         Claire K. Tholl, whose recommendation to preserve more than 200 stone houses led New Jersey and the Federal Government to include many of them on a list of protected historic buildings, died on Monday at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. She was 69 and lived in Upper Saddle River, N.J.         She suffered a lengthy illness, her family said.         Mrs. Tholl was trustee emeritus of the Bergen County Historical Society, a title created for her. She also had been a member of the county's Historic Site Advisory Board since 1969. It was for the board that she conducted a survey of sandstone structures dating as far back as the 1600's.         "The board decided that our stone houses were being threatened with demolition, so funding was acquired and she did the stone house survey in 1979 and 1980," Ruth Van Wagoner, director of the county Office of Cultural and Historic Affairs, said yesterday. "More than 200 were placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places, and about 190 were placed on the National Register."         Among the buildings shielded as a result of the survey by Mrs. Tholl was the 282-year-old Steuben House, a mansion of Bergen County sandstone in Dutch Colonial style in River Edge. The mansion was used as a headquarters by George Washington in 1780 and was given to Gen. Friedrich von Steuben as a reward after the Revolutionary War as a reward for being Washington's drillmaster. It was saved by the state from demolition in 1928 through eminent-domain proceedings.         A native of Hackensack, Claire Koch Tholl studied engineering and naval designing at Stevens Institute of Technology and graduated in architecture from Cooper Union in 1947.         She began her historic research in 1944, after working as a draftsman and in boat design, technical illustration and cartography. She later added architectural photography to her interests.         By 1960 she was studying old houses. She advised the restorers of Steuben House, Old Stone Church in Saddle River and Ringwood Manor in Ringwood, among many others.         She also was knowledgeable about early cooking methods and utensils and the kind of foods favored in the past, and the farms that produced them. For the Bicentennial year 1976 she wrote about the foods of the past in the introduction of an illustrated collection of regional and historic recipes.         Mrs. Tholl is survived by two daughters, Lisanne Fogel of Bellingham, Mass., and Andrea Dente of Vernon, N.J.; two sons, Robert, of Morristown, N.J., and James, of Queensbury, N.Y., and five grandchildren. Her husband, Edward, an architect, died in 1967.       
         Dr. Beatrix T. Gardner, a psychologist who with her husband, Dr. R. Allen Gardner, taught a chimpanzee sign language in the 1960's and the 1970's, died while traveling with her husband in Padua, Italy, on June 5. She was 61 and lived in Reno.         Reached yesterday at the University of Nevada in Reno, where he and his wife had worked as a team, her husband said the cause of death was a central nervous infection. He reported her death this week.         In the 1970's the couple announced that by raising a chimpanzee, Washoe, in the manner of a human child they had taught the ape to communicate using signs similar to those widely used by deaf human beings.         Since then, other researchers have also reported success in training chimpanzees to communicate without depending on speech, as by pushing specific buttons on a keyboard. At the time of the Gardner announcement, Dr. Peter R. Marler of Rockefeller University termed their work "brilliant and exciting."         That such animals actually learned a "language" has, however, been challenged. Among the skeptics is Dr. Herbert S. Terrace, a Columbia University psychologist, who has argued that his chimpanzee experiments have shown that an ape cannot, in any meaningful way, connect "words" into sentences.         Beatrix Tugendhut Gardner was born on July 13, 1933, in Vienna and was living in Poland at the time of the Nazi invasion. The family escaped to Brazil and lived for six years in a suburb of Sao Paulo before moving to the United States.         Dr. Gardner, whose first name was sometimes written Beatrice,earned a bachelor's degree at Radcliffe College and a master's degree at Brown University. She received a doctorate in zoology at Oxford University in England in 1959. She studied the stickleback, a fish whose male builds a nest for his mate. She returned to the United States and taught at Wellesley College, where she met Dr. Gardner, who was studying rats.         They learned of the adverse behavioral effect on rhesus monkeys reared in isolation and ultimately decided to investigate the role of parent-child relationships in the upbringing of chimpanzees. They married in 1961, moved to the University of Nevada in 1963, and in 1966 began trying to teach Washoe, a 10-month-old female ape, to use signals from Ameslan, the American Sign Language.         In 1967, when Washoe was 15 months old, they reported early results to a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New York. They said Washoe had learned signs for hundreds of words.         The Gardners reported that the chimpanzee created expressions like "water birds" for a pair of swans and "open flower" to gain admittance to a flower garden. Washoe even seemed to be teaching sign language to a young companion. The Gardners did similar tests with four more chimpanzees: Moja, Pili, Tatu and Dar.         Skeptics suggested that these claims could be a product of inadvertent coaching or wishful thinking.         Other than her husband, Dr. Gardner had no immediate survivors.         But the chimpanzee project continues. Washoe just celebrated her 30th birthday. She lives in Ellensburg, Wash., at the Chimpanzee and Human Communications Institute, said Deborah Fouts, who with her husband, Roger, is co-director of the institute.       
         Dr. Berta Vogel Scharrer, a pioneering biomedical scientist and founding faculty member of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University, died on Sunday at her home in the Bronx. She was 88.         Harvard University, conferring an honorary doctorate on Dr. Scharrer in 1982, said her "research journeys into the world of insects have profoundly affected the study of human physiology." The particular insect she had studied since 1937 was the South American cockroach.         Dr. Scharrer's specialty was neuroendocrinology, the study of the interaction between the nervous and endocrine systems. At her death, she was distinguished professor emeritus of anatomy and structural biology and of neuroscience at Einstein. She had been affiliated with the college since it was founded in 1955. She reached emeritus status in 1978 but continued her research until a few months ago.         In 1928, Dr. Ernst Scharrer, her future husband, working in Germany, discovered what he called gland-nerve cells in the hypothalamus of a fish's brain. From this, the Scharrers developed the concept of neurosecretion -- secretions from nerve cells -- that gave rise in the 1930's and early 1940's to neuroendocrinology as a new discipline.         Berta Vogel was born in Munich, Germany, and received a doctorate in biology from the University of Munich in 1930. She married Dr. Scharrer in 1934, and they remained a team at Einstein until his accidental drowning in 1965. Though not Jewish, the Scharrers left Germany in 1937 because of Hitler's policies.         Early in their collaboration, they decided on a comparative approach, dividing the animal kingdom so that he would study vertebrates and she invertebrates. They determined that certain principles found in an insect could explain certain things about mammalian systems, and vice versa.         Their discovery of neurosecretions took years to find acceptance, as their peers resisted the notion that neurons could dispatch neurohormonal, blood-borne signals, an activity previously associated only with the hormonal endocrine cells.         Once neuroendocrinology became established, Dr. Scharrer received many honorary degrees and other honors in the United States and in Europe. She was given the National Medal of Science at a White House ceremony in 1985.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Karl Vogel of Neustadt, Germany, and a sister, Lotte Vogel of Munich.       
         Alice V. Keliher, whose experiences as a lightly trained teacher of ill-prepared first graders led her to become a renowned expert on early childhood education and a champion of giving children unreserved respect and affection, died on Tuesday at the Tucson Medical Center in Arizona. She was 92.         A longtime professor of education at New York University, Miss Keliher cherished her unofficial title as the "grandmother of day care."         In the 1930's, she conducted seminal research on childhood development with Arnold Gesell at Yale University. In the 1940's and 1950's, as a member of N.Y.U.'s faculty, she served on virtually every city, state and national conference devoted to children and wrote widely on the subject.         And in the 1960's, while winding down her wide-ranging academic career as a professor at Wheelock College in Boston, she became the Massachusetts regional training officer for Head Start, the Federal program designed to provide disadvantaged children with the preschool enrichment Miss Keliher had been preaching to parents and educators for decades.         Although she trained teachers at N.Y.U. from 1936 to 1960, World War II provided her with her major platform.         As director of child and youth services of the New York Office of Civilian Defense, and secretary of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia's Committee on the Wartime Care of Children, Miss Keliher helped make day care an accepted staple of American life.         Her campaign for day care may have made her a legitimate feminist heroine, but Miss Keliher, who also helped lessen the burden on mothers by spearheading the development of kindergarten and nursery school, made it clear that her focus was not women, but their children.         Instead of talking about what "working mothers need," she said in 1949, the emphasis should be on "what makes a good next generation for America."         A native of Washington who received her teacher's certificate after two years of training, Miss Keliher was only 20 when she became a teacher in 1923. After four years in the Washington school system, she decided she could serve children better by teaching their teachers how to teach.         Obtaining bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in three years at Teachers College at Columbia University, she joined Dr. Gesell in 1930. She secured the job with the renowned child psychologist, she later confided, because she was the only applicant who knew how to operate a movie camera, a skill needed in research based on close observation of minute changes in infant behavior.         For all her dedication to her work, Miss Keliher's abiding passion was opera, and for decades she was a fixture in the center of the first row of the first balcony at the Metropolitan Opera (at just over 5 feet tall, she needed an unobstructed view), where her frequent guest was Eleanor Roosevelt.         The two women, who became friends when Mrs. Roosevelt took an apartment in Miss Keliher's building near Washington Square Park, enjoyed trading favors: Mrs. Roosevelt let Miss Keliher take her N.Y.U. students on field trips to the Roosevelt estate at Hyde Park. Miss Keliher, who had the larger oven, let Mrs. Roosevelt roast her turkeys in her kitchen.         Miss Keliher also shared Mrs. Roosevelt's devotion to human rights.         In a little-known chapter of her life, her lawyer, J. Dan O'Neill, said yesterday, Miss Keliher helped several Jewish families escape from Germany and Austria in the late 1930's. Her lawyer said the enterprise was organized by the love of her life, a shadowy American intelligence agent whose death in World War II led Miss Keliher to vow to remain unmarried.         Miss Keliher later created a furor when she refused to attend an education conference at a club known to exclude Jews. And she was such an outspoken champion of women, including their need for birth-control devices, Mr. O'Neill said, that she became a virtual pariah to her own Roman Catholic Church.         For all her books, like "Life and Growth" and "A Critical Study of Homogenous Grouping," Miss Keliher stressed a single theme, one she summed up in 1955: "If I could say just one thing to parents, it would be simply that a child needs someone who believes in him no matter what he does."         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Gloria Wills Landes, a former Broadway showgirl who capped a brief, effervescent career by founding and directing an acclaimed school for aspiring teen-age actors and playwrights, died on Friday at her home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 69.         Mrs. Landes was the director of the SUNY Youth Theater in Purchase, N.Y., until she became ill last year. She had breast cancer, her family said.         If Gloria Wills's days on Broadway had been a Busby Berkeley musical, she would have been the star's funny and bubbly best friend, the one who has her moments in the spotlight but gives up a promising career to marry a rich businessman.         Mrs. Landes's career lasted only three years, but by the time she left a Broadway-bound show in Philadelphia in 1948 to marry Jack Landes, a wealthy silver importer, she had something to tell her grandchildren.  Like hundreds of other stage-struck singers, dancers and actors who have passed through Broadway's revolving door over the years, she had a scrapbook proving that she had been a part of a great tradition.         She may have spent more time auditioning than performing, but she was a Brooklyn girl who could belt out a song, and her persistent auditions at least made an impression on Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. Rodgers once said she had auditioned for every part in "Oklahoma!" except the villain, Jud Fry.  If she missed a week trying out for the part of Ado Annie, the "girl who can't say no," Hammerstein would ask if she had been sick.         She may not have been a star, but the critic Walter Kerr once called her "one of the funniest things on Broadway," and she had her share of brushes with destiny and Broadway cliches.         In 1945, for example, she was in the chorus of "Carousel" when she discovered new meaning in the old theater good-luck wish of "break a leg." A featured singer got sick, and her understudy, rushing in to replace her, fell down the dressing room steps and actually broke a leg. Mrs. Landes, then all of 19 years old, spent the next six weeks singing "You'll Never Walk Alone."         Then there was the birthday party for "Oklahoma!" She did a comic version of Agnes de Mille's famous second-act ballet that left Miss de Mille in stitches and persuaded Rodgers and Hammerstein to cast her as Beulah, the campus vamp, in the musical "Allegro" in 1947.         That led to a part in the revue "Make Mine Manhattan," with Sid Caesar, but Mrs. Landes, who had doubts about the part and her future in the theater, left the show in Philadelphia to accept what she decided was a better offer: to marry Mr. Landes and live happily ever after.         That is more or less what she did. Several months after she was married, Cole Porter asked her to be Bianca in "Kiss Me Kate," but she was pregnant by then with the first of her four sons.         Unlike many other short-term performers who end up in the suburbs, Mrs. Landes found a second act. After performing in summer stock, she established a school for teen-age performers that was absorbed by the State University of New York at Purchase, where she taught a generation of young actors and playwrights, including Matt Dillon.         Mrs. Landes's husband died in 1989. She is survived by her sons, Mark of Potomac, Md., Dan of Brooklyn, Robert of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Peter of San Rafael, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and a brother, Herbery Wolfson of Wilmington, Del.       
         Annie Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, the younger of the two sisters whose wisdom and triumphs have been celebrated in a best-selling book and in the Broadway play "Having Our Say," died yesterday at her home in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. She was 104.         "She just took a couple of deep breaths and passed away," said Amy Hill Hearth, co-author of "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 years," the 1993 best-selling oral history. "And it's an important thing she died at home, in her bed, with her sister there. That's all she wanted."         Her 106-year-old sister, Sarah, known as Sadie, with whom she had lived for more than 100 years, seemed to handle her sister's death with the same strength that had carried her through a century.         "I'll just do the best I can," Sarah Delany told Ms. Hearth in an interview at her home. "I'll continue right on as if Bessie were here."         She added that for her sister, whose life was filled with many achievements, the last few years had been particularly special. "Bessie lived to be 104, and she lived her life the way she wanted to," she said. "And especially the last couple of years, she has been having a ball. Between the play and books, she has been having the time of her life. And she said you really couldn't ask for anything more."         The two sisters had lived so long and seen so much that to some it seemed they might live forever. Born a generation after the Civil War, they had triumphed over Jim Crow, worked in Harlem during its renaissance, borne witness to the feminist and civil rights movements and in recent years, become national celebrities.         Their award-winning memoir has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 19 months, sold more than 900,000 copies and been translated into four foreign languages. They were co-authors of a second book, "The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom" (Kodansha America, 1994) which has sold 160,000 copies. And in April their Mt. Vernon parlor was re-created on Broadway, in a dramatization that earned three Tony nominations.         Bessie Delany often marveled that the nation would be interested in what two elderly black women had to say. She wanted her life seen not so much as a story of blacks or of women, but of America.         The sisters' lives remained simple despite their celebrity. They rose early to eat a breakfast of oatmeal, went to bed after watching the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour on a black-and-white television and had no telephone. They relied mostly on each other for comfort and company. In more than a century, they lived apart for only a few months. And Sarah Delany said many times that it was for her baby sister that she had lived so long.         Annie Elizabeth Delany was born on Sept. 3, 1891, in Raleigh, N.C., the third child of a former slave who became the country's first black Episcopal bishop. Raised on the campus of St. Augustine's College, she and her siblings were well-educated, nurtured and sheltered from the harsher edges of American racism.         But she and her sister often spoke of the first time they were told to go to the back of the trolley car. And they remembered how the staff at the drugstore refused to serve them. Still, Bessie Delany was undaunted. Known as the feistier of the sisters, she was once almost lynched for speaking rudely to a "rebby boy." And she often told tales of how as a child she would sneak a sip from the forbidden side of the water fountain. 'I'd just take a drink of the white water," she said. "It didn't taste any different."         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1911 and worked as a teacher in North Carolina and Georgia to earn the money she needed to continue her education. The few months in 1912 that she and Sadie taught in different parts of the South was the only time they did not live together.         In 1917, the two sisters made their way to New York City. Bessie had planned to become a doctor but ultimately decided to go to dental school. She graduated from Columbia University in 1923 and became the second black woman to work as a dentist in New York.         Known as "Dr. Bessie, Harlem's colored woman dentist," Dr. Delany socialized with Cab Calloway, W. E. B. Du Bois and the doyennes of the Harlem Renaissance. But she treated many of Harlem's poor, and in 27 years of practice never raised her rates. It was $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling, from 1923 until the day she retired, in 1950.         Like her sister Sarah, the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school, she never married or had children. They referred to themselves as "Negro maiden ladies" and lived together in a Harlem apartment, in a Bronx cottage and finally in the Mt. Vernon home they bought in 1957.         With the death of their youngest sister, Laura, in 1993, they were the last survivors among their parents' children. When asked in a 1993 interview if she could account for her and her sister's longevity, Dr. Delany replied, "Honey, we never married; we never had husbands to worry us to death." As for mortality, she said, "I haven't been afraid to live, and I won't be afraid to die."         Recently Dr. Delany had become more frail, Ms. Hearth said. And in the time the two women knew each other, she often spoke about death, though with characteristic sass and humor. "She was worried she was too mean to get into heaven," Ms. Hearth remembered, laughing.         A funeral service is to be held on Thursday at 10:30 A.M. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. And before the curtain rises on "Having Our Say" tonight, there will be a brief tribute at the Booth Theater.         In addition to her sister, Dr. Delany is survived by 14 nieces and nephews.       
         Before she made her Metropolitan Opera debut last Saturday in the title role  of Bizet's "Carmen," Denyce Graves kept telling herself that the Met was simply  another opera house. After all, she had already sung the role at the Vienna State Opera, at the Bastille Opera in Paris and at Covent Garden, 21 productions in the last two years alone.         "I tried to think of this as just another engagement," she said recently, "but nobody would let me do that."         She was referring not only to managers and the news media, but also to her family, friends and former teachers from the tough southwest Washington neighborhood where she grew up, a gritty area near a sewage treatment center and an automobile impoundment lot. More than 50 of her relatives and former neighbors traveled to New York by chartered bus for her Met debut; some 50 more  came by train and car.         For years, most people at home saw Ms. Graves as "some sort of space alien,"  she said, what with her exotic notions of becoming an opera singer. But "a Met debut was something they understood," she said, and the tumultuous standing ovation she got on Saturday night "really clinched it for them." She sings the role again this afternoon and on Wednesday and next Saturday.         Ms. Graves knows that her personal story is the kind of inspirational saga Americans love: a television crew from "60 Minutes" covered her Met debut. "This was not just a move for myself, but for my people, my family," the 30-year-old mezzo-soprano said. "I realize now that what I say affects my family, so I've become more protective of their feelings, my mother's in particular. It's not just my story; it's hers."         Ms. Graves was the second of three children. Her father, an alcoholic, abusive man, left the family when her mother was pregnant with their third child. The children did not see him for again for 18 years, when he turned up, unannounced, at the high school graduation of Ms. Graves's younger sister. By then he had become a minister. They have not heard from him since.         Left alone with three children to raise, Ms. Graves's mother found work as a  clerk-typist at the University of the District of Columbia. (Today, Mrs. Dorothy Graves Kenner, her name from a second marriage, is registrar.) She was out of the house before the children were up, and gone most of the day. "When she got home, we had to have dinner ready," Ms. Graves said. "We did the cooking, dishwashing and cleaning in rotating one-week shifts."         Yet her mother provided a rich, if regimented, family life. Participation in  their fundamentalist Baptist church was mandatory. Ms. Graves sang in the choir  and helped out at Sunday school. At home, her mother dedicated each night of the week to some educational project: one night the children would present oral book reports or speak on assigned topics (like birds, flowers or geography). Thursday was music night, when the family performed gospel as an impromptu vocal group at churches and meeting halls. Popular music of any kind was banned in the house, though Ms. Graves listened to some illicit Michael Jackson on the radio when she was alone. "My mother worked so hard," Ms. Graves said. "She didn't want her babies to be lost to the streets, like so many."         At school, Ms. Graves's singing was encouraged by a strong-willed music teacher, Judith Grove. "I adored her," Ms. Graves said. "I thought she hung the  moon." Ms. Grove directed her to the Duke Ellington School for the Performing Arts, a public high school in Washington. She was accepted immediately. There, she received private voice lessons and attended her first opera: a dress rehearsal for Beethoven's "Fidelio," on a school expedition to the Kennedy Center.         After high school, Ms. Graves made great progress under Helen Hodam, a renowned voice teacher, first at Oberlin Conservatory, and then at the New England Conservatory. In Boston, she took side jobs to support herself: cleaning dormitories, working as an all-night hotel desk clerk. When she decided to enter the Metropolitan Opera Regional Auditions, she had all the makings of a finalist: a lustrous mezzo-soprano voice and a striking stage presence. But her  performance was charged with a special determination. "I had to win," she said.  "I was four months behind in my rent. I couldn't pay for the rented dress I was wearing." Ms. Graves won.         The pressure took its toll. After the competition, her voice failed her. The  problem later turned out to be a treatable thyroid condition. But her performance at the finals in New York City was "a disaster," Ms. Graves said. Demoralized, she quit singing and took a secretarial job.         Yet the word of her promise had spread. The Houston Grand Opera called to invite her to participate in its program for young artists. She declined. When they called twice more, her friends prevailed on her to accept. ("It was a sign, like something meant to be," she said.)         Since then, her success has come steadily. One of her big supporters is Placido Domingo, who sang Don Jose to her Carmen at Covent Garden. They first met in Houston when Ms. Graves sang Emilia in a production of Verdi's "Otello."  "What impressed me immediately about her, aside from her obvious vocal and physical beauty, was an aura of the dramatic about her," Mr. Domingo said recently.         "As Carmen," he continued, "she is so good that the world might want her exclusively for this role. That would be a shame, because she has very much to offer in other parts." In his capacity as future artistic director of the Washington Opera, Mr. Domingo has invited her to sing two other leading roles, which have not yet been announced.         In developing her approach to this signature role, Ms. Graves avoided listening to recordings of celebrated Carmens from the past. Moreover, she counts herself lucky to have done her first Carmen in a modern-dress production  at the Minnesota Opera.         "I didn't want to do a traditional Carmen," she said. "Carmen is an unapologetic modern woman, a woman of the 90's. She speaks constantly about her  freedom, but she is no whore. Her spirit is free. She is attracted to Don Jose precisely because he isn't interested. When she realizes she truly loves him, she becomes afraid and treats him badly. Love means losing your freedom. I think she is essentially a very sad person."         Vocally, she finds the role gratifying, but frustrating. Unlike the other characters, Carmen has no defining "stand-and-deliver aria," as Ms. Graves put it, which makes portraying her true character a challenge. "Carmen sings songs,  but these are set pieces involving other people," she said. Carmen's most famous song, the "Habanera," is a "dramatic miscalculation," according to Ms. Graves, wrongly inserted by Bizet into the score after the premiere at the insistence of the first Carmen, Celestine Galli-Marie. "It's an awkward introduction to Carmen," Ms. Graves said. "In the original version, she enters, sings her few insinuating lines, then leaves, like a black cat crossing the stage. That's much more in character."         Her recent performances include Adalgisa in "Norma" at Zurich, Giulietta in "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" at La Scala, and Dalila in a concert performance of "Samson et Dalila" with the Chicago Symphony under James Levine. She is looking  forward to performing Marguerite in Berlioz's "Damnation of Faust" in Houston and Bonn ("I adore that music"), and hopes someday to sing Blanche in one of her favorites, Poulenc's "Dialogues of the Carmelites."         The sudden attention has left Ms. Graves excited but unaffected. Greeting a visitor in her hotel suite, she curled up on the couch in an oversize sweatshirt and casually stirred gobs of honey into her tea with a dinner knife when no teaspoon was handy. As she relaxed next to her husband, David Perry, an importer of fine classical guitars, she seemed content with the way her life has turned out.         "Perhaps this should be the last interview about the past," Mr. Perry suggested. "From now on, the future will be the story." Ms. Graves nodded quietly.       
         Maxene Andrews, "the one on the left" in the trio of sisters whose string of hit songs in the 1940's made them the dominant radio voice of the home front and an inspiration to American servicemen, died on Saturday at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack, said her longtime manager, Lynda Wells.  Miss Andrews had recently completed a four-week engagement playing herself in the revue "Swingtime Canteen" at the Blue Angel in New York. Ms. Wells said that Miss Andrews had agreed to return to the show in December.         Miss Andrews was a teen-ager when she, her older sister, LaVerne, who died in 1967, and her younger sister, Patty, formed the trio whose close-voiced, enthusiastic style became the vocal parallel of the big bands of the swing era. They became stars almost overnight in 1937, singing English lyrics to the Yiddish song "Bei Mir Bist du Schon."         That success started the sisters on a long series of novelty hits that included "Ti-Pi-Tin," "Hold Tight," "The Jumping Jive," "Beer Barrel Polka," "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy" and "Apple Blossom Time."         "The Beer Barrel Polka" was followed by "The Pennsylvania Polka" and "Strip Polka," while "Rhumboogie" started them on a series of boogie-woogie hits that included "Beat Me, Daddy, Eight to the Bar" and "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy."         Their big hits during World War II were "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree" and "Rum and Coca-Cola."         To a nation at war, the Andrews Sisters became a cherished American institution. They could be heard on the radio, on jukeboxes and on movie soundtracks. They made numerous appearances at war bond rallies and they entertained troops, who seemed to regard them as the epitome of American innocence.         The innocence may have been even more authentic than it seemed. Miss Andrews said it was not until years later that she learned that the sly references to "working for the Yankee dollar" in "Rum and Coca-Cola" were suggestive of prostitution in Trinidad.         One of their few ballad hits was the song "I'll Be With You in Apple Blossom Time," which was recorded in 1940 and became Miss Andrews's personal favorite.         The sisters' singing style came naturally to them. "We couldn't read music," Maxene once explained. "But when we heard a song, we heard it in harmony."         Maxene, known as Mackie to her family and friends, was born on Jan. 3, 1916. She organized the trio in 1932, when she was 16. LaVerne was 21 and had been studying piano, while Patty, 14, was the tap-dance champion of Minneapolis, where the sisters were born. From the start, LaVerne was the low voice, Maxene the high voice and Patty the one in between.         From the late 1930's until the early 1940's, the Andrews Sisters sold more than 50 million records, appeared as themselves in 22 films and frequently teamed with Bing Crosby and Glenn Miller on their radio shows.         Although the public always saw the three sisters together, singing in close harmony, their private lives were studded with fallings-out. The group broke up in the early 1950's when Patty decided to become a solo performer. Maxene made her own debut as a solo act at that time at the Blue Angel but canceled after a few nights because she was still thinking in harmony terms. The sisters came together again very soon, however, and remained together until LaVerne's death.         In 1970 Maxene accepted the position of dean of women at Tahoe Paradise College in Lake Tahoe, Calif.         "I laughed when I was offered the position," she said. "All my life I'd been in show business. My schooling was the school of experience. But I had great rapport with young students."         In 1974 Maxene and Patty made their Broadway debuts in "Over Here." The show ran for more than a year, but after it closed, the two never sang together again.         Although they made a joint publicity appearance in 1987 when an Andrews Sisters star was added to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the two remained estranged, Ms. Wells said yesterday.         In recent years Miss Andrews had pursued an almost full-time career, lecturing, performing in concerts and at nightclubs and, more recently, in musicals. Earlier this year she appeared in "Follies," in Houston and Seattle.         Miss Andrews's marriage to Lou Levy, who managed the sister act, ended in divorce in 1951.         In addition to her sister, of Encino, Calif., Miss Andrews is survived by a daughter, Aleda Hunt, and a son, Peter Levy, both of Salt Lake City; by Ms. Wells, whom she adopted and who lived with her in Auburn, Calif.; Steve Sharpe of Los Angeles, whom she considered a foster son, and one grandchild.         Correction:  October 25, 1995, Wednesday         Subheadings for obituaries on Monday about the singer Maxene Andrews and the writer Kingsley Amis were reversed in some copies. The reference to "a onetime radical" applied to the obituary of Mr. Amis; the one to a "last role" in "a Manhattan revue" was for Miss Andrews's.       
         Marilyn J. Morheuser, the lawyer at the center of a 13-year court struggle to make New Jersey's school-financing system more equitable for the state's poorest districts, died on Sunday at her home in Newark. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, according to the Education Law Center, a Newark-based public-interest organization of which she had been executive director since 1979.         Ms. Morheuser was the agency's lead counsel for the plaintiffs in Abbott v.  Burke, a class-action suit brought in 1981 to challenge the state's Quality Education Act of 1980. Arguing on behalf of pupils of the poorest urban schools, the suit asserted that the state had inadequately responded to a State Supreme Court ruling on school financing in 1973. That ruling said that New Jersey's method of school financing violated the State Constitution by failing to guarantee parity between the poorest and the most affluent districts.         The court -- the state's highest -- agreed with the center, ruling in 1990 that the law was still unconstitutional because it did not meet the educational  needs of disadvantaged city children. It ordered that those needs be met.         The law center returned to court the next year, this time to obtain a compliance order, which the Supreme Court in Trenton handed down in 1994. In it, the judges decided that the state must increase the financing of the 30 poorest  districts to a level where their per-pupil outlays would equal the average of the wealthiest districts by fiscal year 1996-97.         The judges demanded that schools in hard-pressed cities like Newark, Camden and Paterson be provided preschool programs, health services and smaller class sizes. The state has the responsibility to provide them rather then leave it up  to the impoverished districts, they wrote.         Ms. Morheuser did not start her professional life at the bar; a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Webster College, she first was a nun. She spent 16 years teaching high school and college around the country, wherever her teaching Roman Catholic order, the Sisters of Loretto, sent her.         Being of a rather radical bent on social issues, she decided that she could achieve more on the outside. She quit the order in 1963 and became an advocate for racial equality in Milwaukee.         In 1973, she received her J.D. at the Rutgers-Newark School of Law. Before she joined the Newark law center she represented such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, the Urban League and the National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Her work attracted many honors, including a Special Achievement Award from the New Jersey Education Association in 1993, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Award from the National Education Association last year. Last May, she was cited as Woman of the Year in Education by the New Jersey League of Women Voters.         Ms. Morheuser is survived by a sister, Marie Casey of St. Louis.       
         Rosalind Cash, an original member of the Negro Ensemble Company and one of its most vibrant and versatile actresses, died on Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 56.         The cause was cancer, said her agent, John Sekura.         Although she was best known for her acting in naturalistic dramas like Lonne Elder 3d's "Ceremonies in Dark Old Men," Ms. Cash was equally at home in musicals and in classics, portraying Goneril to James Earl Jones's King Lear for the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1973.         Before joining the Negro Ensemble Company in 1968, Ms. Cash had a widely diverse career, singing in nightclubs and performing Off Broadway (in "Junebug Graduates Tonight!" at the Chelsea Theater Center) and on Broadway (in "The Wayward Stork"). Cast in "The Great White Hope" at the Arena Stage in Washington, she decided to forgo that play, and paid the Arena the equivalent of two weeks' salary so she could return to New York to join the new black theater  company.         In the first season of the Negro Ensemble Company, she was featured in "The Song of the Lusitanian Bogey" by Peter Weiss, Wole Soyinka's "Kongi's Harvest" and Richard Wright's "Sweet Daddy Goodness." In "Ceremonies in Dark Old Men" the next year, Douglas Turner Ward played a barber facing economic hardship. Ms. Cash was his strong-minded daughter, the family's principal wage-earner. The role remained a hallmark of her career, and in 1975 she repeated it in the ABC television version.         After her initial success, she moved back and forth between theater and films. In 1980 she returned to the Negro Ensemble Company to appear in "The 16th Round" by Samm-Art Williams.         In Hollywood, she repeatedly battled stereotype. Calling herself "a one-lady  movement," she was not afraid to speak her mind, realizing that as an actress, "if you yell loud enough, someone will listen." Her movies included "Klute," "The Omega Man," "Hickey and Boggs," "The New Centurions," "Uptown Saturday Night" and "Wrong Is Right" (in which she played the first black woman to become Vice President of the United States). In 1995, she was in "Tales From the 'Hood."         On television she appeared in Melvin van Peebles's "Sophisticated Gents," Maya Angelou's "Sister, Sister," "A Killing Affair" and the American Playhouse adaptation of James Baldwin's "Go Tell It on the Mountain." She was Mary Mae Ward on the soap opera "General Hospital."         Ms. Cash was born in Atlantic City and attended City College of New York.         She is survived by a sister, Helen Cash Jackson, and two brothers, Jack and Robert.       
         Butterfly McQueen, the actress best remembered for her portrayal of Prissy in "Gone With the Wind," the vexing slave girl who confounded Scarlett O'Hara with  the tearful pronouncement, "I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies, Miss Scarlett," died yesterday. She was 84 years old.         Earlier in the day, Ms. McQueen was critically burned when a kerosene heater  in her one-bedroom cottage just outside Augusta, Ga., caught fire. She suffered  burns over 70 percent of her body and died at Augusta Regional Medical Center.         After appearing in the Civil War epic "Gone With the Wind" in 1939, Ms. McQueen's voice, squeaky and high-pitched, became her most remarked-upon characteristic, prompting one critic to describe it as a "clarinet with a cold"  and another to comment that it was an "itsy-little voice fading over the far horizon of comprehension."         Although Ms. McQueen's role as Prissy earned her fame, it also brought her criticism in later years from people who considered the role stereotypical and demeaning.         "You know, today they call me an Uncle Thomasina," she said in 1970.         But Ms. McQueen, who devoted her later years to serving the African-American  community, said she also felt it necessary to acknowledge the history of black slavery in the United States.         "As I look back on "Gone with the Wind," for instance, I feel it is useful to have this authenticity," she once said. "We've got to know more about where we've come from. I wasn't too happy about the whole thing, but also later in life, as I looked around, I decided to take what I could get and then use it for what I want to do."         Born Thelma McQueen in Tampa, Fla., daughter of a housekeeper and a stevedore, Ms. McQueen first developed a fondness for acting as a child, when she would recite whole books of the Bible at home.         "All I knew as a child was church, church, church," she said.         When her parents separated, Ms. McQueen moved with her mother to Augusta, Ga., and then to New York City. As a teen-ager, she attended high school in Babylon, L.I., and later moved to Harlem.         After a brief stint in nursing school, Ms. McQueen pursued her acting career  in earnest, finding that the stage was much more exciting than a hospital. Her first break came in 1937 when George Abbott offered her a role in "Brown Sugar." The show was a flop, but Ms. McQueen signed on as a permanent member of the Abbott Acting Company.         It was during her years with the acting company that a friend dubbed her "Butterfly," after Ms. McQueen told her she had once danced a butterfly ballet in a performance of "A Midsummer Night's Dream."         Soon after, Mr. Abbott tailored a role for her in "What a Life," which she played on Broadway. One evening, during an intermission in Philadelphia, she received a contract from her agency for Prissy, a role she was initially rejected for after a talent scout called her too chubby. She received the good news with some reservation.         "I'd just come from a modern up-to-date integrated school in 'What a Life' and I couldn't understand why they'd want to bring back the 1800s," Ms. McQueen  said. "Most of my friends were progressive, going forward and looking forward. It was depressing for me."         Despite the success of "Gone With The Wind," Ms. McQueen found it increasingly difficult to find work in film and theater. She appeared in the films "Mildred Pierce" and "The Women," and on several radio shows. In 1951, she put on a one-woman show at Carnegie Hall, but she soon found she had to take on  other jobs to support herself. During the 1950's, she worked as a companion for  a woman in Long Island and sold toys at Macy's. At one time, she began her own radio show in Augusta, "to instill pride in the neighborhood," she said.         In 1966, still unable to find work as an actress, Ms. McQueen wrote a letter  to a Georgia congressman asking him for help in getting a job.         But it was upon her return to Harlem one year later that she found a second vocation -- helping her community. She plunged into antipoverty work and took a  job as a waitress in a soul food restaurant.         Fond of children, she worked at the Mount Morris Park Recreation Center as a  receptionist. Her distinctive voice could be heard through the corridors as she  gave tap dance and ballet lessons. She defined herself at the time through her commitment to the "black family," she said.         Ever restless and determined, Ms. McQueen, who had never completed college, graduated with a degree in political science from City College in 1975 at the age of 64.       
         Vera Maxwell, one of a legendary group of American sportswear designers who came to prominence in the 1940's, died on Sunday in Rincon, P.R., at the home of her grandson, Douglas Maxwell.         She was 93 and died after a brief illness, said her daughter-in-law, Rhea Maxwell.         One of the pioneers of women's sportswear along with Claire McCardell, Clare Potter, Carolyn Schnurer and Tina Leser, Vera Maxwell continued to design clothes that were casual, comfortable and classic until her retirement in 1985.         Among her innovations was the "weekend wardrobe" of 1935 that consisted of two jackets, two skirts and a pair of trousers; the wraparound jersey blouse; the riding jacket suit and the fencing suit. In the 1940's she designed a cotton coverall uniform for war workers at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation that was a forerunner of the jump suit. She was also the first American designer to make clothes of Ultrasuede.         She won the Coty American Fashion Critics' Award in 1953 and was honored in 1970 with a retrospective exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. In 1980 there was another retrospective, this time at the Museum of the City of New York, which opened with a party attended by Princess Grace of Monaco and her daughter Princess Caroline. Mrs. Maxwell had met the former Grace Kelly in Dallas in 1955 when they were both there to receive Neiman Marcus Awards, and she frequently visited her and Prince Rainier in Monaco.         Born Vera Huppe in New York City on April 22, 1901, of Viennese parents, she traveled to Europe with them as a child and lived for a while in Vienna. She attended high school in Leonia, N.J., and studied ballet in New York, becoming a member of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1919. She danced with the company until her marriage in 1924 to Raymond J. Maxwell, who worked on Wall Street. They were divorced in 1937. She married Carlisle H. Johnson, an architect, in 1938 and divorced him in 1945.         While married to Mr. Maxwell, she had started to model on Seventh Avenue and developed an interest in making clothes. She studied tailoring in London and worked as a designer for several American sportswear houses including Adler and Adler, Glenhunt and Max Milstein. (In 1970, Mrs. Maxwell formed a business partnership with Mr. Milstein's nephew Morton Milstein.)         Mrs. Maxwell became known as a designer in the 1930's when American fashion was struggling to be born and most designers toiled anonymously. She achieved fame with such designs as a weekend wardrobe of a collarless jacket with four patch pockets that she made in tweed and in gray flannel to be mixed and matched with a short pleated flannel tennis skirt, a longer tweed skirt with pressed-down pleats and a pair of flannel cuffed trousers -- all designs so classic they could still be worn today.         Following the precepts of her idol, Coco Chanel, Mrs. Maxwell devoted herself to making timeless clothes that women could move around in. In 1975, she showed what she called a "speed suit," which was actually a pull-on dress with a stretch top and no zippers, buttons, snaps or ties. A woman could slip it on in seconds.         After years of designing for other manufacturers, Mrs. Maxwell founded her own company, Vera Maxwell Originals, in 1947. Her heyday was in the 1950's when her easy-to-wear styles attracted customers like Pat Nixon, Martha Graham and Lillian Gish. By 1960 her clothes were being sold in 700 stores around the country. In the 60's, her star waned as fashion's attention shifted to swinging London designers like Mary Quant and Zandra Rhodes.         In 1964, Mrs. Maxwell showed a collection of American Indian-inspired clothing that failed to find an audience. "It bombed," she said in an interview that appeared in The New York Times in 1970. "So I decided to lie fallow for a while."         She resurfaced in 1970 with a collection that was introduced at a tea in B. Altman's. Until her retirement, she continued to turn out the tasteful classic suits, coats and dresses that her loyal customers would wear for years.         She made a brief comeback as a consultant to a knitwear company but spent most of her time working on her memoirs. They have never been published, her daughter-in-law said, partly because "people wanted gossip about Grace Kelly, but she wouldn't write that."         She sold her Manhattan apartment three years ago and retired to Gilgo Beach, L.I., with her son, Dr. R. John Maxwell, and daughter-in-law and spent winters in Rincon with them and her grandson. She is also survived by her granddaughter, Sarah Maxwell of Santa Fe, N.M., and a great-granddaughter, Isabel Maxwell.       
         Margaret Wade, who coached Delta State to three national championships in six seasons in the 1970's and in 1986 became the first woman named to the Basketball Hall of Fame, died yesterday at the Bolivar County Hospital in Cleveland, Miss. She was 82.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         A native of Cleveland, Miss Wade was a star on the Delta State team there in the late 1920's before barnstorming with a semipro team known as the Tupelo Red Wings.         Long before her college triumphs, Miss Wade had earned a reputation as a formidable coach on the high school level. In 21 years at Cleveland High School, she led the team to a 453-89-6 record. It was achieved, one of her former players said yesterday, by a combination of inspiring her players' devotion and working them to distraction.         "She all but killed us doing calisthenics," said Sue King.         After her high school career, Miss Wade joined Delta State, initially as a physical education instructor. The school had dropped women's basketball in 1932 as unsuitably rough for proper young ladies, but when college officials decided to revive it in 1973, Miss Wade was the obvious choice to coach.         Over the next six seasons her teams compiled a 157-23 record, won three national championships and set a record of 51 consecutive victories, from 1974 to 1976.         During her final season, 1978-79, the annual Wade Trophy was established to honor the outstanding college player.         She is survived by a brother, Broughton Wade.       
         Mary Bingham, the matriarch of the Bingham newspaper empire, died suddenly in Louisville, Ky., on Tuesday evening. She was 90 and lived in Glenview, 15 minutes outside Louisville, on the family estate.         Mrs. Bingham, a philanthropist and civic leader and the widow of Barry Bingham Sr., was delivering a speech at a dinner in her honor when she collapsed. She was pronounced dead of cardiac arrest at Norton Hospital.         At the dinner at the Hyatt Regency hotel to raise money for the de Paul School in Louisville, Mrs. Bingham had been toasted by Gov. Brereton Jones; Jon Jory, artistic director of the Actors Theater of Louisville; other Kentucky dignitaries, and her daughter Eleanor Bingham Miller.         Before delivering her prepared speech, Mrs. Bingham said she was so flattered by the event that "the best thing would be for a big pink cloud to come down and take me away." She then spoke about the need for civic responsibility and asked for support of the Louisville Free Public Library.         In the part of her talk that remained undelivered, she quoted Pericles as saying that an Athenian "who did not acquaint himself with and took no part in public affairs was regarded not as unambitious, but as a man of no consequence whatever."         All her life, she was a most enthusiastic participant in public and cultural affairs. Governor Jones said that with Mrs. Bingham's death, "Kentucky has lost one of its most caring and productive citizens."         A distinguished, articulate woman, Mrs. Bingham was for more than 60 years a major presence on the Louisville scene. Mr. and Mrs. Bingham, always known as "the Binghams," were great hosts, especially at Kentucky Derby time, when their invitations were among the most coveted.         Together with Mr. Bingham, who died in 1988, Mrs. Bingham was a generous supporter of the arts and of educational and social programs. She was a strong environmentalist and also led a drive to send book mobiles to rural Kentucky.         After her husband died, she took over as the head of the family foundation, the Mary and Barry Bingham Sr. Fund, which gave $59 million to a wide variety of institutions. Last fall, the Actors Theater of Louisville opened the Bingham Theater. The beneficence of the Binghams is one reason Louisville is such a prosperous cultural community.         In 1986, a bitter family conflict engulfed the Binghams, leading to the sale of their media empire, the cornerstone of which was The Louisville Courier-Journal, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper known for its liberal politics and socially conscious positions. Barry Bingham Sr. had been publisher of the newspaper after his father, Robert Bingham, and, in turn, he had been succeeded by his son Barry Bingham Jr.         After Barry Bingham Jr. and his sisters, Eleanor and Sallie Bingham, were locked in a feud over control of the company, Barry Bingham Sr. decided to sell. The battle and the sale of the paper to the Gannett chain became front-page news throughout the country. Later, several books were written about the conflict and the family itself, including a memoir by Sallie that was critical of her parents.         Behind the scenes, Mrs. Bingham had been a force at the newspaper. She was a vice president and director and wrote editorials while her husband was overseas during World War II. For 26 years, until 1968, she was the editor of the book review section.         Mrs. Bingham was born Mary Caperton on Dec. 24, 1904, in Richmond, and as a young woman, she acted with Richmond's Little Theater. It was while she was a classics major at Radcliffe College that she met her husband, then a student at Harvard University. They were both involved in collegiate dramatics.         After graduating from Radcliffe in 1928, she spent a year studying in Greece on a fellowship. In 1931, she and Barry Bingham were married. They had five children, including two sons, Worth and Jonathan, who died in accidents.         The Binghams were active in Democratic politics and would, as Mrs. Bingham said, "get together with liberal friends on election night to listen to the results in sympathetic company."         When her son became publisher of the paper, he exchanged houses with his parents, as was the family tradition. The parents moved into the so-called Little House on the family estate, an Italianate villa where Mrs. Bingham continued to live after her husband's death.         In addition to her son and daughters, Mrs. Bingham is survived by six grandsons, four granddaughters and a great-granddaughter.
