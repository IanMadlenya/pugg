Ann Rork Light, who was a silent film actress, died here Saturday at the Vanderbilt University Hospital. She was 79 years old and was being treated for emphysema and lung cancer.         The daughter of Samuel Edwin, a Hollywood producer, she appeared in films with Rudolph Valentino and Will Rogers, who also was her godfather.         In the 1930's Mrs. Light married J. Paul Getty, the oil magnate. In 1960, she married Dr. Ruldolph Light, an heir to the Upjohn Pharmaceutical Company and a professor of neurosurgery.       
        Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the flapper her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 87 years old.         Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the flapper her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 87 years old.         Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films, beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1934. But it was in the Roaring Twenties that she put her stamp on American social history, creating in dozens of films the image of the wide-eyed, insouciant flapper with bobbed hair and short skirts.         There was one other distinction known to every fan, even in the days before Technicolor: she had one brown eye and one blue eye. The eyes sparkled at audiences the world over, beginning with the 1923 hit that made her big splash, ''Flaming Youth.'' Her Dutch bob was soon copied by hairdressers across America and her air of an emancipated young woman inspired countless imitations.         Miss Moore was at the vanguard of fashion's first revolution of the 20th century as skirts rose above the knee, bosoms vanished and waistlines slid down to the hips. Co-Starred With Tracy         There followed such films as ''The Perfect Flapper,'' ''Naughty but Nice,'' ''Little Orphan Annie,'' and ''We Moderns.'' Her favorite, she said shortly after she stopped performing, was a talkie, ''The Power and the Glory,'' which co-starred Spencer Tracy.         At the height of her popularity she earned $1 million a year from films. She was also a writer, the author of ''Silent Star,'' her autobiography, and ''How Women Can Make Money in the Stock Market.'' Another work, ''Colleen Moore's Doll House,'' dealt with an elaborate miniature house she built in the mid-1920's. Designed in the form of a castle, and complete with electricity, running water, an organ and a radio, the house cost $470,000. It was sent around the country later for display in department stores to raise money for charity.         Miss Moore was born Kathleen Morrison in Port Huron, Mich., on Aug. 19, 1900. She arrived in Hollywood at age 15 when an uncle arranged a screen test with the director D. W. Griffith. She wanted to be a second Lillian Gish, playing dramatic roles, but instead found herself playing pure-as-snow heroines in Westerns with stars like Tom Mix. She later observed that she usually came out second best to the star's horse.         She had long, curly hair then, but at her mother's suggestion in 1923 she cut the curls off and landed the part of the flapper. 'A New Type'         ''Here was a chance for a girl who had straight hair, who was not buxom and not a great beauty,'' she told an interviewer half a century later. ''A new type was born - the American girl.''         In 1926, three years after her flapper had burst upon the screen, Miss Moore wrote: ''Don't worry, girls. No edict of fashion arbiters will ever swathe you in long and cumbersome skirts.'' She added: ''The American girl will see to this. She is independent, a thinker who will not follow slavishly the ordinances of those who in the past have decreed this or that for her to wear.''         Although she started the short-skirt fad with her appearances on screen, Miss Moore at first dressed quite differently in private life, favoring jeans, baggy sweaters and saddle shoes. But when she became a national fixture as the flapper, a designer friend accused her of being the worst-dressed woman in Hollywood. She took the criticism to heart and changed her manner of dress, managing to look both the all-American girl and chic and urbane.         Miss Moore was married three times. Her first two husbands were John McCormick, a film producer, and Albert F. Scott, a New York stockbroker. With her third marriage, to Homer Hargrave, a stockbroker, in 1937, she ended her film career. Mr. Hargrave was a widower with two children whom she came to consider her own. Mr. Hargrave died in 1967.         Four years later Miss Moore hired a builder, Paul Maginot, to construct a home in Hidden Valley south of Paso Robles. In 1983 she and Mr. Maginot were married.         Her husband survives, as does her son, Homer Hargrave Jr. of Paso Robles; her daughter, Mrs. Roger Jackson Coleman; several grandchildren, and several great-grandchildren.       
        Marion B. Reith, who founded the English in Action program, died of pneumonia Dec. 21 at Pomona (Calif.) Valley Community Hospital. She was 91 years old and lived in Claremont, Calif.         Marion B. Reith, who founded the English in Action program, died of pneumonia Dec. 21 at Pomona (Calif.) Valley Community Hospital. She was 91 years old and lived in Claremont, Calif.         She was born in Minneapolis and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley. When she moved to Manhattan in 1959, Mrs. Reith became interested in the difficulties of foreign students communicating in colloquial English.         She began tutoring a few students, recruited her friends and founded English in Action. There are now 31 branches nationally, under the auspices of the English-Speaking Union.         Mrs. Reith moved to Claremont in the late 1970's.         She is survived by a son, John, of Santa Barbara, Calif.; a daughter, Marianne Hatfield of Porterville, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandson.       
        Renee Pollack, executive director of Westchester Jewish Community Services, died of a cerebral hemorrhage Thursday in White Plains Hospital Medical Center. She was 53 years old and lived in Hartsdale, N.Y.         Renee Pollack, executive director of Westchester Jewish Community Services, died of a cerebral hemorrhage Thursday in White Plains Hospital Medical Center. She was 53 years old and lived in Hartsdale, N.Y.         Under her leadership, Westchester Jewish Community Services became the first mental health agency in New York State to be certified as a home health agency.         She is survived by a son, Ross, of Hartsdale, and a daughter, Janet, of White Plains.       
        Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Franco's doctor, Dr. Vicente Pozuelo Escudero, said she died of complications from bronchial pneumonia contracted on Feb. 1.         Queen Sofia went to Mrs. Franco's Madrid apartment to deliver condolences to Mrs. Franco's daughter, Carmen Franco de Martinez-Bordiu, 60, and her husband, on behalf of King Juan Carlos and herself.         In 1969, Franco designated Juan Carlos to be his successor, and Juan Carlos resumed the Spanish monarchy two days after Franco's death on Nov. 20, 1975. Figurehead of Movement         When her husband died, Mrs. Franco became the figurehead of a loosely formed organization of Franco's political followers, called ''El Movimiento.'' Each anniversary of Franco's death prompts thousands of fascists to march in the streets.         Mrs. Franco annually attended a funeral Mass in her husband's memory at the underground basilica in the Valley of the Fallen outside Madrid, where thousands of Nationalists killed in the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War are buried.         Ill health kept her from attending the 1987 memorial. An estimated 5,000 people attended the Mass, at the end of which they gave the fascist salute and shouted ''Franco! Franco! Franco!''         Mrs. Franco was born Carmen Polo on July 9, 1900, in the northern city of Oviedo, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. She was educated by Salesian nuns. In Spanish Morocco         She married Francisco Franco, then an up-and-coming army lieutenant colonel, on Oct. 22, 1923, and the couple left soon after for Spanish Morocco, where Franco was responsible for much of the conduct of the Riff Wars and where he built the military power base that served his successful uprising against the Republican Government.         Mrs. Franco exercised a strong influence on her husband, particularly in connection with affairs of the Roman Catholic Church and public morality.         Social historians say her puritanical upbringing was responsible for the heavy censorship of anything touching on sex or sexual matters in Spanish literature, theater and cinema during most of the 1939-75 Franco regime.         A man who answered the telephone at the apartment of Mrs. Franco's daughter said burial was scheduled for Sunday in the village of El Pardo on the outskirts of Madrid.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Franco is survived by seven grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.       
        Marghanita Laski, a novelist, critic and prolific amateur lexicographer, died Saturday, according to her family. She was 72 years old.         Marghanita Laski, a novelist, critic and prolific amateur lexicographer, died Saturday, according to her family. She was 72 years old.         A graduate of Somerville College at Oxford, Miss Laski published her first novel, ''Love on the Supertax,'' in 1944, and followed it with five others by 1953, including ''The Victorian Chaise-Longue.''         She then turned to criticism, with books on Charlotte Yonge, Jane Austen, George Eliot and Rudyard Kipling and two studies of religious and esthetic experience, ''Ecstasy'' and ''Everyday Ecstasy.''         One of her novels, ''Little Boy Lost,'' was turned into a movie in 1953 that starred Bing Crosby. Her 1959 television play ''The Offshore Island'' was about life in Britain after an atomic holocaust.         Miss Laski was widely known as a radio broadcaster. From 1979 to her death she was a member of the Arts Council of Great Britain, which channels government aid to the performing and visual arts.         Throughout her life, language remained one of Ms. Laski's great passions. Dr. Robert Burchfield, who started editing the four supplements to the Oxford English Dictionary in 1960, said Ms. Laski was his biggest contributor.         She is survived by her husband, John Howard, who founded the Cresset Press, and by a son and a daughter.

Dorothy Kurgans Goldberg, an artist, writer and human rights advocate, died of lung cancer Saturday at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Goldberg, the wife of Arthur J. Goldberg, the former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, was born in St. Louis. She earned bachelor's degrees in art from the University of Chicago and the Art Institute of Chicago and, in 1932, a doctorate in art from the University of Chicago.         Mrs. Goldberg had several one-person shows in New York and in Washington and helped establish community art programs in both cities. She also wrote several books, including ''The Creative Woman'' and ''A Private View of Public Life.'' Her most recent manuscript, dealing with international negotiations on human rights, is to be published soon.         In the late 1970's, Mrs. Goldberg served as a United States delegate to the Belgrade Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a follow-up to the Helsinki accords on human rights. She also was an observer at the Madrid follow-up conference on the Helsinki accords in 1981 and the Ottawa Conference on Human Rights in 1985.         Mrs. Goldberg married Justice Goldberg in 1931. After her husband's appointment as Secretary of Labor in the Kennedy Administration, Mrs. Goldberg organized Widening Horizons, a program to assist poor people seeking employment. She also organized Friends of the Juvenile Court, an organization to combat juvenile delinquency.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Goldberg is survived by a daughter, Barbara Cramer of Chicago; a son, Robert Goldberg, of Anchorage, Alaska, and six grandchildren. Funeral details were incomplete.

        Nora Astorga, Nicaragua's chief delegate to the United Nations and one of her Government's leading voices on the international scene, died of cancer yesterday in a Managua hospital. Thirty-nine years old, she had been one of the Sandinistas' leading guerrilla heroes in the revolution that overthrew the Somoza regime in         Nora Astorga, Nicaragua's chief delegate to the United Nations and one of her Government's leading voices on the international scene, died of cancer yesterday in a Managua hospital. Thirty-nine years old, she had been one of the Sandinistas' leading guerrilla heroes in the revolution that overthrew the Somoza regime in July 1979.         A spokesman for the Nicaraguan Mission to the United Nations said Miss Astorga returned to Managua in early January because of her illness and was hospitalized Thursday. He said her deputy, Julio Icaza, had been acting in her stead.         Dr. Kevin M. Cahill of New York said he had treated Miss Astorga for breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy in 1986, followed by chemotherapy.         Bourgeois by background and style, Miss Astorga used her Catholic upbringing and legal career as cover for her early role as a guerrilla. She was best known for an operation in 1978 in which she lured Gen. Anastasio Somoza Debayle's second-in-command into her bedroom, where hidden assailants killed him. U.S. Refused Her as Envoy         Miss Astorga at the time was a corporate lawyer and mother of two. She said later that the Somoza aide, Gen. Reynaldo Perez Vega, was to have been abducted, interrogated and exchanged for 59 political prisoners. But there was a struggle, and the would-be kidnappers slit the general's throat instead, she said.         The general also worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, American and Nicaraguan officials said. The incident loomed large when the United States refused to accept her appointment as Ambassador to Washington in 1984.         After the Sandinista victory, Miss Astorga became chief special prosecutor in 1980 for the trials of 7,500 members of the Somoza regime's National Guard and other supporters of the ousted dynasty. Many of them drew long sentences, but most have been released since.         Miss Astorga then was named Deputy Foreign Minister to represent Nicaragua at international conferences. She also spoke for her country in 1983 and 1984 when the Contadora group of Latin American nation was searching for a peaceful settlement of the civil strife in Central America.         She presented her credentials to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar at the United Nations in March 1986. Her message, sounded often, was meant to counter Washington's charges that the Sandinistas were seeking to impose Marxism-Leninism on all of Central America and to challenge the United States to help resolve the region's conflicts through talks. An Atypical Revolutionary         ''Revolutions are not exportable like Coca-Cola or paperbacks or something like that,'' she told reporters. ''You don't produce it internally and send it away. Revolutions are made in a country when the conditions in that particular country are for a process of change.''         Miss Astorga stood out in her diplomatic surroundings not only as one of the few women in such a position. At 5 feet 11 inches in high heels, she seldom went unnoticed, with her sleek frame fitted in dress-for-success clothes and her hair smartly cropped. She spoke Americanized English as well as Italian and loved classical music - not the typical portrait of a revolutionary.         While at the United Nations, she lived in a six-bedroom house in Scarsdale with her mother and her five children, including an adopted son who was the child of a friend killed in the revolution. All the children attended schools in Westchester County.         Nora Astorga Gadea was the daughter of a wealthy lumber exporter and rancher. The Astorga family - she kept her maiden name - had been associated with the Somoza regime since her grandfather was Defense Minister.         Driven to excel, she studied sociology at Catholic University in Washington before taking her law degree at the Jesuit-run Catholic University in Managua. There she began her secret work for the Sandinistas, passing messages and buying supplies.         At 22, she married Jorge Jenkins, a student dissident, and the couple spent a year in Italy, where he studied archeology and she banking law. They had two children before they parted after five years.         After the Peres Vega killing, Miss Astorga fled to a training camp where she commanded a military squad and became the lover of Jose Maria Alvarado, a member of the Sandinista inner circle, with whom she had two children.

She was 87 years old and lived in Washington.         Martha Granger Krock, a former society columnist in Chicago and Washington, died of pneumonia yesterday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 87 years old and lived in Washington.         Mrs. Krock was a society columnist for the Hearst Newspapers in Chicago briefly in the early 1930's. She moved to Washington in 1933 and wrote a column, ''These Charming People,'' for The Times-Herald until 1939.         That year she married Arthur Krock, the four-time Pulitizer Prize winner, who for many years was the Washington columnist and bureau chief of The New York Times. He died in 1974.         A prominent hostess in Washington, she was also long active in charities. During World War II, she was chief of the American Women's Voluntary Services and was decorated in 1947 by the Belgian Government for her work.         Mrs. Krock was born in Lake Forest, Ill., a daughter of Alfred Hoyt Granger, an architect, and Belle Hughitt Granger. Mrs. Krock was related to William Tecumseh Sherman, the Civil War general, and to John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury under President Rutherford B. Hayes and Secretary of State under President William McKinley.         Her first marriage, to William Mitchell Blair of Chicago, ended in divorce in 1932.         Surviving are a son, William Granger Blair of Manhattan, a reporter for The Times; a sister, Barbara Shepard of Menasha, Wis., and Carefree, Ariz., and three grandchildren.

        Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Best known for her insight into the everyday activities of American women, young and old, and for her studies of life as it was lived in and near Union Square from 1930 until the present day, Miss Bishop was the living continuation of a specific and distinctively American idiom.         That idiom, which was pioneered at the turn of this century by Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, George Luks, John Sloan and others, was reportorial in style, anecdotal in tone and shorn of all extraneous or merely complimentary material. It was intended to seize a moment, tell a tale, and give a renewed dignity to people for whom high art in this country had not often had a place. A Perceptive Observer         On the street corner, in the automat, in the subway and on park benches in fine weather, Miss Bishop proved herself a perceptive observer. For young women in the big city who were as yet unmarked by life, she had a particular feeling. But she was alert to the potential both for happiness and for an irrevocable, untold misery that exists at every stage of metropolitan life.         For all the rapid, spontaneous, firsthand qulity of her observation, she knew how to reach back into European Old Master painting for support and encouragement. John H. Baur, former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, once said of her work that ''in some mysterious manner which I do not really understand, her paintings carry forward the great tradition of north European 17th-century figure painting.''         Miss Bishop cherished that connection, and once said that ''you may have true gifts and the ability to make something that is new and surprising, but if your work hasn't any connections and your gift gives out, you haven't any leverage.'' Optimistic Viewpoint         When she first came to New York in the early 1920s, determined to become an artist, Miss Bishop studied at the Art Students League with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Guy Pene du Bois, both of whom had studied with Robert Henri.         From Pene du Bois, and later from her close friend, the painter Reginald Marsh, Miss Bishop learned to sharpen and perfect her sense of a New York subject. But neither age nor familiarity ever eroded her inherently optimistic approach to life. In her late work, it was as apparent as ever she had an unsentimental confidence that one day, somehow, the lot of women in the city would be changed for the better, Miss Bishop was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on March 3, 1902, the daughter of John Remsen Bishop, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Anna Bartram Bishop. Her father moved his large family from Princeton to the Midwest in hopes of giving them a more comfortable life. The failure of this venture, and the experience of genteel poverty in Detroit, gave her a lifelong sympathy with underprivileged people. Moved to New York in 1918         In 1918 she moved to New York and studied at the New York School of Applied Design for Women. Shortly after leaving the Art Students League in 1924, she began to work in the Union Square area, where she eventually took rank as the unofficial but unquestioned visual historian.         In 1932, she joined the Midtown Gallery in Manhattan, with which she remained closely affiliated for the rest of her life. A member of the National Academy of Design since 1941, she was vice president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters from 1944-46, a Benjamin Franklin Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in London in 1964, a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1971, and the recipient of honorary doctorates at Bates College, Mount Holyoke College and Syracuse University. She also received the gold medal of the National Arts Club in 1968 and 1970, the Outstanding Achievement in the Arts award (presented by President Carter) in 1979, and the gold medal for painting from the National Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1987.         Miss Bishop was married in 1934 to Dr. Harold Wolff, a neurologist. She is survived by a son, Remsen Wolff, and two granddaughters, Sara and Naomi Wolff.

        Heather O'Rourke, familiar to moviegoers as the child swept into another world by ghosts in ''Poltergeist'' and its sequel, ''Poltergeist II,'' died at Children's Hospital and Health Center in San Diego Monday. She was 12 years old.         Heather O'Rourke, familiar to moviegoers as the child swept into another world by ghosts in ''Poltergeist'' and its sequel, ''Poltergeist II,'' died at Children's Hospital and Health Center in San Diego Monday. She was 12 years old.         She died as a result of an acute bowel obstruction, complicated by septic shock, said a spokesman for the hospital, Vincent Bond. He said Miss O'Rourke had undergone surgery for the obstruction, which was congenital, after an emergency flight to the hospital from another hospital in the area.         Miss O'Rourke had finished shooting the forthcoming ''Poltergeist III'' last June. A statement by M-G-M, the studio that produced all three films, said her death was unexpected, and the cause ''unknown at this time.''         Steven Spielberg, who co-wrote and co-produced ''Poltergeist,'' discovered Miss O'Rourke by chance when she was visiting the M-G-M studios. After the 1982 film, she appeared in television shows such as ''Webster'' and ''Still the Beaver'' and had a recurring role on ''Happy Days'' as the daughter of Henry Winkler's girlfriend. She played a blind girl on a recent episode of ''Our House.''         But she was most memorable in her debut film, in which she played a key role as the youngest child of a suburban family. With her wide eyes, long blonde hair and soft voice, she was so striking that the sequel played off her presence. Her slight voice, eerily singing ''They're baaack!'' to announce the ghosts' return, became the tag line in the film's advertising.         She is survived by her parents, Katherine and Jim, of San Diego.

        Irene Rich, the urbane star of scores of silent films of the 1920's and a popular radio personality of the 30's, died of heart failure Friday at her home in Hope Ranch, Calif., outside Santa Barbara. She was 96 years old.         Irene Rich, the urbane star of scores of silent films of the 1920's and a popular radio personality of the 30's, died of heart failure Friday at her home in Hope Ranch, Calif., outside Santa Barbara. She was 96 years old.         With chiseled features, aristocratic bearing and a trim figure accented by smart gowns and coiffeurs, she was for more than two decades a role model for millions of American women.         She entered the movies as an extra in 1918, and once estimated that she had made more than 60 pictures. In seven, she was the upwardly striving wife of the humorist Will Rogers.         For more than a decade a national radio audience regularly tuned to her dramatic series, ''Dear John.'' For the Benefit of Grapes         Her sponsor was Welch's grape juice, and in succeeding years, her svelte image became indelibly linked with the product, which she winningly touted as the key to being slender. Welch's said she had increased sales by 638 percent, and she told an interviewer that the sponsor was ''frank enough to say that I have brought him so much business that it has just saved his shirt - I think it's kind of swell.''         The actress was born Irene Luther in Buffalo on Oct. 13, 1891, the daughter of William and Mabel Luther, who later moved to the isolated mining town of Stites, Idaho.         When her parents decided to send her to boarding school, she eloped at the age of 17. The marriage, to Elvo Deffenbaugh, produced a daughter, Frances, and ended in divorce in two years. She married Maj. Charles Rich of the Army, with whom she had a daughter, Jane. The couple were divorced four years later, and the 24-year-old Miss Rich began supporting herself and her two daughters by successfully selling real estate in San Francisco.         She went to Hollywood in 1918, became an extra in silent films and was soon playing leading roles with such actors as Dustin and William Farnum, Lon Chaney, Clive Brook, Ronald Colman and Lewis Stone.         Miss Rich later dismissed her screen image as ''the doormat in an endless series of domestic films,'' but she skillfully played a number of challenging roles, including a worldly Edwardian in the 1925 screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's ''Lady Windermere's Fan.'' She was also the screen's first ''Craig's Wife,'' the antiseptic shrew who tormented Warner Baxter in the 1928 silent film of George Kelly's benchmark play. Portrayed Mothers in the 30's         Her comedies with Will Rogers included ''Jes' Call Me Jim'' (1920), ''They Had to See Paris'' (1929) and ''Down to Earth'' (1932).         By the 30's, Miss Rich invariably portrayed mothers, as in ''The Champ'' (1931), with Jackie Cooper and Wallace Beery, and ''That Certain Age'' (1938), with Deanna Durbin. Her later occasional film appearances included supporting roles in two 1948 epics, ''Fort Apache,'' directed by John Ford, and ''Joan of Arc,'' starring Ingrid Bergman.         In vaudeville, Miss Rich did nearly 5,000 performances in a dramatic sketch called ''Ask the Wife.'' On Broadway, Miss Rich was the nation's first female President, deftly cueing one-liners for the madcap comic Bobby Clark in the long-running musical ''As the Girls Go'' in 1948-50. Retired in 1950         The actress also had a talent for business. In the 30's and 40's she owned and operated a 300-acre stock farm outside Los Angeles, producing food, feed, poultry and livestock. Every phase of the enterprise showed a profit. In World War II, she served as a lieutenant in the Women's Ambulance and Defense Corps.         In early 1950, when ''As the Girls Go'' was about to end its Broadway run, Miss Rich was married to George Henry Clifford, a businessman, and announced her retirement. Mr. Clifford died in 1959.         In reviewing ''As the Girls Go,'' Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote that ''Miss Rich is a lady who presides over the whole rumpus with warmth, charm and good manners, and the show has the good taste to respect her quality.''         She is survived by her two daughters, two grandsons and three great-grandchildren.

The daughter of Alicia Spaulding, a United Fruit Company heiress, and Count Lorenzo Paolozzi, she was born in New York, grew up in Rome, and was educated in Switzerland and at the Madeira School in Greenway, Va.         She began her modeling career in New York at age 17. A nude photograph of her by Richard Avedon in Harper's Bazaar in 1962 caused a sensation. Unclothed figures did not appear in fashion magazines at that time.         In 1964, she married Dr. Howard Bellin, a plastic surgeon. They were known for their lively parties attended by an eclectic group that included Andy Warhol, Jacob K. Javits, Zsa Zsa Gabor, karate instructors and whatever glamorous personality happened to be in town, Dr. Bellin recalled. They were divorced in 1982, remarried four months later when Mrs. Bellin fell ill, and divorced again when she seemed to be recovering.         She is survived by two sons, Marco and Andy, her sister, Francesca, and her mother, all of Manhattan.         The funeral will be at 3 P.M. tomorrow at St. James Episcopal Church, at 865 Madison Avenue, at 71st Street in Manhattan.         Correction:  April 30, 1988, Saturday, Late City Final Edition

Elaine Black Yoneda, a radical labor activist during the Depression and the 1934 San Francisco general strike, died of a heart attack here on Thursday. She was 81 years old.         Mrs. Yoneda, known in labor circles as ''the Red Angel'' and as ''Tiger Woman'' in the Hearst newspapers because of her militancy, was the only woman on the steering committee of the 1934 San Francisco general strike, which was a response to the killing of two longshoremen participating in a West Coast walkout.         Until she retired in 1973, Mrs. Yoneda was a clerical worker for the pension fund of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union-Pacific Maritime Association. She was a member of Local 29 of the Office and Professional Employees International Union until this year and was president of the women's auxiliary of Local 16 of the longshoremen's union. Became a Communist         She was born in New York City on Sept. 4, 1906. She moved to Los Angeles in 1931 and there joined the Communist Party. She was active with International Labor Defense, a group that worked for the legal rights of strikers and others active in the labor movement.         She met a young Japanese-American and fellow Communist named Karl Yoneda when she went to bail him out of jail, where he was being held for strike activities. They were married in 1933.         Her husband said her death came on the 55th anniversary of their wedding as they were preparing to celebrate.         Mr. Yoneda said they had remained members of the party: ''We believe in minority parties. If you let the big shots run the country, what will happen to us?'' Husband Interned in War         In 1942, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt signed an order for the internment of people of Japanese ancestry. Mr. Yoneda was interned at the camp at Manzanar, Calif.         Mr. Yoneda said his wife and son remained with him until he volunteered to perform intelligence work for the United States military against the Japanese Army in Burma. Mrs. Yoneda was allowed to move with her son to San Francisco, but for the next two years she had to report monthly to military authorities on the child's whereabouts, her husband said.         In later years, she remained active in union and political work. The day before she died, she attended a longshoremen's rally for the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential campaign, her husband said.         A private funeral service was held Saturday in San Francisco. In addition to her husband, Ms. Yoneda's survivors are her daughter from a previous marriage, Joyce Ebangelista, her son, Thomas Yoneda, and two grandchildren.

She was 88 years old and lived in Pompano Beach, Fla.         Evelyn D. Seide Walter, personal secretary and companion to Helen Keller for 37 years, died Thursday at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., after a long illness. She was 88 years old and lived in Pompano Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Walter was 20 when she went to work as a secretary for the American Foundation for the Blind in Manhattan. She met Miss Keller there a short time later and became secretary to the blind and deaf woman who surmounted her physical limitations to become an author, educator and champion for the handicapped.         After the death of Miss Keller's companion of many years, Polly Thompson, Mrs. Walter became her ''eyes,'' running the Keller home in Westport, Conn., and managing her finances until Miss Keller's death in 1968.         ''She loved Helen Keller dearly,'' said Mrs. Walter's daughter, Evelyn D. Tonner of Margate, Fla. She added that her mother had promised Miss Keller and Polly Thompson that she would never write a book about her experiences as a companion, a promise she honored.

She was 70 years old.  Mrs. Spellman, a Democrat, was running for her fourth term in the House when her heart stopped beating temporarily on Oct. 31, 1980, while she was judging a Halloween costume contest at a shopping mall.         Two days later, she was re-elected with 80 percent of the vote over a little-known Republican, Kevin R. Igoe.         Mrs. Spellman remained hospitalized in critical condition for several weeks after her heart attack. Her condition later stabilized, and she was able to breathe without the aid of life-support equipment, but she never regained consciousness. Seat Is Declared Vacant         After receiving a medical analysis stating that Mrs. Spellman was in a ''trance-like state'' and unable to take the oath of office, the House declared her seat vacant in February 1981. It was the first time the House vacated the seat of a member who had become mentally or physically disabled.         Thirty-two Republican and Democratic candidates, including Mrs. Spellman's husband, Reuben, entered a special primary on April 7, 1981, to select the nominees to run for election in Maryland's Fifth District.         Mr. Spellman was defeated for the Democratic nomination by Steny H. Hoyer, who went on to defeat the Republican candidate, Mayor Audrey Scott of Bowie, Md., in a special election on May 19, 1981. Mr. Hoyer continues to serve in the House.         Mrs. Spellman, who was born Gladys Noon in New York City on March 2, 1918, was educated in public schools in the District of Columbia, George Washington University and the Graduate School of the Department of Agriculture.         Her first elected position was as a member of the Prince Georges County Board of Commissioners in 1962. In 1967, she was appointed by President Johnson to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.         She is survived by her husband; two sons, Stephen and Richard; a daughter, Dana Spellman O'Neill, and four grandchildren.

        Eleanor Estes, a prolific author of children's books, died of complications following a stroke at the Whitney Manor Nursing Home in Hamden, Conn., on Friday. She was 82 years old and lived in New Haven.         Eleanor Estes, a prolific author of children's books, died of complications following a stroke at the Whitney Manor Nursing Home in Hamden, Conn., on Friday. She was 82 years old and lived in New Haven.         Mrs. Estes was born in West Haven. She graduated from the Pratt Institute Library School and worked as children's librarian in branches of the New York Public Library system.         Her first book was ''The Moffats,'' written in 1941 and an instant hit. It illustrated the life of a family of four children growing up in a small New England town. Two other books about the Moffats followed.         The most popular of her 19 books, many of which she illustrated herself, was ''The Hundred Dresses,'' a tale about a poor child who is ridiculed for her tattered clothing and who insists that she owns 100 dresses. They turn out to be drawings, and when they win a prize, the girl's tormentors are abashed - and perhaps reformed. Won a Newbery Medal         Mrs. Estes won several literary prizes, the most prestigous being a John Newbery Medal for the most distinguished children's book, in 1952 for ''Ginger Pye.''         She was once asked by The New York Times Book Review what she was trying to say to children. She replied: ''I am holding up a mirror, and the scene reflected in the mirror is a true image of childhood, and the mirror, besides reflecting, also speaks and echoes the clear, profound, unpremeditated utterances, thoughts and imageries of children. I like to make children laugh or cry, to be moved in some way by my writing.''         Mrs. Estes wrote a single adult novel, ''The Echoing Green,'' which never achieved the popularity of her children's works.         She is survived by her husband, Rice, and a daughter, Helena Sileo of Brooklyn.       
        Frances Midlam Kennedy, a former executive vice president of the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton, died of lung cancer Saturday at the home of her daughter in Weston, Mass. She was 75 years old and had lived in Manhattan until last fall.         Frances Midlam Kennedy, a former executive vice president of the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton, died of lung cancer Saturday at the home of her daughter in Weston, Mass. She was 75 years old and had lived in Manhattan until last fall.         With such campaigns as ''What's a woman to do'' for Total cereal and ''Bake a Gold Medal memory'' for the flour brand, Mrs. Kennedy rose to prominence in a field with few women executives. Working for what was then Dancer-Fitzgerald-Sample Inc., she was Chicago's Advertising Woman of the Year in 1960. She moved to the company's office in New York two years later to become a senior vice president and creative director.         For several years until she retired last year, Mrs. Kennedy also headed the company's creative review board and the creative strategy advisory board. Evaluated Campaign Ideas         Eventually, as chairman of D.F.S.'s creative review and advisory boards, she evaluated all campaign ideas before the client got to see them. In 1972, she also started a continually updated project meant to guide advertisers in their approach to women.         A native of Wilmington, Del., Mrs. Kennedy attended public schools and started writing copy for Compton Advertising in New York in 1939, leaving for D.F.S. in 1947. Saatchi & Saatchi, which had taken over Compton and D.-F.S. separately, merged them into the present firm last year.         Mrs. Kennedy, is survived by two sons, Edward C. of Lexington, Ky., and Stephen D. of Watertown, Mass.; a daughter, Dr. Katherine K. Treadway of Weston; a sister, Elizabeth Hudson of Dover, Del.; a brother, Edward Midlam of Lake Charles, La., and eight grandchildren.         A funeral service will be held at 2 P.M. tomorrow at St. Thomas Episcopal Church, Fifth Avenue at 53d Street.

        Barbara Woodhouse, the dog trainer whose teaching methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died today, relatives said. She was 78 years old.         Barbara Woodhouse, the dog trainer whose teaching methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died today, relatives said. She was 78 years old.         Her family said she died in a hospital in Buckinghamshire, northwest of London, having suffered a second stroke a month ago. She had a first stroke in 1984.         ''We shall miss her very much but she had been very ill for some time,'' Mrs. Woodhouse's son, Patrick, said today.         In the 1970's and early 1980's, millions of dog owners in Britain and the United States watched Mrs. Woodhouse schooling pets on the BBC television program ''Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way,'' which became widely syndicated in this country. Before long, loyal viewers were telling their dogs, ''Walkies!'' as her byword caught on. With Love and Breath         Her book, ''No Bad Dogs, The Woodhouse Way,'' was a bestseller in 1982.         She insisted that any dog could be trained and showed that they could be taught within minutes with ''tone of voice, telepathy and a little bit of loving.'' Her way of getting to know an animal was to breathe into its nose.         Mrs. Woodhouse's smiling, bespectacled face, framed by short gray hair, became a familiar sight on television talk shows. In 1980, she was ''flabbergasted'' to be named female television personality of the year in Britain.         ''She had an amazing ability with animals,'' her husband, Dr. Michael Woodhouse, said.         The Woodhouses lived in Croxley Green in Hertfordshire north of London.         The daughter of a clergyman, Mrs. Woodhouse developed her knack with animals as a child when her mother boarded dogs. She learned she could stop their barking by talking to them in a quiet voice. Innkeeper for Man and Beast         She trained dogs as her three children were growing up, and at one time ran a hotel for dogs and their owners.         She made her first dog-training film, ''Love Me, Love My Dog,'' in 1955 using a Great Dane, Juno. It was shown in movie theaters around the country. Her first record album, in 1967, had advance sales of 25,000.         Mrs. Woodhouse said she received 400 letters a day when the television program was running.         She once said that because of the television appearances, she could not go out in public without being asked for her advice.         The public recognition could be helpful, she said. Once, going through passport control at a London airport, the inspector said: ''Oh, here's the dog lady. No need to see your passport. Walkies!''

        Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         The immediate cause of the actress's death was not disclosed, but she had been in frail health for several years. She had lived in a condominium in Montecito, a suburb of Santa Barbara, since 1974. For many years previously, she and Mr. March, who died in 1975 at the age of 77, lived in Manhattan and on a 40-acre farm near New Milford, Conn.         Miss Eldridge, who made her New York stage debut in the chorus of Jerome Kern's ''Rockabye Baby,'' in 1918, was a versatile actress who played in touring stock companies, motion pictures and on Broadway. She Played Mary Tyrone         She topped a distinguished career on the stage in 1956 with her memorable portrayal of the tragic drug addict Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical drama, ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' For that performance she was named best actress by the New York Drama Critics Circle.         Miss Eldridge was named Florence McKechnie when she was born on Sept. 5, 1901, in Brooklyn. She graduated from Girls High School and immediately set her sights on an acting career. By 1921 she had made her mark, appearing in the Theater Guild's ''Ambush'' and impelling one critic to call her ''one of the brightest chapters in the season's theatrical history.''         She became one of her era's most celebrated performers, appearing in ''The Cat and the Canary'' (1922), Pirandello's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' (1922), and as the neurotic and spoiled Daisy Buchanan in a stage version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.''         In 1927 she met and appeared opposite Mr. March in Molnar's ''The Swan,'' and they were married within the year. Then, on a repertory tour, they were not allowed to appear in the same plays together, for management considered it unromantic to have a man and wife play lovers. Ascendancy of the Voice         The Marches wound up in Los Angeles in 1928, so the actor could appear in ''The Royal Family'' at a local theater. Sound had just been introduced into films, and Hollywood was eager to give work to stage-trained actors with excellent voices, like Miss Eldridge and Mr. March, and so they settled there.         Miss Eldridge had appeared briefly in a New York-made film in 1923, but her first good movie roles came in 1929, when she made three films, ''The Studio Murder Mystery,'' co-starring Mr. March, ''Charming Sinners'' and ''The Greene Murder Case.'' During the 1930's, while her husband became a major box-office star, she appeared in several movies, including ''The Story of Temple Drake'' (1933), based on William Faulkner's ''Sanctuary,'' ''Les Miserables'' (again with Mr. March, in 1935) and ''Mary of Scotland'' (1936), in which she played Elizabeth I. The acting couple returned to Broadway in 1938 in ''Yr. Obedient Husband,'' a vehicle based on Samuel Pepys's diary, and failed so resoundingly they bought advertising space to apologize. The advertisement, in trade publications, showed the Marches as trapeze artists missing each other's grip in midair. ''Oops, sorry!'' read the caption.  In 1942, during the Broadway run of Thornton Wilder's ''Skin of Our Teeth,'' Miss Eldridge and Mr. March carried on an epic feud with their notoriously temperamental co-star, Tallulah Bankhead. The director of the play, Elia Kazan, in his recent autobiography, ''A Life,'' recalled that nightly, while Miss Eldridge was giving her main speech, Miss Bankhead would conspicuously comb her hair to upstage her. To retaliate, Mr. March stood in the wings gargling loudly while Miss Bankhead gave her big speech. Other Roles Together         In 1948 Miss Eldridge returned to Hollywood to play Mr. March's wife in Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest.'' That same year they appeared in a daring and controversial film about euthanasia, variously called ''An Act of Mercy'' and ''An Act of Murder.'' They also acted together in ''Christopher Columbus,'' in which Miss Eldridge was seen as Queen Isabella, in 1949, and, again playing man and wife, in ''Inherit the Wind,'' in 1960.         The Marches had no children of their own, but adopted two, Anthony and Penelope. Miss Eldridge is survived by her daughter, Penelope Fantacci of Florence, Italy; five grandchildren; a great-granddaughter, and two brothers, David I. McKechnie, who lives in Oregon, and Cromwell McKechnie, of Carpenteria, Calif.

She was 60 years old, and had been on the Mount Holyoke faculty since 1957.         Jean C. Harris, a professor of art at Mount Holyoke College and the former director of its art museum, died of cancer last Friday at Holyoke (Mass.) Hospital. She was 60 years old, and had been on the Mount Holyoke faculty since 1957.         A specialist in 19th-century French painting, Ms. Harris had published many articles and essays in that field, and had prepared a number of exhibition catalogues, including ''Collegiate Collections,'' a history of art collecting at American colleges and universities.         In 1970 she published a catalogue raisonne of the graphic works of Manet, and in 1984 a handbook of the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum. For the museum in 1962, she organized one of the first shows of work by contemporary American female artists. Examining Art's Economics         At the time of her death she was editing a catalogue of the graphic works of the 19th-century French painter and etcher Alphonse Legros. With a colleague, Sarah Montgomery, a professor of economics at Mount Holyoke, she was also working on a book, ''The Art Complex,'' dealing with the economic organization of the art world.         Ms. Harris was born on Dec. 4, 1927, in Cairo, the daughter of the Rev. Erdman and Harriette Pope Harris. She graduated from Smith College in 1949, and later earned both M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Radcliffe College.         At Mount Holyoke, where she was named a full professor in 1971, she served for a number of years as chairman of the art department, and in the early 1970's oversaw new construction to house it. As director of the college's art museum, from 1978 to 1983, she helped add significantly to its collections, and to the number of exhibitions it organized.         She is survived by her sister, Ruth Pelmas of Glastonbury, Conn., two nieces, a nephew, and an uncle, John Pope, professor emeritus of English at Yale University. A funeral service will be held today at 9 A.M. at Abbey Chapel on the Mount Holyoke campus.

She was 94 years old and had lived in Arroyo Grande for several years.         Adela Rogers St. Johns, the journalist, author and screenwriter, died yesterday morning in the South County Convalescent Hospital in Arroyo Grande, Calif., her grandson, George St. Johns, said. She was 94 years old and had lived in Arroyo Grande for several years.         As a journalist for Hearst and other publications, she wrote about such stories as the Leopold-Loeb murder trial, the abdication of Edward VIII, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and the trial of the kidnapper, Bruno Hauptmann.         She also wrote many articles for Photoplay magazine, becoming known as its ''Mother Confessor of Hollywood.''         Her screenwriting included two Tom Mix westerns, and her published fiction included short stories and serials for The Saturday Evening Post, Good Housekeeping and other magazines. Worked for Several Papers         The Hearst publications for which she worked over the years included The San Francisco Examiner, The Los Angeles Herald and The Chicago American. She also worked for the Hearst-owned International News Service.         Mel Durslag, another longtime writer for Hearst publications, said yesterday, ''She was a tough, hard newspaper woman, a figure from the old, roaring days of Hearst journalism, which no longer lives.''         Mrs. St. Johns was the daughter of a California criminal lawyer, and she spent much time in courtrooms in her youth. She wrote in a 1969 volume of memoirs, ''The Honeycomb,'' that what she did not learn at school she had ''learned from pimps, professional prostitutes, gamblers, bank robbers, poets, newspapermen, jury bribers, millionaire dipsomaniacs and murderers.'' Began Career in 1913         She was born in Los Angeles on May 20, 1894, the daughter of Earl Rogers and the former Harriet Belle Greene. She grew up mainly in Los Angeles, attending several schools, including Hollywood High School, and then traveled widely, with time out to study piano in Leipzig.         She began her newspaper career in 1913 as a reporter and feature writer with The San Francisco Examiner. She worked for The Los Angeles Herald from 1914 to 1918, The Chicago American in 1928 and The New York American in 1929.         Mary Pickford, Tom Mix, Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino were some of the celebrities she interviewed over the years.         Mrs. St. Johns's first short story, ''The Black Cat,'' was published in 1918. Her first novel, ''The Sky Rocket'' (1923) became a movie, and so did ''A Free Soul'' (1924) and ''A Single Standard'' (1925). Taught at Universities         She taught at the Graduate School of Journalism of the University of California at Los Angeles from 1950 to 1952, and at other universities over the years.         Her books included ''How to Write a Short Story'' (1952) and ''Affirmative Prayer in Action'' (1955), and ''Final Verdict,'' a biography of her father, in 1962.         Other magazines to which she contributed included McCall's, Ladies Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and Reader's Digest.         Mrs. St. Johns was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Nixon in 1970.         Her 1914 marriage to William Ivan St. Johns ended in divorce in 1929, and so did her subsequent marriages, to Richard Hyland and to Francis P. O'Toole.         She is survived by a daughter, Elaine St. Johns of Arroyo Grande; two sons, McCullah St. Johns of Thousand Oaks, Calif., and Richard Rogers St. Johns of Los Angeles; 10 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren.

        Ray Eames, who as a partner in the design firm The Office of Charles and Ray Eames exerted a powerful influence on furniture and industrial design over the last 40 years, died of cancer on Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         Ray Eames, who as a partner in the design firm The Office of Charles and Ray Eames exerted a powerful influence on furniture and industrial design over the last 40 years, died of cancer on Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         As a professional partner of her husband, Charles, who died in 1978, Ray Eames collaborated in the design of hundreds of chairs, tables, and other pieces of furniture that combined mass production with a high sense of style and comfort.         Their most famous work is the ''Eames Chair,'' two pieces of molded plywood connected by stainless steel tubing. Other chairs and tables designed by the Eameses, who worked in Venice, Cal., were made from such materials as reinforced plastic and fiberglas.         Today, their designs are commonly found in airports, high schools and hospitals in mass-produced form, and as showpieces in the most stylish offices and homes. Their Home Was a Showcase         The Eameses' home in Santa Monica, Calif., was designed and built in 1949 as a demonstration project to encourage the use of mass-produced industrial materials. Virtually all of the materials used were bought out of manufacturers' catalogues. The house was a harbinger of the era of prefabricated buildings, but was also widely praised for the lightness, delicacy, intelligence and beauty of its design.         Mrs. Eames, a painter by training, and Mr. Eames, an architect, collaborated in dozens of design projects ranging from films and books to fabric design and museum exhibitions.         Their work in films was especially noted. Most of the films were educational, and many attempted to make scientific notions understandable to a wide public through striking visual means.         The best-known of these efforts is ''Powers of Ten,'' completed by the Eameses in 1968 for the Commission on College Physics. The film illustrates the concept of tenfold magnification by zooming a camera from the surface of the earth to the edge of the universe, then back down to a carbon atom in a man's hand.         A native of Sacramento, Calif., Mrs. Eames was trained as a painter, and studied with Hans Hoffman in New York City for six years in the 1930's. In 1940, she met Mr. Eames, an architect, at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. They married and moved to California in 1941.         Mrs. Eames is survived by her daughter, Lucia Demetrios of San Francisco, and by five grandchildren.

McFarland, who was ac tive until two years ago in the manage-ment of Sweets seafood restaurant, a family business at Fulton and South Streets, died of cardiac arrest Sunday at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge, N.J. She was 91 years old and lived in Caldwell, N.J.         Mrs. McFarland was a daughter of James Lake, who in 1917 acquired Sweets, the oldest seafood house in New York City, founded by Abraham M. Sweet in 1842. Her sister, Lea Lake, died in April at 89 after having been a co-owner of Sweets since 1933, when their father died.         Mrs. McFarland was involved with the restaurant in childhood but was associated for several decades with Ohrbach's specialty store. In 1962, after her retirement there, she rejoined Sweets.

Mrs. McFarland is survived by two sons, John, of East Hanover, N.J., and Benjamin, of Andover, N.J.; five grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
        Hazel Dawn, a celebrated singer and actress in the early decades of the century who was known as ''The Pink Lady,'' died Sunday at the home of her daughter in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Hazel Dawn, a celebrated singer and actress in the early decades of the century who was known as ''The Pink Lady,'' died Sunday at the home of her daughter in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Miss Dawn made her Broadway stage debut in March 1911 in an imported musical called ''The Pink Lady.'' The show was a hit, running for three years, and although she was not the leading lady Miss Dawn skyrocketed to fame.         She was once the mascot of both Army and Navy at one of their annual football games. And Miss Dawn said that when West Point's cadets tossed their hats onto the stage, one hat belonged to a cadet who later became President, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Career Began in London         Miss Dawn began her career in London musical comedies and appeared in ''The Dollar Princess'' and ''Dear Little Denmark,'' as well as ''The Pink Lady.'' In New York, Victor Herbert is said to have written ''The Debutant'' for her and she had roles in ''Up in Mabel's Room'' and ''The Demi-Virgin.'' Although she was an exceptional beauty, most of her roles were not starring ones.         Hazel Dawn was born in Ogden, Utah, and named Hazel Tout. Her family later moved to Wales, where her father, a Mormon, was a missionary. In London, according to one version of how she got her name, a producer, Ivan Caryll, met her at a party and said: ''You're just the one I want for my new play. But you must change your name. Tout is honest but impossible. You are so young, so fresh, so pink, you remind one of the dawn; you shall be Hazel Dawn.''         Miss Dawn starred in the original ''Ziegfeld Follies'' and appeared in early silent films of the Famous Players, among whom were Marion Davies and Margaret Clark. Married Into Wealth         In 1927, Miss Dawn married Charles Gruwell, a mining engineer from Montana, reportedly ''one of the richest men in the West,'' and largely gave up her career, though she did appear on stage in ''Wonder Boy'' in 1931. After Mr. Gruwell died in 1941, she went to work in the casting department of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, retiring from there about 25 years ago. She also appeared in 1946 in the film ''Margie.''         Miss Dawn is survived by her daughter, Dawn Gruwell Kaufman, and her son, Charles E. Gruwell, both of New York, five grandsons and seven great-grandchildren.

        Nancy Hale, a novelist and short-story writer, died Saturday at the Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Va., after suffering a stroke. She was 80 years old and lived in Charlottesville.         Nancy Hale, a novelist and short-story writer, died Saturday at the Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Va., after suffering a stroke. She was 80 years old and lived in Charlottesville.         Flickers of prim Boston, social New York and proper Virginia danced through her works, the earlier ones focusing on the follies and foibles of well-bred women.         ''I specialize in women,'' Miss Hale said in an interview in 1942, ''because they are so mysterious to me. I feel that I know men quite thoroughly, that I know how, in a given situation, a man is apt to react. But women puzzle me.''         Nancy Hale was born in Boston on May 6, 1908, the daughter of Philip L. Hale and Lilian Westcott Hale, both painters. As a toddler she played in their studios, often setting up a palette and trying to copy whatever they were working on. Brief Career Painting         She graduated from the Winsor School in Boston in 1926, studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and worked briefly as a painter.         Bored with Boston, she moved to New York in 1928. After working as an assistant editor at Vogue (''I pinch-hit as a model''), she joined The New York Times as a reporter. In 1929 she began to contribute ''casuals'' - humorous sketches - and stories to The New Yorker.         She became one of the New Yorker's best-known writers, and once boasted that she sold the magazine more stories in a single year than any other writer. First Novel About the Young         Miss Hale's first novel, ''The Young Die Good,'' was published in 1932. It was based on her idea that young New Yorkers wanted something more than they were getting in life but had neither ''the courage nor strength to go out and get it.'' Her second novel, ''Never Any More,'' appeared in 1934, followed in 1936 by a collection of short stories, ''The Earliest Dreams.''         Among her other works were ''New England Discovery'' (1963), ''Life in the Studio'' (1969), ''Secrets'' (1971), ''Mary Cassatt'' (1975) and ''The Night of the Hurricane'' (1978).         She is survived by her husband, Fredson T. Bowers, of Charlottesville, a former chairman of the English department of the University of Virginia; two sons by previous marriages, William Wertenbaker, of New Haven, Conn., and Mark Hardin; five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Dr. Myrtle Bryan McGraw, a psychologist and researcher in child development, died of pnuemonia last Tuesday at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 89 years old.         Dr. McGraw, whose work was hailed by Dr. John Dewey, the educator and philospher, conducted a behavior study with the Woods twins, Johnny and Jimmy, and others at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, where she was associate director of the Normal Child Development Center from 1930 to 1942. The study was published in 1935 and was followed by a second work, ''The Neuromuscular Maturation of the Human Infant,'' in 1943.         She was appointed professor of psychology at Briarcliff College in 1953 and taught there until 1972, when she retired.         Dr. McGraw was born in Birmingham, Ala., and graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University. She received a Ph.D. from Columbia University.         She was married to Rudolph F. Malina, a research engineer, who died in 1970.         Dr. McGraw is survived by a daughter, Mitzi Wertheim of Washington, and two grandchildren.       
        Dorothy Scott Gerber, the widow of Daniel F. Gerber, who founded the Gerber Products Company, died in her sleep Sunday at her home in Fremont, Mich., according to a company spokesman. She was 84 years old.         Dorothy Scott Gerber, the widow of Daniel F. Gerber, who founded the Gerber Products Company, died in her sleep Sunday at her home in Fremont, Mich., according to a company spokesman. She was 84 years old.         Mrs. Gerber played a key role in the introduction of Gerber baby food in 1928. Tired of straining foods for her own children, it occurred to her that if the Fremont Canning Company could puree tomatoes, it could also puree fruits and vegetables. Fremont was the predecessor to Gerber Products; the name was changed in 1941.         Her husband thought the idea was sound and that other mothers might welcome commercially strained baby foods if they could be sold cheaply at regular grocery outlets.         The first batches of strained vegetables were then produced. Mrs. Gerber, a native of Ithaca, Mich., who married Daniel Gerber in 1923, liked them and, more important, so did her 7-month-old daughter Sally. The new baby food was priced at 15 cents, considerably cheaper than similar foods, which until then had been obtainable largely through drug stores at 40 to 60 cents each.         Besides her daughter, Sally Phinny of Fremont, Mrs. Gerber is survived by four other children, Paula Warm of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Gay Cummings, Scottie Merrill and Daniel Gerber Jr., all of Fremont. She is also survived by 18 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren.

Mrs. Snowden and her husband, Otto, began Freedom House in 1949 after calling 17 people to their home to discuss how black and white residents of Boston could unite on common problems.         They ran the organization from their home for three years and then bought a building for it.         By the time the Snowdens retired in 1984, the organization had become a catalyst for urban renewal, job fairs, affirmative action and innovative school programs. The Snowdens were also a force for calm during Boston's school integration crisis of the 1970's.         ''The work of an organization like ours is never done,'' Mrs. Snowden once said.         In June 1987, she was one of 32 Americans who were given ''no strings'' grants by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. For five years, each fellow receives an annual stipend ranging from $30,000 to $75,000.         In June, the Boston School Committee voted to rename a high school in Mrs. Snowden's honor.         Mrs. Snowden is survived by her husband, a daughter and a granddaughter.       
        Henrietta Jacobson, a longtime star of the Yiddish theater in New York, died of heart failure Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Henrietta Jacobson, a longtime star of the Yiddish theater in New York, died of heart failure Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Jacobson was one of the most venerable actresses and comediennes of the Yiddish theater, which flourished on the Lower East Side during the first half of the century. The daughter, wife and mother of Yiddish actors, she made her stage debut at age 3 in Chicago, where she was born.         After her 1912 New York debut in ''Israel's Hope,'' Miss Jacobson spent much of the next seven decades performing in such Yiddish plays and musicals as ''It Could Happen to You,'' ''The World of Mrs. Solomon,'' ''Go Fight City Hall'' and ''Kosher Widow.'' Her husband, Julius Adler, was almost always her co-star in New York and on the road. They produced and directed at the Downtown National Theater and other Lower East Side playhouses, with Miss Jacobson often designing the sets and doing the choreography.         Miss Jacobson starred on the long-running radio series ''My Mother and I'' in the 1940's. She made her Broadway debut in Neil Simon's 1962 ''Come Blow Your Horn,'' and appeared in the 1971 musical ''70, Girls, 70'' and in the 1980 film ''Hero at Large.''         In addition to her husband, Miss Jacobson is survived by a son, Bruce, of Manhattan.

        Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Feinberg was the author of nine novels including ''A World Full of Strangers,'' ''Fairytales,'' ''The Days of Winter,'' ''Portraits,'' ''Come Pour the Wine'' and ''Seasons of the Heart.'' Her books have been translated into 33 languages and sold more than 20 million copies.         Mrs. Feinberg was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a child of German immigrants, and was brought up in San Francisco from the age of 6 months. She dropped out of school in the sixth grade and continued her education by auditing classes at the University of California at Berkeley. Seeking a Sedentary Pursuit         At 18, she married Dr. Herman Feinberg, who was her grandmother's physician. Subsequently Mrs. Feinberg became an interior decorator for 25 years, until a serious illness forced her to take up a more sedentary activity.         ''I'd been writing all my life - little things for Hadassah, plays for the Sisterhood,'' she said in a 1980 interview. ''I never thought of myself as a writer, but the simplest thing seemed to be to put a piece of paper in the roller and start typing.''         Her first novel was not published until she was 55. It took her four years to write ''A World Full of Strangers,'' chronicling four generations in the life of a Jewish family in the United States.         The novel was rejected by four houses before it was published in 1975 by the Arbor House Publishing Company. It sold 20,000 hard-cover books, ''a very respectable figure for a first novel,'' said Donald I. Fine, her first publisher, who edited her first six novels. The book went on to sell nearly 2 million copies in paperback. Explanation of Success         Although her books were not received enthusiastically by reviewers, they were immensely successful. Gilbert Millstein, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said about ''A World Full of Strangers'': ''It is soap opera - in this case, Jewish soap opera - and the audience for soap opera, in print or on televsion, Jewish or not, runs into the millions.''         ''The Last Princess,'' which was her final book, was published last April and will be brought out in paperback next spring. ''We know of no other book she was working on,'' said a spokesman for G. P. Putnam's Sons, which published her last three novels, all of them best sellers. Her Common Theme         A common theme of the novels was the struggle of Jewish immigrants to make themselves at home in the United States while holding true to their traditions. ''I'm very interested in the perpetuation of Jewish life,'' she once said. ''My own family is very close. I suppose that's why I'm drawn to family sagas.''         Mrs. Feinberg's husband died in May 1986, and her daughter, Arlene, died in an automobile accident in 1985.         Mrs. Feinberg is survived by her father, Albert C. Freeman of Atherton, Calif.; two sisters, Ruth Sevier of San Francisco and Helen Dwane of Redwood City, Calif.; a son, Sheldon, of Danville, Calif.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

She was a member of Hadassah for 72 years, becoming a national secretary of the organization and serving as president from 1937 to 1939 and 1942 to 1947.         She is survived by her husband, Moses; a daughter, Naomi Cohen of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
        Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         As Lois W., she was revered as ''the first lady of Al-Anon,'' and as a living reminder of the beginnings five decades ago of the Alcoholics Anonymous self-help movement.         Al-Anon members help one another and themselves to deal with personal problems by speaking about them -''sharing their experience, strength and hope,'' as they like to say - at group meetings. They also help each other on a one-to-one basis, and they read the movement's many inspirational pamphlets and books. Thousands of Groups Formed         An executive on the staff of the Al-Anon Family Group headquarters in Manhattan, where Mrs. Wilson's death was announced yesterday, said 30,000 groups - including several thousand Alateen groups for the teen-age children of alcoholics - are in operation.         The executive, who in accordance with Al-Anon policy declined to give her name, said more than 20,000 of the groups were in the United States and Canada, with groups in about 100 other nations. She estimated worldwide membership of Al-Anon at about 500,000.         In the 1930's, Mrs. Wilson - a spirited, small woman with lively brown eyes - stuck by her alcoholic husband, William G. Wilson, who had become a self-described ''hanger-on in Wall Street.'' She hoped he would manage to stop drinking for good.         Mr. Wilson did, and in 1935 he became a co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. One of its groups flourished in the Wilsons' home, then an apartment at 182 Clinton Street in Brooklyn. Since those early days, Alcoholics Anonymous has grown to an international membership of more than 1.5 million. Known within that organization as Bill W., Mr. Wilson died in 1971. A Time of Discontent         After Alcoholics Anonymous was founded, Mrs. Wilson became discontented. ''It seemed I saw nothing of the man I had tried to help,'' she later recalled.         ''He was always with his A.A. cronies'' who helped him to resist alcohol, she said, adding that ''I guess I was jealous and resentful that these strangers had done for him what I could not do.''         A turning point for her came one day when, as she said, ''I threw my shoe at him as hard as I could.''         ''I was so ashamed of myself,'' she said, ''that I went out and walked around the block several times. I soon had to admit that I needed some therapy myself.''         Mrs. Wilson, who was not an alcoholic, began applying to herself the same self-help principles that her husband and his Alcoholics Anonymous friends were using.         ''I shared my experience with other relatives of alcoholics, and we began to hold informal meetings,'' she said. ''We did not discuss our alcoholic relatives, but tried to straighten out our own lives. This attitude became basic to Al-Anon.'' Two Separate Organizations         Though Al-Anon is in many ways patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous, the two organizations are organizationally separate. Both groups are self-supporting; they do not accept funds from nonmembers. Members of both groups are supposed to maintain anonymity in the news media - which is why Mrs. Wilson and her husband were widely known only by their first names.         Mrs. Wilson was said never to have voiced blanket condemnation of the drinking of alcoholic beverages, affirming that she opposed ''only the disease of alcoholism and the damage it does to a family.''         She was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of a physician. She graduated from the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn, worked in a Y.W.C.A. and taught school in Short Hills, N.J., before her marriage to Mr. Wilson in 1918. After her marriage she worked for a time as an occupational therapist, wrote magazine articles and worked as a Macy's sales clerk.         After Mrs. Wilson and other alcoholics' relatives began their meetings, similar self-help discussion groups for members of alcoholics' families were founded elsewhere in the United States during the 1940's. In 1951, Mrs. Wilson, along with a friend and Westchester County neighbor, Anne B., set up a central information center for these groups. The center was initially in her Westchester home. First Alateen Group         Not long afterward, the center moved into offices in Manhattan, and the movement took the name Al-Anon Family Groups. In 1957, the first Alateen self-help group was set up, in California, for young people with alcoholism in their families.         Mrs. Wilson remained active and prominent in Al-Anon into the 1980's, traveling on its behalf and appearing at and addressing Al-Anon gatherings. At the first international convention of Al-Anon, in 1985 in Montreal, an audience of 45,000 -members of Alcoholics Anonymous as well as Al-Anon - gave her a standing ovation.         Mrs. Wilson wrote an autobiography, ''Lois Remembers,'' first published in 1979.         There are no immediate survivors. Funeral arrangements have not yet been set.

Ruth Harris Bunche, a former teacher and the widow of Ralph J. Bunche, the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former Under Secretary General at the United Nations, died of pancreatic cancer yesterday at her home in Kew Gardens, Queens. She was 82 years old.         Mrs. Bunche was active in many civic and community organizations over the years. She served as a director on a number of boards, among them the New York City Youth Board, the Inwood House for Unwed Mothers, the Japan International Christian University and the advisory board of the Metropolitan Chapter of the United Nations Association of the United States of America. At her death, she was a board member of the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations, the Irving Berlin God Bless America Fund and the Play Schools Association, which honored her last year for 37 years of service.         Mrs. Bunche was a native of Montgomery, Ala., where her father had been a Republican national committeeman and an advocate of civil rights. She met her husband when she was a first-grade teacher at a school in Washington, where Mr. Bunche was a political science professor at Howard University. They were married in 1930; he died in 1971.         She is survived by a daughter, Joan, of Manhattan; a son, Ralph Jr., of London; a sister, Aileen Davis of Washington; a brother, Booker Harris of Hartford, and six grandchildren.         A service will be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home at 1076 Madison Avenue on Tuesday at 1 P.M.

        Miranda Reeves, a slave's daughter who was believed to be 113 years old, died Thursday at a convalescent home here.         Miranda Reeves, a slave's daughter who was believed to be 113 years old, died Thursday at a convalescent home here.         Her oldest grandddaughter, Ruby Fletcher, 57 years old, said her grandmother, a native of Camden, S.C., moved to Connecticut in the 1940's.         Mrs. Fletcher said survivors included two daughters, Cathron Harris and Thelma Ford, both of Colchester; 9 grandchildren; 39 great-grandchildren; 40 great-great-grandchildren and 1 great-great-great-grandchild.         Her exact age could never be officially verified. At her last birthday, Mary Ellen Klinck, State Commissioner on Aging, said that if she were indeed 113 she would be Connecticut's oldest resident.       
        Vet Boswell, the last surviving member of the popular and influential 1930's singing trio the Boswell Sisters, died Saturday. She was 77 years old and lived here.         Vet Boswell, the last surviving member of the popular and influential 1930's singing trio the Boswell Sisters, died Saturday. She was 77 years old and lived here.         Miss Boswell died in Peekskill Community Hospital, where she had been admitted with pneumonia, her daughter, Chica Minnerly, said.         Helvetia Boswell - she was known by her nickname - and her sisters Martha and Connee were born and brought up in New Orleans.         They gained fame in the late 1920's and early 30's for harmonies and arrangements that filtered jazz and blues into a style that was a precursor of swing and influenced such performers as Ella Fitzgerald, the Mills Brothers and the Andrews Sisters.         Among the trio's popular songs were ''Dinah,'' ''Yes Sir, That's My Baby,'' ''The Music Goes Round and Round'' and ''Top Hat.'' They appeared in three feature films and several shorts.         She retired from performing when the trio broke up. Martha died in 1958 and Connee, who had a successful solo career, died in 1976.         Vet Boswell is survived by her daughter, three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
        Jennie Lee, a Scottish coal miner's daughter who rose to became a Labor Party Member of Parliament, Minister of State for the Arts and a baroness, died Wednesday at her home in London, a friend, Lord Goodman, said Thursday. She was 84 years old.         Jennie Lee, a Scottish coal miner's daughter who rose to became a Labor Party Member of Parliament, Minister of State for the Arts and a baroness, died Wednesday at her home in London, a friend, Lord Goodman, said Thursday. She was 84 years old.         The cause of death was not immediately disclosed.         Baroness Lee of Asheridge, as she was known after being made a life peer in 1970, held a seat in Parliament for 27 years. She was a member of the Labor Party's national executive from 1958 to 1970 and served as party chairman in 1967 and 1968.         The present leader of the party, Neil Kinnock, on Thursday recalled her as ''a woman of brilliance and vision, a great socialist, who inspired so many and was loved by all who knew her warmth and passion for justice.''         Given special responsibility for the arts in 1965 by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, she played a crucial political role in starting the Open University, which provided higher education by correspondence, over radio and television and at evening classes to many students who had had no other university-level studies. Lesson for a Teacher         Her lifelong concern for the underprivileged was sharpened by her experience while teaching for two years in the late 1920's in a village near Lochgelly in Fifeshire, eastern Scotland.         ''I did not believe that there was any good reason why either the children or myself should come to terms with life as we found it in that bleak mining village,'' she wrote in her volume of memoirs ''This Great Journey.''         ''Most of the misery I saw around me in school, in the streets, and in private homes, had its roots in the poverty of the place,'' she said. ''I did not see how, within the four walls of a classroom, I could ever hope to change any of that.''         She ran successfully for Parliament and represented a Scottish district from 1929 until she lost the seat in 1931. She represented another district, near the industrial city of Birmingham in England, from 1945 until losing that seat in a general election in 1970. She then automatically acquired a seat in the House of Lords on being elevated to the peerage.         A New York Times editorial commented at the time: ''How Scotland's fiery Jennie would have scorned the robes of a baroness early in her Labor Party career!'' Married to Bevan         She was born Janet Lee on Nov. 3, 1904 in Lochgelly. Her father, James Lee, was active in the trade union movement. Her paternal grandfather, Michael Lee, won renown in the movement, rising to be a member of the Scottish Miners' Executive.         Lady Lee was married in 1934 to Aneurin Bevan, a prominent Labor Party figure who was known as Nye. A former coal miner, he was a elected to Parliament in 1929 and remained a Member of Parliament for 31 years, serving as Minister of Health from 1945 to 1951. He died in 1960.         After Jennie Lee was elected to Parliament from Staffordshire in 1945, and Mr. Bevan was re-elected to Parliament in the same elections, they became known as ''Britain's first man-and-wife parliamentary team.''         Lady Lee, who held degrees from the University of Edinburgh, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Cambridge University. Her books included ''My Life with Nye,'' published in 1980, in addition to ''This Great Journey,'' which was published in the United States in 1942 after appearing first in Britain.         Lady Lee and Mr. Bevan had no children, and she has no survivors.       
        Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Miss Graham, who also served as a war correspondent in Europe in World War II and who at various times had her own Hollywood-based radio and television shows, is probably best remembered for her love affair with F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose last unhappy years she described in her first book, ''Beloved Infidel,'' published in 1958.         That book concentrated on the Pygmalion and Galatea aspect of the relationship between the novelist and Miss Graham, in which he created a ''college of one'' for her, drawing up lists of books she read to complete ''the education of a woman,'' as her book was subtitled. 'The Very Best Portrait'         ''Beloved Infidel,'' which Miss Graham wrote in collaboration with Gerold Frank, became an international best seller, received critical approval for its warmth and authenticity, and was hailed by Edmund Wilson in a long review in The New Yorker as ''the very best portrait of Fitzgerald that has yet been put into print.''         Born into poverty in an East London slum, Miss Graham parlayed a native intelligence and her great good looks, under the guidance of several worldly and cultivated men, into a reputation as a bright, brittle and often witty sophisticate.         She labored under no illusions, however, and late in life characterized herself as ''a fascinating fake who pulled the wool over Hollywood's eyes.'' She was also not above turning her talent for abrasive criticism of ''the lightweight pinheads of Hollywood'' upon herself.         For example, in ''The Rest of the Story,'' published in 1964, she wrote: ''Sitting at my typewriter, banging out the items, I sometimes laugh as I stir my witch's brew, putting in the onions and the herbs to give indigestion to people I don't like or to those I think have slighted me, the great me. And it's true that I sometimes mistake my typewriter for my teeth, because the more I bite the more my column will be read.'' A Hard Childhood         Miss Graham's real name was Lily Shiel, which ''to this day horrifies me to a degree impossible to explain,'' she wrote in ''Beloved Infidel.'' When she was an infant, she said, her father died of tuberculosis, and her childhood was characterized by a string of Dickensian hardships. For six years she lived with her mother, a domestic, in a rented basement room, then wound up in an orphanage. As a young woman, she put in a brief stint as a domestic, which she hated, and then went to work in Gamage's department store as a toothbrush demonstrator. Miss Graham said she got the job because she was pretty and had a dazzling smile and perfect teeth, ''thanks to a sweets-deprived childhood in the orphanage.''         At Gamage's she met her first Pygmalion, Maj. John Graham Gillam, who employed her in the iron and steel company in which he was an executive, taught her table manners and coached her to free herself of her Cockney accent. After their marriage, she adopted the name of Sheilah Graham, studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and finally was hired as a chorus girl by C. B. Cochran, the British equivalent of Florenz Zeigfeld, who put her in a 1927 musical revue called ''One Dam Thing After Another.'' When the star fell ill, Miss Graham went on in her place, and, of course, was a smashing success, she said.         Cochran signed her to a contract for other shows and she soon began selling articles about show business to the penny press. She recognized that as a writer she possessed a quality of ''salable mediocrity,'' she said, and decided to carve out a career in journalism. At Home in Hollywood         In 1933, Miss Graham said, she moved to New York and for two years wrote for The New York Mirror and The Evening Journal. In 1935 she was offered North American Newspaper Alliance's syndicated Hollywood column, and she moved to Los Angeles. She divorced Major Gillam in 1937.  She felt at home in Hollywood, more so than she had in New York, she said, because ''Hollywood was notorious even in London for the ignorance of the people who made the films - no one could embarrass me with erudite conversation.''         It was in July 1937, at a party given for her by Robert Benchley to celebrate her engagement to the Marquess of Donegall, that she met Fitzgerald. It was love at first sight for both of them, she said. She broke off her angagement and entered into an affair with Fitzgerald that was to last more than three years, until Dec. 21, 1940, when he died in her arms.         The years with Fitzgerald were, for Miss Graham, both idyllic and harrowing. The famed novelist was in failing health, fighting an epic and losing battle with alcoholism. He looked upon himself as a burned-out case, and he was having trouble turning out movie scripts to pay for his daughter's education and his wife Zelda's mental asylum bills.         But they were devoted to one another and Miss Graham gave him not only her love and patience but also a measure of peace of mind. She served as the model for Kathleen, the heroine in ''The Last Tycoon,'' the Fitzgerald novel that was unfinished at his death.         ''I was never a mistress,'' Miss Graham said. ''I was a woman who loved Scott Fitzgerald for better or worse until he died.'' War Correspondent in England         After his death Miss Graham returned to England as a war correspondent. It was there that she met, and married in 1941, Trevor Cresswell Lawrence Westbrook, an executive of the company that manufactured the Spitfire fighter plane. Before the marriage ended in divorce in 1946, they had two children, Wendy and Robert. A brief third marriage, in 1953, to a man she identified only as ''an American of Polish ancestry with an unpronounceable name,'' also ended in divorce.         Miss Graham resumed her Hollywood column after the war and, to earn as much money as she could, also wrote for magazines and conducted a radio show and a television show, ''Hollywood Today,'' in the mid-1950's. By 1964 Time magazine could report that Miss Graham had ''deposed Hopper and Parsons as doyenne of the Hollywood columnists,'' appearing in 178 newspapers, compared to about 100 for Miss Hopper and 69 for Miss Parsons.         Miss Graham also produced several more books, three of them centering on Fitzgerald - ''The Real Scott Fitzgerald,'' ''The Rest of the Story'' and ''College of One.'' That volume, published in 1967, after Miss Graham found the handwritten Fitzgerald ''curriculum'' he created for her, listed his favorite books and musical works that he insisted she become familiar with. Other Graham books included ''The Garden of Allah,'' ''Confessions of a Gossip Columnist'' and the steamy autobiographical novel ''A State of Heat'' (1972). She also published ''Hollywood Revisited'' in 1985.         Miss Graham is survived by her daughter, Wendy Fairey, who is dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Brooklyn College; her son, Robert Westbrook, now living in Khania, Crete; and by three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in New York next month.       
        Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         The reports said Ms. Onassis had been staying with childhood friends at an exclusive country club outside the Argentine capital. Her father, Aristotle Onassis, laid the foundation of his self-made fortune in shipping, real estate and high finance in Argentina and was a dual citizen of that country and Greece.         Mr. Onassis died in 1975 in France and his daughter and only surviving child was left in charge of the Onassis Group, with assets then variously estimated at $500 million to $1 billion, most of it in shipping. Forbes magazine, citing a worldwide slump in that industry, reported in 1987 that the figure probably had shrunk to $250 million or less.         Mr. Onassis' two major shipping companies were Springfield Shipping of New York City and Olympic Maritime of Monte Carlo.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Onassis gave up her American citizenship. She learned about business and finance in the New York offices of her father, beginning as a 20-year-old secretary. After his death, she gradually strengthened her hold over the Onassis Group, although some questions remained in the late 1970's as to just how much control she exerted and how much she left to day-to-day managers.         One of the world's richest women, Miss Onassis was no stranger to personal misfortune. There was the death of her only brother, Alexander, in a private-plane crash in 1973. She herself went through four much-publicized marriages and divorces. Churchill and Callas         The social life on ''Ari'' Onassis' 325-foot yacht, named Christina, was legendary and included the likes of Winston Churchill and the soprano Maria Callas. In fact, Mr. Onassis was romantically linked with Miss Callas when his own marriage to the former Athina (Tina) Livanos, another shipping heiress, broke up in 1959.         Tina Onassis eventually was remarried to her former husband's arch rival, Stavros Niarchos. And Ari Onassis, in 1968, married Mrs. Kennedy, the widow of President John F. Kennedy, whom he first met in 1963.         Christina Onassis defied her father in 1971 by marrying Joseph Bolker, a millionaire home builder and real-estate man, A divorced father of four, he was 27 years her senior and the union broke up within months, apparently at the insistence of her father.         Her next marriage, strongly promoted by her father, took place shortly after his death. Her second husband was Alexander Andreadis, a Greek shipping and banking heir. It, too, lasted only 14 months.         Miss Onassis' third marriage, in Moscow in 1978 to Sergei Kauzov, a Soviet shipping agent, again made front-page headlines, as did her flight to Greece a few days later and their separation in 1979. Marries Frenchman         She married a French businessman, Thierry Roussel, in 1984 and had a daughter with him, Athina, the following January. They filed for divorce eight months later.         Ms. Onassis was said to have never felt close to her stepmother. Friends in Athens said Mr. Onassis was thinking of divorcing the former Mrs. Kennedy at the time of his death and had intended to limit a divorce settlement to $3 million rather than the $250,000 a year provided in his will.         The reports of a forthcoming divorce were denied by Christina, who in 1977 was said to have made a much more generous multi-million settlement in return for which Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis dropped all further claims against the estate.

        Mary K. Frank, a theatrical producer, died Sunday at her home in Grand View-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 77 years old.         Mary K. Frank, a theatrical producer, died Sunday at her home in Grand View-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 77 years old.         Mrs. Frank was active in New York theater for more than 30 years, producing such plays as Robert Anderson's ''Tea and Sympathy,'' which ran from 1953 to 1955 and featured Deborah Kerr's Broadway debut; ''Sabrina Fair'' (1953); ''One More River'' (1960), and ''K2,'' Patrick Meyers's 1983 drama about two mountain climbers in the Himalayas. She also produced several works by Alan Paton, including ''Too Late the Phalarope'' (1956) and ''Sponono'' (1964).         Mrs. Frank was president of the New Dramatists Committee, a group supporting new playwrights, from 1960 to 1969. She bought a ranch near Old Snowmass, Colo., in the mid-1960's, and devoted many years to raising Thoroughbred race horses.         Mrs. Frank is survived by a daughter, Maud E. Frank of Bellerose, L.I., and a grandchild.       
        Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         The widow of Morris Cafritz, a wealthy real estate entrepreneur, Mrs. Cafritz glittered on the capital's social scene in the 1950's and 1960's. As president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, she oversaw annual contributions of about $6 million to local community and arts organizations.         Mrs. Cafritz combined wealth, effervescence and numerous contacts in business and government into a potent concoction of lavish entertainments that, in Washington, are as much a part of political life as sessions of Congress.         Initially, she competed with Pearl Mesta as Washington's premier hostess, the two vying to snare the most prominent guests. After Mrs. Mesta was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949, Mrs. Cafritz undertook her campaign in earnest. A four-page account in Life magazine depicted her favorite summer soiree - one or two hundred guests, in evening dress, gathered for mint juleps and steaks on the barbecue in her backyard overlooking all of Washington.         She gave dozens of parties every year in her 57-room, white brick mansion on a seven-acre hilltop that included a basement night club with illuminated dance floor, a gym and an Olympic-size swimming pool. Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, Ambassadors, movie stars, Supreme Court Justices and heads of state played happily there over four administrations.         Born in Budapest, Mrs. Cafritz was the daughter of a Hungarian father and an American mother. She was a graduate of the University of Budapest. In the 1920's the family moved to Washington.         She met her husband in 1928 and they were married the next year. He died in 1964. In the early 1970's Mrs. Cafritz was forced to withdraw from the social scene because of poor health.         Surviving are three sons, Calvin, Carter and Conrad, all of Washington, and 13 grandchildren.

        Melanie Kahane, an interior designer whose bold use of color created a new look for homes, died of lung cancer Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old. Miss Kahane, the widow of Ben Grauer, a broadcaster for NBC News, caught the public's eye in 1946, when she designed one of the first colored kitchen appliances, a shiny red stove.         Melanie Kahane, an interior designer whose bold use of color created a new look for homes, died of lung cancer Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old. Miss Kahane, the widow of Ben Grauer, a broadcaster for NBC News, caught the public's eye in 1946, when she designed one of the first colored kitchen appliances, a shiny red stove. In 1949, her design for a black-and-white French provincial bedroom accented with pumpkin-colored furniture became one of the most photographed interiors in magazines and books.         ''She was a great inspiration when I was a student in the 50's,'' said Mario Buatta, an interior designer in Manhattan. ''I remember rooms in pink and orange. It was very distinctive. Her work had guts.''         Miss Kahane (pronounced ka-HAIN) was born in Manhattan. She graduated from the Parsons School of Design and worked as an illustrator of women's clothing. In 1939, she went into business as an interior designer. 'The Ability to Visualize'         She designed light bulbs, hotels, studio apartments and theaters. A client, Anne Windfohr Marion, is the second generation of her family to be a client. ''She did mother's house when I was 15,'' said Mrs. Marion, whose husband, John, is chairman of Sotheby's North America. ''She was very easy to work with, a vital, energetic person.''         Miss Kahane had the ability to charm clients while sticking firmly to her finely honed esthetic of glamour and tasteful pizzazz. ''The decorator has the ability to visualize a finished room before it is begun,'' she said, ''and the strength of character not to deviate from a plan, no matter what the opinion of loving friends and relatives.''         After she married, Miss Kahane transformed her dining room into a library for Mr. Grauer's book collection. Then she moved the dining table back in, creating another much-photographed interior. The couple appeared together on an NBC Radio program, ''Decorating Wavelengths,'' which offered news and advice.         Miss Kahane produced a television documentary on contemporary Scandinavian design. She was on the design committee for the United States Pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels. In 1959, Miss Kahane traveled to the Soviet Union for NBC to record women's views. Under the aegis of the State Department, she conducted symposiums on textiles in Southeast Asian countries. Book for Children         Miss Kahane was a fellow and former treasurer of the American Institute of Interior Designers, a former president of the Decorators Club and an honorary life member of the American Society of Interior Designers.         She wrote a book for children, ''There's a Decorator in Your Doll House,'' published by Atheneum in 1968. In 1985, she was inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame.         Miss Kahane had a wit that was often as sharp as her clothing. In an interview in which she revealed that much of the art in her home had been bought by her husband without consultation, she observed, ''When a man's wife is a decorator, he frequently gets the compulsion to assert himself.''         Her recipe for a happy marriage included two sinks in the bathroom. ''A great meeting place,'' she noted.         Surviving are her daughter, Joan Ebenstein Porter of Pipersville, Pa., and two grandchildren. A memorial will be held Jan. 19 at 10:30 A.M. at the David M. Schwartz Center at Parsons, 560 Seventh Avenue at 40th Street.
