        Pauline Frederick, a longtime radio and television news analyst of world affairs, died of a heart attack on Wednesday at Lake Forest (Ill.) Hospital while visiting relatives. She was 84 years old and lived in Sarasota, Fla.         Pauline Frederick, a longtime radio and television news analyst of world affairs, died of a heart attack on Wednesday at Lake Forest (Ill.) Hospital while visiting relatives. She was 84 years old and lived in Sarasota, Fla.         Miss Frederick achieved eminence when her field was virtually closed to women. She was NBC's correspondent at the United Nations for 21 years, and earlier covered it for ABC. After retiring from NBC in 1974, she commented on foreign affairs for National Public Radio.         At all three networks, Miss Frederick had her own news programs, and she reported on political conventions, the United Nations and world affairs.         She covered the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals, conferences of the Big Four foreign ministers in New York and Paris, and China's entrance into the United Nations. She also reported on the Korean War, wars in the Middle East, efforts by the United Nations to restore peace in the Congo and on the Cuban missile affair.         'I Think News Is News'         Early in her career, Miss Frederick was assigned to cover what were regarded as women's stories.         ''I never believed there was such a thing as 'women's news,' '' she said in 1956. ''I think news is news; that's all. One of my first assignments was covering a forum for women on the topic 'How to Get a Husband.' I don't think I learned anything from it, and I don't think the audience did either.''         Soon afterward, though, came a turning point. In an emergency, she was asked to broadcast a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in New York, and afterward specialized in international affairs and politics. In 1951, ABC's biography of Miss Frederick noted that she ''holds the unique distinction of being the only woman network news analyst and diplomatic correspondent in American radio.''         Miss Frederick was born in Gallitzin, Pa., and grew up in Harrisburg, where she reported for several newspapers while still in high school. She considered law as a career before deciding to pursue journalism.         She majored in political science at American Unversity in Washington, where she received a master's degree in international law.         Despite her opinions on so-called women's news, she hit upon an effective way, given the times, to break into journalism: interviewing the wives of diplomats in Washington. She sold the articles to The Washington Star.         Writing and Radio Interviews         Miss Frederick wrote for the United States Daily, a predecessor of U.S. News and World Report, covering the State, War and Navy Departments. Then she wrote for the North American Newspaper Alliance, also doing occasional radio interviews for NBC before becoming a war correspondent for the newspaper alliance in 1945.         Miss Frederick made her first network broadcast from Washington in 1939, her first overseas broadcast from China in 1945, and her first network television broadcast from the national political conventions in Philadelphia in 1948.         In 1976, she became the first woman to moderate a Presidential debate, between Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter.         She was also the first woman to be elected president of the United Nations Correspondents Association. Her many honors included a Paul White Award from the Radio-Television News Directors' Association in 1980 and a George Foster Peabody Award in 1954. In 1975, she was named to the Hall of Fame of Sigma Delta Chi, the journalists' society. She received honorary doctorate degrees in journalism, law and the humanities from 23 colleges and universities.         Miss Frederick was married to Charles Robbins, a former reporter and managing editor at The Wall Street Journal, who died in August. There are no immediate survivors.

She was 97 years old.         Marguerite Stitt Church, an Illinois Republican who was a member of the House of Representatives from 1950 to 1962, died in her sleep on Saturday at her home in Evanston, Ill. She was 97 years old.         In 1950, Mrs. Church won the 13th Congressional seat formerly held by her husband, Ralph E. Church, a lawyer, who died in March of that year. In his 14 years in the House, she was closely associated with him in political campaigns and in legislative programs.         In her 12 years in Congress, Mrs. Church introduced measures to carry out recommendations of the Hoover Commissions for efficiency and economy in Government.         She was a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Government Operations Committee. In 1959, as the ranking Republican member of a subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy, she traveled more than 40,000 miles in 17 countries.         She sponsored legislation, later enacted, to prohibit transporting fireworks into any state where they are illegal.         Marguerite Stitt Church was a native New Yorker who graduated from Wellesley College in 1914, Phi Beta Kappa. She received an M.A. in political science from Columbia University in 1917.         In 1918, she married Mr. Church and moved to Evanston, where she was active in welfare and social service organizations.         Mrs. Church was a trustee of the National College of Education, a member of the American Association of University Women and former president of the National Alumnae Association of Wellesley College.         She is survived by a daughter, Marjory Barnum of Northfield, Ill,; two sons, Ralph E. Jr. of Vero Beach, Fla., and William of Chicago; nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
        Brenda Lansdown, a retired professor of education who introduced new teaching methods in China, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 86 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass. The cause of death was pneumonia, said Harriet Harvey, a friend.         Brenda Lansdown, a retired professor of education who introduced new teaching methods in China, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 86 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass. The cause of death was pneumonia, said Harriet Harvey, a friend.         In the 1940's Ms. Lansdown taught at the Dalton School and the City and Country School in Manhattan, where she developed a ''hands-on'' method of teaching science to elementary and high school students, known as the investigative colloquium method. She later became a professor of education at Brooklyn College and also taught at Hunter College and the Harvard Graduate School of Education.         In 1974, at the age of 70, she began the study of Mandarin, and in 1979 was invited to Peking Normal University to introduce her teaching method to China. The method differs sharply from traditionial Chinese pedagogy, in which rote memorization is emphasized over creative thinking and problem solving.         Translated Into Chinese         Her book, ''Teaching Elementary Science Through Investigation and Colloquium,'' first published in 1971, was translated into Chinese, and more than 30,000 copies have been distributed to educators in China. Videotapes of her demonstration classes have been beamed by satellite to schools in the provinces.         In the last six years Ms. Lansdown raised funds in the United States for an experimental work-study cooperative school in a remote area of China that uses hands-on principles to teach Chinese farmers animal husbandry, agriculture and forestry.         Ms. Lansdown, a native of London, attended St. Paul's School there and graduated from Lausanne University in Switzerland.         She is survived by a brother, Merton, of Dorset, England.       
        Dorothea Bennett, a geneticist and educator known for her work in early mammalian development, died Thursday at the M. D. Anderson Hospital in Houston. She was 60 years old and lived in Austin, Tex.         Dorothea Bennett, a geneticist and educator known for her work in early mammalian development, died Thursday at the M. D. Anderson Hospital in Houston. She was 60 years old and lived in Austin, Tex.         Dr. Bennett died of lymphoma, a colleague at the University of Texas, Dr. Karen Artzt, said.         Dr. Bennett was the Alfred W. Roark Centennial Professor at the university, a post she resigned shortly before her death. Her early scientific contributions were made in mammalian embryology in association with L. D. Dunn, a noted geneticist.         Between 1962 and 1976 she achieved international recognition for her research in the genetics of early mammalian development and the first definition of mammalian sperm surface structures, which were thought to control sperm development and fertilization.         In 1976 she joined the staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in Manhattan, where she did research and taught at the doctoral level. In 1986 she moved to the University of Texas, where she became chairman of the zoology department.         Dr. Bennett served on several peer review committees for the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation in Washington.         She was born on Oahu, Hawaii, and graduated from Barnard College. She received a doctorate from Columbia University.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the Mayor of Princeton and a member of one of the nation's best-known political families, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 51 years old.         Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the Mayor of Princeton and a member of one of the nation's best-known political families, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 51 years old.         Mrs. Sigmund first learned that she had cancer in 1982, when a melanoma was found behind her left eye. The eye was removed and she continued with her political career.         But last year, after Mrs. Sigmund unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey, doctors found that the cancer had spread. Mrs. Sigmund had finished second in the primary to Representative Jim Florio, who went on to win the general election.         Born in New Orleans         Politics and public service were a way of life for Barbara Boggs Sigmund. She was born on May 27, 1939, in New Orleans about the time that her father, Hale Boggs, was beginning his first term as a Democratic Congressman.         In 1972, the plane carrying her father, then the House majority leader, was lost over Alaska, and her mother, Corinne Lindy Claiborne Boggs, succeeded him in Congress.         Mrs. Sigmund's mother's family, the Claibornes, traced its roots to colonial Jamestown in Virginia and is said to have included more members of Congress than any other American family.         Politics 'All Around Us'         ''Nobody speechified about it,'' Mrs. Sigmund once said about the family's deep interest in politics. ''It was all around us.''         Her brother, Thomas Hale Boggs, is a prominent lawyer in Washington, and her sister, Cokie Roberts of Bethesda, Md., is a correspondent for National Public Radio and for ABC News on television and radio.         Mrs. Sigmund was a graduate of Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y. She married Paul E. Sigmund, a professor of political science at Princeton, in 1964. She became a Latin teacher at the Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart in Princeton. After the birth of the couple's three sons, she returned to the school to teach religion and government.         In 1974, she left Stuart to join the staff of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University.         After serving as a member of the Princeton Borough Council, she was elected in 1976 to the Mercer County Board of Freeholders. She was president of the board in 1979 and 1980.         In 1982, she decided to run for Congress, hoping she could join her mother on Capitol Hill. But at the last minute she changed her mind and ran instead for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, finishing fourth in a field of 10 candidates. It was during the 1982 campaign that she lost her eye to cancer and surprised everyone by showing up at a fund-raising event hours after checking out of the hospital. She was wearing an eye patch covered with the words ''Vote Sigmund.''         'Subject to the Fates'         After her defeat in the Senate primary, she was elected mayor of Princeton in 1983. ''There's no way to plan a political life,'' she said at the time. ''It's all subject to the fates. I enjoy practicing the craft of government and I think it can be done from the local level up, as well as the other way.''         She brought a ready wit and seemingly boundless energy to the job of Mayor and attacked the problems of providing affordable housing and managing development. She loved to point out that Princeton's image as a wealthy town was misleading. ''It has been a town of mixed-income groups and races for centuries,'' she said.         Once, she complained wryly that most of the town's newer residents were executives in the high-tech industries that were moving to Princeton and surrounding areas. ''We want a certain amount,'' she said, ''but not so much as to destroy the town.''         Writing Poetry         After Mrs. Sigmund was found to have a recurrence of cancer last year, she began chemotherapy treatments but continued to devote as much energy as she could to the duties of her office and her favorite hobby, writing poetry.         Her mother announced in July that she would not run for re-election to Congress. She did not say so at the time, but close associates said she wanted more time to spend with her daughter.         Besides her husband, her mother, her brother and her sister, Mrs. Sigmund is survived by three sons, Paul Jr., of Ann Arbor, Mich., David, of Detroit, and Stephen, of New Orleans.         A funeral service will be held on Saturday at 5:30 P.M. in the Princeton University Chapel.       
         Mary Kenny Landers, professor emeritus of mathematics at Hunter College, died on Sunday at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. She was 85 years old and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         She died of cancer of the colon, said her son-in-law, John Savage.         Professor Landers taught at Hunter for almost 50 years, retiring in 1975. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the New York Academy of Sciences.         An early advocate of academic collective bargaining, she was secretary of the Legislative Conference, an organization representing the professional staff at the City University of New York, from 1959 to 1972. At that time, the conference merged with theUnited Federation of College Teachers to form the Professional Staff Congress.

         Toni Greenberg, a philanthropist and arts administrator, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Greenberg was president of New York Pro Musica and was the widow of Noah Greenberg, founder and musical director of the early-music ensemble, who died in 1966. She served as assistant to the president of the Mannes College of Music from 1966 to 1970 and was acting director of the New York University Institute for the Humanities in the late 1970's.         She was born in Danzig, then a free city on the Baltic and now Gdansk, Poland, and received a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's degree in library science from Columbia.         Long interested in the study of Judaism, she made gifts for that purpose to several institutions, including Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which she was a governor; the New York Public Library, Yale and Skidmore College, where she was a trustee.         She is survived by two daughters, Anne Donovan of London and Jane Ernst of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and four grandsons.
