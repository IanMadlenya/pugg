        Helen Steele Reece, founder and director of the Reece School, a private elementary school for children with emotional and learning disabilities, died in her sleep on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 99 years old.         Helen Steele Reece, founder and director of the Reece School, a private elementary school for children with emotional and learning disabilities, died in her sleep on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 99 years old.         She founded the school in 1948 in a brownstone at 180 East 93d Street, using small classes with more teachers than usual to create a supportive setting. The school was also a training center for teachers in the field.         Mrs. Reece, a native of Hillsboro, Ohio, graduated from the Teachers College of Columbia University. She began as a teacher at the City & Country School in Manhattan, later becoming director of Rosemary Hall, a private school in Greenwich, Conn. She was a former director of the Downtown Community School in Manhattan.         There are no immediate survivors.         Correction:  January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Thursday about the founder of the Reece School in Manhattan, a private school for children with emotional and learning disabilities, misidentified her. She was Ellen Steele Reece.

        Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         The star's death was announced by Paul Mills, a longtime friend and film producer, who said she had been ill for some time, particularly with respiratory problems, and had a stroke more than three years ago.         The actress had lived quietly in London for more than 30 year after being hounded for decades by photographers and reporters who publicized her marriages to Mickey Rooney, the band leader Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra and her flamboyant escapades with matadors, international playboys and writers.         Working on Her Memoirs         Miss Gardner, who had been completing her memoirs, said in a recent interview, ''If you don't tell your side, the self-appointed biographers step in, adding to the abysmal lies.''         The actress, whose green eyes, chestnut hair, high cheekbones and sensual lips made her eminently photogenic, was known for femme fatale portrayals.         She brought a tigresslike seductiveness and a husky-voiced irreverence to roles as worldly, devil-may-care women, becoming adept at playing exotic vamps and free-spirited protagonists, as in films of such Ernest Hemingway stories as ''The Killers'' (1946), ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' (1952) and ''The Sun Also Rises'' (1957). In the loosely autobiographical ''Barefoot Contessa'' (1954), she played a fiery dancer who becomes a movie star.         Praise for Later Roles         She portrayed torch singers in ''The Hucksters'' (1947) and ''Show Boat'' (1951); an irrepressible playgirl in ''Mogambo'' (a 1953 role for which she won an Academy Award nomination); a tormented Anglo-Indian in ''Bhowani Junction'' (1956); a thoughtful cosmopolitan in ''On the Beach'' (1959), and a blowsy innkeeper in the film of Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' (1964).         Although she was mainly decorative in most of her early roles and many reviewers said her acting range was narrow, she won wide praise for many later performances. Nonetheless, she consistently denigrated her talent, remarking to a 1985 interviewer: ''Listen, honey, I was never really an actress. None of us kids who came from M-G-M were. We were just good to look at.''         Poverty in Childhood         Ava Lavinia Gardner was born on Dec. 24, 1922, in Grabton, a poor community outside Smithfield, N.C., to Jonas Bailey Gardner, a tobacco and cotton farmer, and Mary Elizabeth Gardner. Her father died when she was 16, and her mother then managed a boardinghouse.         Her childhood was marked by poverty and a wardrobe so meager it prompted ridicule from schoolmates. She took commercial courses in high school, and an older brother paid her tuition so she could continue secretarial studies for a year at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson, N.C.         At 18, she visited her eldest sister, Beatrice, in New York City, on a journey that transformed her life. Her brother-in-law, Larry Tarr, a commercial photographer, took a portfolio of pictures of her and sent them to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She was given a screen test in New York that was made without sound because of her heavy Southern drawl. The 1941 test won her a seven-year M-G-M contract and intensive diction lessons as well as a starlet's standard classes in acting, calisthenics, makeup and fashion.         Her next five years were notable for tiny roles in a score of mostly forgettable movies, a blizzard of publicity pictures - and two brief marriages, to Mickey Rooney and Artie Shaw. Each marriage ended in separation after less than a year and finally in divorce.         The 69-year-old Mr. Rooney, upon learning of her death, said yesterday, ''My heart is broken with the loss of my first love.''         Stardom at 24         Miss Gardner later attributed the brevity of the first marriage to the couple's youth and to other people's domination of their lives. A press agent invariably accompanied them, even on their honeymoon. Of the second marriage, Miss Gardner said, Mr. Shaw insisted she read scores of books and insulted her intelligence in public.         Despite the personal setbacks, Miss Gardner won stardom at the age of 24 as a gun moll who betrays her lover (Burt Lancaster in his film debut) in ''The Killers.'' Other early starring roles were in a musical, ''One Touch of Venus'' (1948); a melodrama, ''The Great Sinner'' (1949), and a fantasy, ''Pandora and the Flying Dutchman'' (1951).         Miss Gardner's third marriage, to Frank Sinatra in 1951, was one of the most publicized Hollywood unions of the time. The couple had bitter public quarrels and separated in 1953 but tried a series of brief cross-country, trans-Atlantic reconciliations. They were finally divorced in 1957.         In a 1986 book, ''His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra,'' Kitty Kelley attributed the following quotation to the actress:         ''You start with love, or what you think is love, and then comes the work. I guess you have to be mature and grown up to know how to work at it. But I was the youngest of seven kids and was always treated like the baby, and I liked it and played the baby. Now I'm having a helluva time growing up.''         On TV as Nero's Mother         In 1958 Miss Gardner left M-G-M and became an independent actress, earning up to $400,000 a movie, most of them made in Europe. Her films included ''55 Days at Peking'' (1963), ''Seven Days in May'' (1964), ''Mayerling'' (1969), ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean'' (1972), ''The Blue Bird'' (1976) and a handful of disaster epics.         She did not appear on television until 1985, portraying Agrippina, Nero's scheming mother, in ''A.D.,'' a lavish mini-series about the first Christian century, and reviewers hailed her as still very much a star. Asked about her reluctance to accept television roles, she replied: ''Television is a lovely thing for people of my age to watch, but it's for young people to make. The kids were very nice to me.''         In the 1950's, the actress was deeply in love with Spain, bullfighting and, reportedly, a succession of bullfighters.         Her celebrated candor made her friends and enemies. When she arrived in Australia to make ''On the Beach,'' she enraged many people by remarking, ''I'm here to make a film about the end of the world, and this sure is the place for it.''         Sympathetic interviewers described her as an outgoing, earthy woman who had a lively sense of humor, particularly about herself, and deep family loyalty. Looking ahead to retirement, Miss Gardner once remarked: ''When I'm old and gray, I want to have a house by the sea. And paint. With a lot of wonderful chums, good music and booze around. And a damn good kitchen to cook in.''         Survivors include two sisters, Beatrice, of Hollywood, and Myra, of Smithfield, N.C., and nieces and nephews.         At her wish, she is to be buried beside her parents in North Carolina.         From a Moll to Guinevere         Ava Gardner appeared in about 60 movies, starting in 1942 and ending in 1981. These were the films for which she was most noted:         The Killers         The Hucksters         One Touch of Venus         Show Boat         Pandora and the Flying Dutchman         The Snows of Kilimanjaro         Mogambo         Knights of the Round Table         The Barefoot Contessa         Bhowani Junction         The Sun Also Rises         The Naked Maja         On the Beach         The Night of the Iguana         The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean         The Cassandra Crossing         The Kidnapping of the President       
        Madge Bellamy, an actress who starred in silent films in the 1920's, died on Wednesday at San Antonio Community Hospital in Upland, Calif. She was 90 years old and lived in Ontario, Calif.         Madge Bellamy, an actress who starred in silent films in the 1920's, died on Wednesday at San Antonio Community Hospital in Upland, Calif. She was 90 years old and lived in Ontario, Calif.         In the years between ''Hail the Woman,'' released in 1922, and ''The Daring Young Man'' in 1935, Miss Bellamy made 26 films. She was considered the Fox studio's answer to Clara Bow and Colleen Moore, her contemporaries at other studios.         Grace Houghton, whose Vestal Press of Vestal, N.Y., is to publish Ms. Bellamy's autobiography, ''Darling of the Twenties,'' next month, said that the actress thought her best film was the 1928 adaptation of an Edna Ferber story, ''Mother Knows Best.''         Ms. Bellamy's film career ended in the 1930's. ''I got too big for my britches,'' she said. ''I wanted too much money and when it was not forthcoming, I quit.''       
        Sister R. Mildred Barker, the spiritual leader of Maine's Shaker community, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 92 years old.         Sister R. Mildred Barker, the spiritual leader of Maine's Shaker community, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 92 years old.         Her death leaves just eight people in the last active Maine community of Shakers, celibate Protestants who stress pacifism and the communal sharing of material goods.         In 1931 Sister Mildred was put in charge of the Shakers' jelly and jam industry and candy-making business. In 1960 she was chosen trustee of the community, overseeing business and financial matters. The community raises sheep and grows apples and herbs.         President Ronald Reagan recognized her in 1983 for her expertise in singing old Shaker songs, many of which were recorded on four albums.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Felicia Clark, an urban-planning consultant, died of complications from a stroke on Tuesday at her home in Boston. She was 58 years old and also had a house on Tuckernuck Island, Mass.         Felicia Clark, an urban-planning consultant, died of complications from a stroke on Tuesday at her home in Boston. She was 58 years old and also had a house on Tuckernuck Island, Mass.         Ms. Clark worked on planning in New York in the 1960's. She was planning director for community high schools and later coordinator of educational development for the state's Urban Development Corporation, planning schools and similar centers for Roosevelt Island and other sites. She was elected to Community School Board 2 in Manhattan and was on the State Republican Committee.         In 1975, Ms. Clark became principal consultant and planner to the Regional Plan Association for the Gateway National Recreational Area.         Ms. Clark was the wife of Todd Granville Lee, also an urban planner. They moved to Boston in 1977, where Ms. Clark formed the Community Facilities Planning Group. She directed the Downtown Boston Waterfront Project. At her death, she was also vice president and director of planning for Todd Lee/Clark/Rozas Associates Inc.         Also surviving are a daughter and three sons, Story Clark Resor of Jackson, Wyo., Joseph 3d, of Los Angeles, Christopher, of Manhattan, and Laurance, of Cambridge, Mass.; two sisters, Anne Witherby of Boston and Rosamund Bodman of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.

Veola Lederer, a former executive of a Manhattan leather boutique and a former museum vice president, died of a heart attack on Wednesday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., while spending the winter in Pompano Beach. She was 81 years old and lived in Stockbridge. Mass.  Mrs. Lederer was the widow of Ludwig G. Lederer. In World War II, while her husband taught celestial navigation to pilots in Mississippi, she managed his Fifth Avenue leather goods store, Lederer de Paris. The store was later sold. Mr. Lederer died in 1960.         Mrs. Lederer was a board member and president of Young Audiences Inc., which presents classical music programs for schoolchildren. She was also a volunteer with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.         In the 1970's and 1980's, she was a volunteer, a board member and vice president of Hancock Shaker Community, a nonprofit museum in Pittsfield, Mass.         She was a graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music and studied harp and voice for two years in Salzburg and Vienna.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Sulzberger nurtured and bridged the generations of the family that has controlled The Times since 1896, when her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it as a small and ailing property. She played an important role in selecting the succeeding publishers -her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.         From all of them, Mrs. Sulzberger gained a unique view of the great events and personalities of the 20th century and of the paper's growth in covering them. To all of them, she conveyed the traditions of The Times and its dedication to serious journalism, to good taste and to progressive values.         Mrs. Sulzberger also served the paper as a director and as a trustee for the stock left by her father. And she strove to preserve the family ties among her 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.         At her request, cremation and interment will be private. A public memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or to Mrs. Sulzberger's alma mater, Barnard College.         Besides cherishing the values of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger read the paper diligently and regularly, but only modestly offered the editors ideas and news tips. She also wrote droll letters to the editor on issues great and small, asking that they be thrown out if judged foolish, or published with only a pseudonym, usually the name of a dead relative or friend.         Devotion to the Parks         A woman of energy, social conscience and impish humor, Mrs. Sulzberger pursued a variety of other interests, notably those devoted to parks and the environment, to Barnard, education and libraries, and to the welfare of animals.         She once inspired a series of articles that demonstrated the public's low interest and competence in history, a series that won The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1944 and provoked curriculum changes in many states. She also encouraged the paper to develop its potential as a classroom aid to teachers, which helped to make it the most widely circulated daily newspaper in schools and colleges.         Mrs. Sulzberger's own history of her experiences, a largely anecdotal memoir as told to her granddaughter Susan W. Dryfoos, was privately printed for friends and family in 1979 and then published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1981 under the title ''Iphigene.''         In a foreword, the historian Barbara W. Tuchman said of Mrs. Sulzberger, ''She is high-class in every way a woman can function - in devotion to family, in strong social conscience, in elegance of person and winning ways that gain her ends, in alert intelligence and irreverent humor, in energy and unfailing curiosity, in friendship and a welcoming home.''         Quiet but Decided Influence         Throughout her life, Mrs. Sulzberger had a quiet but decided influence on The Times. Perhaps the first time was at the age of 13, when her father discovered that she was using her weekly allowance to buy newspapers that carried comics. Mr. Ochs relented in his own opposition and decided to publish a Timesian strip, called ''The Roosevelt Bears.'' It ran for only six months, in 1906; Iphigene pronounced it boring.         When her husband was publisher, Mrs. Sulzberger's influence on The Times went beyond encouraging wider news coverage, to advocating divergent editorial views. She disagreed with Mr. Sulzberger by siding with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War against the Franco forces, by favoring statehood for Israel to provide a home for displaced European Jews and by preferring Adlai E. Stevenson instead of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for President.         When The Times endorsed Eisenhower in 1952, Mrs. Sulzberger told her husband she would vote for the general ''out of love for you and loyalty to The Times.'' But in 1956 she deserted the newspaper's position and voted for Stevenson.         ''I felt I had discharged my obligation to the paper four years earlier,'' she explained in her memoirs.         Encouraged by her parents to be curious and undogmatic about the world around her, Mrs. Sulzberger cultivated a well-stocked mind. She read and traveled extensively all her life, from the time her parents took her with them on their first grand tour of Europe when she was 8 years old.         One of her most joyous trips was a three-week visit to China in 1973, an experience she considered a high point of her life. Her 81st birthday fell during her stay in Beijing, where her Chinese hosts insisted on giving a banquet in her honor. She was also received by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who expressed his regard for Mrs. Sulzberger by inviting her to dinner and by talking with her at length about China and world issues.         She was the matriarch of the family and, according to one of her children, ''the glue that held us all together.'' When she was nearing 80, she began spending several days annually with grandchildren at schools in the Boston area, an effort to understand the outlook and life style of young people.         Chess for Central Park         Although Mrs. Sulzberger's major interests were her family and The Times, she embraced a number of civic and educational institutions. In 1928 she joined the Park Association, a volunteer group devoted to improving the city's parks. She became its president in 1934 and held the office until 1950, when she was elected chairman. She gave up that post in 1957 but kept her active membership.         Two results of her work for the parks particularly pleased her: getting the financier Bernard M. Baruch to contribute a chess and checkers house to Central Park and helping to restore Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx.         In 1976 Mrs. Sulzberger received the annual award of the Parks Council - a citizens' group into which the Park Association had merged - for her continuing work on environmental issues. In particular the award cited a work-study program she had founded in Central Park several years earlier, which was duplicated in other parks.         Four years later Mrs. Sulzberger was named honorary chairman of the newly formed Central Park Conservancy, a group of private citizens who raise funds for Central Park. She also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Barnard College and the gold medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences for distinguished service to humanity.         At the Jewish Theological Seminary she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1968 for her work in public, philanthropic and educational activities.         Another of Mrs. Sulzberger's avocations involved the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Her zeal reflected the delight she took in gardening and in flowers. She was a keen supporter of the institution's program to train student gardeners in cooperation with nearby Christopher Columbus High School. The garden honored her in 1965 with its distinguished service award.         Mrs. Sulzberger was also active in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she backed programs to train young people in restoring furniture and paintings.         Educational opportunity for youth was the thread that bound together Mrs. Sulzberger's ''outside'' interests.         The chief example of this was Barnard College, on whose board she sat from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. Her happiest achievement in this work was gathering funds for a library. The building, called the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960. The alumnae citation in 1972 spoke of ''excellence and service, intelligence and old-fashioned hard work.''         Columbia University, at its 1951 commencement, gave Mrs. Sulzberger a Doctor of Laws degree, citing her as the ''distinguished daughter of a distinguished father'' and praising her civic involvement as well as her role at The Times.         In addition to her occupation with Barnard affairs, she served at various times as a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which gave her an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1973, and of the University of Chattanooga. She was on the committee for the Dictionary of American Biography and on the advisory committee for publication of the works of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University project.         Honor From a Black College         She was also on the boards of the Cedar Knolls School (where she had once worked) and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and on the board of managers of Inwood House, a home for unmarried mothers.         Mrs. Sulzberger had been a director of Yaddo, a colony for artists and writers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that inherited a block of Times stock. In addition, she was involved with the State Communities Aid Association, the National Urban League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the New York Girl Scout Council. The council at one time met at her home because it could not find a suitable interracial gathering place.         In January 1978, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Bishop College of Dallas, then the largest predominantly black private college in the Southwest, and was commended for having been the largest single private donor in the history of the United Negro College Fund. ''She has contributed more than $35,000 a year in the past decade,'' the citation said.         Later that year Mrs. Sulzberger, a prime mover in setting up a program that let high school students alternate classroom studies with store and business jobs, received an award from the New York City Board of Education; it cited her as ''an outstanding friend of cooperative education.''         Amid these activities she found time to be interested in polar explorations, an interest shared with her husband. One result was Adm. Richard E. Byrd's naming of a body of water Sulzberger Bay; it is in Antarctica, off Marie Byrd Land. Its cold blue surface reflects a mountain, Mount Iphigene.         A Rabbi's Granddaughter         Born on Sept. 19, 1892, Iphigene Bertha Ochs grew up as the only child of Adolph S. and Iphigenia Wise Ochs. Her father was then proprietor of The Chattanooga Times, a growing Tennessee newspaper. Her mother was the daughter of Isaac Mayer Wise, rabbi of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati and founder of American Reform Judaism.         Iphigene's classical name, often shortened by her family to Iffy or If, proved a boon. Anyone who met her could forever greet her by name. ''Who could ever forget a name like Iphigene?'' she once asked.         On Aug. 13, 1896, Mr. Ochs bought the faltering New York Times, and soon the family moved from Chattanooga to New York. The child was educated at home until she was 8, when she was sent to Dr. Sachs's School for Girls. Her schooling at home, which Mrs. Sulzberger later called ''rather haphazard,'' nonetheless gave her a good grounding in history and literature.         When she learned to read, she said, her parents supplied her with ''one-syllable history books on Rome and Greece and France and the United States,'' along with fiction. Her mother also took her regularly to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and to the theater.         Mr. Ochs introduced his daughter to other worlds - the pleasures of walking, the mysteries of the newspaper business and delight in the ideas of other people.         ''Unquestionably, the high point of my week was Sunday, when my father stayed home and took me to Central Park,'' Mrs. Sulzberger said of her girlhood. ''He was a great walker. I learned to enjoy it, too.''         These walks were for fun and education. One of their Sunday trips was to the cemetery in the tiny Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx. Mr. Ochs walked his daughter to the grave of the poet for whom the park was named and pointed to the tombstone inscription composed by Fitz-Greene Halleck for his friend in 1820:         Green be the turf above thee         Friend of my better days!         None knew thee but to love thee,         Nor named thee but to praise.         Mr. Ochs told Iphigene that he wanted the last two lines placed on his gravestone. The request was quite premature: Mr. Ochs lived until 1935. But his daughter then complied with the wish.         Mr. Ochs also took her to the newspaper office. ''What I remember best about The Times of those days was its composing room, where they were very nice and let me push buttons,'' she recalled much later. When she was older, she was often a guest at luncheons her father gave for figures in business, the professions or politics.         'Are You Sure of Your Facts?'         At home, Mr. Ochs was an indulgent yet perfectionist father. He strove to help his daughter buttress her opinions with facts. ''He always used to say to me: 'What is your authority? Where did you read it? Are you sure of your facts?' '' Mrs. Sulzberger recalled. Her father persuaded her to memorize a passage from Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography'' that described how Franklin had cultivated humility by avoiding dogmatic statements.         ''I think this helped me form the habit of qualifying my remarks; it's become almost second nature,'' she said in later years, ''and I've endeavored to hand this wisdom on to my children and grandchildren.''         Young Iphigene took to travel. Starting in 1900, she made trips every year with her parents, either to Europe or in the United States. These were usually planned learning experiences, adjuncts to school and college.         Her attendance at Dr. Sachs's School was followed by four years at the Benjamin-Dean School, from which, in 1910, she entered Barnard. ''I discovered that learning could be a joy,'' she recounted of her years on the Morningside Heights campus. ''I was absolutely happy.''         In her school years she worked in the Henry Street Settlement, the Jewish Big Sisters Program and the Cedar Knolls School for disturbed children, experiences that contributed to a lifelong social awareness.         At Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course in the School of Journalism at Columbia. But Mr. Ochs held that a newspaper office was no place for women, especially not for his daughter, of whom he felt protective.         Publisher Gets a Son-in-Law         At college she ''very casually'' met Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the son of a cotton merchant; later she was reintroduced to him by her cousin Julius Ochs Adler, with whom Mr. Sulzberger was in military training at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The couple fell in love during Mr. Sulzberger's visits to the Ochs home on Lake George, but Mr. Sulzberger was obliged to propose twice before he was accepted - the successful occasion taking place, as she recalled with a twinkle, ''on the grounds of the local lunatic asylum'' in Spartanburg, S.C. He was stationed nearby as an Army lieutenant.         They were married at her parents' home in New York on Nov. 17, 1917, while Mr. Sulzberger was on a 10-day leave. Although Mr. Ochs first had reservations about his daughter's choice, ''within a few years his devotion to Arthur became boundless,'' she said.         World War I ended just as Mr. Sulzberger was to be sent abroad. So the couple settled in New York, where Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times.         The early years of Mrs. Sulzberger's marriage were given to making a home and rearing her children - Marian, born in 1918; Ruth, in 1921; Judith, in 1923, and Arthur Ochs, who was born in 1926. With her family well started, she began to take an active role in education and philanthropy.         Offstage Figure at Paper         In 1935, after the death of her father, Mrs. Sulzberger became a trustee under his will along with her husband and her cousin Julius Ochs Adler; her husband was elected president and publisher of The Times.         As the publisher's wife, Mrs. Sulzberger shared her husband's concerns and problems but remained steadfastly an offstage figure in the operation of the paper.         Her memoirs note, though, that at least one news beat - a scoop - came about ''because I had made eyes at a handsome young man in journalism school'' back in 1912 at Columbia. The man was Hollington Tong, who eventually became China's Ambassador to the United States.         The beat, on Aug. 23, 1944, was an account by James Reston of secret decisions by four major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China - on the future structure of the United Nations, including the concept of veto power in the Security Council.         Years later Mrs. Sulzberger revealed that the documents had come from the Chinese delegation, and Mr. Reston confirmed that they had been provided by a young diplomat, Joseph Ku, as a result of Mrs. Sulzberger's friendship with Ambassador Tong.         During World War II, she became director of special events for The Times, working with the promotion department. In this job, she furthered programs to assist the war effort, civilian defense, conservation and the use of The Times in schools and colleges.         Among other things, Mrs. Sulzberger suggested supplements and booklets for students on the war and on world affairs. She instituted forums for young people, which became a weekly event broadcast by WQXR, the radio station of The Times, and were later carried on television. She was also a tireless hostess at lectures that staff members of The Times gave for teachers, and she had a hand in Musical Talent in Our Schools, a project aimed at stimulating student musicians.         After the war, Mrs. Sulzberger quietly phased herself out of her Times job. Her children began to marry and establish homes of their own. Grandchildren were born. This all drew on her sense of family.         At the same time, she wanted to devote more attention to domestic concerns, including gardening. Before 1949, the Sulzbergers had a country home, called Hillandale, in White Plains. They sold it and bought a house near Stamford, Conn., which they also named Hillandale.         A Change of Generations         In 1957, the process of shifting daily management of The Times to younger shoulders began. Mr. Sulzberger, who had been president and publisher for 22 years, turned his presidency over to Orvil E. Dryfoos, then 44, husband of the Sulzbergers' daughter Marian. A next step was taken in 1961, when Mr. Sulzberger gave the publisher's post to Mr. Dryfoos and became chairman. He kept that position until his death, on Dec. 11, 1968.         Enfeebled by a stroke in his last years, Mr. Sulzberger relied almost completely on his wife as his contact with the world.         Meanwhile, in the spring of 1963, after a long newspaper strike in New York, Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the youngest Sulzberger child and the only son, was named president and publisher.         Along with her son, Mrs. Sulzberger's three other children are now directors of the Times Company - Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.         Mrs. Sulzberger herself was a director of the Times Company from 1917 until 1973, when she became a director emeritus. She was among those who voted to alter the company structure fundamentally, granting limited voting rights to the Class A stock and listing it on the American Stock Exchange. At her death she was a trustee of the stock trust established by her father that exercised effective control of the enterprise.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Sulzberger continued to live mostly in New York, at 1115 Fifth Avenue, staying in touch with her growing family and carrying on community and educational pursuits. She still traveled, went to the theater, ballet and concerts, and spent weekends in Stamford.         In 1982, when she turned 90, there were a number of celebrations. One was given by Barnard to honor her many contributions. Another was held at the New York Botanical Garden, where 165 friends and relatives put on skits, sang songs and poured forth affection.         Barbara Tuchman, in the foreword to ''Iphigene,'' notes that Mrs. Sulzberger was appointed by her father to the board of The Times when she was in her 20's and had the longest connection of anyone with the paper.         ''Through her, the continuity of family control from father to husband to son-in-law to son has been maintained for over 60 years and, through her, it will be passed on to the next generation - her grandchildren,'' Mrs. Tuchman wrote.         ''Through Iphigene's steady companionship and interest in their lives, her influence makes itself felt and will endure at the paper after the source is gone.''

Geneva Mathiasen, former executive director of the National Council on Aging, died of heart failure on Tuesday at a nursing home in Suffern, N.Y. She was 91 years old and lived in Tuxedo, N.Y.         Mrs. Mathiasen was one of the delegates to the first White House Conference on the Aging in 1950. She was appointed executive secretary of the newly formed National Committee on the Aging, which was established to provide information and consultation services on the field of aging, with headquarters in New York City.         In 1960, with help from a Ford Foundation grant, the national committee became the independent National Council on the Aging, with Mrs. Mathiasen as its first executive director. She retired in 1969.         She then served a term as co-chairman of Gov. Hugh Carey's Task Force on Aging. Mrs. Mathiasen was also a board member of the Jewish Home and Hospital and a member of the Citzens' Committee on Aging for the Community Council of Greater New York.

        Anne Tonetti Gugler, a Broadway actress and dancer who was a founding resident of an enclave of actors and artists in Rockland County, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday at her home in Orangetown, N.Y. She was 87 years old.         Anne Tonetti Gugler, a Broadway actress and dancer who was a founding resident of an enclave of actors and artists in Rockland County, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday at her home in Orangetown, N.Y. She was 87 years old.         In her late teens, she took a leave from high school to dance with Isadora Duncan's troupe in Europe. In the 1920's, she had minor roles on Broadway in ''The Green Hat'' and ''Saturday's Children.''         She left acting to pursue a career in real estate and cultivate her native hamlet of Sneden's Landing in Orangetown, overlooking the Hudson River, as a community of artists, writers and actors. Mrs. Gugler was following in the steps of her mother, an artist, who acquired almost two dozen homes in the secluded hamlet around the turn of the century and sought out poets, actors and musicians as tenants.         Sneden's Landing eventually became a haven for artistic celebrities, including Noel Coward, Laurence Olivier, Ethel Barrymore, Katharine Cornell and E. B. White. Today, the actors Bill Murray and William Hurt own homes there, as does Mikhail Baryshnikov.         Mrs. Gugler's husband, the architect Eric Gugler, died in 1974. She is survived by a sister, Alexandra, of Santa Barbara, Calif.       
        Sister Thea Bowman, a nationally active black educator who with song, prayer and persistent exhortation urged the Roman Catholic Church to embrace the culture of African Americans, died of cancer on Friday at her home in Canton, Miss. She was 52 years old.         Sister Thea Bowman, a nationally active black educator who with song, prayer and persistent exhortation urged the Roman Catholic Church to embrace the culture of African Americans, died of cancer on Friday at her home in Canton, Miss. She was 52 years old.         Eight months ago, at a semiannual meeting of the nation's Catholic bishops in South Orange, N.J., Sister Thea, suffering from breast and bone cancer, brought the assembly to its feet with an address depicting the black experience in America. She then asked the prelates to cross arms, clasp hands and sing ''We Shall Overcome.''         ''You've got to move together to do that,'' she told them.         But the work of Sister Thea, a Canton native who was the granddaughter of a slave, was far more than symbolic.         She was director of the Office of Intercultural Affairs for the Diocese of Jackson, Miss., and served on the faculty of the Institute of Black Catholic Studies at Xavier University in New Orleans. Last year, Mary Lou Jennings of Stowe, Vt., and the Rev. Thomas F. X. Hoar of Winooski, Vt., established the Sister Thea Bowman Black Catholic Educational Foundation to provide financial support for black students at all educational levels.         ''She was an outstanding woman,'' said Bishop Joseph Houck of the Diocese of Jackson. ''She was proud of her heritage and totally dedicated to the vision of Jesus Christ for love and growth of all people.''         Sister Thea was to receive the Laetare Medal, the oldest and most prestigious award given to American Catholics, at the University of Notre Dame's commencement exercises on May 20. The award will be posthumously presented, the university said Friday.         Working and Praying Together         Much of the work of Sister Thea, the only black member of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, was done through music.         ''When I came into the Catholic Church in the 1940's,'' she said in an interview in 1987, ''we had to leave behind us the music that was an expression of the spirituality of our home, community and upbringing. People were teaching us uniformity.''         The uniformity began to break down in the early 1960's, she said, when the Second Vatican Council encouraged expressions of ethnic heritage. She recorded an album of 15 spirituals, ''Sister Thea: Songs of My People,'' in 1988.         ''There's a black church that transcends denominations,'' Sister Thea said in the 1987 interview. ''If we work together, play together, stand together, pray together, then we can create a new heaven.''         She is survived by three cousins, Barbara Barber, Anita Scott and Johnie Middleton, all of Jackson.

Sara Seegar, an actress who appeared on and off Broadway, in films and on television, died yesterday at St. Mary's Hospital in Langhorne, Pa. She was 76 years old and lived at Stone Meadows, Newtown, Pa., with her husband, the actor Ezra Stone, who said she died of a cerebral hemorrhage.         Miss Seegar made her Broadway debut in 1940 in ''Horse Fever,'' a farce that starred Mr. Stone and folded after three weeks. ''The show was a terrible flop,'' Mr. Stone said later. ''We looked good to each other by comparison.'' Miss Seegar said, ''Misery loves company.'' They were married two years later.         Her career began in London, where she appeared in 1935 in ''Three Men on a Horse.'' She also had roles in four British films including ''Dead Men Tell No Tales.'' All her British film roles were of American women; the British labor office at the time prohibited a foreigner playing a role that could be filled by a British citizen.         From the 1940's through the 1960's Miss Seegar appeared in American plays including ''At War With the Army'' with Gary Merrill, directed by Mr. Stone on Broadway in 1949, and Sheridan's ''School for Scandal'' with Patricia Neal in 1953 and ''Ernest in Love,'' a musical based on Oscar Wilde's ''The Importance of Being Earnest'' in 1960, both off Broadway.

In 1983 she and Mr. Stone produced and staged ''Sweet Land,'' a pageant celebrating the 300th anniversary of their Bucks County community that enlisted the talents of 300 of their neighbors.         Miss Seegar was born in Greentown, Ind., attended school in London and Paris, went to Hollywood High and graduated with honors in drama from Los Angeles Community College.         In addition to Mr. Stone, she is survived by their son Joseph, of Newtown; a daughter, Francine, of Wallingford, England; two sisters, Dorothy Hatch of Washington and Miriam Whelan of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.

        Marion Rosenwald Ascoli, a philanthropist who was a former chairwoman and president of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, died yesterday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 88 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.         Marion Rosenwald Ascoli, a philanthropist who was a former chairwoman and president of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, died yesterday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 88 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.         She died of arteriosclerotic heart disease, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Ascoli, a daughter of Julius Rosenwald, a Chicago clothier who was a chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Company, devoted most of her adult life to charitable causes, many of them involving child welfare. She was the widow of Dr. Max Ascoli, the editor and publisher of The Reporter magazine, who died in 1978.         Mrs. Ascoli's principal interest was promoting health services for children. She was active with the Citizens Committee for almost four decades and served as its president from 1960 to 1962 and chairwoman from 1962 to 1964, when she stepped down and became head of the committee's health section, a post she held until 1981.

Stern of Manhattan, and Peter M. Ascoli of Chicago; a brother, William Rosenwald of Manhattan; nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
        Bertha Lindsay, the last surviving eldress of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming, known as the Shaker Society, died Wednesday at her home at Shaker Village in Canterbury, N.H. She was 93 years old.         Bertha Lindsay, the last surviving eldress of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming, known as the Shaker Society, died Wednesday at her home at Shaker Village in Canterbury, N.H. She was 93 years old.         She apparently died of a stroke, said Dr. Scott Swank, director of the village.         Sister Ethel Hudson, who is 94, is now the last of a community of Shakers in Canterbury that once numbered 400 men, women and children. The community, founded in 1792, was a communal society of shared property; followers were devoted to celibacy, living simply and pacifism. The Shakers in Canterbury once owned about 4,000 acres, most of which is being preserved. About 690 acres remain, and efforts are under way to have that too remain free of development.         There is one other Shaker community in the country, in Sabbathday Lake, Me. It has four covenanted members and four others who follow the Shaker practices.         History of Sect         The Shakers, who included free-form and choreographed dance in their worship, were an offshoot of the Shaking Quakers from England. They are thought to have derived their name from a belief that shaking from religious fervor was a manifestation of inner spiritual experience.         Miss Lindsay came to Canterbury in 1905 as an orphan. She lost her sight when she was 90 years old and put her remaining energies into making audio recordings about the history of the movement. ''I want people to know we did have fun and plenty of it,'' she said in an interview.         She is survived by a niece.       
        Hortense Hirsch, a volunteer for social-welfare, educational and civic organizations and a trustee of Mount Sinai Medical Center for more than half a century, died on Tuesday at her suite in the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan. She was 103 years old. During a career as a volunteer that began in the early years of the century, she was active in many organizations, including the Welfare and Health Council, now the Community Council of Greater New York; the National Urban League and the American Red         Hortense Hirsch, a volunteer for social-welfare, educational and civic organizations and a trustee of Mount Sinai Medical Center for more than half a century, died on Tuesday at her suite in the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan. She was 103 years old. During a career as a volunteer that began in the early years of the century, she was active in many organizations, including the Welfare and Health Council, now the Community Council of Greater New York; the National Urban League and the American Red Cross.         On her 80th birthday in 1967, Mount Sinai was joined by the United Hospital Fund, the United Jewish Appeal, the New York Association for New Americans, the Play Schools Association, the New York City Y.W.C.A., the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the Smith College Club of New York - all of which Mrs. Hirsch served for long periods as an officer, director, trustee or founder -in paying special tribute to her.         She contributed money as well as her time, benefiting institutions like Smith College, from which she graduated in 1907 at the age of 19; Northwestern University Law School, from which her father, Levy Mayer, graduated, and Princeton, where she endowed scholarships in memory of her husband, Walter A. Hirsch, a lawyer, who died in 1938, and their son, Lawrence, who died in 1960.         'I Do What I Can'         Mrs. Hirsch also worked on behalf of many political candidates and frequently wrote to legislators on issues about which she or her organizations were concerned.         Seven years ago, when she was 96 years old and still active as a Mount Sinai trustee, a post she assumed in 1932, Mrs. Hirsch was asked why she had worked so long as a volunteer.         ''I never know how I'm going to feel tomorrow,'' she said. ''But I do what I can when I can. This work is still very important to me.''         She was born in Chicago and came to New York to stay in 1909, when she married Mr. Hirsch. She spoke French, Italian and German, and the couple traveled extensively around the world.         Throughout her life Mrs. Hirsch had a flair for the unconventional. As an undergraduate at Smith, she managed to have her own horse and buggy by persuading a farmer to board the animal and keep her secret from the college authorities.         Honored by Smith College         At Smith, she was a member of the executive committee for many years. In 1968, she was awarded the Smith College Medal, given to those who ''exemplify in their lives and service to their community or to the college the true purpose of liberal arts education.''         In 1940, two years after her husband's death and in the year in which both her daughter and her son left home to marry, Mrs. Hirsch took a suite at the Pierre for six months, to give herself time to decide where to live permanently. She never moved, bought her suite when the Pierre went cooperative and at her death was the Pierre's longest-term resident.         She is survived by her daughter, Carol Kridel of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.       
        Ruth Wittenberg, who led fights to preserve historic buildings in Greenwich Village, including the Jefferson Market Courthouse, died in her sleep on Monday at her home on West 10th Street, where she had lived for 65 years. She was 91 years old.         Ruth Wittenberg, who led fights to preserve historic buildings in Greenwich Village, including the Jefferson Market Courthouse, died in her sleep on Monday at her home on West 10th Street, where she had lived for 65 years. She was 91 years old.         Mrs. Wittenberg was a familiar figure at City Hall and in other forums where she pleaded the case for preservation and against what she and her neighbors considered invasive development. She was a major force in gaining designation of the Greenwich Village Historic District two decades ago.         ''I'm kind of a landmark myself,'' Mrs. Wittenberg said in 1977 when, at the age of 79, she was honored for her many civic campaigns. She served on what is now Community Board 2 for almost four decades, having been appointed in 1951 to its predecessor, the Community Council for the Greenwich Village area, by the Manhattan Borough President, Robert F. Wagner. For many years she was chairwoman of the board's landmarks committee.         Board Meetings in Hospital         She was active in board affairs until shortly before her death. A small, energetic woman, she broke a hip in 1975 in a fall while walking on the Avenue of the Americas. Board 2's landmark committee meetings were held in her hospital room until she recovered, and in the years after that, she attended Board of Estimate and Planning Commission sessions in a wheelchair.         Born into a politically active family, she said one of her earliest memories was sitting on the knee of Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist leader.         Mrs. Wittenberg was born in Brooklyn and attended Hunter College and Barnard before quitting to help support her family by working as a demographer for the Bell Telephone Company, predicting population trends for expansion of telephone service.         Jailed as a Suffragist         As a suffragist before women won the right to vote, she was twice jailed. She marched in 1965 in Selma, Ala., in a civil rights demonstration with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..         Not all her battles were victories. She led Village residents in an unsuccessful fight against New York University's plan to construct the 12-story-high Elmer A. Bobst Library on Washington Square South, which residents regarded as too bulky for the site.         Her most conspicuous victory was for demolition of the Women's House of Detention on Greenwich Avenue at Christopher Street and conversion of the site into a community garden, together with preservation of the adjacent Jefferson Market Courthouse, now a branch public library.         Mrs. Wittenberg's husband, Philip, to whom she was married in 1919, died three years ago. She is survived by a daughter, Susanna Berger of New Rochelle, N.Y.; a son, Jonathan, of Tuckahoe, N.Y., five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Jacqueline Schwartzman, a community leader in the Chelsea section of Manhattan for many years, died on Thursday at her home in Chelsea. She was 71 years old.         She had undergone exploratory surgery four weeks ago, but the cause of death is not known, said her husband, Dr. Isidore Schwartzman.         Mrs. Schwartzman, who was born in Chelsea, was an early member of the block association movement in New York City in the 1950's and was the first president of the West 22d Street Association. She was a founder and past president of the Chelsea Independent Democrats.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Leslie Blake and Cheryl Bulbach, both of Manhattan; two sons, Stephen Short of Manhattan and Dr. Wayne Blackmon of Washington, and two grandchildren.       
         Miriam M. Comer, a founder of two community agencies in Great Neck, L.I., died on Monday at a nursing home there. She was 86 years old.         Mrs. Comer, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, died of respiratory failure, her son, Charles, of Port Washington, L.I., said.         In the early 1950's, Mrs. Comer was a founder of what is now the United Community Fund of Great Neck and the United Neighborhood Activities Center, an after-school program for poor children that is no longer operating.         A widow, she is survived by a second son, Harry, of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; four daughters, Miriam Mayer of South Orange, N.J., Carolyn Comer of Port Washington, Marguerite Jansen of Appleton, Wis., and Janet Bryars of Papillion, Neb.; a brother, Robert Hoffman of Coconut Creek, Fla; 13 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.       
         Hortense W. Gabel, a former New York State Supreme Court justice who was a longtime advocate for housing and civil rights and whose career was shattered when she was accused in the Bess Myerson case, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         She died of heart failure, her daughter, Sukhreet, said.         Mrs. Gabel served on the Civil Court and State Supreme Court for 17 years. In December 1988 she was acquitted of charges that she had abused her powers by improperly reducing the alimony payments of Ms. Myerson's companion, Carl A. Capasso, in exchange for a job for her daughter in the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which Ms. Myerson headed.         Mrs. Gabel had a long and distinguished career in government before assuming the Civil Court bench in 1970. That career began after Mrs. Gabel, already active as a reform Democrat, attended a dinner party in 1948 given by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, the founder of the American Jewish Congress; discussion at the party centered on the formation of a group that would champion the cause of blacks discriminated against in housing.  Enforced Rent Laws         By the mid-1950's, as a director of the Committee on Discrimination in Housing, she was involved in trying to expose abuses in the urban renewal program in New York City and helped draft a report that was highly critical of Robert Moses, the builder who reshaped much of the city.         As head of New York City's Rent and Rehabilitation Administration, she dreamed of a slumless New York, and her enforcement of the rent-control laws uncovered overcharges and conspiracies, saving tenants millions of dollars. She also developed rehabilitation programs for sections of Harlem, the Lower East Side and Brooklyn.         Later, as a consultant to and vice president of the Center for Community Change, Mrs. Gabel helped develop housing programs in cities and states across the country.         In her several decades of public service, she served as an assistant New York City corporation counsel, general counsel and first deputy administrator of the New York State Temporary Housing Rent Commission and assistant to the mayor for housing and New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Commissioner, a position she held from 1962 to 1965. Mrs. Gabel was also a consultant to the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency and to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.         She served as an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1973 and as an acting Family Court judge in 1974. She was appointed to fill a vacancy on the State Supreme Court by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1975. She was known as a compassionate judge who supported civil rights and women's causes. In 1986, she was named judge of the year by the National Association of Women Judges, an organization she helped found in 1979.         The organization's president, Justice Christine Durham of the Utah Supreme Court, said in a 1987 interview that Justice Gabel was revered as "one of the grand dames of the New York legal community, who has been a mentor and supporter of women in the profession for decades."         Justice Gabel resigned in 1987 under the cloud of criminal and misconduct investigations that led to the Myerson indictments.         A jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan found Mrs. Gabel, Ms. Myerson and Mr. Capasso not guilty of charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery. The central issue in the case was whether Mrs. Gabel, who was the judge handling preliminary motions in Mr. Capasso's divorce case in 1983, had received a bribe from Ms. Myerson, then New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, in the form of a job for Sukhreet Gabel as a special assistant to Ms. Myerson.         The hiring, the prosecution said, was an inducement to reduce Mr. Capasso's weekly support payments to his wife to $500 from $1,500. Mrs. Gabel had been seeking a job for her daughter. Family Drama         The case was full of bizarre twists and personal dramas. The two-month trial was dominated by the nine days of testimony against her mother by Sukhreet Gabel, the prosecution's star witness, who also taped two telephone conversations with her mother without her knowledge and provided prosecutors with some of her mother's documents.         Mrs. Gabel and her husband, Dr. Milton Gabel, were portrayed during the trial as the protective parents of a troubled woman, and seemed torn between wanting to support her in her moment in the spotlight and hoping that her testimony would not sway the jury.         After the verdict, an exuberant Mrs. Gabel held hands with her daughter outside the courthouse and shouted, "Hooray, we won!"         "This is the best judicial experience I have ever had," she said.         Hortense Wittstein Gabel, known as Horty to her friends, was born Dec. 16, 1912, in the Bronx. She attended public schools in the city and graduated from Hunter College in 1934. Three years later she graduated from Columbia University Law School and worked in her father's law firm. She left in 1944 to marry Dr. Gabel, then an army dentist, and in the war years was a reporter at Fort Hood, Tex., before returning to New York.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Sybil Phillips. They both live in Manhattan. Dr. Gabel died in July.       
         Thelma Stevens, a social worker and retired head of the Women's Division of the United Methodist Church, died yesterday at Brooks Howell, a retirement home in Asheville, N.C. She was 88 years old.         She died of complications of a stroke, a spokeswoman for the church said.         As executive secretary of the church's Women's Division, Ms. Stevens was head of social relations work for Methodist women from 1940 to 1968. She was known in religious circles for her work for social justice, international peace and women's rights.         She was a graduate of Scarritt College and headed the Bethlehem Center, a community center for blacks in Augusta, Ga., from 1928 to 1939. In 1951, she was instrumental in having the Women's Division press for the publication of "States' Laws on Race and Color," a compilation of racial laws.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Clare Rostan Appel, founder with her husband of the Appel Farm Arts and Music Center near Elmer, N.J., died on Dec. 15 at her home on the farm. She was 66 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband, Albert D. Appel.         The youth summer arts and farming camp the Appels founded in 1960 has evolved into a year-round cultural center. In addition to the summer camp, the nonprofit center in southern New Jersey offers extensive community and professional concert series and brings music and other cultural events to audiences throughout the state.         Mrs. Appel was born in Limburg, Germany. Her father owned a textile and clothing factory that was taken over by the Nazis in 1938. Mrs. Appel came to the United States with her parents and older brother in 1940, first to New York City and a month later to a poultry farm in Vineland, New Jersey. She attended Glassboro College in N.J., where she earned a bachelor's degree in education in 1946.         The Appels were married in 1947.They raised pigs, cattle and chickens and cultivated corn and small grains on Mr. Appel's 176-acre farm just outside Elmer. But their love for music -- he played violin, viola and cello, she played the piano -- and a desire to foster creativity eventually led them to use the farm for a youth summer camp that combines arts and farming, from jazz and drama to sheep shearing. The camp today attracts 180 youngsters up to 18 years old.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Appel is survived by two daughters, Judith Monroe of Elmer, N.J., and Aliza Morgan of Newark, Del.; two sons, Toby, of Manhattan and Julius, of Malaga, N.J., and six grandchildren.       
         Taina Waisman Katz, an architect, died on Friday at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, L.I. She was 78 years old and lived in Port Washington, L.I.         Mrs. Katz, who worked under the name of Waisman, died of a stroke, said her daughter, Liisa Sclare of Port Washington.         With her husband, Sidney, and another architect, Read Weber, Mrs. Katz founded the firm of Katz Waisman Weber in Manhattan in 1942. Among the buildings the firm designed were Bellevue Hospital, Kingsborough Community College, Coney Island Hospital and the Volkswagen offices in Orangeburg, N.Y.         When she retired in 1978 after the death of her husband, the firm was taken over by her daughter and son-in-law, Liisa and Donald Sclare.         Besides Mrs. Sclare, Mrs. Katz is survived by another daughter, Sirkka Hoffman of Queens, and a grandson.
