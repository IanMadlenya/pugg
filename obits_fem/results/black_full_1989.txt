        Dr. Catharine Deaver Lealtad, a pediatrician who supervised medical services for displaced children in Germany at the end of World War II, died Monday at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 93 years old and had been a patient at the V.A.'s extended care center in St. Albans, Queens, for nine years.         Dr. Catharine Deaver Lealtad, a pediatrician who supervised medical services for displaced children in Germany at the end of World War II, died Monday at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 93 years old and had been a patient at the V.A.'s extended care center in St. Albans, Queens, for nine years.         Dr. Lealtad, a native of St. Paul, was the first black graduate of Macalester College there. After teaching school in Columbus, Ohio, and working for the Young Women's Christian Association and the Urban League in New York, she was accepted at Cornell University Medical School but left, she said later, because of racial prejudice.         After six years of medical study in Lyons, France, and Berlin, Dr. Lealtad interned in Chicago and practiced at clinics for infants in Harlem. In 1945 she was commissioned a major in the Army and sent to Germany. The following year she was flown to the interior of Shantung Province in China to assist doctors there in fighting cholera behind the front lines in the civil war.         Returning to New York, Dr. Lealtad joined the pediatric service at Sydenham Hospital in Harlem. She later worked at a mission hospital in Puerto Rico and spent seven years as a volunteer at a clinic in Mexico City.         Dr. Lealtad is survived by two sisters, Grace Lealtad of Pasadena, Calif., and Mary Hamilton of Chicago.       
        Barbara W. Tuchman, whose skill at writing histories of men at war and on the brink of war won her two Pulitzer Prizes, died of complications of a stroke yesterday afternoon at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and was admitted to the hospital Saturday after suffering the stroke at her home at Cos Cob, Conn.         Barbara W. Tuchman, whose skill at writing histories of men at war and on the brink of war won her two Pulitzer Prizes, died of complications of a stroke yesterday afternoon at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and was admitted to the hospital Saturday after suffering the stroke at her home at Cos Cob, Conn.         It was Mrs. Tuchman's fourth book, ''The Guns of August,'' a study of the background and beginning of World War I, that made her a celebrity after it came out in 1962, winning reviewers' salutes, a durable niche on best-seller lists and her first Pulitzer Prize.         The second Pulitzer came for ''Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45.'' The 1971 biography of Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, a hard-driving American officer who played a major role in China during World War II, was combined with a history of modern China. Her other books included ''The Zimmermann Telegram,'' ''The Proud Tower'' and ''A Distant Mirror.'' Latest Book a Best Seller         Her most recent book, ''The First Salute,'' sets the American Revolution in international perspective. It has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 17 weeks, and last week was No. 9.         Born into a New York family that had long been eminent in finance and public service, Mrs. Tuchman could have had an easy, conventional life as the wife of a prominent physician. But as her three daughters grew older, she took up the historian's profession.         She had neither an academic title nor even a graduate degree. ''It's what saved me,'' she later said. ''If I had taken a doctoral degree, it would have stifled any writing capacity.'' Her Primary Obstacle         But to be a writer was difficult, she found, simply because she was a woman. ''If a man is a writer,'' she once said, ''everybody tiptoes around past the locked door of the breadwinner. But if you're an ordinary female housewife, people say, 'This is just something Barbara wanted to do; it's not professional.' ''         In fact, Mrs. Tuchman had a firm, even contentious, sense of her vocation. In history and biography, she told an audience at the National Portrait Gallery in 1978, ''the writer's object is - or should be - to hold the reader's attention.''         ''I want the reader to turn the page and keep on turning to the end,'' she added. ''This is accomplished only when the narrative moves steadily ahead, not when it comes to a weary standstill, overloaded with every item uncovered in the research.'' An Impression of Authority         In her person as well as in her choice of words, Mrs. Tuchman gave an impression of authority. She had strong features, a high forehead, wise hazel eyes and a somewhat serious manner that gave way, now and then, to a dazzling smile.         Summing up her view of the historical process, she wrote in 1981, in the preface to ''Practicing History,'' a selection of her short writings, that she had arrived at ''a sense of history as accidental and perhaps cyclical, of human conduct as a steady stream running through endless fields of changing circumstances, of good and bad always coexisting and inextricably mixed in periods as in people, of cross-currents and counter-currents usually present to contradict too-easy generalizations.''         Lofty though her views might be, Mrs. Tuchman was down to earth in her research. Before she wrote ''The Guns of August,'' she rented a Renault sedan and toured the appropriate battlefields. When she took notes, it was always on index cards measuring 4 by 6 inches - a convenient size, she said, for storing in shoeboxes and carrying in her purse.         That sort of prosaic concern was far from her exalted birthright. Barbara Wertheim was born on Jan. 30, 1912, in New York, the daughter of Maurice Wertheim, an investment banker, art collector and philanthropist, and Alma Morgenthau Wertheim, a sister of Henry Morgenthau Jr., who was Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.         Miss Wertheim attended the Walden School before entering Radcliffe College, where she concentrated on history and literature and received her bachelor's degree in 1933. Worked in Japan         Since, as she put it, ''paying jobs did not hang from the trees'' in that Depression year, she took an unpaid position with the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations.         The following year, she went to Tokyo to help work up an economic handbook of the Pacific area. While there, she wrote for two journals, Far Eastern Survey and Pacific Affairs.         An early contribution was a review of a French historian's book about Japan. Not long after it was printed, she later recalled: ''I was thrilled to receive from the author a letter addressed 'Chere consoeur' (the feminine of confrere, or as we would say, 'colleague'). I felt admitted into an international circle of professionals.''         In 1936, Miss Wertheim went to work for The Nation, which her father had bought to keep it from going bankrupt. Her first job was clipping newspaper articles, but soon she was writing herself, and in 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, she went to Valencia and Madrid as The Nation's correspondent. 'Heroes, Hopes, and Illusions'         From Spain she traveled elsewhere in Europe, savoring what she later called ''a somber, exciting, believing, betraying time, with heroes, hopes, and illusions.''         In London, she put together a short book, ''The Lost British Policy,'' about British policy toward Spain and the Western Mediterranean. Her later appraisal of the work, which came out in 1938, was that it was only ''a respectable piece of research,'' and she sometimes omitted it in listing her books.         By 1939, she was back in New York, writing largely on Spain, and the next year she married Dr. Lester Reginald Tuchman, a New York internist.         Mrs. Tuchman was soon showing her strength of will. With Nazi Germany looming, she later wrote, her husband ''not unreasonably felt at that time that the world was too unpromising to bring children into.         ''Sensible for once, I argued that if we waited for the outlook to improve, we might wait forever, and that if we wanted a child at all we should have it now, regardless of Hitler.''         ''The tyranny of men not being quite as total as today's feminists would have us believe,'' she added, writing in 1981, ''our first daughter was born nine months later.'' Separated by Wartime         After Pearl Harbor, Dr. Tuchman went overseas to a United States military hospital, and Mrs. Tuchman got a job in New York with the Office of War Information, preparing material on the Far East for use in broadcasts to Europe.         ''After the war, when my husband came home, we had two more children, and domesticity for a while prevailed,'' she wrote later, ''combined with beginning the work I had always wanted to do, which was writing a book.''         ''When the children were very small,'' she once recalled in an interview, ''I worked in the morning only and then gradually, as they spent full days at school, I could spend full days at work. I could never have done any of this work if I hadn't been able to afford domestic help.''         The fruit of those labors, ''Bible and Sword,'' about relations between Britain and Palestine, came out in 1956. It attracted relatively little notice, though what there was of it was favorable.         Two years later ''The Zimmermann Telegram'' appeared, about a message sent from Berlin to a German diplomat in Mexico in January 1917, raising the possibility of ''an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer territory in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona,'' and about the message's repercussions after it was intercepted and made public by the British.         Writing in The New York Times, Samuel Flagg Bemis, the Yale diplomatic historian, said the value and importance of the book lay in Mrs. Tuchman's ''brilliant use of well known materials, her sureness of insight and her competent grasp of a complicated chapter of diplomatic history.'' 'The Guns of August'         Attempting something that might have seemed a bit beyond her reach, Mrs. Tuchman took up a far broader and more important topic in her next book, which was ''The Guns of August.'' World War I, as she saw it, was no less than ''the chasm between our world and a world that died forever.''         Though the book was largely about arms and men, it was also about aspirations and ideals. ''Men,'' she concluded, in one widely quoted passage, ''could not sustain a war of such magnitude and pain without hope - the hope that its very enormity would insure that it could never happen again.''         Clifton Fadiman, writing in the Book-of-the-Month-Club News, said: ''Its virtues are almost Thucydidean: intelligence, concision, weight, detachment.''         Writing in The New York Times, Cyril Falls, a British officer turned military historian, said Mrs. Tuchman ''writes so brilliantly and inspiringly.'' The book, he said, was ''lucid, fair, critical and witty.''         But he contended that her performance was uneven, and ''the errors and omissions amount to a formidable total.'' For his part, Bruce Bliven, writing in The New Yorker, complained that ''Mrs. Tuchman leans toward seeing issues as black and white.'' Emphasized Human Qualities         The book's emphasis on the human qualities of the leaders of the time helped make it popular with the public, and it served as the basis for a 1964 documentary film, produced by Nathan Kroll, with the same title.         The quarter-century preceding World War I was the subject of Mrs. Tuchman's next book, ''The Proud Tower,'' which came out in 1966. In a review in The New York Times, Martin Duberman, a Princeton history professor, praised her skill at narrating events, making historical personages come alive, and writing clearly and powerfully about complex matters.         But he said the book did ''not come up to the high level of 'The Guns of August.' '' It was not a portrait of the period, he contended, but merely ''random brush strokes, leaving a canvas unoccupied by any ruling vision.''         When ''Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45,'' came out, it was hailed as ''brilliant'' in a review in The New Republic by the dean of American China scholars, John K. Fairbank, the director of Harvard University's East Asian Research Center. 'A Distant Mirror'         Another book about Asia, ''Notes From China,'' a slim volume about a six-week trip Mrs. Tuchman had taken, appeared in 1972. But six years went by before the appearance of her next work, ''A Distant Mirror,'' a study of the 14th century, an era that was racked by plague and war.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Eric Cochrane, a professor of history at the University of Chicago, said, ''This book abounds in the same elements that have made her previous books masterpieces of popular scholarship: vivid battle scenes, scenes from daily life, brilliant portraits.'' But he also argued that she was guilty of grave omissions and misinterpretations.         In ''The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam,'' a 1984 book, Mrs. Tuchman scrutinized the Trojans' decision to admit the Greek horse into their city, the refusal of six Renaissance Popes to arrest church corruption in advance of the Protestant Reformation, British misrule under King George III and America's mishandling of the Vietnam conflict.         Mrs. Tuchman had an occasional fondness for twitting figures of authority. She once began a speech to the Army War College by noting that her subject, generalship, had been suggested by the college's commandant.         ''No doubt,'' she observed, ''he could safely assume that the subject in itself would automatically interest this audience in the same way that motherhood would interest an audience of pregnant ladies.''         Mrs. Tuchman is survived by her husband, who is an emeritus professor of clinical medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine; a sister, Anne W. Werner of Manhattan; three daughters, Lucy T. Eisenberg of Los Angeles, Jessica Tuchman Mathews of Washington, and Alma Tuchman of Cos Cob and Manhattan, and four grandchildren.         The funeral will be private. A memorial service is be held at 2 P.M. Sunday in the Celeste Bartos Forum at the main branch of the New York Public Library.

        Nedda Harrigan Logan, an actress who was the president of the Actors' Fund of America for the last 10 years, died of lung cancer Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         Nedda Harrigan Logan, an actress who was the president of the Actors' Fund of America for the last 10 years, died of lung cancer Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         Mrs. Logan was a daughter of Edward Harrigan, the composer, writer and vaudeville performer, and the wife of Joshua L. Logan, the director, producer and writer, from 1945 until he died in July.         Nedda Logan appeared in many Broadway plays, including ''Dracula,'' ''Merry Andrew'' and ''Becky Sharp,'' as well as films, including ''Charlie Chan at the Opera,'' ''The Case of the Black Cat'' and ''Devil's Island.'' Starring in Plays Overseas         She was a founder of the Stage Door Canteen in 1942 and helped organize and starred in the first plays sent overseas by the U.S.O. Those included ''Three's a Family'' and ''Personal Appearance.''         Mrs. Logan was also a chairwoman and founder of the Actors' Fund blood bank and a trustee of the Museum of the City of New York and the National Corporate Theater Fund, which helps finance regional theaters and neighborhood playhouses.         In recent years, she and Mr. Logan toured widely, often with their children, in a revue called ''Musical Moments,'' which featured songs from major shows Mr. Logan directed, including ''South Pacific,'' ''Paint Your Wagon'' and ''Bus Stop.'' The finale was often a duet the couple sang to each other, ''I Remember It Well'' from ''Gigi.'' Making an Effort         Before marrying Mr. Logan, she was the widow of a character-film actor, Walter Connolly. Of her life as a Hollywood wife, she remarked in 1940: ''If you don't make an effort, it's awfully easy to fall into the soft, indolent - and pleasant - life of the many Hollywood women who are content to just keep the home fires burning for their hard-working, large earning and famous husbands. So you just subside, take to golf, bridge and 'causes.' ''         She was a native of Rumson, N.J., and a graduate of the National Park Seminary in Washington.         Surviving are two daughters, Ann Connolly, of Norwalk, Conn., and Harrigan Logan, of Los Angeles; a son, Thomas Heggen Logan of Manhattan; three granddaughters, and a great grandson.

Tally Brown, an actress and a cabaret performer, died after a stroke on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 64 years old.         Ms. Brown was prominent in the underground performance world of the 1960's and 70's, appearing frequently at such New York nightclubs as Reno Sweeney's, S.N.A.F.U. and the Continental Baths, and acting in such experimental films as ''Brand X,'' ''The Illiac Passion'' and several early works by Andy Warhol.         A short, stout singer with wild black hair, Ms. Brown was known for her intense, dramatic renditions of songs by Kurt Weill, the Rolling Stones and David Bowie. She also appeared in Broadway and Off Broadway productions of ''Mame,'' ''The Pajama Game,'' ''Medea'' and other works. In 1951, Ms. Brown was a founder of the Fine Arts Conservatory, in Miami, which was one of the first racially integrated theaters and art schools in the South. She was the subject of ''Tally Brown, New York,'' an award-winning 1980 documentary by Rosa von Praunheim.

Roberta Worrick, who wrote under the pen name Maria Thomas, was among the eight Americans killed last Monday in the crash of the airplane carrying United States Representative Mickey Leland of Texas. She lived in Addis Ababa; her age could not be learned last night.         Her husband, Tom, the deputy director of the United States Agency for International Development in Ethopia, was also killed in the crash.         Mrs. Worrick's novel, ''Antonia Saw the Oryx First,'' published by SoHo Press and distributed by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 1987, drew critical praise for its depiction of the tensions between colonial whites and Africans on a continent buffeted by changes.         After the success of the novel, Soho Press issued ''Come to Africa and Save Your Marriage,'' Mrs. Worrick's collection of short stories in which she told of the difficulties of various people -Peace Corps volunteers, foreign academics, Indians, American blacks and white hunters left behind by colonial empires - in finding their way in black Africa.         Mr. Worrick and her husband went to Africa with the Peace Corps in 1971 and stayed on, pursuing their own careers. In addition Ethiopia, they lived in Tanzania, Liberia, Nigeria and Kenya.       
        Diana Vreeland, the legendary fashion editor and creator of spectacular fashion exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, died of a heart attack yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was believed to be in her late 80's and had been in failing health for several years.         Diana Vreeland, the legendary fashion editor and creator of spectacular fashion exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, died of a heart attack yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was believed to be in her late 80's and had been in failing health for several years.         In the more than 40 years that she was associated with the fashion world, she was called an oracle, the high priestess of fashion, a myth maker. She was the fashion editor of Harper's Bazaar from 1937 to 1962, when she moved to Vogue. There, she was editor in chief until 1971.         Instead of resting on her laurels, she went on, as consultant to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to a new career of staging annual fashion exhibitions that drew almost one million visitors a year and made the museum a center of fashion excitement for New York City and the world.         ''She was and remains the only genius fashion editor,'' Richard Avedon, the photographer, said yesterday. Their professional relationship at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue was the inspiration for the movie ''Funny Face'' starring Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn.         Despite a predilection for aristocratic luxury that recalled the gracious days before World War I, she had an innate understanding of the extraordinary pace of change in 20th-century life. She had an eye for what was new and imaginative, and many fashion designers say she gave them a crucial boost at an early stage in their career.         Her sense of theater was evidenced in the way she moved - Cecil Beaton described her as ''an elegant crane picking her way out of a swamp'' -and the way she looked. Her cheeks and ear lobes were rouged, her lips and nails colored a clear red and her hair lacquered black until the end of her life.         She was fashionably thin, and her favorite costume when she was working or partygoing was narrow black pants with either a black turtleneck sweater or elaborate tunic, depending on the occasion. For years she wore her hair in a snood - it became a kind of trademark - and wore ankle-strap low-heel sandals.         She was born around the turn of the century in Paris - she was never very specific about her birth date - to the former Emily Key Hoffman, an American, and her husband, Frederick Y. Dalziel, who was Scottish. She had a younger sister, Alexandra.         ''We went to Venice or Deauville in the summer or wherever everybody else went,'' she said of her childhood in Europe. ''Our parents spent their days having a good time. They never contributed a bloody thing and they and all our friends lived the life of Riley.'' Ballet and Riding         In 1914, spurred by the onset of the war, the family moved to New York, where the Dalziel sisters went to ballet classes three times a week, learned to ride from Buffalo Bill Cody and occasionally attended schools such as Brearley for a few months. Diana Dalziel made her debut in 1922, and two years later, while vacationing in Saratoga, met and married T. Reed Vreeland, a banker who graduated from Yale the year she came out.         They lived in Albany for four years and had two sons, Thomas R. Vreeland Jr., who became an architect, and Frederick, who entered the diplomatic service. Then they moved to Europe, where for a brief time Diana Vreeland ran a lingerie shop in London. When they returned to the United States in 1936, she began writing a column for Harper's Bazaar called ''Why Don't You . . . .''         For a country in the midst of a Depression, it offered such heady suggestions as ''Why don't you put all your dogs in bright yellow collars and leads like all the dogs in Paris?'' or ''have a furry elk-hide trunk for the back of your car?'' It was widely satirized and widely read and the next year she was made fashion editor of the magazine. Made a Few Mistakes         During most of the 1960's, when fashion was in turmoil, she presided over Vogue magazine, where the fashion world took everything she said seriously and where she made a few apparent mistakes, such as having experimental photographs taken with a wide-angle lens that distorted the models, giving them big heads and tiny feet. Nevertheless, fashion photographers were widely influenced by those pictures and began trying to see what their lenses could do.         She breakfasted on tea and oatmeal, worked in bed in the mornings and showed up in her office around noon.         Her legend grew as her aphorisms were circulated within the fashion world. ''Pink,'' she said, ''is the navy blue of India.'' ''The bikini is the most important thing since the atom bomb.'' She pronounced Celanese, the American fabric company, as if it were Italian: chelahnayzay, and broke down corduroy to its original components: cord du roi.         She avoided the typewriter. ''Has anyone ever written a great love letter on a typewriter?'' she asked. ''A great suicide note?'' And she made pronouncements. Of Chanel, she said, ''her first customers were princesses and duchesses and she dressed them like secretaries and stenographers.''         During this period, she asked Giorgio di Sant'Angelo, who was working in plastics and sculpture, to make accessories and then clothes.         ''She sent me to Arizona,'' he said, ''with Veruschka, the model, four suitcases full of fabrics, wires and tape and told me to wrap and tie everything as I wanted and then she gave me eight pages in the magazine.'' Two Job Opportunities         When Oscar de la Renta came to New York from Paris with a letter of introduction, she invited him to tea. He had two job opportunities, he told her, one doing custom clothes for Elizabeth Arden, the other designing ready-to-wear for Christian Dior-New York.         ''What do you want to do with yourself?'' she asked.         ''I want to get into ready-to-wear because that's where the money is,'' he told her.         ''Then go to Arden because you will make your reputation faster,'' she advised. ''She is not a designer, so she will promote you. At the other place, you will always be eclipsed by the name of Dior.''         ''That is exactly what happened,'' he said. ''And when I did go into ready-to-wear, she helped me. When I made all those gypsy clothes and the caftans in 1967, 1968, it was all Diana's suggestions.''         She had a sense of fantasy that enveloped both her own image and her friends.         ''Her thought process was very original,'' said Bill Blass, who became a friend of Mrs. Vreeland and her husband, who died in 1966. ''She always insisted I was British, no matter how many times I told her I was a hoosier from Indiana,'' Mr. Blass said. Last Career With Museum         Her last career, with the Metropolitan Museum, began in 1973 with a retrospective showing of Balenciaga's clothes, from his first collection in 1938 to the wedding dress he made in 1972 for the Duchess of Cadiz, General Francisco Franco's granddaughter, a month before he died.         The same year, she pulled together an exhibition called Innovative Designers in Paris, and each year there followed another eye-catcher that drew not only fashion enthusiasts but also people captivated by the color and drama of romantic Hollywood clothes, stylish American women (including Irene Castle, Isadora Duncan, Josephine Baker and Elsie de Wolfe), Russian peasants, the costumes of the Ballets Russes, fashions of the Hapsburg era, Yves Saint Laurent's designs, equestrian costumes, Chinese mandarin robes and dance clothes throughout history.         The parties that heralded the openings each fall became major New York events where figures prominent in art, social and fashion circles mingled for dinner and dancing in the museum; the evening was capped by a stroll through the exotically lighted display halls with appropriate music and the flash of photographers' lights. Mrs. Vreeland was in the center of the action at all the parties except the one for ''Dance'' in 1986, when her health was too fragile. 'Elegance Is Innate'         During the museum period, Mrs. Vreeland became the undisputed voice of the fashion world, and her presence at other parties and fashion openings was eagerly sought. She received awards from such diverse groups as the Italian fashion industry and the Rhode Island School of Design and she became a chevalier of the French National Order of Merit.         In a book of her favorite photographs and sketches edited by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and published by Doubleday in 1980, she continued her penchant for aphorisms. ''Elegance is innate,'' she wrote. ''It has nothing to do with being well dressed.'' She also said, ''I loathe narcissism, but I approve of vanity.''         In her memoirs, ''D. V.,'' published in 1984 by Alfred A. Knopf, she did not restrict her pronouncements to fashion. ''Chutney is marvelous,'' she wrote. ''I'm mad about it. To me, it's very imperial.'' And ''lettuce is divine, although I'm not sure it's really food.'' A Practical Slant         Sometimes her observations had a remarkably practical slant. ''Whatever the fashion,'' she wrote in The New York Times in 1977, ''the important thing is time for upkeep. We take it for granted that a girl gets the best she can for herself. But, if she doesn't keep it up, if it isn't in beautiful condition, if the shoes aren't cleaned before she wears them every day and her bag isn't cleaned and everything in it cleaned, she'll never look like anything.''         She was an early enthusiast on the subject of keeping fit, and the magazines she edited were filled with articles on exercise, skin and hair care and grooming long before these topics became major obsessions.         ''The body must stay fit,'' she once explained. ''Fit people like themselves much better.''         The woman who was sometimes described as having the profile of a cigar-store Indian told an interviewer once that ''you don't have to be born beautiful to be wildly attractive,'' and her friends insist that she carried this maxim out in her own life.         ''Dinner alone with D. V. was one of the best ways I could think of to spend an evening,'' said Bill Blass.         She lived in a basically red apartment on Park Avenue decorated by Billy Baldwin with lots of pictures, patterns, bibelots and calculated clutter. When she was editor in chief at Vogue, she also had her office painted bright red. Link to Aristocratic Years         As fashion became more egalitarian during the later years of the 20th century, Diana Vreeland provided a link to the aristocratic years when it was the province exclusively of the very rich. At a time when most people were concerned with the practical qualities of synthetic fibers, she could speak of ''the feel of a perfect piece of silk'' as the ''greatest projection of pleasure.''         She had the theatrical knack of a Diaghilev, whom she greatly admired and whom she made the subject of one of her Metropolitan Museum exhibits along with the costumes for his Ballets Russes. For the increasingly computerized fashion industry, she was a symbol of the grandeur of the past when drama and imagination were all. She had a glimpse of that past in her early years in Europe. In recreating it in her later life, she smoothed out the bumps and made it seem more exhilarating than perhaps it ever was.         She is survived by her two sons, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         The funeral will be private. A memorial service is planned for the fall, with the date to be announced later.

Maryat Lee, a playwright and producer for community theaters, died of heart disease on Sept. 18 at home in Lewisburg, W. Va. She was 66 years old.         A 1951 anti-drug drama by Miss Lee, ''Dope,'' played community and street theaters for two decades.         Miss Lee moved to West Virginia 12 years ago and founded the Eco Theater, which her brother, John, described as ''suggestive of ecology, close to the people, based on oral history and using untrained actors.''         She is survived by her mother, Grace, of Black Mountain, N.C., and two brothers, John, of Vero Beach, Fla., and Robert E., of Black Mountain.

Mabel K. Staupers, a nurse who spent her career encouraging black women in the health-care profession, died of pneumonia Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 99 years old.         Mrs. Staupers was the executive secretary of the National Association for Colored Graduate Nurses from 1934 to 1949, when she became its president. She retired in 1951, when the group merged with the American Nurses Association.         Previously, she was the first executive secretary of the Harlem tuberculosis committee of the New York Tuberculosis and Health Association and an organizer of the Booker T. Washington Sanitarium, the first inpatient center in Harlem for black patients with tuberculosis.         She was a founder of the National Council of Negro Women, in 1935, and received awards from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Nurses Association.         Mrs. Staupers, who was born in Barbados, graduated from what is now the Howard University College of Nursing in Washington.         Her husband, Fritz C. Staupers, died in 1949.         She is survived by a sister, Dr. Dorothy Harrison of Washington.       
        Dolores Ibarruri was better known at home and abroad under her battle name, La Pasionaria, the Passion Flower.

Dolores Ibarruri was better known at home and abroad under her battle name, La Pasionaria, the Passion Flower. A Basque left-winger who was a founder of the Spanish Communist Party, she won international renown during the Spanish Civil War for her indomitable stand.         In her first broadcast after the outbreak of war in 1936 she told Spanish republicans: ''It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees! They shall not pass!'' The last two words - ''no pasaran'' in Spanish -became the rallying cry of the dying republic.         Later, in her years living in Moscow, she met many Soviet and non-Soviet Communist leaders, including Mao and Ho Chi Minh. Asked in a 1983 interview which of them was most impressive, she answered without hesitation, ''Logically, Stalin.'' In many broadcasts and messages from the Soviet Union to Spain, she advocated collaboration between Communists and all other left-wing and so-called progressive forces, including Roman Catholic groups.         While the Franco regime never forgave her for her role before and during the civil war, which ended in 1939, Spanish anti-Communists would reluctantly acknowledge that she had shown courage and determination. Some backers of Franco would even say privately that La Pasionaria, though in error, was ''a great Spaniard.'' A Delicate Child         Dolores Ibarruri was the 8th of 11 children of a miner's family in the harsh mountains near Bilbao, in northern Spain. Born in the village of Somorrostro on ''a day in December 1895,'' as she wrote in her autobiography, she went to school until she was 15, two years longer than required by law, because she was of delicate health and her parents thought she might become a teacher rather than a manual worker.         The family's poverty prevented this. After being apprenticed to a dressmaker for a short time, she worked for three years as a maid.         At the age of 20 she married Julian Ruiz, a miner from Asturias who had migrated to the Basque country. In her memoirs, ''The Only Way,'' published in Paris, Havana and Mexico in 1962-63, La Pasionaria wrote curiously little about her husband, by whom she had six children, including three girls born as triplets in 1923. All but two of the six died soon after birth. Her only son, Ruben, born in 1922, was reportedly killed in World War II fighting for the Soviet Union.         Deeply religious as a girl, she lost her Roman Catholic faith when she started reading Karl Marx and other radical writers. In 1918 she began working on the miners' newspaper El Minero Vizcaino. Soon she chose her pseudonym for contributions to revolutionary publications. A Founder of Party         She was a member of the first provincial committee of the fledgling Spanish Communist Party in her home province in 1920 and was elected a delegate to the first national Communist congress, which led to the formal founding of the party in 1921. During the next years she emerged as a spellbinding orator, agitator and organizer.         In 1930, elected to the Central Committee of the party, she backed the national leadership in its fight against Trotskyists in Catalonia - a quarrel that was to come into the open again during the civil war.         La Pasionaria moved to Madrid in 1931, having been placed in charge of the party's official organ, Mundo Obrero. Her first visit to the Soviet Union was in 1933-34. She was elected to the Spanish Parliament as a deputy for Asturias in 1934. There, as in other public places, she invariably appeared dressed in black.         In a dramatic session on July 11, 1936, La Pasionaria is said to have exclaimed, ''This is your last speech!'' when Finance Minister Jose Calvo Sotelo, the monarchist leader, attacked the republican Government. On July 13 Mr. Calvo Sotelo was kidnapped and slain by left-wing terrorists, an event that marked the beginning of the civil war. Anti-Communists accused La Pasionaria of having instigated the killing. She denied it.         Throughout the war she made many speeches and broadcasts to urge the country to resist the Nationalist insurgents the way it had resisted Napoleon's troops in 1808. She told women to fight with knives and burning oil. In contrast to her verbal truculence, she is credited by some reports with having saved the lives of nuns who were threatened by mob violence in Madrid early in the war. Communists Grow in Power         As the civil war proceeded, the Communist Party, though comparatively small, became more and more powerful in the republican camp, and La Pasionaria was the most influential Spanish Communist. She consistently backed Palmiro Togliatti, later leader of the Italian Communist Party, whom Moscow had sent as its representative in Spain.         In the spring of 1936, acting on Moscow's orders, she helped bring about the downfall of Francisco Largo Caballero, the Socialist who had been the republic's Prime Minister since September 1936. Juan Negrin, who was Mr. Largo Caballero's successor, is known to have intensly disliked La Pasionaria, but he kept collaborating with the Communists until the republic's collapse in 1938.         La Pasionaria left Spain early in March 1938, shortly before the fall of Madrid. Together with Mr. Negrin and other republican leaders she flew to France and then proceeded to Moscow, where she had sent her two surviving children, Ruben and Amaya, in 1934 for schooling. Organized an Underground         During World War II La Pasionaria made propaganda broadcasts in support of the Soviet war effort. Later she devoted much time to organizing a Communist underground movement for Spain.         After 38 years in Moscow, she returned to Spain in 1977, two years after Franco died. When she made her first appearances in post-Franco Spain, crowds greeted her with chants of ''Si si, si, Dolores esta aqui - ''Yes, yes, yes, Dolores is here.''         The Spanish Communist Party was made legal two years after Franco's death. In 1977 La Pasionaria was re-elected to Parliament, but she later withdrew because of infirmity and age.         She was separated from her husband, Mr. Ruiz, in the 1930's. He died not long after her return to Spain.         Correction:  November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary yesterday about Dolores Ibarruri, the Spanish Communist leader known as La Pasionaria, misstated the year of the fall of the Spanish republic and of her departure for Moscow. It was 1939, not 1938.

Sadie Tanner Mosell Alexander, a lawyer and civil rights advocate for 50 years who achieved a number of academic and professional distinctions as a black woman, died of pneumonia Wednesday at Cathedral Village, a retirement community, in Philadelphia. She was 91 years old and had been hospitalized with Alzheimer's disease in Cathedral Village since 1983.         Mrs. Alexander was appointed by Harry S. Truman to the President's Committee on Civil Rights, which issued a report in 1948 that cited the gap between American ideals and practice. In 1981 President Jimmy Carter named her chairwoman of the White House Conference on Aging.         On June 15, 1921, she became the second black woman in the United States to receive a Ph.D.; the first, Georgiana Simpson, got the degree a day earlier at the University of Chicago. Mrs. Alexander was also the first black woman in the nation to get a Ph.D. in economics and the first to receive a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania.         In 1927, she became the first black woman to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania's Law School; her father had been the first black man to graduate from the school. And she became the first black woman to pass the Pennsylvania bar.         Before receiving her doctorate in economics, Mrs. Alexander had been the first national president of the black women's sorority, Delta Sigma Theta. Leader in Philadelphia         Mrs. Alexander practiced law with her husband, Raymond Pace Alexander, a Harvard Law School graduate, until he became a judge in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia. In the 1940's, she was assistant city solicitor in Philadelphia. Two decades later she headed the city's Commission on Human Rights.         She was active in the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans for Democratic Action and a board member of the National Urban League.         Mrs. Alexander's grandfather was Bishop Benjamin Tucker of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was founded in Philadelphia. Her uncle was the 19th-century artist Henry Tanner.         Mrs. Alexander leaves two daughters, Rae Alexander-Minter, who is director of public programs in education at the New-York Historical Society, and Mary A. Brown of Washington; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
