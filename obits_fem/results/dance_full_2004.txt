         Kiharu Nakamura, a geisha in Tokyo in the 1930's who wrote a popular memoir and taught sopranos how to portray the most famous geisha in fiction, Madama Butterfly, died on Jan. 5 at her home in Jackson Heights, Queens. She was 90.         The report of her death came from Artemis Willis, who is making a documentary film about her.         Miss Nakamura, whose original name was Kazuko Yamamoto, was born on the Japanese island of Hokkaido. Her family moved to Tokyo when she was a child, and at age 15 she joined the Shimbashi Geisha Association. She learned to play the three-stringed lute called the shamisen, to sing ballads in the traditional quavering voice, to dance and otherwise entertain. She adopted the name Kiharu, which means happy spring.         She also learned English, an accomplishment that led to the end of her career as a geisha. Pressed by the military police to report on her foreign clients, she instead married a young diplomat, Shintaro Ota, and moved with him to his post in Calcutta.         They returned to Japan during the war and later divorced, and she eventually married a photographer, Masaya Nakamura. After a second divorce, she moved to New York, where she became a sought-after expert on geisha traditions.         Ms. Nakamura helped the soprano Anna Moffo and many other singers prepare for the role of Cio-Cio-San in Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' teaching them how to walk with their feet together, hold a fan and stand up gracefully from kneeling.         She was also a consultant on the Broadway show ''M. Butterfly,'' and was cited in the acknowledgments of Arthur Golden's 1997 novel ''Memoirs of a Geisha.''         Her own memoir, ''An Edokko Geisha'' (1983), was a best seller in Japan and became a mini-series on Japanese television. She also wrote two other memoirs, as well as autobiographical novels. Her books have not been translated into English.         Miss Nakamura is survived by her companion, Robert E. Lee of Jackson Heights; a son, Masakatsu Ota of Niigata, Japan; and two grandchildren.       
         Ann Miller, the long-legged tap-dancer with the lacquered raven hair and Nefertiti eye makeup whose athleticism made her a staple of big-screen musicals in the 1940's and 50's, died on Thursday at a Los Angeles hospital. She was believed to be about 80.         The cause was lung cancer, Esme Chandlee, her friend and former publicist, told The Associated Press.         She was, in her heyday, America's female tap star, inheriting the mantle of Ginger Rogers and Eleanor Powell. She always took a vigorous approach to dancing, and her agent said she could produce 500 taps a minute. Nobody ever disputed him.         As a young actress, she consistently won praise for her roles in movies like ''Easter Parade'' (1948), in which she danced most gracefully with Fred Astaire as she tried to woo him away from Judy Garland; ''Kiss Me Kate'' (1953), in which she portrayed Lois Lane, the nightclub hoofer who became Bianca in Cole Porter's version of ''Taming of the Shrew''; and ''On the Town'' (1949), which paired her with Jules Munshin, the sidekick of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, sailors desperately looking for girls on their 24-hour leave in New York. These, she said, were her favorite movies, and most fans and critics would agree.         She first attracted attention in 1938, when she played the fudge-making, ballet-dancing daughter in Frank Capra's ''You Can't Take It With You.'' And in 1979, after a long hiatus, she made a tremendous comeback, starring with Mickey Rooney in ''Sugar Babies,'' a musical salute to vaudeville that ran for nearly three years on Broadway. She enjoyed the stardom that she felt she had been denied earlier.         ''At MGM I always played the second feminine lead,'' she told the writer Bob Thomas in 1990. ''I was never the star in films. I was the brassy, good-hearted showgirl. I never really had my big moment on the screen. 'Sugar Babies' gave me the stardom that my soul kind of yearned for.''         Johnnie Lucille Ann Collier was born in Chireno, Tex. Her father, John Alfred Collier, was a successful criminal lawyer who counted among his clients Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker and Baby Face Nelson. He dreamed of having a son he could call John Jr.; instead, he named his daughter Johnnie. Her mother was the former Clara Birdwell, whose mother was a Cherokee.         The Colliers soon moved to Houston, where her mother saw to it that she studied piano and violin but mostly dancing, partly to build up legs affected by rickets, a condition caused by a vitamin D deficiency that can lead to softening of the bones and deformity.         When Ms. Miller was about 10 her parents' marriage fell apart and her mother took her to California. There she developed a dance routine and performed at meetings of local civic organization. She earned $5 a night, plus tips.         A few years later she was seen by Benny Rubin, a comic and talent scout, who happened to be escorting Lucille Ball. They arranged a movie audition, which led to her first film, a nonspeaking part in ''New Faces of 1937'' for RKO.         Other light films followed, and while she aspired to the romantic roles that were being enjoyed by other dancing stars, like Ginger Rogers and Eleanor Powell, she was offered none.         In the 1940's she appeared in a string of forgettable films. Among them were ''Melody Ranch'' (1940), which is recalled now only because it was the first time Gene Autry kissed a woman for the cameras; ''Time Out for Rhythm'' (1941), a vehicle for Rudy Vallee; ''Priorities on Parade'' (1942), a feel-good movie for soldiers starring Jerry Colonna; ''Reveille With Beverly'' (1943); ''What's Buzzin' Cousin?'' (1943); ''Jam Session'' (1944) and ''Eadie Was a Lady'' (1945).         In 1946 she married a millionaire, Reese Llewellyn Milner. The marriage failed within a year, and she went back to work, winning a big part in perhaps her most memorable film, MGM's ''Easter Parade.'' She got the part only when Cyd Charisse, the first choice for the role, broke a leg, and she had to dance in flats because Fred Astaire was barely taller than she was.         In 1951 and 1952 she appeared in ''Two Tickets to Broadway'' and ''Lovely to Look At,'' a remake of Jerome Kern's ''Roberta.'' Later that decade she was in ''Deep in My Heart,'' a tribute to Sigmund Romberg; ''Hit the Deck,'' set to Vincent Youmans's music; and ''The Opposite Sex,'' a musical version of Clare Boothe Luce's play, ''The Women.''         By the late 50's she had moved from movies to nightclubs and also appeared frequently on television programs like ''The Ed Sullivan Show,'' ''The Hollywood Palace'' and ''Laugh-In.''         In 1969 she scored a Broadway triumph when she took on the title role of ''Mame,'' which had been originated by Angela Lansbury. The critics felt she rivaled Ms. Lansbury, and Clive Barnes said in The New York Times that she gave the show ''a real shot in the arm.''         Jobs were scarce after that, though in 1972 she made a memorable commercial for Heinz's ''Great American Soups'' commercial, in which she danced atop an eight-foot soup can.         She went on the road with touring companies of ''Can-Can,'' ''Panama Hattie,'' ''Hello, Dolly!'' and ''Blithe Spirit.'' Her biggest comeback of all came in 1979, with ''Sugar Babies.''         Two more marriages, to William Moss in 1958 and to Arthur Cameron in 1961, ended in divorce. In between marriages she dated Conrad Hilton, Howard Hughes and Louis B. Mayer, among others. There are no immediate survivors.         In her prime, Ms. Miller's flamboyantly glamorous appearance, especially her hair, which was often a bouffant, lacquered wig, sometimes made her the butt of jokes about falling down and breaking her hair.         In later years, she seemed to revel in making television appearances in her wig and Egyptian-style makeup. In her 1972 autobiography, ''Miller's High Life,'' and in other writings about her serious spiritual interests, she even laid claim to having been Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt in an earlier life.         But she said that throughout her life she wondered ''whatever happened to Lucille Collier from Texas.''         ''There's a part of me that will always be Lucille Collier, and she's just waiting for this long-winded Hollywood love affair to end with the Ann Miller creature.''       
         Elma Lewis, a nationally recognized arts educator who was among the first people to be awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, died on Jan. 1 at her home in Roxbury, the Boston neighborhood. She was 82.         The cause was complications of diabetes, said Sarah-Ann Shaw, a former student.         Ms. Lewis, considered a doyenne of black culture in Boston, was a no-nonsense mentor to generations of young dance, opera and theater students at the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts, which she founded in 1950 in a Roxbury apartment before moving it permanently to a former synagogue and school in the same area. In 1968 she founded the National Center of Afro-American Artists, which still exists although the school closed in 1986. In addition to becoming a MacArthur Fellow, she received a national medal for the arts in 1983.         She operated the Elma Lewis Playhouse in the Park, a summer theater where musicians played to capacity audiences in Franklin Park in Roxbury, after she had overseen an effort to rid the area of drug dealers and garbage. Duke Ellington and the Boston Pops Orchestra, under Arthur Fiedler, were among the performers there.         Born in Roxbury, Ms. Lewis worked her way through Emerson College by acting. She received a master's degree in education from Boston University, and staged operas and taught speech therapy, dance and drama in Boston and Cambridge, Mass.         She had no immediate survivors.         Asked in an 1981 interview in The Times if she felt like a token as one of three women among 21 MacArthur fellows, Ms. Lewis said that she had felt exclusion more because of her race than because of her sex. ''As a matter of fact,'' she said, ''women's problems belong to white women, because it is in that white dominant group that men are keeping women from utmost dominance. The black man is oppressed, and I can't imagine a man brave enough to oppress me.''       
         May O'Donnell, an early Martha Graham principal dancer and a modern-dance choreographer and teacher, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 97.         Her death was reported by Marian Horosko, who is writing a book about her.         The serene Ms. O'Donnell might have served as the model for the tranquil all-seeing Pioneer Woman in Graham's 1944 ''Appalachian Spring,'' a role she created. Yet she had a robust sense of humor about the world of dance, and she was the rare dancer who stood up to the strong-willed Graham with quiet determination.         Ms. O'Donnell choreographed a modern-dance classic, the 1943 ''Suspension,'' which was inspired by her memory of seeing a plane below the hilltop on which she was standing in wartime California. That work was best explained, she felt, by T. S. Eliot's observation in ''Four Quartets'' that dance was ''at the still point of the turning world.''         In the piece dancers moved slowly amid boxes and a large turning mobile, seeming at times to float. ''Suspension'' confounded audiences accustomed to the highly charged narrative dances then popular. ''O'Donnell created a poetical cloud of movement that refused to be hurried,'' Donald McDonagh wrote in his Complete Guide to Modern Dance. ''The work didn't thunder, shout or roar its message; it whispered but eventually achieved recognition.''         Ms. O'Donnell was born in Sacramento and would later recall the heady openness and freedom of California, which had also affected the young Graham. In California, Ms. O'Donnell trained with Estelle Reed and Michio Ito before studying in New York with Graham. She performed with Graham from 1932 to 1938, then returned to California and founded the San Francisco Dance Theater with her husband, the composer Ray Green, and a Graham colleague and lifelong friend, Gertrude Shurr.         Ms. O'Donnell toured with José Limón from 1940 to 1942. She returned to Graham's company in 1944, dancing as a guest artist for nine years. During that time she created the major roles of the Attendant in Graham's ''Herodiade'' (1944), She of the Earth in ''Dark Meadow'' (1946) and the Chorus in ''Cave of the Heart'' (1946). She also danced principal roles in ''Letter to the World,'' ''Deaths and Entrances,'' ''Every Soul Is a Circus'' and ''Primitive Mysteries.'' She retired from the stage in 1961.         Ms. O'Donnell choreographed from 1937 to 1988, presenting her first program of her own work in 1939. In 1949 she founded a New York-based company that performed into the 1980's. In 2002 she received the Martha Hill Lifetime Achievement Award.         Her repertory of 50 documented dances included many collaborations with Mr. Green, who died in 1997. Ms. O'Donnell is survived by a brother, Charles Melton O'Donnell of Sacramento.         Ms. O'Donnell was also an influential teacher. Her students included Gerald Arpino, Cora Cahan, Robert Joffrey, Ben Vereen and Dudley Williams. Mr. Vereen recalled Ms. O'Donnell's mystique in a 1983 interview in The New York Times.         ''May was very gentle, even then, and her classes had such an easy flow,'' he said. ''Complete journeys in themselves. I always wanted to get closer to her. But I was very shy.'' She taught only once a week, he said, adding: ''I'd think in between, 'Where does she go?' She'd bring in this wonderful, warm love and then disappear.''       
         Josephine Schwarz, a pioneer of the American regional ballet movement and a co-founder of the Dayton Ballet, died on Friday in Boulder, Colo., said her niece, Johannah Franke. She was 95.         Ms. Schwarz and her sister, Hermene Schwarz, who died in 1986, were natives of Dayton who, through decades of persistence, made that city a dance center. They founded the Schwarz School of Dance (now the Dayton Ballet School) in 1927 and in 1937 the Dayton Ballet (originally known as the Experimental Group for Young Dancers), one of America's oldest ballet companies.         Josephine Schwarz soon established herself as a dance crusader who believed in the importance of both classical ballet and modern dance. Her students over the years included Daniel and Joseph Duell, brothers who joined the New York City Ballet; Rebecca Wright, who went into American Ballet Theater; Donna Wood of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater; and Jeff Gribler of the Pennsylvania Ballet.         Ms. Schwarz and her sister, who were white, taught black students at a time when some white residents of Dayton frowned upon such classes. One of those students, Jeraldyne Blunden, founded the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company in 1968. Like the Dayton Ballet, it continues to flourish. The Dayton Ballet became a charter member of the Northeast Regional Ballet Association in 1959, and in the years that followed the Schwarz sisters organized many choreography conferences and regional festivals.         After receiving her early training in Dayton, Josephine Schwarz studied ballet in Chicago with Adolph Bolm and in 1926 performed with his Ballet Intime. She later studied at the School of American Ballet in New York and studied modern dance with Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman in New York, and Mary Wigman and Rosalia Chladek in Europe. She danced on Broadway in ''Life Begins at 8:40'' in 1935. But when an injury ended her performing career in 1937, she returned to Dayton.         Ms. Schwarz was a former member of the dance advisory panel of the National Endowment for the Arts, and she held honorary doctorates from Wright State University, in Dayton, and the University of Dayton. In 1990 she retired from the Dayton Ballet, which is now directed by Dermot Burke. She moved to Boulder in 1994.         In addition to Ms. Franke, of Boulder, she is survived by two nephews, Peter Schwarz, of Denver, and Brian Schwarz, of Jackson, Wyo., and several grandnieces and grandnephews.       
         Ella Johnson, a jazz singer who performed with her brother Buddy Johnson in his dance bands in the 1940's and 50's, died in New York on Feb. 16, her nephew James Johnson Jr. said. She was 86.         A smooth singer with a seductive delivery, Ms. Johnson was often compared to Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald. But as a part of her brother's rollicking bands, she also helped forge a link to R&B and early rock 'n' roll.         Ms. Johnson was born in Darlington, S.C., and moved to New York to join Buddy, her older brother, while still in her teens. Though only two years older than Ella, Buddy had become an established musician in New York and was leading groups at the Savoy Ballroom and elsewhere.         Her first hit with Buddy was ''Please, Mr. Johnson'' in 1940, and she continued to record and perform with him into the 1960's. Among her best-known songs was ''Since I Fell for You (1945), a ballad written by Buddy that was later performed by Mel Tormé and George Shearing, Annie Laurie, Lenny Welch and others.         She also sang ''When My Man Comes Home,'' ''Hittin' on Me,'' ''Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball?'' and ''I Don't Want Nobody.''         Among her survivors are her husband, Odell Day; four brothers, Edward Parrott and Earl Johnson of Darlington, and Allan and Wesley Parrott of New York; a sister, Hattie Miller of Landover, Md.; and a granddaughter, Lisa.       
         Genia Melikova, a leading ballerina with the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas and a noted ballet teacher in the United States, died on March 5. She was 74.         Alice Helpern, a friend and colleague, said that Ms. Melikova collapsed in the lobby of her apartment building in Manhattan and was taken to a hospital, where she died.         Born in France, Ms. Melikova trained with Lubov Egorova, Anatole Vilzak, Igor Schwezoff and other teachers. She performed briefly with American Ballet Theater before joining the Paris-based de Cuevas company, the first European troupe to feature ballets by American choreographers as well as American dancers. Ms. Melikova danced with the de Cuevas company from 1954 to 1962. Her roles included Aurora and the Lilac Fairy in ''The Sleeping Beauty'' and Odette-Odile in ''Swan Lake,'' in which she was the first Western ballerina to perform with Rudolf Nureyev after his defection in 1961.         Ms. Melikova also performed with the London Festival Ballet and Grand Ballet Classique de France in the early 1960's before settling in New York City, where she danced at Radio City Music Hall and on Broadway. She became known as a gifted teacher and was praised by dance reviewers as a choreographer with a special aptitude for showing young students at their best in ballets that revealed her own sense of design and musicality.         She taught for 26 years at the Dance Division of the Juilliard School, which hired her on the recommendation of the ballet choreographer Antony Tudor, with whom she had worked in Europe. At her death, Ms. Melikova was a guest instructor at Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Va., where she had taught since 1996. She also taught in New York City at the Igor Youskevitch School of Ballet and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center.         In the mid-1970's Ms. Melikova directed the Bridgeport Ballet Company in Connecticut and the Bernhard Ballet, where she drew praise for her restaging of classics that included George Balanchine's ''Minkus Pas de Trois'' and John Taras's ''Design for Strings.''       
         Ludmilla Tcherina, a raven-haired French artist and ballet star who danced for many of Europe's top choreographers, died on Sunday at her home in Paris at the age of 79, France's culture ministry said today.         The cause of her death was not immediately known.         Famous for her beauty as much as her temperament, Ms. Tcherina dazzled audiences around the world, especially in films like ''The Red Shoes.'' During the 1940's and 1950's she danced in New York, Milan, Buenos Aires, Monte Carlo and Paris; in 1960 she danced at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow.         As choreographer, actress, painter and writer as well as dancer, she tried to associate the different art forms in some of her performances. ''When you dance, you can paint, sculpt, even write and compose,'' she once wrote.         Born in Paris on Oct. 10, 1924, of a Georgian father and a French mother, Monika Tchemerzine, as Ms. Tcherina was baptized, began dancing as a child. She quickly made her mark. From 1940 to 1944 she danced at the Théâtre de Monte Carlo in the company that became the Nouveaux Ballets de Monte Carlo. In 1942 she danced the role of Juliet in Serge Lifar's new ballet ''Roméo et Juliette'' in Paris.         Her main dancing partner, Edmond Audran, became her husband, but he died in a car accident in 1951. Distraught, she stopped dancing. But two years later she was persuaded to return to the stage by her new husband, Raymond Roi, who survives her.         Ms. Tcherina inspired new ballets by Maurice Béjart and Roland Petit.         One of her great successes was her performance in 1957 in Debussy's ''Martyrdom of St. Sebastian,'' a work that combines music, dance and drama. Reviewing the production for a Paris daily, the French writer François Mauriac wrote: ''Ludmilla Tcherina in the role of St. Sebastian has a grace that is the Grace of God. If the love of God can be expressed through dance, that miracle came to pass last night.''         From the 1940's through the 1970's, Ms. Tcherina appeared in 22 movies, among them ''The Red Shoes'' and ''The Tales of Hoffmann.'' She created several monumental structures in the late 1980's and early 1990's. And, during the 1980's, she published two novels and a screenplay.       
         Lynn L. Seidler, the former executive director of the Shubert Foundation, which provides grants to support live professional theater and dance, died on Thursday while vacationing in the Turks and Caicos Islands. She was 67 and lived in Sanibel, Fla.         The cause was lung cancer, which was diagnosed a year ago, said her husband, Lee J. Seidler.         Ms. Seidler became the foundation's first director in 1975, turning it into one of the largest grant-making institutions for the arts in the country.         Under Ms. Seidler's leadership, the program took an unconventional approach to giving money. Instead of putting funds into bricks and mortar, she set Shubert grants aside for non-profit theaters, drama schools and dance companies in need of help with operating expenses.         The foundation currently distributes several hundred grants each year, ranging from $5,000 to $275,000. Last year it gave $13 million.         Ms. Seidler also founded the Shubert Archive. In 1976 she dusted off a trove of materials that for years had been sitting in boxes in the attics and basements of various Shubert theaters. With six million items, the archive is now one of the largest collections of theater memorabilia in the country.         Ms. Seidler retired from the foundation in 1994.         She was born Lynn Lopatin in New Brunswick, N.J., on Aug. 13, 1936. She received a bachelor's degree in liberal arts from Lake Erie College in 1958 and a master's degree in speech therapy from New York University in 1970.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her father, William Lopatin of Sanibel; a daughter, Laurie, of San Jose, Calif.; and a grandson.       
         Sofia Golovkina, a former ballerina with the Bolshoi Ballet who directed the Moscow Ballet School, the company's affiliated academy, with an iron grip for 40 years, died on Feb. 17 in Moscow. She was 88.         Ms. Golovkina, whose death was reported by the Novosti press agency, was familiar to American ballet audiences. She toured her pupils in the United States in 1973 and 1989 and directed a summer school, the Bolshoi Academy at Vail, at the Vail International Dance Festival in Colorado, for several years after 1990. In 1993 she managed to persuade President Bill Clinton, then visiting Vail, to share a curtain call with her students.         Ms. Golovkina was an assertive representative of Soviet-era ballet, and her students won many international competitions.         Not everyone appreciated her aggressive manner. During their first appearance in New York in 1973, the Bolshoi pupils were invited to the New York City Ballet by George Balanchine. Backstage, when Ms. Golovkina started lecturing him on ballet, he turned on his heel and left.         Ms. Golovkina's temperament was well suited to the heroic roles she performed in Soviet ballets influenced by the Socialist realism of the 1930's and 40's.         She also appeared in the classics. She performed with the Bolshoi Ballet from 1933 to 1959 after graduating from the Bolshoi school in 1933. In 1960 she was named director of the school, where she taught the advanced classes for women.         In the 1970's she supervised construction of a new school building. In 2001 Boris Akimov succeeded her as director of the school.       
         Rosemary Park Anastos, an advocate for women's education and the liberal arts and a former president of Barnard College and Connecticut College for Women, died April 17 at her home in Los Angeles, said a niece, Joan Citron. She was 97.         Dr. Park, as she was known professionally, came from a family of academics: her mother was a teacher, her father and brother were also college presidents. When she left the Barnard presidency in 1967 after five years, she became the first woman to be a vice chancellor at the University of California. At her Barnard inauguration in 1963, she said that ''to avoid becoming a nursery school to the university with custodial and elementary responsibilities only,'' the college must make its liberal arts more sophisticated. She said that meant moving beyond acquiring facts to the mastery of subjects like advanced mathematics, political and economic theory and classical philosophy.         At Connecticut, where she was president from 1947 to 1962, she expanded the student body by one-third, strengthened the curriculum, built major new buildings and was a tireless fund-raiser. She made the campus a national center for modern dance and generally enhanced the college's reputation. When Yale gave her an honorary degree in 1958, it said she had been a major force in ''adding a bright star to the galaxy of liberal arts colleges for women.''         At Barnard, she followed a similar agenda, strengthening the curriculum, adding major buildings and raising money. But she left after five years, pulled by her marriage in 1965 to Milton Vasil Anastos, a professor of Byzantine Greek at the University of California, Los Angeles. He died in 1997. Dr. Park is survived by her stepson, Milton V. Anastos Jr., of Warwick, R.I., and several nieces and nephews.         Of her departure for California, David Truman, dean of Columbia College, wrote in Barnard's alumnae magazine that although she was the only woman at many Columbia meetings, her wisdom and humor gave weight to her advice and made her ''one of the best men in the university.''         Not all of her dealings with Columbia were harmonious, however, as she related in an interview with Helen S. Astin, a U.C.L.A. colleague, in ''The Higher Education of Women: Essays in Honor of Rosemary Park.'' When she proposed a new science laboratory for Barnard, she said, Columbia discouraged her, saying its labs were sufficient. But, she said, Barnard did not control those labs, and the absence of its own lab would send a signal ''that it didn't believe in science for women.'' Barnard built a new lab.         Born in Andover, Mass., Dr. Park was the oldest of four children of J. Edgar Park, a minister raised in Ireland who became president of Wheaton College, in Massachusetts, and Grace Burtt Park, who taught Greek and mathematics. Her brother, William E. Park, was president of Simmons College, in Boston.         She studied German at Radcliffe and graduated summa cum laude. She later studied at the University of Bonn in 1930 and in 1934 earned a Ph.D. at the University of Cologne. She began teaching German part time, first at Wheaton, then at Connecticut College, where she became dean of freshmen, academic dean, acting president, then president.         She spoke and wrote widely on education, the role of women and other topics, often breaking from conventional wisdom. She told parents that they should encourage their children to take courses in advanced mathematics and French, because society would need scientists and linguists. She said that schools facing teacher shortages should think about using television and older students to help with the teaching; both, she said, had proved effective.         She often leavened her seriousness with wit. In one speech, she took a swipe at English usage: ''At some point in most of the professions, the regrettable expression 'load' arose: case load, patient load, teaching load,'' she said. ''Artists, as far as I know, do not refer to picture load, poem load or concert load.''         Although she supported women's education, she was not a zealot. In her interview with Dr. Astin, Dr. Park said that women's colleges were ''particularly important for girls who develop slowly,'' but said men might benefit ''from the same kind of protective environment.'' She predicted that women's colleges would become less necessary, and she won authority to establish Connecticut College for Men and then admitted men as graduate students.         She was an energetic fund-raiser at a time when it was not always viewed as dignified. To raise $3.1 million for Connecticut College, she crossed the country, meeting with executives who questioned the need to finance women's education.         She became a vice chancellor at U.C.L.A. in 1967, and then a professor. In 1980, she helped develop the Plato Society, a U.C.L.A. study program for retired people. Until a few months ago, she was a member herself, taking courses like ''Romantic Composers'' and ''Brain and Memory.''       
         Lygia Pape, an influential Brazilian artist who worked in two important movements, Concretism and the looser Neo-Concretism, and later moved beyond them, died on May 3 in Rio de Janeiro. She was 77.         The cause was complications of myelodysplasia, a blood disease, said her daughter Paula Pape.         A restlessly experimental artist, Ms. Pape (pronounced PAH-pay) worked at challenging formal and conceptual limits in many different media, including painting, printmaking, sculpture, dance, film, performance and installation. In the 1950's she was involved in Concretism, which was based on severe abstract styles of European painters like Piet Mondrian and Kasimir Malevich. In 1954 she helped found an important Concretist group called la Frente (the Front).         At the end of the decade she joined her fellow artists Hélio Oiticica and Lygia Clark in founding Neo-Concretism, which rejected the formal remove of Concretist art but retained its insistence on the concrete reality of the artwork as opposed to more representational imagery.         Favoring more interactive relations between art and viewers, the Neo-Concretists sought to expand the formal, expressive and social dimensions of art. Among Ms. Pape's Neo-Concretist works were books with semiabstract sculptural elements that viewers were encouraged to handle.         In a ballet that Ms. Pape choreographed in 1958, simple geometric shapes with people hidden inside moved about the stage. Ten years later she created one of her best-known pieces, ''Divisor,'' a performance work in which dozens of people poked their heads through holes in a gridded arrangement in a large sheet of white cloth. It has been interpreted as a comment on modern bureaucracy as well as on the split between mind and body.         In the 60's Ms. Pape worked with a filmmaking group called Cinema Novo, for which she designed lettering and posters. She also made short experimental films of her own, some only seconds long. In later decades she created large-scale and often surrealistically dramatic installations using lights, plants, food, flowing liquids, fabric and other materials.         Her work was seen in New York in ''Body and Soul,'' a 400-year survey of Brazilian art at the Guggenheim Museum in 2001. Two works from her Neo-Concretist phase are currently on view at El Museo del Barrio in Manhattan in an exhibition of Latin American works from the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.         Ms. Pape was born on April 7, 1927, in the Novo Friburgo section of Rio. Like many Brazilian artists, she studied studio art informally, but she did receive a master's degree in the philosophy of art from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 1980.         From 1972 to 1985, Ms. Pape taught semiotics at the school of architecture at the Universidade Santa Ursula in Rio. She was appointed professor in the school of fine arts of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 1983.         In addition to her daughter Paula, Ms. Pape is survived by her husband, Gunther Pape; another daughter, Cristina Maria; and two grandsons.       
         June Taylor, the Emmy-winning choreographer whose routines on ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' brought the chorus line into the television age, died on Sunday at a hospital in Miami, said her sister, Marilyn Gleason. She was 86 and lived in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.         Each week ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' opened with a number by the 16 high-kicking, wide-smiling young women of the June Taylor Dancers. Their routines, created by Ms. Taylor, were intricate, expensive and wholesome-looking updates of the classic Broadway chorus lines.         To accommodate the square format of television, the dancers were often shot from above, resulting in kaleidoscopic patterns of limbs that recalled the films of Busby Berkeley.         Besides the three-minute numbers that opened each show, Ms. Taylor also choreographed longer routines for special broadcasts. In 1953 Gleason and Ms. Taylor collaborated on ''Tawny,'' a ballet of more than 20 minutes with music by Gleason. A review by Jack Gould in The New York Times said the piece cost a reported $30,000 to produce. ''Every penny was well spent,'' he wrote, ''for here was popular commercial television displaying artistic vision and imagination.''         Ms. Taylor won an Emmy Award for her choreography on ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' in 1955.         Born in Chicago, Ms. Taylor was a seasoned nightclub dancer when her career was derailed by tuberculosis at age 20. She turned to choreography, hitting the road with her own company. She met Gleason, then a little-known comedian, at a Baltimore nightclub in 1946.         Ms. Taylor began working on television in 1948 on Ed Sullivan's ''Toast of the Town'' and later worked on ''Cavalcade of Stars,'' which Gleason joined in 1950. ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' began in 1952 and ran until 1959; it returned to television in 1962 and ran until 1970.         Gleason moved his show in 1964 from New York to Miami, where he could play golf all year long, and Ms. Taylor remained in Florida after the show ended. In 1978 she was invited by the Miami Dolphins football team to direct the team's cheerleaders. She turned her demanding techniques to the squad. She also favored costumes that were throwbacks to her earlier days. The Dolphins' Web site says that it was not until Ms. Taylor retired in 1990 that the women updated their uniforms with, for example, sneakers while they were on the sidelines.         Besides her sister, of Fort Lauderdale, who married Gleason in 1975, Ms. Taylor is survived by a nephew, Craig Horwich of Chicago. Her husband, Sol Lerner, died in 1986.         Ms. Taylor often spoke of television's demands on dance. ''One of the first things I learned in television was the necessity of varying the style of the dancing each week,'' she said in an interview in 1953. ''People want something new. My girls, I believe, are the best hoofers in the business. They know tap, ballet, classical ballet, toe work, modern and acrobatic dancing.''         Mrs. Gleason, who was a dancer in her sister's group, remarked that speed was a necessity.         ''We were on television,'' she said yesterday, ''and we had to move fast. The only comparison was the Rockettes, but we danced four times faster than they did.''       
         Betty Oliphant, a British-born teacher who as director of the National Ballet School in Toronto became a leading figure in ballet, died on Monday in St. Catharines, Ontario, near Toronto. She was 85.         Her death was announced by a school spokeswoman, Pamela Rice.         She was a ballet mistress of the National Ballet of Canada and director of the National Ballet School until her retirement in 1989. She was known for stressing technical mastery, not for the sake of virtuosity alone but as a means of achieving freedom of expression.         Under Ms. Oliphant's guidance, the National Ballet School became an internationally respected institution. In 1967, Erik Bruhn, the great Danish dancer, asked Ms. Oliphant to reorganize the Royal Swedish Ballet School, and she helped reorganize the Royal Danish Ballet School in 1978.         She was known as ''Miss O'' to several generations of students, and she titled her 1996 autobiography ''Miss O: My Life in Dance.'' Many leading Canadian dancers and choreographers studied with her over the years, including Frank Augustyn, Veronica Tennant, Karen Kain, Rex Harrington, John Alleyne and James Kudelka, the National Ballet's artistic director.         Ms. Oliphant studied dance in London, moved to Canada in 1947 and opened a school in Toronto. After meeting Celia Franca, the British-born founder of the National Ballet of Canada, she was appointed its ballet mistress in 1952 and served as its associate artistic director from 1969 to '75. She and Ms. Franca founded the National Ballet School in 1959, and Ms. Oliphant directed it until her retirement. In 1988 the National Ballet School named its theater the Betty Oliphant Theater.         Although Ms. Oliphant and Ms. Franca never met in London, both had similar dance backgrounds. Both studied with the great English choreographer Antony Tudor and with Marie Rambert, one of the pioneers of modern British ballet. Ms. Oliphant also studied with Tamara Karsavina and Laurent Novikoff.         Ms. Oliphant is survived by two daughters, Gail Sadova and Carol Roach, a grandson and a great-granddaughter.       
         Bella Lewitzky, a modern-dance pioneer and an outspoken champion of artistic freedom, died on Friday in an assisted-care center in Pasadena, Calif. She was 88.         She had a heart attack after a stroke, said Marjorie Perces, a friend.         A fearless and tireless dancer, choreographer, teacher and cultural crusader, Ms. Lewitzky struggled to make modern dance a major art form in California and to make Los Angeles an important dance center. She campaigned passionately for government support of the arts. Yet she was undaunted by attempts to limit artistic freedom.         Ms. Lewitzky, who was politically active all her life, was called before a hearing of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1951 and asked to identify acquaintances who might have been members of the Communist Party. She declined to supply names, giving the punning reply, ''I am a dancer, not a singer.''         Decades later, when the National Endowment for the Arts started requiring grant recipients to sign an anti-obscenity pledge, Ms. Lewitzky and her company filed a lawsuit, and in January 1991, a federal judge found the pledge unconstitutional.         Ms. Lewitzky was born in Llano del Rio, a utopian socialist community in the Mojave Desert. Her family later settled in San Bernardino, where Ms. Lewitzky received dance and piano lessons. Dance especially fascinated her, and her love of the art grew during the 1930's, when she attended classes taught by Lester Horton, the Los Angeles area's most prominent modern dancer at that time.         She soon established herself as a charismatic performer with the Horton Dance Group, starring in highly dramatic works by Mr. Horton like ''Salome'' (1937) and ''The Beloved'' (1948), in which she portrayed a wife accused of adultery by her puritanical husband.         Other company members included Rudi Gernreich, who became an innovative fashion designer and a stage designer for some of Ms. Lewitzky's later productions, and Newell Reynolds, Ms. Lewitzky's husband, who later became an architect.         Ms. Lewitzky left Horton in 1950 to pursue an independent career. She developed a considerable reputation as a dynamic teacher, holding posts at the University of Southern California, the Idyllwild arts school (accepting an appointment there without signing its loyalty oath) and the California Institute of the Arts. She also served as a guest teacher around the world.         She directed the Los Angeles-based Bella Lewitzky Dance Company from 1966 to 1997. It first traveled to the East Coast in 1971, appearing at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn., and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.         As a performer, Ms. Lewitzky was a fiery stage personality. Anna Kisselgoff described her in The New York Times in 1971 as ''an extraordinary artist with an astounding mastery of technique.''         But as the creator of works like ''On the Brink of Time'' (1969), ''Kinaesonata'' (1970) and ''Greening'' (1976), she favored a cooler choreographic style.         In directing her group, Ms. Lewitzky was deeply concerned about her dancers' welfare. Her company members were always fully insured, and she paid them annual salaries even when they did not perform every month of a year.         Ms. Lewitzky served on the dance panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and on the California Arts Council and was the recipient of the Dance Magazine Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Tiffany Award, the National Medal of Arts, the Capezio Award and, in 1989, the first California Governor's Award for Lifetime Achievement.         Ms. Lewitzky and her husband lived in New Mexico in the 1990's but returned to Southern California in 2001. In addition to her husband, she is survived by her daughter, Nora Reynolds, a dancer, and two grandsons, Keenan and Ross McCune.       
         Yoko Watanabe, a Japanese soprano who was renowned for the gracefulness and intensity of her portrayal of Cio-Cio-San, the tragic title character of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' died on July 15 at her home in Milan. She was 51.         A Japan Opera Foundation official announced her death to The Associated Press but did not give a cause. Miss Watanabe learned she had cancer in 2000.         Miss Watanabe was born in Fukuoka, Japan, in 1953 and early on, hoped to make a career as a dancer. She began studying Japanese dance when she was 3 and ballet when she was 6, but gave up dancing when her teachers said she was too tall and broad-shouldered for a professional career. She then took up the piano and became an accomplished player.         Miss Watanabe gave recitals until she was 18, but she was already thinking about the opera stage. When she was 16, she attended a performance of ''Madama Butterfly'' that, she said later, changed her life.         ''I knew immediately that I wanted to sing opera,'' she told The New York Times in 1988. ''When the performance was over, I went to the stage door and asked the soprano who sang Cio-Cio-San -- Kuniko Kozono -- to please teach me. And she did.''         From there, Miss Watanabe continued her studies at the University of Japan in Tokyo. A competition victory in 1976 took her to La Scala in Milan, where she continued her studies. Miss Watanabe had won second prize in that Tokyo competition. The first-prize winner was Renato Grimaldi, an Italian tenor whom she married and who survives her.         Another competition victory led to Miss Watanabe's professional debut, as Nedda in Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci,'' in Treviso, Italy, in 1978. She made her La Scala debut in 1985 as Liù in Puccini's ''Turandot,'' and in her 20-year career she sang other major Puccini heroines as well as roles in works of Mozart, Verdi, Gounod and Bizet.         But the portrayal for which she was best known was Cio-Cio-San, the geisha who marries an American naval officer and is abandoned by him. It was as Cio-Cio-San that she made her debuts with the Royal Opera in 1983, the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1986, and the Metropolitan Opera in 1987.         Reviewing her Met debut for The New York Times, Will Crutchfield described Miss Watanabe's tone as having ''more metal than cream in it'' but praised her ''heartfelt portrayal'' and the subtleties of her characterization. Part of her success, too, came from the way she balanced Western and Japanese acting styles.         ''I am Japanese, and my figure is Japanese,'' she said, ''but the music is Italian, so I try not to do too much of what we would think of as Japanese theatrical movement. In Japanese theater, our movements are very small. We walk in small steps, we make small gestures. I don't believe those would really convey the character of Butterfly fully to the public. After all, this is a very dramatic opera.''         Miss Watanabe collapsed during a performance in December 1999 and retired a month later when her doctors diagnosed her cancer.       
         Izora Rhodes Armstead, one half of the disco-pop duo the Weather Girls, who sang the flamboyant and enduring club hit ''It's Raining Men,'' died on Sept. 16 at a hospital in San Leandro, Calif. Her age was unknown.         The cause was heart failure, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. The church where Ms. Armstead's funeral was held, St. John Missionary Baptist in San Francisco, confirmed her death.         ''It's Raining Men,'' a bombastic vocal romp that winkingly borrowed from gospel music -- ''Hallelujah, it's raining men, amen!'' goes its chorus -- was one of the biggest hits of the genre known as hi-NRG, a souped-up version of disco that ruled dance clubs in the 1980's.         Sung with gusto by Ms. Armstead, then known as Izora Rhodes, and her partner, Martha Wash, the song only reached No. 46 on the pop charts when it was released in 1983, but hit No. 1 on the club charts and later reached No. 2 in England.         Written by Paul Jabara and Paul Shaffer -- now of ''Late Show With David Letterman'' -- the song has since become an anthem of the gay club scene and in 2001 it again reached the top of the British charts with a version by a former Spice Girl, Geri Halliwell.         The song was the centerpiece of the group's first album, ''Success,'' which featured another booming Jabara-Shaffer composition, ''Dear Santa (Bring Me a Man This Christmas)'' and a version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair.''         Ms. Armstead and Ms. Wash met in San Francisco in the mid-70's when they both joined a gospel group called Now (News of the World). They were soon recruited to sing backup for Sylvester, a cross-dressing disco singer with a local following.         The two sang on four Sylvester albums, including the hit songs ''Dance (Disco Heat)'' and ''(You Make Me Feel) Mighty Real.''         The two went solo in 1979 under the name Two Tons o' Fun, a play on their Rubenesque physiques. They issued one album under that name before rechristening themselves the Weather Girls for ''Success.'' They recorded two more albums before disbanding in the late 80's.         After the Weather Girls, Ms. Wash sang, often anonymously, for C and C Music Factory, Black Box and other groups, and Ms. Armstead moved to Germany to found a new Weather Girls group with her daughter Dynell Rhodes, who survives Ms. Armstead, along with six other children and several grandchildren.       
         Margaret Kelly, a proper Irishwoman better known as Miss Bluebell who founded the Bluebell Girls, the long-stemmed, high-kicking, slightly clad troupe considered the most glamorous chorus line in Paris and perhaps the world, died in her sleep on Sept. 11 at her home in Paris, her son Patrick Leibovici said. She was 94.         Founded in 1932, the Bluebell Girls are one of the last remaining companies to dance the traditional cancan, with its flying kicks and punishing splits. They are still the featured act at the Lido, on the Champs-Élysées, performing in glittering clouds of sequins, ostrich feathers, voluminous headgear and not a great deal else.         To generations of showgirls -- she is said to have trained 14,000 -- Miss Kelly was talent scout, taskmaster, chaperon, mother confessor and dispenser of tea. Until her retirement at 79, she supervised the Bluebells' every performance (two shows a day, seven days a week) with military precision, while ferociously guarding their virtue from a stream of stage-door Lotharios.         A global franchise, the troupe toured internationally and had resident companies in Reno, Nev., and Las Vegas, where a colony of retired Bluebells still live.         Bluebell Girls are very beautiful, and very tall. As Miss Kelly told The Los Angeles Times in 1985, ''They must have long legs, be at least 5-foot-10, with high, well-formed derrières, firm breasts, but not too large because, since the demise of the brassiere, dangling, voluminous breasts appear unpleasant, anti-aesthetic.''         Her life was the subject of a BBC miniseries, ''Bluebell,'' in 1986, but Miss Kelly complained that the film's eight hours could scarcely begin to tell her story. She was abandoned as an infant; grew up poor; danced her way across the cabaret stages of Europe as a teenager; worked with Maurice Chevalier, Josephine Baker and Edith Piaf; was interned during World War II; saved her husband from the Nazis; raised four children; could still dance the cancan in her 60's; smoked a pack of cigarettes every day of her adult life; and was awarded the French Legion of Honor and the Order of the British Empire.         Margaret Kelly was born in Dublin on June 24, 1910. Shortly afterward, her parents left her with the parish priest and never returned. She was placed with a local woman, who adopted Margaret and moved with her to a suburb of Liverpool, where they lived, Miss Kelly would later say, a threadbare but happy life.         A frail child (she was nicknamed Bluebell by a doctor, struck by her wispy frame and piercing blue eyes), Margaret was advised to take dancing lesson to strengthen her legs. At 14, she was performing in nightclubs in Britain and on the continent. At 19, Miss Kelly was a featured dancer at the Folies-Bergère in Paris, where she eventually started Les Bluebell Girls.         In 1939, she married Marcel Leibovici, a pianist who wrote songs for Piaf. When the Nazis invaded Paris the following year, Miss Kelly, a British subject, was sent to an internment camp in eastern France. She was released, her son said, only when the Irish ambassador intervened, ''much to the delight of the German jailers, because she had by then organized the whole barracks to an English way of life, with teatime and everything.''         Miss Kelly returned to Paris, where her husband, who was Jewish, was in hiding. She bribed the concierge of his apartment building, who had betrayed other tenants, to keep his whereabouts secret.         Mr. Leibovici died in a car accident in 1961. Miss Kelly is survived by two sons, Patrick, of Las Vegas, and Francis of Palaiseau, France; a daughter, Florence Shapiro, of Las Vegas; and five grandchildren. Another son, Jean-Paul, died in 1996.         After the war, Miss Kelly revived her company at the Lido, scouring the globe to find women who met her precise specifications. Many were English (she thought French girls too short), and classically trained dancers grown too tall for ballet.         Risqué even by Paris standards, the Bluebell Girls were in great demand. By the 1960's, Miss Kelly, after an inward moral struggle, allowed them to perform bare-breasted. An Arab sheik once tried to purchase the entire troupe, Newsweek once reported, and an Italian magnate offered 16 white Ferraris in trade. But Miss Kelly watched over every aspect of the Bluebells' conduct, on stage and off, and there was no sale.         After all, the young women she affectionately called ''my girls'' were no common chorines. ''I created class with chorus girls,'' Miss Kelly told The New York Times in 1988. ''Although the girls are topless, it's done with taste and elegance.''       
         Barbara Schwei, a founder and the producer of the American Indian Dance Theater, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Manhattan. She was 57.         The cause was breast cancer, according to Les Schecter, a friend.         Born in Milwaukee, Ms. Schwei received her degree in theater from New York University. She began her career in the late 1960's as a theatrical press agent. She was a producer of the 1973 Broadway stage musical ''Nash at Nine'' and, with James Nederlander, the ''International Music Stars'' series. She produced concerts in New York and across the United States and Canada by European pop music performers and composers including Enrico Macias, Gilbert Bécaud, Charles Trenet and Domenico Modugno.         Ms. Schwei founded the American Indian Dance Theater in 1987 with Hanay Geiogamah, its artistic director. It was the first all-American Indian professional company of dancers, singers and musicians, with a repertory of traditional pieces that crossed tribal lines and cultures. The company, which has also performed modern work by choreographers including Laura Dean, has appeared twice in the PBS ''Great Performances'' series and was featured on Turner Broadcasting's 1994 documentary series ''The Native Americans.'' It has toured North America, Europe and the Middle and Far East.         The company also released an original cast album for which Ms. Schwei was nominated as producer for a Grammy Award in 1990.         Ms. Schwei is survived by a brother, Peter, of Dodgeville, Wisc.       
         Carol Mezzacappa, a dancer and choreographer who staged many works by the modern-dance pioneer Charles Weidman, died on Oct. 12 in a hospice in Brooklyn, where she lived. She was 47.         The cause was brain cancer, according to an announcement from the Charles Weidman Foundation.         Ms. Mezzacappa was president of the foundation and the artistic and executive director of Dance Consort: Mezzacappa-Gabrian, a company she founded with her husband, the dancer Craig Gabrian.         The dance idiom developed by Doris Humphrey and Weidman in 1928 after they left Denishawn, the company that spawned other pioneers like Martha Graham, remained at the heart of Ms. Mezzacappa's performances. Writing in The New York Times in 1994, Jennifer Dunning praised the ''playful, robust'' style of Dance Consort in Weidman's ''Brahms Waltzes.''         Both Dance Consort and its junior troupe in Brooklyn, Young Dancers in Repertory, were devoted to Weidman's movement principles and the presentation of his works.         Born in Brooklyn, Ms. Mezzacappa studied the Humphrey-Weidman technique with Weidman, Nona Schurman, Peter Hamilton and Ernestine Stodelle. A graduate of Brooklyn College, Ms. Mezzacappa brought her expertise in staging Weidman works to theaters in New York and to colleges and dance programs.         She is survived by her husband; her parents, Beatrice and Michael Mezzacappa; and her sister, Diane Alvaro.       
         Dame Alicia Markova, one of the greatest British ballerinas of the 20th century, co-founder of the company now known as the English National Ballet and a former director of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, died yesterday in Bath, England, the English National Ballet announced. She was 94.         Famous for her delicacy, Dame Alicia was indelibly associated with ''Giselle,'' the supreme example of 19th-century balletic Romanticism. It was as Giselle that she made her American debut with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, giving a performance that was thought to set a standard for any other dancer attempting the part. She later performed Giselle as a star of Ballet Theater (as American Ballet Theater was originally called) and as a guest artist with companies around the world. She was so closely identified with the ballet that in 1960 she titled her autobiography ''Giselle and I.''         Audiences never tired of watching Dame Alicia in ''Giselle''; she, in turn, never seemed to tire of dancing it. Reviewing a 1958 performance by Ballet Theater in which Miss Markova appeared as guest artist, John Martin, then the dance critic of The New York Times, remarked: ''Markova has danced the role so many times that she could undoubtedly do it in her sleep; what is so notable is that she never does. She is as fresh, as sensitive, as creatively alert as if she had never done it before; but what a wealth of background she has accumulated for it!''         Lillian Alicia Marks was born in London on Dec. 1, 1910. A knock-kneed child, she was sent by her doctor to a London school called Miss Thorne's Dancing Academy. She astounded her teacher with her ability to do anything asked of her, and she was soon cast in dancing roles in Christmas pantomimes.         Mrs. Marks took her daughter to a London school run by the ballerina Serafina Astafieva. She presented Astafieva with a card bearing the child's name as she had been billed in the pantomimes: ''Little Alicia: The Miniature Pavlova.'' Aghast at this presumption, Astafieva slammed the door in their faces. Later, however, she saw Alicia dance and accepted her as a pupil.         In 1924 the teenage Alicia became the youngest member of Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, the greatest ballet company of its day. She danced her first leading role in 1926, when she portrayed the nightingale in ''Le Rossignol,'' choreographed by George Balanchine to music by Stravinsky. Non-Russian dancers in the Ballets Russes were expected to change their names, and it was Diaghilev who gave the British dancer her professional name. He also gave Miss Markova a governess, who made sure that her charge went to bed early when she was not performing and saw to it that she did not overindulge in chocolates and that she attended no social occasions but chaperoned teas.         After Diaghilev died in 1929, Miss Markova returned to London and became active with both of the pioneering British ballet groups of the day, the Ballet Rambert and the Vic-Wells Ballet, the last of which developed into the Royal Ballet. Because she was already an esteemed dancer, her presence lent prestige to these troupes and, because she was British, she proved that ballet was not something in which only Russians could excel.         In 1934 she formed the Markova-Dolin Ballet with another British dancer, Anton Dolin, the partner with whom she was associated for much of her career. She joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, remaining with it until 1941, when she joined Ballet Theater, where Mr. Dolin was again her partner. In 1945 they formed a Markova-Dolin Ballet in America.         Returning to Britain after the war, they made their troupe the basis of the London Festival Ballet (today's English National Ballet). Mr. Dolin was its first director; Miss Markova was its ballerina until 1952, after which she devoted herself to guest performances. She retired as a dancer in 1963, the year Queen Elizabeth II named her Dame of the British Empire.         Known for her beautiful purity of line and her classic simplicity of movement, Dame Alicia was admired in ''Swan Lake'' and ''Les Sylphides'' as well as in ''Giselle.'' Yet this ethereal ballerina could surprise audiences with her range. She certainly did so with Ballet Theater in 1942 when she danced two contrasting roles. One was Juliet in Antony Tudor's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' In 1946 the dance historian Grace Robert praised that interpretation in ''The Borzoi Book of Ballets,'' writing that ''Markova's deerlike shyness in the first scene, her tragic, controlled despair, the exquisite movement of her hand as she wakes up in the tomb scene, all are unforgettable in their subtlety.''         But this poignant Juliet was tempestuous as the gypsy Zemphira in Léonide Massine's ''Aleko.'' ''The great surprise of 'Aleko' was the superb Zemphira of Alicia Markova,'' Robert wrote. ''Her exquisite 'Swan Lake' and matchless 'Giselle' contained no hint of the fire and quite different sort of dramatic intensity of her gypsy. With sunburnt makeup, wild hair and a vivid red costume, her very appearance was a shock, though a delightful one.''         Dame Alicia, who had occasionally made guest appearances in the ballet sequences of works in the repertory of the Metropolitan Opera, astonished the dance world in 1963 when she accepted an invitation to direct the Metropolitan Opera Ballet. The Met's dance troupe had never been considered important and the opera management had seldom shown much interest in ballet. Nevertheless, in her six years as director, Dame Alicia raised the dancers' technical level and made it possible for the ballet company to present programs of its own.         In 1970 Dame Alicia became a distinguished lecturer on ballet at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, the home school of the Cincinnati Ballet. She remained there until 1974, after which she gave occasional master classes for many organizations, including the Royal Ballet School. She also staged revivals of ballets in which she had starred, and presided over dance festivals and conferences.         A gala was held in honor of Dame Alicia's 80th birthday on Dec. 2, 1990, at the Sadler's Wells Theater in London. On that occasion, Dame Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, spoke in tribute to her.         A tiny black-haired woman, Dame Alicia was just over 5 feet 2 inches tall, and during her dancing years she rarely weighed more than 98 pounds, even though she usually devoured a thick steak after performances.         Her life was as carefully organized as her dancing. She moved through each day with quiet determination and her life was almost entirely devoted to ballet. She never married. Among her few diversions were expensive clothes, classical music and gin rummy, at which she usually won.       
         Freda Flier Maddow, an early Martha Graham dancer, died on Dec. 11 in Los Angeles. She was 87, and lived in Los Angeles.         Her death was announced by her daughter Ellen Maddow.         Ms. Maddow, who performed as Freda Flier, trained and danced in Los Angeles with Benjamin Zemach and Carmelita Maracci before moving to New York in 1935. She joined the Graham company in 1937 and performed with it until 1941. She danced in the original productions of ballets including ''Celebration,'' ''Primitive Mysteries,'' ''Letter to the World'' and ''Every Soul Is a Circus.''         She also performed with Eugene Loring's Dance Players and danced on Broadway in the original production of ''Finian's Rainbow.'' In 1944 she married a screenwriter, Ben Maddow, and returned to Los Angeles, where she performed in films.         She appeared in two dance productions after her formal retirement in 1948: in 1988, in New York in Rocky Bornstein's ''Vision Obscured,'' and in 1999 in the Los Angeles production of ''From the Horse's Mouth,'' a series, created by Tina Croll and James Cunningham, evoking the history of American dance.         In addition to Ellen Maddow, of New York, Ms. Maddow is survived by another daughter, Emily Dawson of Bolton, Mass., and six grandchildren.       
         Susan Sontag, the novelist, essayist and critic whose impassioned advocacy of the avant-garde and equally impassioned political pronouncements made her one of the most lionized presences -- and one of the most polarizing -- in 20th-century letters, died yesterday morning in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 71.         The cause was complications of acute myelogenous leukemia, her son, David Rieff, said. Ms. Sontag, who died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, had been ill with cancer intermittently for the last 30 years, a struggle that informed one of her most famous books, the critical study ''Illness as Metaphor'' (1978).         A highly visible public figure since the mid-1960's, Ms. Sontag wrote four novels, dozens of essays and a volume of short stories and was also an occasional filmmaker, playwright and theater director. For four decades her work was part of the contemporary canon, discussed everywhere from graduate seminars to the pages of popular magazines to the Hollywood movie ''Bull Durham.''         Ms. Sontag's work made a radical break with traditional postwar criticism in America, gleefully blurring the boundaries between high and popular culture. She advocated an aesthetic approach to the study of culture, championing style over content. She was concerned, in short, with sensation, in both meanings of the term.         ''The theme that runs through Susan's writing is this lifelong struggle to arrive at the proper balance between the moral and the aesthetic,'' Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic and an old friend of Ms. Sontag's, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''There was something unusually vivid about her writing. That's why even if one disagrees with it -- as I did frequently -- it was unusually stimulating. She showed you things you hadn't seen before; she had a way of reopening questions.''         Through four decades, public response to Ms. Sontag remained irreconcilably divided. She was described, variously, as explosive, anticlimactic, original, derivative, naïve, sophisticated, approachable, aloof, condescending, populist, puritanical, sybaritic, sincere, posturing, ascetic, voluptuary, right-wing, left-wing, profound, superficial, ardent, bloodless, dogmatic, ambivalent, lucid, inscrutable, visceral, reasoned, chilly, effusive, relevant, passé, tenacious, ecstatic, melancholic, humorous, humorless, deadpan, rhapsodic, cantankerous and clever. No one ever called her dull.         Ms. Sontag's best-known books, all published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, include the novels ''Death Kit'' (1967), ''The Volcano Lover'' (1992) and ''In America'' (2000); the essay collections ''Against Interpretation'' (1966), ''Styles of Radical Will'' (1969) and ''Under the Sign of Saturn'' (1980); the critical studies ''On Photography'' (1977) and ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' (1989); and the short-story collection ''I, Etcetera'' (1978). One of her most famous works, however, was not a book, but an essay, ''Notes on Camp,'' published in 1964 and still widely read.         Her most recent book, published last year, was ''Regarding the Pain of Others,'' a long essay on the imagery of war and disaster. One of her last published essays, ''Regarding the Torture of Others,'' written in response to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by Americans at Abu Ghraib, appeared in the May 23, 2004, issue of The New York Times Magazine.         An Intellectual With Glamour         Unlike most serious intellectuals, Ms. Sontag was also a celebrity, partly because of her telegenic appearance, partly because of her outspoken statements. She was undoubtedly the only writer of her generation to win major literary prizes (among them a National Book Critics Circle Award, a National Book Award and a MacArthur Foundation genius grant) and to appear in films by Woody Allen and Andy Warhol; to be the subject of rapturous profiles in Rolling Stone and People magazines; and to be photographed by Annie Leibovitz for an Absolut Vodka ad. Through the decades her image -- strong features, wide mouth, intense gaze and dark mane crowned in her middle years by a sweeping streak of white -- became an instantly recognizable artifact of 20th-century popular culture.         Ms. Sontag was a master synthesist who tackled broad, difficult and elusive subjects: the nature of art, the nature of consciousness and, above all, the nature of the modern condition. Where many American critics before her had mined the past, Ms. Sontag became an evangelist of the new, training her eye on the culture unfolding around her.         For Ms. Sontag, culture encompassed a vast landscape. She wrote serious studies of popular art forms, like cinema and science fiction, that earlier critics disdained. She produced impassioned essays on the European writers and filmmakers she admired, like Jean-Paul Sartre, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin and Jean-Luc Godard. She wrote experimental novels on dreams and the nature of consciousness. She published painstaking critical dissections of photography and dance; illness, politics and pornography; and, most famously, camp. Her work, with its emphasis on the outré, the jagged and the here and now, helped make the study of popular culture a respectable academic pursuit.         What united Ms. Sontag's output was a propulsive desire to define the forces that shape the modernist sensibility. And in so doing, she sought to explain what it meant to be human in the waning years of the 20th century.         To many critics, her work was bold and thrilling. Interviewed in The Times Magazine in 1992, the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes compared Ms. Sontag to the Renaissance humanist Erasmus. ''Erasmus traveled with 32 volumes, which contained all the knowledge worth knowing,'' he said. ''Susan Sontag carries it in her brain! I know of no other intellectual who is so clear-minded, with a capacity to link, to connect, to relate.''         A Bevy of Detractors         Others were less enthralled. Some branded Ms. Sontag an unoriginal thinker, a popularizer with a gift for aphorism who could boil down difficult writers for mass consumption. (Irving Howe called her ''a publicist able to make brilliant quilts from grandmother's patches.'') Some regarded her tendency to revisit her earlier, often controversial positions as ambivalent. Some saw her scholarly approach to popular art forms as pretentious. (Ms. Sontag once remarked that she could appreciate Patti Smith because she had read Nietzsche.)         In person Ms. Sontag could be astringent, particularly if she felt she had been misunderstood. She grew irritated when reporters asked how many books she had in her apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan (15,000; no television set). But she could also be warm and girlish, speaking confidingly in her rich, low voice, her feet propped casually on the nearest coffee table. She laughed readily, and when she discussed something that engaged her passionately (and there were many things), her dark eyes often filled with tears.         Ms. Sontag had a knack -- or perhaps a penchant -- for getting into trouble. She could be provocative to the point of being inflammatory, as when she championed the Nazi-era filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl in a 1965 essay; she would revise her position some years later. She celebrated the communist societies of Cuba and North Vietnam; just as provocatively, she later denounced communism as a form of fascism. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, she wrote in The New Yorker, ''Whatever may be said of the perpetrators of Tuesday's slaughter, they were not cowards.'' And in 2000, the publication of Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' raised accusations of plagiarism, charges she vehemently denied.         Ms. Sontag was born Susan Rosenblatt in Manhattan on Jan. 16, 1933, the daughter of Jack and Mildred Rosenblatt. Her father was a fur trader in China, and her mother joined him there for long periods, leaving Susan and her younger sister in the care of relatives. When Susan was 5, her father died in China of tuberculosis. Seeking relief for Susan's asthma, her mother moved the family to Tucson, spending the next several years there. In Arizona, Susan's mother met Capt. Nathan Sontag, a World War II veteran sent there to recuperate. The couple were married -- Susan took her stepfather's name -- and the family moved to Los Angeles.         For Susan, who graduated from high school before her 16th birthday, the philistinism of American culture was a torment she vowed early to escape. ''My greatest dream,'' she later wrote, ''was to grow up and come to New York and write for Partisan Review and be read by 5,000 people.''         She would get her wish -- Ms. Sontag burst onto the scene with ''Notes on Camp,'' which was published in Partisan Review -- but not before she earned a bachelor's and two master's degrees from prestigious American universities; studied at Oxford on a fellowship; and married, became a mother and divorced eight years later, all by the time she turned 26.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Sontag spent a semester at the University of California, Berkeley, before transferring to the University of Chicago, from which she received a bachelor's degree in 1951. At Chicago she wandered into a class taught by the sociologist Philip Rieff, then a 28-year-old instructor, who would write the celebrated study ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist'' (Viking, 1959). He was, she would say, the first person with whom she could really talk; they were married 10 days later. Ms. Sontag was 17 and looked even younger, clad habitually in blue jeans, her black hair spilling down her back. Word swept around campus that Dr. Rieff had married a 14-year-old American Indian.         An Academic Beginning         Moving with her husband to Boston, Ms. Sontag earned her master's degrees from Harvard, the first in English, in 1954, the second in philosophy the next year. She began work on a Ph.D., but did not complete her dissertation. In 1952 she and Dr. Rieff became the parents of a son, David Rieff, who survives her. Mr. Rieff lives in Manhattan and was for many years his mother's editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux. (A journalist, he wrote ''Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West,'' published by Simon & Schuster in 1995.) Also surviving is her younger sister, Judith Cohen of Maui.         After further study at Oxford and in Paris, Ms. Sontag was divorced from Dr. Rieff in 1958. In early 1959 she arrived in New York with, as she later described it, ''$70, two suitcases and a 7- year- old.'' She worked as an editor at Commentary and juggled teaching jobs at City College, Sarah Lawrence and Columbia. She published her first essays, critical celebrations of modernists she admired, as well as her first novel, ''The Benefactor'' (1963), an exploration of consciousness and dreams.         With ''Notes on Camp'' Ms. Sontag fired a shot across the bow of the New York critical establishment, which included eminences like Lionel and Diana Trilling, Alfred Kazin and Irving Howe. Interlaced with epigrams from Oscar Wilde, that essay illuminated a particular modern sensibility -- one that had been largely the province of gay culture -- which centered deliciously on artifice, exaggeration and the veneration of style.         ''The experiences of Camp are based on the great discovery that the sensibility of high culture has no monopoly on refinement,'' Ms. Sontag wrote. ''The man who insists on high and serious pleasures is depriving himself of pleasure; he continually restricts what he can enjoy; in the constant exercise of his good taste he will eventually price himself out of the market, so to speak. Here Camp taste supervenes upon good taste as a daring and witty hedonism. It makes the man of good taste cheerful, where before he ran the risk of being chronically frustrated. It is good for the digestion.''         If that essay has today lost its capacity to shock, it is a reflection of how thoroughly Ms. Sontag did her job, serving as a guide to an underground aesthetic that was not then widely known.         ''She found in camp an aesthetic that was very different from what the straight world had acknowledged up to that point, and she managed to make camp 'straight' in a way,'' Arthur C. Danto, the Johnsonian professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia and the art critic for The Nation, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''I think she prepared the ground for the pop revolution, which was in many ways essentially a gay revolution, through Warhol and others. She didn't make that art, but she brought it to consciousness. She gave people a vocabulary for talking about it and thinking about it.''         The article made Ms. Sontag an international celebrity, showered with lavish, if unintentionally ridiculous, titles (''a literary pinup,'' ''the dark lady of American letters,'' ''the Natalie Wood of the U.S. avant-garde'').         Championing Style Over Content         In 1966 Ms. Sontag published her first essay collection, ''Against Interpretation.'' That book's title essay, in which she argued that art should be experienced viscerally rather than cerebrally, helped cement her reputation as a champion of style over content.         It was a position she could take to extremes. In the essay ''On Style,'' published in the same volume, Ms. Sontag offended many readers by upholding the films of Leni Riefenstahl as masterworks of aesthetic form, with little regard for their content. Ms. Sontag would eventually reconsider her position in the 1974 essay ''Fascinating Fascism.''         Though she thought of herself as a novelist, it was through her essays that Ms. Sontag became known. As a result she was fated to write little else for the next quarter-century. She found the form an agony: a long essay took from nine months to a year to complete, often requiring 20 or more drafts.         ''I've had thousands of pages for a 30-page essay,'' she said in a 1992 interview. '''On Photography,' which is six essays, took five years. And I mean working every single day.''         That book, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism in 1978, explored the role of the photographic image, and the act of picture-taking in contemporary culture. The crush of photographs, Ms. Sontag argued, has shaped our perceptions of the world, numbing us to depictions of suffering. She would soften that position when she revisited the issue in ''Regarding the Pain of Others.''         The Washington Post Book World called ''On Photography'' ''a brilliant analysis,'' adding that it '' merely describes a phenomenon we take as much for granted as water from the tap, and how that phenomenon has changed us -- a remarkable enough achievement, when you think about it.''         In the mid-1970's Ms. Sontag learned she had breast cancer. Doctors gave her a 10 percent chance of surviving for two years. She scoured the literature for a treatment that might save her, underwent a mastectomy and persuaded her doctors to give her a two-and-a-half-year course of radiation.         Out of her experience came ''Illness as Metaphor,'' which examined the cultural mythologizing of disease (tuberculosis as the illness of 19th-century romantics, cancer a modern-day scourge). Although it did not discuss her illness explicitly, it condemned the often militaristic language around illness (''battling'' disease, the ''war'' on cancer) that Ms. Sontag felt simultaneously marginalized the sick and held them responsible for their condition..         In ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' Ms. Sontag discussed the social implications of the disease, which she viewed as a ''cultural plague'' that had replaced cancer as the modern bearer of stigma. She would return to the subject of AIDS in her acclaimed short story ''The Way We Live Now,'' originally published in The New Yorker and included in ''The Best American Short Stories of the Century'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1999).         Although Ms. Sontag was strongly identified with the American left during the Vietnam era, in later years her politics were harder to classify. In the essay ''Trip to Hanoi,'' which appears in ''Styles of Radical Will,'' she wrote glowingly of a visit to North Vietnam. But in 1982 she delivered a stinging blow to progressives in a speech at Town Hall in Manhattan. There, at a rally in support of the Solidarity movement in Poland, she denounced European communism as ''fascism with a human face.''         In 1992, weary of essays, Ms. Sontag published ''The Volcano Lover,'' her first novel in 25 years. Though very much a novel of ideas -- it explored, among other things, notions of aesthetics and the psychology of obsessive collecting -- the book was also a big, old-fashioned historical romance. It told the story of Sir William Hamilton, the 18th-century British envoy to the court of Naples; his wife, Emma (''that Hamilton woman''); and her lover, Lord Nelson, the naval hero. The book spent two months on The New York Times best-seller list.         Reviewing the novel in The Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote: ''One thing that makes 'The Volcano Lover' such a delight to read is the way it throws off ideas and intellectual sparks, like a Roman candle or Catherine wheel blazing in the night. Miniature versions of 'Don Giovanni' and 'Tosca' lie embedded, like jewels, in the main narrative; and we are given as well some charmingly acute cameos of such historical figures as Goethe and the King and Queen of Naples.''         Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' was loosely based on the life of the 19th-century Polish actress Helena Modjeska, who immigrated to California to start a utopian community. Though ''In America'' received a National Book Award, critical reception was mixed. Then accusations of plagiarism surfaced. As The Times reported in May 2000, a reader identified at least a dozen passages as being similar to those in four other books about the real Modjeska, including Modjeska's memoirs. Except for a brief preface expressing a general debt to ''books and articles by and on Modjeska,'' Ms. Sontag did not specifically acknowledge her sources.         Interviewed for The Times article, Ms. Sontag defended her method. ''All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain,'' she said. ''I've used these sources and I've completely transformed them. I have these books. I've looked at these books. There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.''         Ms. Sontag's other work includes the play ''Alice in Bed'' (1993); ''A Susan Sontag Reader'' (1982), with an introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick; and four films, including ''Duet for Cannibals'' (1969) and ''Brother Carl'' (1971). She also edited works by Barthes, Antonin Artaud, Danilo Kis and other writers.         Ms. Sontag was the subject of an unauthorized biography by Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock, ''Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon'' (Norton, 2000), and of several critical studies, including ''Sontag & Kael: Opposites Attract Me,'' by Craig Seligman (Counterpoint/Perseus, 2004). She was the president of the PEN American Center from 1987 to 1989.         In a 1992 interview with The Times Magazine, Ms. Sontag described the creative force that animated ''The Volcano Lover,'' putting her finger on the sensibility that would inform all her work: ''I don't want to express alienation. It isn't what I feel. I'm interested in various kinds of passionate engagement. All my work says, be serious, be passionate, wake up.''         A Life of the Mind         For four decades, Susan Sontag's books were published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. These are some of the more notable.

         Maude Lloyd, a dramatically expressive ballerina who became an articulate dance critic, writing in collaboration with her husband, Nigel Gosling, died on Nov. 26 at her home in London. She was 96.         She died after a brief hospitalization, said John Percival, a British freelance dance critic.Born in South Africa in 1908, Ms. Lloyd arrived in London as a dance student and in 1927 became associated with Ballet Rambert, a pioneering British ballet company. After capturing the attention of Antony Tudor, then a young choreographer eager to explore the possibilities of dramatic ballets, she danced in major works of his like ''The Planets'' (1934) and ''Dark Elegies'' (1937).         Perhaps her greatest characterization was that of Caroline in ''Jardin aux Lilas'' (1936), Tudor's poignant and often revived ballet about a young woman who must marry a man she does not love. Ms. Lloyd's eloquence contributed much to the impact of its premiere.         When she started teaching ballet classes for adult beginners, one of her students was a dance-loving young art critic, Mr. Gosling. She married him in 1939 and retired from the stage the next year.         Because Ms. Lloyd's conversation was as expressive as her dancing, and because she and her husband were inseparable, Richard Buckle, editor of Ballet magazine in London, suggested in 1951 that the couple write dance criticism as a team. They adopted Alexander Bland as a byline, derived from the names of two piglets (Pigling Bland and his brother Alexander) in a Beatrix Potter story.         After they wrote for various publications, the team as Alexander Bland began writing dance reviews in 1955 in The Observer, a weekly for which Gosling was also the art critic. Although Gosling stopped writing art criticism in 1975, reviews by Alexander Bland continued until Gosling died in 1982. Some of them are anthologized in ''Observer of the Dance'' (Dance Books, 1985).         When Rudolf Nureyev arrived in England after defecting from the Soviet Union in 1961, the Goslings hospitably took the young dancer under their wings and helped him adjust to his new country. They celebrated his achievements in their book ''The Nureyev Image'' (1976).         Ms. Lloyd is survived by a son, Nicholas, and grandchildren.       
         Rachael Dunaven Yocom, a dance educator and theorist, died on Nov. 14 in Tucson, said Cora Cahan, president of the New 42nd Street redevelopment organization and a former student. She was 88.         Born in Corvallis, Ore., Dr. Yocom taught dance at schools and universities in Oregon, Idaho and Utah after receiving her doctorate at New York University in 1951. In New York City, she was chairwoman of the dance department from 1954 to 1972 at the High School of Performing Arts, the subject of the movie ''Fame,'' and was teacher in charge of the school from 1973 to 1975.         Dr. Yocom trained generations of New York dancers, among them Jacqulyn Buglisi, Laura Dean, Eliot Feld, Arthur Mitchell, Eleo Pomare, Ben Vereen, Edward Villella, Dudley Williams and Ms. Cahan. She wrote several books on physical education, sports and dance, including ''Modern Dance Techniques and Teaching'' (1946), written with Gertrude Shurr, an early Martha Graham dancer and longtime colleague. Dr. Yocom also wrote songs and was a dance photographer.         Dr. Yokom is survived by two sisters, Ruth Carkin of Tucson and Roberta Jean Fox of Eugene, Ore., and a brother, Raymond, of Lancaster, Pa.
