Sylvia Meagher, a writer and retired senior liaison officer of the World Health Organization at the United Nations, died of complications from the flu Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Meagher was a native of Brooklyn who studied at Brooklyn College and had worked for the World Health Organization for 31 years. She wrote three books that pointed to major inconsistencies in the United States Government's findings in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy: ''Subject Index to the Warren Commission Report'' (1966), ''Accessories After the Fact: The Warren Commission, the Authorities and the Report'' (1967) and ''Master Index to the J.F.K. Assassination Investigations'' (1980).         Surviving are three nieces, Ruth Tessel and Susan Kaplan, both of East Brunswick, N.J., and Diane Vernickas of Dayton, N.J.       
        Elizabeth Knowlton, a mountain climber who in 1932 became the first woman to climb as high as 20,000 feet in the Himalayas, died of heart disease Sunday at the Ocean Manor Nursing Home in Scituate, Mass., where she lived for the last four years. She was 93 years old and a longtime resident of Cambridge,         Elizabeth Knowlton, a mountain climber who in 1932 became the first woman to climb as high as 20,000 feet in the Himalayas, died of heart disease Sunday at the Ocean Manor Nursing Home in Scituate, Mass., where she lived for the last four years. She was 93 years old and a longtime resident of Cambridge, Mass.         Miss Knowlton attained world fame when she was the only woman in a German-American expedition that attempted to climb the 27,660-foot-high Nanga Parbat in Kashmir, the seventh-highest peak in the world. The men in charge of the climb would not let her continue beyond the 20,000-foot level.         Miss Knowlton, who was 37 years old at the time, wrote periodic dispatches to The New York Times on the four-month-long assault, which ended in failure because of heavy snowstorms. She later wrote an account of the expedition in her book ''The Naked Mountain,'' published by Putnam in 1933. Frustration and Futility         After recounting the two years of planning for the ascent, the work that went into preparation in Munich, the long journey by ship, rail, truck, pack horses and afoot, and the two and a half months of the actual climb, she summed up the futile effort in these words:         ''And the mountain, scornful of our puny efforts, had carelessly every day or two scattered a few snowflakes on us, and then finally thrown a whole handful. And we could do nothing against it. Everything was ended. The effort was over. Defeat - frustration - futility.''         Miss Knowlton, a native of Springfield, Mass., was a gradaute of Vassar and received a master's degree in English from Radcliffe. She began climbing in the White Mountains of New Hampshire when she was 7 years old. Fluent in German, French, Italian and Spanish, she was at home among explorers in the many expeditions in which she took part in the Alps and in Mexico and Canada.         After World War II she took part in the first two ascents of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia. She was in her 60's when she made her last climbs in the Nepalese foothills.         Miss Knowlton was a member of the Explorers Club, the Appalachian Mountain Club and the American Alpine Club.         She is survived by a nephew, Marcus P. Knowlton of Princeton, N.J.         Correction:  February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Late City Final Edition         An obituary on Friday about Elizabeth Knowlton, a mountain climber, misstated an accomplishment in her career. Miss Knowlton climbed peaks in the Himalayas more than 20,000 feet high in 1932, but she was not the first woman to do so; Fanny Bullock Workman of Worcester, Mass., achieved the feat before World War I.

Sister Helen Madeline Ingraham, who in 1919 founded Emmanuel College, the first Roman Catholic college for women in New England, died Tuesday. She was 101 years old.         Sister Ingraham was dean at Emmanuel for 31 years. After retiring in 1950, she founded another college for her religous order in Okayama, Japan. She also wrote a series of books on meditation and translations from the French of Abbe Gaston Courtois.       
        Beatrice Blackmar Gould, co-editor with her husband, Bruce, of the Ladies' Home Journal from 1935 until their retirement in 1967, died of Alzheimer's disease yesterday at their home in Hopewell, N.J. She was 90 years old.         Beatrice Blackmar Gould, co-editor with her husband, Bruce, of the Ladies' Home Journal from 1935 until their retirement in 1967, died of Alzheimer's disease yesterday at their home in Hopewell, N.J. She was 90 years old.         Mrs. Gould, who was born in Emmetsburg, Iowa, and held degrees from the University of Iowa and the Columbia School of Journalism, began her writing career as a reporter on the Ottumwa (Iowa) Courier in the early 1920's.         She later edited news about women for the New York Sunday World and contributed to several magazines, including the Saturday Evening Post, Cosmopolitan, Liberty and Vanity Fair.         With her husband, whom she married in 1923, she wrote two plays, ''Man's Estate,'' which the Theatre Guild produced in 1929, and ''The Terrible Turk,'' which appeared in 1934. The Goulds also wrote the screenplay ''Reunion'' in 1936.         In the 32 years the Goulds edited the Ladies' Home Journal, its circulation tripled to 7.5 million.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Gould is survived by a daughter, Sesaly Kraft of Federalsburg, Md.; a sister, Florence Snoke of Ann Arbor, Mich.; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
        Pegeen Fitzgerald, who, with her husband, Edward, conducted a radio talk show for 42 years and pioneered the at-home radio format, died of breast cancer Monday at her Manhattan home. She stated her age as 78 and also had a home in Kent, Conn.         Pegeen Fitzgerald, who, with her husband, Edward, conducted a radio talk show for 42 years and pioneered the at-home radio format, died of breast cancer Monday at her Manhattan home. She stated her age as 78 and also had a home in Kent, Conn.         ''The Fitzgeralds,'' subtitled ''Book Talk, Back Talk and Small Talk,'' was a radio institution, achieving at times an audience of 2 million listeners. It was broadcast mainly on WOR radio from the couple's 16th-floor apartment overlooking Central Park, and occasionally from their weekend homes in Hay Island, Conn., off Long Island Sound, and later from Kent, Conn., in the foothills of the Berkshires.         Mr. Fitzgerald died in 1982, at the age of 89, after 52 years of marriage, and Mrs. Fitzgerald continued a talk show on WOR and later on WNYC, until last April when she took a medical leave.         With ease and good humor, Mrs. Fitzgerald, a calm, homespun liberal, and Mr. Fitzgerald, a scholarly, theatrical conservative, bounced ideas, events and viewpoints off each other. Their casual preparation usually involved only glancing through newspapers and their mail. Cats and Commentary         Their only script was commercials, which they themselves styled, and they delivered them unobtrusively and at random. Their commentary, punctuated by the purring of their many cats, concerned the doings of friends and acquaintances and oddities in the news, and included occasional comments designed to shock bluenoses. The couple occasionally bickered on the air, but with wit and affection, in an effort to project the reality of their long marriage.         ''There is no easy way to describe what they do,'' Francis X. Clines wrote in The New York Times in 1979. ''They wool-gather and play off each other. They steep themselves daily in remembrances, using the airwaves as their Proustian bed.'' The husband often asked civility of the wife, and she responded by ''listening very carefully to him, correcting details, switching topics intuitively, reading the commercials elegantly and accurately.'' ''We're a true soap opera,'' she remarked to the reporter.         The loyalty of many listeners who regarded the Fitzgeralds as friends or part of their family frustrated some broadcast executives who tried to take them off the air several times. This loyalty extended to listeners who sent them their cats when entering nursing homes and others who willed their pets to the couple, who often had 10 cats in their apartment and 100 at their weekend home. Headed Animal Protection Groups         In Mrs. Fitzgerald's last years, she continued to maintain the Last Post, a shelter in Falls Village, Conn., and also aided many orphans, convicts and former convicts.         She said she believed deeply in antivivisection and ethical vegetarianism, refusing to eat meat or fish or to wear a fur coat ''because I don't want any living thing killed for my own use or pleasure.'' She headed two animal groups as president of the Vivisection Investigation League and as executive director of the Millenium Guild.         Mrs. Fitzgerald, a vivacious, stylish woman, has been described by friends as a gracious hostess who invariably kept champagne in her refrigerator for guests. From Portland to New York         Pegeen Fitzgerald was born Margaret Worrall in Norcatur, Kan., the eldest of seven children of Fred Calvin Worrall and the former Jane Sweeney, who were of French and Irish ancestry. In Pegeen's early teens, the family moved to Portland, Ore., where she graduated from high school at 15.         She attended the College of St. Theresa in Winona, Minn., but had to leave and seek work after two years when her father fell ill. She started to work in a Portland department store, rising from bookkeeper to advertising copywriter to assistant advertising manager. She married Mr. Fitzgerald in 1930.         He worked as a newspaper reporter and as a movie publicist, and entered radio in 1933 as a master of ceremonies for a variety show. The couple went to New York in 1936 and he joined WOR, where he gained success with a program on books and current events. She, meanwhile, was the advertising manager of McCreery's department store but, after several years, also joined WOR, where she had a talk show and then, in 1940, joined her husband and began broadcasting from their home.         Surviving are four sisters, Irene McAllister, of San Jose, Calif.; Cristine Sharkey, of Santa Barbara, Calif.; Eve Jane Mueller, of Portland, Ore.; and Mimi Findlay, of Martinez, Calif., and a brother, P. J. Worrall, of Alamo, Calif.

Ruth Moore Garbe, a writer of books about science, died of cancer Monday at her brother's home in San Francisco. She was 80 years old lived in San Francisco.         Under the name of Ruth Moore, Mrs. Garbe was the author of books that included ''Man, Time and Fossils'' and ''The Coil of Life: The Story of the Great Discoveries in the Life of Sciences'' published in 1953 and 1961 by Alfred Knopf & Co. She also wrote a biography of Nils Bohr, published by Knopf in 1966.         She was a graduate of Washington University, St. Louis. From 1943 to 1970 she was a reporter for The Chicago Sun-Times.         In 1986, Mrs. Garbe and her brother, Norman Moore, gave $1 million to Washington University to endow a professorship in architecture. In 1987 she and her husband, Raymond W. Garbe, since deceased, donated $1 million to Harvard University to endow a professorship in urban design.         She is survived by her brother.       
        Arvia MacKaye Ege, a poet and a founder of the Rudolph Steiner Educational and Farming Association, died Wednesday at her home in Hillsdale, N.Y. She was 86 years old.         Arvia MacKaye Ege, a poet and a founder of the Rudolph Steiner Educational and Farming Association, died Wednesday at her home in Hillsdale, N.Y. She was 86 years old.         Mrs. Ege, daughter of the playwright Percy MacKaye, wrote ''The Secret Iron of the Heart,'' published in 1982, and ''The Battle for the Sunlight: A Modern Legend,'' which was reissued in 1983, both by the Admonis Press. Another book, ''The Power of the Impossible,'' is scheduled for release this year.         In 1972, Mrs. Ege founded the Rudolph Steiner Association in Ghent, N.Y. It is the umbrella organization for the Hawthorne Valley Farm, a dairy farm; the Hawthorne Valley School; the Hawthorne Valley Visiting Students Program, an environmental center, and the Hawthorne Valley Artists and Artisans. All are in the Hudson Valley near Hillsdale.         Surviving are a brother, Robert MacKaye of Spring Valley, N.Y., and a sister, Christy Barnes of Hillsdale.       
        Emily Kimbrough, an author, lecturer and former radio commentator, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and had suffered from lung cancer, said a longtime friend, Sophia Yarnall Jacobs.         Emily Kimbrough, an author, lecturer and former radio commentator, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and had suffered from lung cancer, said a longtime friend, Sophia Yarnall Jacobs.         Miss Kimbrough was the co-author, with Cornelia Otis Skinner, of ''Our Hearts Were Young and Gay,'' a reminiscence of her travels in Europe during the early 1920's. The book, published in 1942, was popular despite a review from Orville Prescott, then the critic for The New York Times, who wrote: ''There is a noticeable trace of mild humor to 'Our Hearts Were Young and Gay,' but it is very mild indeed, about as tasty as junket or cornstarch pudding. Why it should be a co-selection for December by the Book-of-the-Month Club is a dark mystery.''         It was made into a movie starring Diana Lynn and Gail Russell. Miss Kimbrough wrote a sequel, ''We Followed Our Hearts to Hollywood,'' published in 1943.         A native of Muncie, Ind., Miss Kimbrough graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1921. Her first job was as a copywriter at Marshall Field & Company in Chicago, where she became editor of a publication, ''Fashions of the Hour.'' She joined The Ladies Home Journal as fashion editor, and was managing editor before she resigned to work as a freelance writer and lecturer. Joined WCBS Radio         Her articles appeared in The New Yorker and Atlantic Monthly. Her subsequent books, including ''Forty Plus and Fancy Free,'' ''How Dear to My Heart'' and ''Water Water Everywhere.''         In 1952, she joined WCBS Radio, where she wrote her own 25-minute daily program.         Miss Kimbrough was also active in civil rights with the National Urban League during the 1960's.         She was married in 1927 to John Wrench, and was divorced several years later.         She is survived by her daughters, Margaret Wrench Kuhn of Westport, Conn., and Alis Wrench McCurdy, of Cam Cape Sebastian, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
        Helene Eliat van de Velde, a psychologist and writer who elucidated Freudian insights into the literary portrayal of human behavior, died of cardio-respiratory failure on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 years old.         Helene Eliat van de Velde, a psychologist and writer who elucidated Freudian insights into the literary portrayal of human behavior, died of cardio-respiratory failure on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 years old.         Born in Berlin, Mrs. van de Velde moved in cultural circles in Berlin and in Paris, where she settled in the 1930's. She wrote several short stories and a novel, ''Sheba Visits Solomon,'' published in America by Viking Press in 1932.         The book, which dealt with the legendary visit of Balkis, the Queen of Sheba, to King Solomon, was assessed in The New York Times Book Review as ''a gay, amusing, witty, sophisticated and exceptionally shrewd novel'' casting an unorthodox light on the meeting between the virgin Queen and the imposing monarch.         Mrs. van de Velde trained in psychoanalysis under two prominent pupils of Sigmund Freud, Karl Abrams and Hans Sachs, before coming to the United States during World War II. Later she returned to attend the Institute of Applied Psychology in Zurich under Rudolf Brun. In 1954 she began her practice in New York under the supervision of Theodore Reik, founder of the Psychological Association for Psychoanalyasis.         She is survived by her daughter, France-Helene Weindling of Manhattan, and a grandchild.       
        Hannah Grad Sverdlin, a radio and television writer known professionally as Hannah Grad Goodman, died of kidney failure on Jan. 19 at Doctors Hospital. She was 78 years old and lived on the Upper West Side.         Hannah Grad Sverdlin, a radio and television writer known professionally as Hannah Grad Goodman, died of kidney failure on Jan. 19 at Doctors Hospital. She was 78 years old and lived on the Upper West Side.         Mrs. Sverdlin wrote scripts for ''The Eternal Light,'' ''Kraft Television Theater,'' ''The Paul Winchell Show,'' ''Hollywood Opening Night'' and ''Private Secretary.'' She also wrote for ''Your Show of Shows,'' where she replaced a departing Selma Diamond because Imogene Coco wanted at least one woman emale on the writing staff.         Recently Mrs. Sverdlin was arts critic for Hadassah magazine. She was a founder of the Writers Guild and among her published books are ''The Story of Prophecy,'' ''Eyewitness to Jewish History'' and ''Eyewitness to American History.''         She is survived by her husband, Sol, and a brother, Martin Grad, of Skokie, Ill.       
        Barbara W. Tuchman, whose skill at writing histories of men at war and on the brink of war won her two Pulitzer Prizes, died of complications of a stroke yesterday afternoon at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and was admitted to the hospital Saturday after suffering the stroke at her home at Cos Cob, Conn.         Barbara W. Tuchman, whose skill at writing histories of men at war and on the brink of war won her two Pulitzer Prizes, died of complications of a stroke yesterday afternoon at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and was admitted to the hospital Saturday after suffering the stroke at her home at Cos Cob, Conn.         It was Mrs. Tuchman's fourth book, ''The Guns of August,'' a study of the background and beginning of World War I, that made her a celebrity after it came out in 1962, winning reviewers' salutes, a durable niche on best-seller lists and her first Pulitzer Prize.         The second Pulitzer came for ''Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45.'' The 1971 biography of Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, a hard-driving American officer who played a major role in China during World War II, was combined with a history of modern China. Her other books included ''The Zimmermann Telegram,'' ''The Proud Tower'' and ''A Distant Mirror.'' Latest Book a Best Seller         Her most recent book, ''The First Salute,'' sets the American Revolution in international perspective. It has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 17 weeks, and last week was No. 9.         Born into a New York family that had long been eminent in finance and public service, Mrs. Tuchman could have had an easy, conventional life as the wife of a prominent physician. But as her three daughters grew older, she took up the historian's profession.         She had neither an academic title nor even a graduate degree. ''It's what saved me,'' she later said. ''If I had taken a doctoral degree, it would have stifled any writing capacity.'' Her Primary Obstacle         But to be a writer was difficult, she found, simply because she was a woman. ''If a man is a writer,'' she once said, ''everybody tiptoes around past the locked door of the breadwinner. But if you're an ordinary female housewife, people say, 'This is just something Barbara wanted to do; it's not professional.' ''         In fact, Mrs. Tuchman had a firm, even contentious, sense of her vocation. In history and biography, she told an audience at the National Portrait Gallery in 1978, ''the writer's object is - or should be - to hold the reader's attention.''         ''I want the reader to turn the page and keep on turning to the end,'' she added. ''This is accomplished only when the narrative moves steadily ahead, not when it comes to a weary standstill, overloaded with every item uncovered in the research.'' An Impression of Authority         In her person as well as in her choice of words, Mrs. Tuchman gave an impression of authority. She had strong features, a high forehead, wise hazel eyes and a somewhat serious manner that gave way, now and then, to a dazzling smile.         Summing up her view of the historical process, she wrote in 1981, in the preface to ''Practicing History,'' a selection of her short writings, that she had arrived at ''a sense of history as accidental and perhaps cyclical, of human conduct as a steady stream running through endless fields of changing circumstances, of good and bad always coexisting and inextricably mixed in periods as in people, of cross-currents and counter-currents usually present to contradict too-easy generalizations.''         Lofty though her views might be, Mrs. Tuchman was down to earth in her research. Before she wrote ''The Guns of August,'' she rented a Renault sedan and toured the appropriate battlefields. When she took notes, it was always on index cards measuring 4 by 6 inches - a convenient size, she said, for storing in shoeboxes and carrying in her purse.         That sort of prosaic concern was far from her exalted birthright. Barbara Wertheim was born on Jan. 30, 1912, in New York, the daughter of Maurice Wertheim, an investment banker, art collector and philanthropist, and Alma Morgenthau Wertheim, a sister of Henry Morgenthau Jr., who was Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.         Miss Wertheim attended the Walden School before entering Radcliffe College, where she concentrated on history and literature and received her bachelor's degree in 1933. Worked in Japan         Since, as she put it, ''paying jobs did not hang from the trees'' in that Depression year, she took an unpaid position with the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations.         The following year, she went to Tokyo to help work up an economic handbook of the Pacific area. While there, she wrote for two journals, Far Eastern Survey and Pacific Affairs.         An early contribution was a review of a French historian's book about Japan. Not long after it was printed, she later recalled: ''I was thrilled to receive from the author a letter addressed 'Chere consoeur' (the feminine of confrere, or as we would say, 'colleague'). I felt admitted into an international circle of professionals.''         In 1936, Miss Wertheim went to work for The Nation, which her father had bought to keep it from going bankrupt. Her first job was clipping newspaper articles, but soon she was writing herself, and in 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, she went to Valencia and Madrid as The Nation's correspondent. 'Heroes, Hopes, and Illusions'         From Spain she traveled elsewhere in Europe, savoring what she later called ''a somber, exciting, believing, betraying time, with heroes, hopes, and illusions.''         In London, she put together a short book, ''The Lost British Policy,'' about British policy toward Spain and the Western Mediterranean. Her later appraisal of the work, which came out in 1938, was that it was only ''a respectable piece of research,'' and she sometimes omitted it in listing her books.         By 1939, she was back in New York, writing largely on Spain, and the next year she married Dr. Lester Reginald Tuchman, a New York internist.         Mrs. Tuchman was soon showing her strength of will. With Nazi Germany looming, she later wrote, her husband ''not unreasonably felt at that time that the world was too unpromising to bring children into.         ''Sensible for once, I argued that if we waited for the outlook to improve, we might wait forever, and that if we wanted a child at all we should have it now, regardless of Hitler.''         ''The tyranny of men not being quite as total as today's feminists would have us believe,'' she added, writing in 1981, ''our first daughter was born nine months later.'' Separated by Wartime         After Pearl Harbor, Dr. Tuchman went overseas to a United States military hospital, and Mrs. Tuchman got a job in New York with the Office of War Information, preparing material on the Far East for use in broadcasts to Europe.         ''After the war, when my husband came home, we had two more children, and domesticity for a while prevailed,'' she wrote later, ''combined with beginning the work I had always wanted to do, which was writing a book.''         ''When the children were very small,'' she once recalled in an interview, ''I worked in the morning only and then gradually, as they spent full days at school, I could spend full days at work. I could never have done any of this work if I hadn't been able to afford domestic help.''         The fruit of those labors, ''Bible and Sword,'' about relations between Britain and Palestine, came out in 1956. It attracted relatively little notice, though what there was of it was favorable.         Two years later ''The Zimmermann Telegram'' appeared, about a message sent from Berlin to a German diplomat in Mexico in January 1917, raising the possibility of ''an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer territory in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona,'' and about the message's repercussions after it was intercepted and made public by the British.         Writing in The New York Times, Samuel Flagg Bemis, the Yale diplomatic historian, said the value and importance of the book lay in Mrs. Tuchman's ''brilliant use of well known materials, her sureness of insight and her competent grasp of a complicated chapter of diplomatic history.'' 'The Guns of August'         Attempting something that might have seemed a bit beyond her reach, Mrs. Tuchman took up a far broader and more important topic in her next book, which was ''The Guns of August.'' World War I, as she saw it, was no less than ''the chasm between our world and a world that died forever.''         Though the book was largely about arms and men, it was also about aspirations and ideals. ''Men,'' she concluded, in one widely quoted passage, ''could not sustain a war of such magnitude and pain without hope - the hope that its very enormity would insure that it could never happen again.''         Clifton Fadiman, writing in the Book-of-the-Month-Club News, said: ''Its virtues are almost Thucydidean: intelligence, concision, weight, detachment.''         Writing in The New York Times, Cyril Falls, a British officer turned military historian, said Mrs. Tuchman ''writes so brilliantly and inspiringly.'' The book, he said, was ''lucid, fair, critical and witty.''         But he contended that her performance was uneven, and ''the errors and omissions amount to a formidable total.'' For his part, Bruce Bliven, writing in The New Yorker, complained that ''Mrs. Tuchman leans toward seeing issues as black and white.'' Emphasized Human Qualities         The book's emphasis on the human qualities of the leaders of the time helped make it popular with the public, and it served as the basis for a 1964 documentary film, produced by Nathan Kroll, with the same title.         The quarter-century preceding World War I was the subject of Mrs. Tuchman's next book, ''The Proud Tower,'' which came out in 1966. In a review in The New York Times, Martin Duberman, a Princeton history professor, praised her skill at narrating events, making historical personages come alive, and writing clearly and powerfully about complex matters.         But he said the book did ''not come up to the high level of 'The Guns of August.' '' It was not a portrait of the period, he contended, but merely ''random brush strokes, leaving a canvas unoccupied by any ruling vision.''         When ''Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45,'' came out, it was hailed as ''brilliant'' in a review in The New Republic by the dean of American China scholars, John K. Fairbank, the director of Harvard University's East Asian Research Center. 'A Distant Mirror'         Another book about Asia, ''Notes From China,'' a slim volume about a six-week trip Mrs. Tuchman had taken, appeared in 1972. But six years went by before the appearance of her next work, ''A Distant Mirror,'' a study of the 14th century, an era that was racked by plague and war.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Eric Cochrane, a professor of history at the University of Chicago, said, ''This book abounds in the same elements that have made her previous books masterpieces of popular scholarship: vivid battle scenes, scenes from daily life, brilliant portraits.'' But he also argued that she was guilty of grave omissions and misinterpretations.         In ''The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam,'' a 1984 book, Mrs. Tuchman scrutinized the Trojans' decision to admit the Greek horse into their city, the refusal of six Renaissance Popes to arrest church corruption in advance of the Protestant Reformation, British misrule under King George III and America's mishandling of the Vietnam conflict.         Mrs. Tuchman had an occasional fondness for twitting figures of authority. She once began a speech to the Army War College by noting that her subject, generalship, had been suggested by the college's commandant.         ''No doubt,'' she observed, ''he could safely assume that the subject in itself would automatically interest this audience in the same way that motherhood would interest an audience of pregnant ladies.''         Mrs. Tuchman is survived by her husband, who is an emeritus professor of clinical medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine; a sister, Anne W. Werner of Manhattan; three daughters, Lucy T.

        Angna Enters, a dancer and mime, painter and writer, died on Saturday at the County Manor Nursing Home in Tenafly, N.J. She was 82 years old.         Angna Enters, a dancer and mime, painter and writer, died on Saturday at the County Manor Nursing Home in Tenafly, N.J. She was 82 years old.         Miss Enters became internationally known during the 1920's for an individual style of dance-mime that Stark Young described as ''free of influences foreign to her nature.'' She specialized in character vignettes, frequently described as wordless monologues, developing nearly 300 separate characters for her touring Theater of Angna Enters from 1928 to 1960.         Her range of subjects was wide, from sharply specific satires on politics and the arts to portraits of ordinary young women. ''To my way of thinking, the greatest quality about Angna Enters is her unfetteredness,'' the dance critic Walter Terry wrote in 1946. In her 1926 ''Moyen Age,'' one of her best-known pieces, Miss Enters seemed to have stepped out of a medieval painting as she enacted a woman's reactions to stories of events in the life of Christ, in a series of fluid poses to music by Frescobaldi. Also an Artist and Sculptor         Miss Enters was also a well-known artist and sculptor who held her first New York exhibition in 1933. She designed and executed all the costumes and props for her performances, and illustrated several of the books she wrote on her life and her work. She also composed scores for some of her pieces.         Miss Enters was born in New York City of an Austrian father and French mother, and spent her childhood in Milwaukee and traveling through Europe. She returned to New York in 1922 to enroll at the Art Students' League, where she studied with John Sloan while doing lettering in an advertising agency during the daytime.         Miss Enters had studied ballet in Milwaukee as she had studied piano, she once said, ''to become 'accomplished.' '' Her adult interest in dance began with a concern for the visual representation of movement. First Dance Work in 1923         She enrolled in dance classes taught by Michio Ito in 1922, and performed as his partner in a series of recitals in 1923. That year she created her first piece, ''Ecclesiastique,'' an evocation of a statue of a Gothic Virgin, which she performed in a Broadway revue organized by Ito. The piece later became ''Moyen Age.'' She presented her first solo program in 1924 at the Greenwich Village Theater with a borrowed $25 as her operating budget.         Her reputation grew rapidly over the next two years, and Miss Enters made her London debut in 1928, performing for the first time in Paris the following year.         Miss Enters wrote three volumes of autobiography - ''First Person Plural,'' ''Silly Girl'' and ''Artist's Life'' - a novel, ''Among the Daughters'' (1956), and a book about her work, ''On Mime,'' published in 1966. Her plays, ''Love Possessed Juana: A Play of the Inquisition in Spain'' and ''The Unknown Lover,'' were presented by the Houston Little Theater in 1946 and 1947. A University Lecturer         A noted master teacher, Miss Enters lectured at universities throughout the country. In the early 1960's, she was an artist in residence at the Dallas Theater Center and Baylor University and a fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University.         Miss Enters retired from performing in 1960, and had been in nursing homes since 1976. There are no survivors.       
        Dr. Ruth Fox, a psychoanalyst who in 1959 became the first medical director of The National Council on Alcoholism, an agency devoted to alcoholism prevention, died in her sleep Friday at a nursing home in Washington. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Ruth Fox, a psychoanalyst who in 1959 became the first medical director of The National Council on Alcoholism, an agency devoted to alcoholism prevention, died in her sleep Friday at a nursing home in Washington. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Fox, a native New Yorker, performed pioneering research on the use of Antabuse, a chemical used widely in alcoholism treatment today. She was founder and first president of the American Medical Society on Alcoholism and Other Drug Dependencies in 1954. She wrote, lectured and taught extensively on the subject. She also maintained a private practice and was one of the first psychoanalysts willing to accept alcoholics as patients.         The winner of a number of honors, she received, among others, the Citation of Merit award from the Malvern Institute for Psychiatric and Alcoholic Studies in 1963; the Silver Key award from the National Council on Alcoholism in 1972, and the annual award from the American Medical Society on Alcoholism in 1973. Retired in '79         She was a fellow of several groups including the American Psychiatric Association, the New York Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, the American Health Association and the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. She retired in 1979.         Dr. Fox was a graduate of Rush Medical College in Chicago. She took a premedical course in Paris, where she resumed study after she received her medical degree. She also studied in Vienna and Frankfurt and interned at the Rockefeller Foundation in Beijing. On her return to the United States, she spent a year treating mental cases in a Denver psychiatric hospital, did four years of research in pediatrics at the Fifth Avenue Hospital, and for four years was laboratory chief at the Neurological Institute.         She is survived by a son, McAlister Coleman of Manchester, Mass.; a dauhter, Ann Coleman Allen of Edgartown, Mass., and two granddaughters.       
        Viola Ilma, a writer, died Tuesday at the Wesley Health Care Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., after a stroke. She was 78 years old and lived in Saratoga Springs.         Viola Ilma, a writer, died Tuesday at the Wesley Health Care Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., after a stroke. She was 78 years old and lived in Saratoga Springs.         She wrote ''And Now, Youth!'', a book published in 1934 about American young people, and a memoir, ''A Political Virgin,'' published in 1938.         In 1936, she organized the first American Youth Congress, a meeting in New York City of youth groups from across the nation.         Miss Ilma founded Friends of the Saratoga National Battlefield, in Stillwater, N.Y.         Surviving are her cousins, Honor Holland of Saratoga Springs and Manhattan, and Laura Glance of Miami.       
        Dame Daphne du Maurier, the author of ''Rebecca'' and other highly popular Gothic and romantic novels that were turned into films, plays and documentaries, died yesterday in her sleep at home in the village of Par in Cornwall, on the rugged southwestern coast of England, a setting she had peopled with characters who were cherished by readers all over the world.         Dame Daphne du Maurier, the author of ''Rebecca'' and other highly popular Gothic and romantic novels that were turned into films, plays and documentaries, died yesterday in her sleep at home in the village of Par in Cornwall, on the rugged southwestern coast of England, a setting she had peopled with characters who were cherished by readers all over the world. She was 81 years old.         ''Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again . . . I came upon it suddenly; the approach masked by the unnatural growth of a vast shrub that spread in all directions . . . There was Manderley, our Manderley, secretive and silent as it had always been, the gray stone shining in the moonlight of my dream, the mullioned windows reflecting the green lawns and terrace. Time could not wreck the perfect symmetry of those walls, nor the site itself, a jewel in the hollow of a hand.'' With 'Rebecca,' a Classic         With those famous opening lines of ''Rebecca,'' written by Miss du Maurier when she was 31, she created one of the classic Gothic romances. It is a story about a young woman who marries a widower and becomes the new mistress of a mansion haunted by the image of his first wife. Trying to solve the mystery, she is drawn into a psychological labyrinth. As the model for Manderley, Miss du Maurier used Menabilly, a 70-room manor on the Cornwall coast. Later, fulfilling a childhood dream, she and her husband moved into the mansion that had served as the setting for her novel.         One British critic called the novel ''a Charlotte Bronte story minus Bronte,'' but found it had its own appeal. Another critic, Basil Davenport, called it a ''melodrama, unashamed, glorying its own quality, such as we have hardly had since that other dependent, Jane Eyre, found that her house too had a first wife.'' In The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote, ''You know the end before you know the beginning; you never know the beginning until, almost, the end. That is a writer's art. Call it a trick, if you like; a trick performed as well as Miss du Maurier performs this trick is art.'' 'I Lose Myself in the Plot'         Long after the novel's international success, Miss du Maurier said she could never understand why it had become an instant favorite that eventually sold over a million hardcover copies. ''It is true that I immersed myself in the characters, especially in the narrator, but then this has happened throughout my writing career. I lose myself in the plot as it unfolds.''         All her life she received letters from readers about the characters in ''Rebecca,'' often asking why she did not give her heroine a Christian name. She explained, ''The answer is simple - I could not think of one, and it became a challenge in technique, the easier because I was writing in the first person.''         Although she had lived in Cornwall quietly, with occasional visits from her son and two daughters, to her neighbors she was known for her interest in protecting the integrity of the land and seascape around her against exploitation. Up to two weeks ago, she took her dog for daily walks along the beach. Several Films From Other Books         Friends said she carried her authorial fame and honors lightly. As the wife of Lieut. Gen. Sir Frederick A. M. Browning, who died in 1965 after serving as treasurer to the Duke of Edinburgh, she was also known as Lady Browning. In 1969, Miss du Maurier was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire.         In addition to ''Rebecca'' (the 1940 film that starred Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine), other movies adapted from her novels included ''Jamaica Inn'' (1939), ''Frenchman's Creek'' (1944), ''The Years Between'' (1946), ''Hungry Hill'' (1947) and ''My Cousin Rachel'' (1953). ''The Birds,'' directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1963, was based on a short story by Miss du Maurier that appeared in a collection, ''Kiss Me Again, Stranger.''         She also wrote a biography of her father, ''Gerald,'' a famous actor and theater manager; ''The du Mauriers,'' a family history; ''The Infernal World of Branwell Bronte, a biography of Patrick Branwell Bronte; and several plays - ''Rebecca,'' based on her novel; ''The Years Between'' and ''September Tide.'' The End as Beginning         Once, talking about the technique of her writing genre, she said, ''What is a suspense novel? The term is a loose one, covering any story from a whodunit to a frivolity turning on which dark stranger gets the blonde. People in doubt, people mystified, people groping their way from one situation to another, from childhood to middle age, from joy to sorrow - these are the figures in a true suspense novel. They are traveling along a road of uncertainty toward an unseen goal. The suspense novel succeeds if the reader says to himself at the final page, 'Yes - it couldn't happen any other way.' In its end, to paraphrase Mary, Queen of Scots, is its beginning.''         Miss du Maurier spoke of her writing without pretension, according to her friends. Asked if one of her novels was about ''boy meets girl,'' the author replied, ''No, it's ghoul meets goon.''         She is survived by a son, Christian Frederick du Maurier-Browning, and two daughters, Lady Tessa Montgomery and Lady Flavia Leng.       
        Elizabeth Cornelia Hall, the retired head librarian of the New York Botanical Garden, died of heart failure Wednesday at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. She was 91 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Elizabeth Cornelia Hall, the retired head librarian of the New York Botanical Garden, died of heart failure Wednesday at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. She was 91 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Miss Hall used to say that she was just no good at retiring. She tried it once, at 70. But she promptly went to work for the Horticultural Society of New York as its librarian emeritus. She returned to the New York Botanical Garden in 1982, in its plant-information service, dispensing advice on dubious mushrooms and sympathy to people with terminal plants.         Once, when a caller asked how she might kill a tree without her husband's knowledge, Miss Hall replied, ''Well, you could kill your husband first.''         She worked at the plant-information service five days a week until January.         Officially, Miss Hall was the Botanical Garden's head librarian for 23 years, from 1937 to 1960. She worked as a research librarian for an additional three years, then became curator of education before attempting retirement in 1967. 'The Gentle Side'         Vigorous and energetic, Miss Hall made three trips to China while in her 80's and continued reading at least one book a week. ''I go to bed around midnight and get up at 7 A.M.,'' she explained, ''and I don't use up energy with makeup, hairdos or manicures.''         She inspired and nurtured America's leading garden writers and horticulturists. ''Helping people to learn about, care for and enjoy plants has given me a joyous life,'' she said on her 90th birthday. ''Plants bring out the gentle side of people.''         For her 90th birthday, the New York Botanical Garden, plus the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Horticultural Society of New York, the New York branch of the Herb Society of America and Wave Hill, paid tribute to her at a birthday party, attesting to the fact that Miss Hall had become an indispensible reference work herself.         Born in Meriden, Conn., she graduated from Radcliffe College and earned a certificate from the Ambler School of Horticulture, now part of Temple University, and a master's degree from Columbia University.         Before joining the Botanical Garden, Miss Hall had been the librarian at the Horticultural Society of New York. She had previously worked as a children's librarian for the New York Public Library.         She aided generations of horticulturists, who admired her wisdom and were amused by her quirks. ''Hers has been an enthusiastic force amongst her worldwide colleagues,'' wrote Charles D. Webster, former president of the Horticultural Society.         Miss Hall loved horse racing. She kept a well-organized card catalogue of promising 2-year-olds, which she called ''my sleepers,'' and she went to the track with relish. ''Here I was, supposed to be a perfectly old-maid, New England librarian,'' said Miss Hall, in no danger of becoming a stereotype. She delighted in telling of once having won the daily double.         She left no survivors.       
        Emily Davie Kornfeld, an author and actress, died of emphysema Friday at her home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         Emily Davie Kornfeld, an author and actress, died of emphysema Friday at her home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Kornfeld was the author of ''Profile of America,'' published in 1954 by Thomas Y. Crowell Company. The book, an illustrated history of the United States, was a compilation of writing by Americans like Thoreau and Jefferson. It was critically acclaimed and a best seller.         But Congress refused to appropriate money for the United States Information Agency to purchase the book for its libraries abroad after a House appropriations subcommittee objected to the work on the basis of pictures that showed a rural schoolhouse and a plain-looking schoolteacher.         The action created a furor in newspapers and magazines. ''What kind of puerility is this?'' asked an editorial in The New York Times. ''Is Congress to pass on every book, to censor every publication?''         The foreword to the book was written by Charles A. Lindbergh, and the introduction was by Louis Bromfield. Mrs. Kornfeld, who wrote the book before she was married, waived her royalties.         Mrs. Kornfeld was a granddaughter of a founder of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. She was born in Tuxedo Park, graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and appeared on the stage on Broadway and at the Old Vic in London.         She was predeceased by her husband, Joseph S. Kornfeld. In 1978, she established a foundation in the name of her husband and herself, which awards grants in medical research and related fields. Mrs. Kornfeld was the founder of the Tuxedo Historical Society.         She had no survivors.       
        Lucille Ball, the irrepressible queen of television comedy for nearly a quarter-century, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles a week after undergoing heart surgery there. She was 77 years old.         Lucille Ball, the irrepressible queen of television comedy for nearly a quarter-century, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles a week after undergoing heart surgery there. She was 77 years old.         A hospital spokesman, Ron Wise, said the actress had suffered a rupture of the aorta after having improved steadily from a seven-hour operation.         Miss Ball, noted for impeccable timing, deft pantomime and an endearing talent for making the outrageous believable, was a Hollywood legend: a contract player at RKO in the 1930's and 40's who later bought the studio with Desi Arnaz, her first husband.         She made her last public appearance four weeks ago at the Academy Awards ceremonies, when she and Bob Hope introduced a production number.         The elastic-faced, husky-voiced comedian was a national institution from 1951 to 1974 in three series and many specials on television that centered on her ''Lucy'' character. The first series, ''I Love Lucy,'' was for six years the most successful comedy series on television, never ranking lower than third. The series, on CBS, chronicled the life of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, a Cuban band leader played by Mr. Arnaz, who was Miss Ball's husband on and off screen for nearly 20 years.         It was a major national event when, on Jan. 19, 1953, Lucy Ricardo gave birth to Little Ricky on the air the same night Lucille Ball gave birth to her second child, Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha 4th. The audience for the episode was estimated at 44 million, a record at the time, and CBS said 1 million viewers responded with congratulatory telephone calls, telegrams, letters or gifts. Miss Ball's first child, Lucie Desiree Arnaz, was born July 17, 1951, three months before the show went on the air.         The Ricardos were the best-known, best-loved couple in America, and the first ''Lucy'' series is still in syndication in more than 80 countries, at times with six episodes a day in a single area.         Analyzing the reasons, Miss Ball explained why her inspired exaggeration of an average middle-class housewife was credible: ''I believe it all the way. I do what I do with all my strength and heart.''         ''Lucille Ball will always be the first lady of CBS,'' William S. Paley, the chairman of the network, said yesterday in a tribute issued by his office. ''Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever.''         Miss Ball was also an astute business executive. From 1962 to 1967, she headed Desilu Productions, one of the biggest and most successful television production companies. Also, starting in 1968, she and her second husband, Gary Morton, a former nightclub comic, headed Lucille Ball Productions.         She bought Mr. Arnaz's share of Desilu Productions in 1962 with a $3 million bank loan, and she sold the company to Gulf and Western Industries in 1967 for $17 million. Her share totaled $10 million.         Discussing how she became an executive, Miss Ball said: ''My ability comes from fairness and a knowledge of people. I ran my studio like I run my home, with understanding of people. We touch in our house. I tell my children, 'There's so little time.' ''         Miss Ball was a tireless worker. ''I have to work or I'm nothing,'' she once said. ''I've never been out of work except for two hours once between contracts.'' On the set, she was said to know every term, every lighting fixture and every worker. A Veteran of Motion Pictures         Before entering television, Miss Ball appeared in more than 50 films, beginning in 1933 as an unbilled chorus girl in an Eddie Cantor musical farce, ''Roman Scandals.'' Her other films included ''Having Wonderful Time'' (1938), ''Room Service'' (1938), ''The Big Street'' (1942), ''Best Foot Forward'' (1943), the title role in ''Du Barry Was a Lady'' (1943), ''Without Love'' (1945), ''Sorrowful Jones'' (1949) and ''Fancy Pants'' (1950).         James Agee, the writer and film critic, observed that Miss Ball ''tackles a role like it was sirloin and she didn't care who was looking.'' Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote in 1938 that she ''is rapidly becoming one of our brightest comediennes.'' In 1960 she also starred in a Broadway musical, ''Wildcat.''         In 1964 there was a Lucy Day at the New York World's Fair, and in 1971 she became the first woman to receive the International Radio and Television Society's Gold Medal. Her many other awards included four Emmys, induction into the Television Hall of Fame and a citation for lifetime achievement from the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Daughter of a Pianist         Lucille Desiree Ball was born on Aug. 6, 1911 in Celoron, outside Jamestown, N.Y. She was the daughter of the former Desiree Hunt, a pianist, and Henry Dunnell Ball, a telephone lineman, who died when she was 3.         As a girl she spent a great deal of time with her maternal grandparents, who instilled in her a deep family loyalty and a commitment to hard work. Her favorite times were attending vaudeville shows and silent films and acting out episodes and plays. Of a school production of ''Charley's Aunt,'' she said, ''I played the lead, directed it, cast it, sold tickets, printed the posters and hauled in furniture for props.''         She embarked on a show-business career at 15 by going to Manhattan and enrolling in John Murray Anderson's dramatic school. From the first, she was repeatedly told she had no talent and should return home. She tried and failed to get into four Broadway chorus lines. From Soda Jerk to Cigarette Girl         She worked variously as a waitress and as a soda jerk in a Broadway drugstore. She then became a hat model in Hattie Carnegie's salon and also modeled for commercial photographers. She won national attention as the Chesterfield Cigarette Girl in 1933. This got her to Hollywood as a Goldwyn chorus girl in ''Roman Scandals.''         Over two years, she played unbilled and bit roles in two dozen movies and made two-reel comedies with Leon Errol and the Three Stooges. She then spent seven years at RKO Radio Pictures, getting many leading roles in low-budget movies. She was typed and mostly wasted in films, but a few roles suggested her talents - a cynical young actress in ''Stage Door'' (1937), a temperamental movie star in ''The Affairs of Annabel'' (1938), a rejected lover in the 1939 melodrama ''Five Came Back,'' a gold-digging stripper in ''Dance, Girl, Dance'' (1940), a handicapped egotist in ''The Big Street'' (1942) and a tough-talking secretary in ''The Dark Corner'' (1946).         ''I never cared about the movies,'' she said later, ''because they cast me wrong.'' A Regular on the Radio         In radio, Miss Ball did regular stints on Phil Baker's and Jack Haley's comedy-variety shows in the late 30's and 40's and, from 1947 to 1951, she played the precursor to Lucy: the hare-brained wife of a Midwestern banker (Lee Bowman and later Richard Denning) in the CBS radio comedy ''My Favorite Husband.'' The show's writers were Madelyn Davis and Bob Carroll Jr., who were to write many Lucy scripts in later decades.         On the stage, Miss Ball won favorable notices for a 22-week tour in the title role of Elmer Rice's fantasy ''Dream Girl.''         In 1950, she and Mr. Arnaz tried to sell the ''I Love Lucy'' television show to CBS. Network executives objected, contending the public would not accept the team of an American redhead and a Cuban bandleader with a heavy accent. To prove their case, the couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour with a 20-minute act that included a ''Cuban Pete-Sally Sweet'' medley. They produced a 30-minute film pilot with $5,000 of their own money. The broadcast officials were won over. Premiere in 1951         ''I Love Lucy'' had its premiere on Oct. 15, 1951, and within a few months millions of Americans tuned in every Monday evening to watch the antics of the Ricardos and their best friends, Fred and Ethel Mertz (William Frawley and Vivian Vance).         ''I Love Lucy'' was one of the first shows to be filmed rather than performed live, making it possible to have a high-quality print of each episode for rebroadcast, compared with the poor quality of live-show kinescopes. The change eventually led to a shift of television production from New York to Hollywood. The show was the first to be filmed before an audience, and crew members used three cameras at once to permit motion-picture-type editing. The series won more than 200 awards, including five Emmys.         Jack Gould of The Times offered this analysis: ''The extraordinary discipline and intuitive understanding of farce gives 'I Love Lucy' its engaging lilt and lift. Only after a firm foundation of credibility has been established is the element of absdurdity introduced. It is in the smooth transition from sense to nonsense that 'I Love Lucy' imparts both a warmth and a reality to the slapstick romp that comes as the climax.'' Miss Ball's superb timing, Mr. Gould wrote, makes her ''the distaff equivalent of Jack Benny,'' her professional idol. A Fortune in Rerun Rights         Mr. Arnaz made a fortune for the couple by obtaining rerun rights for the series. He later sold the rights to CBS, allowing the couple's production company, Desilu, to buy a studio, the former RKO lot where Miss Ball's film career had languished and where they had met in 1940 while appearing together in ''Too Many Girls.''         Despite the continuing popularity of ''I Love Lucy,'' the couple sought a less demanding schedule and ended the series in 1957 after making 179 episodes. The format persisted, however, for three more years through a series of hourlong, high-budget, around-the-world specials called ''The Luci-Desi Comedy Hour.'' Their collaboration ended with their divorce in 1960. Mr. Arnaz died in 1986.         Two years after their divorce, Miss Ball revived ''Lucy,'' playing a widow in ''The Lucy Show'' for 156 episodes until 1968, then did ''Here's Lucy'' for 144 episodes from 1968 to 1974. In these two series she was joined by her two children, her longtime friend Vivian Vance and Gale Gordon, who succeeded Mr. Arnaz as her masculine foil. In shaping situation comedies, Miss Ball consistently sought superior writers, followed their advice, gave them unstinting credit and paid close attention to production details.         In later movies, she co-starred with Bob Hope in two comedies, ''The Facts of Life'' (1961) and ''Critic's Choice'' (1963), and appeared with Henry Fonda in ''Yours, Mine and Ours,'' a 1968 farce about a couple with nearly a score of children. In 1974 she starred in a film version of the stage hit ''Mame.'' Last Series Failed         Miss Ball also appeared occasionaly in television specials and played a spunky bag lady in a 1985 television movie, ''Stone Pillow.'' John J. O'Connor of The Times said she was ''as wily and irresistible as ever'' and ''in total control.'' In 1986, she returned to weekly television as a grandmother in another sitcom series called ''Life With Lucy,'' but it failed to gain an audience.         Addressing a group of would-be actors, she said the best way to get along with tough directors was ''don't die when they knock you down.'' She said she was very shy at the start of her career, but overcame it when ''it finally occurred to me that nobody cared a damn.''         Associates called Miss Ball self-reliant, sympathetic and sometimes tempestuous. ''Life is no fun,'' she once said, ''without someone to share it with.''         For many years she and Mr. Morton had homes in Beverly Hills and Palm Springs and in Snowmass, Colo.         Miss Ball is survived by her husband, her daughter, her son and three grandchildren.         Funeral plans were incomplete last night.       
        Margery A. Ryerson, a painter and lithographer, died March 30 at the King Street Nursing Home in Rye Brook, N.Y. She was 102 years old.         Margery A. Ryerson, a painter and lithographer, died March 30 at the King Street Nursing Home in Rye Brook, N.Y. She was 102 years old.         Miss Ryerson was known for her portraits of children, and many of her prints are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution, the Brooklyn Museum and other American museums. For many years she exhibited her works with Grand Central Art Galleries, and she received awards from the Hudson Valley Art Association and the National Arts Club on Gramercy Park in New York, where she lived for more than 30 years.         Miss Ryerson studied art with Robert Henri and Charles Hawthorne, and edited Mr. Henri's ''Art Spirit,'' a book on the philosophy of art. She was also a co-editor of ''Hawthorne on Painting'' and frequently wrote about art for magazines, newspapers and art journals.         Miss Ryerson was a descendant of one of the first Dutch families to settle in the United States and her ancestral home in New Jersey, Ringwood Manor, is now a state park.         There are no survivors.       
        Dona Guimaraes, editor of the Home Design and Entertaining sections of The New York Times Magazine, died of lung cancer Monday night at New York Hospital. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan and Quogue, L.I.         Dona Guimaraes, editor of the Home Design and Entertaining sections of The New York Times Magazine, died of lung cancer Monday night at New York Hospital. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan and Quogue, L.I.         Before joining The Times as editor of The Home Section in 1979, Ms. Guimaraes was executive editor of Mademoiselle magazine. She had previously worked as a fashion editor and reporter at Mademoiselle, Charm and Women's Wear Daily.         ''Dona has been a sensitive and elegant spirit in directing the coverage of design and home affairs,'' Max Frankel, executive editor of The Times, said. ''She leaves an indelible mark on The Times and on all who worked with her.''         Ms. Guimaraes was born in Dearborn, Mich. She attended Middlebury College and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1946. She received a master's in English from the university in 1947. Ms. Guimaraes lectured on the history of fashion and design at the Smithsonian Institution, the Los Angeles Museum of Art and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York.         Her mother, the late Dorothy Hailes Guimaraes, was a collector of 19th- and 20th-century decorative objects who donated extensively to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn and the costumes division of the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institution.         Ms. Guimaraes was well known for essays on style, often memoirs of her childhood, on the back page of the Home Design magazine. Of her twice-yearly family literary teas, which brought out the worst of the family silver, including claw-footed napkin rings, she wrote, ''Every ornate curve became a duel between object and polisher. I usually lost.''         Among friends and colleagues she was known for her personal style, a hawklike eye for detail and a habit of rarely going anywhere without her tape measure. A devoted collector and preservationist, she renovated a 1924 worker's cottage and an early 19th-century barn that had been a dance hall.         Surviving are a sister, Suzanne, of Talkeetna, Alaska, and a brother, Paul, of Canoga Park, Calif.       
        Alice-Leone Moats, a journalist who was the author of nine books, died Sunday at Graduate Hospital, Philadelphia, after a long illness. She was 81 years old and lived in Philadelphia.         Alice-Leone Moats, a journalist who was the author of nine books, died Sunday at Graduate Hospital, Philadelphia, after a long illness. She was 81 years old and lived in Philadelphia.         Miss Moats was a foreign correspondent for Collier's magazine in Japan, China and the Soviet Union, among other countries, before becoming a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer.         Born in Mexico of wealthy and socially prominent American parents, she was educated at convent schools in Mexico City, Rome and Paris, at the Brearley School in Manhattan and the Fermata School for Girls in Aiken, N.C.         In 1933 she wrote ''No Nice Girl Swears'' (St. Martin's Press), a sassy book of etiquette that immediately became a best seller. It took years of foreign correspondence and the publishing in 1943 of her favorite book, ''Blind Date with Mars,'' (Doubleday Doran) about a journey through the Far East, before the furor cooled off.         In a 1984 interview, Miss Moats, who never married although she said she had been engaged eight times, noted that society had changed. Instead of pretty debutantes, she said, society had become what she called ''the Face Lift Brigade.''         ''I'm glad I had money when I was young and pretty,'' she said.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Arline Thomas, known as ''the bird lady of Queens'' for the number of wild birds she sheltered and rescued, died of congestive heart failure Monday at Huntington (L.I.) Hospital. She was 85 years old and lived in Hollis, Queens.         Arline Thomas, known as ''the bird lady of Queens'' for the number of wild birds she sheltered and rescued, died of congestive heart failure Monday at Huntington (L.I.) Hospital. She was 85 years old and lived in Hollis, Queens.         Mrs. Thomas, until recently a member of the Audubon Society's volunteer bird-saving corps, treated 200 or more wild birds a year. She had ducks in her bathtub, birds perched on the edges of mixing bowls while she made cakes, owls vying for a place on the kitchen window sill and a blue jay that poked cashew nuts into the ears of a pet rabbit. She fed them birdseed, babyfood, scraped beef, dog biscuits and once, to a tiny, timid horned lark, shrimp salad.         Mrs. Thomas held Federal and state licenses to treat wild birds. The licenses stipulate that when the birds are well, they must be released. Between May and September, she would devote about 12 hours a day to the birds, hand-feeding her nestlings with a tweezer every hour.         She treated her first patient, a one-eyed nuthatch suffering from a sprained wing, more than 30 years ago. Soon neighbors started taking injured birds to her and eventually, with help from the New York Zoological Society's head birdkeeper, Mrs. Thomas learned to care for them properly.         ''I felt sorry for the birds,'' she said in a 1985 interview. ''I was home, few others were doing it, and anyway I believe you get what you give in this life.''         Mrs. Thomas wrote many articles and a number of books on the care of wild birds, including ''Bird Ambulance'' (Scribner's, 1971), ''Mockingbird Trio'' (Scribner's, 1973), and ''Salty'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1981).         A widow, she is survived by a stepson, Frank Thomas of Garden City, L.I., and eight grandchildren.       
        Lydia Pasternak Slater, a poet who translated some of the works of her brother, Boris Pasternak, the Russian Nobel laureate in literature, died in Oxford, England, on May 4 after a long illness. She was 87 years old.         Lydia Pasternak Slater, a poet who translated some of the works of her brother, Boris Pasternak, the Russian Nobel laureate in literature, died in Oxford, England, on May 4 after a long illness. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Slater was the youngest of four children of Leonid Pasternak, a Russian Impressionist painter who was once commissioned by Leo Tolstoy to illustrate one of his books. Her mother, Rosalia, was a concert pianist.         After her marriage in 1936 to a British psychiatrist, Dr. Eliot Slater, she moved to London from Germany. Her parents followed her to England to escape anti-Semitism. In Oxford, she wrote poetry and worked as a translator.         Mrs. Slater is survived by two sons and two daughters.       
        Dorothy Ruth Pirone, whose father was Babe Ruth but who did not learn the identity of her natural mother until she was 59 years old, died yesterday at her home in Durham, Conn. She was 68 years old.         Dorothy Ruth Pirone, whose father was Babe Ruth but who did not learn the identity of her natural mother until she was 59 years old, died yesterday at her home in Durham, Conn. She was 68 years old.         For most of her life, Mrs. Pirone was led to believe that her mother was the baseball star's first wife, Helen. Over the years, Mr. Ruth and his first wife gave conflicting birth dates and details. It was not until 1980 that Mrs. Pirone learned her real mother was Juanita Jennings, a woman she had grown up knowing and loving as a close family friend.         Last year, Mrs. Pirone wrote a book about her father, ''My Dad, the Babe,'' which was co-authored by Chris Martens and published on the 40th anniversary of her father's death, Aug. 16, 1988.         Mrs. Pirone, who raised Arabian horses in Durham for more than a dozen years, is survived by four daughters, a son and 12 grandchildren.       
        Gilda Radner, the Emmy Award-winning comedian who created the nasal-voiced broadcaster Roseanne Roseannadanna, the nerdy teen-ager Lisa Loopner and the bumbling complainer Emily Litella for the television show ''Saturday Night Live,'' died of cancer early yesterday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 42 years old.         Gilda Radner, the Emmy Award-winning comedian who created the nasal-voiced broadcaster Roseanne Roseannadanna, the nerdy teen-ager Lisa Loopner and the bumbling complainer Emily Litella for the television show ''Saturday Night Live,'' died of cancer early yesterday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 42 years old.         ''There's a preciseness to her parody,'' the critic Molly Haskell once said of Miss Radner. ''Like Dickens, she's added people to the world who bear her stamp. And even when she's tasteless you don't wince. There's something very gentle and sweet in Gilda that comes through.''         As a guest editorialist on ''Saturday Night Live's'' parody of the weekend news, Miss Radner, in the character of Miss Litella, would rail against broadcasters for paying too much attention to ''endangered feces.'' And only when it was made clear to her that the subject was ''endangered species'' would she back off, mewling, ''Never mind.'' Other topics that enraged her included conservation of national race horses, preoccupation with violins on television and concern for Soviet jewelry.         Besides her standard ''Never mind,'' Miss Radner coined the catch phrase for the scatterbrained Roseanne Roseannadanna, ''It's always something,'' which became the title of a book she wrote detailing her fight with ovarian cancer. By Her Side         Miss Radner, whose illness was diagnosed two and a half years ago, died in her sleep about 6:20 A.M. at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a hospital spokesman, Ron Wise, said. Her husband of five years, the actor and filmmaker Gene Wilder, was at her side.         ''I loved her like a sister; my thoughts are with Gene and her family,'' said Dan Aykroyd, a fellow ''Saturday Night'' star. Mr. Aykroyd's comments were relayed by a spokeswoman, Susan Patricola.         Miss Radner, who won the Emmy as the outstanding actress in a variety series, was reared in a quasi-theatrical family in Detroit. ''My father had a hotel,'' she once told an interviewer, ''and people in show business used to stay there. He loved peformers and entertainment, and I grew up knowing that. Some of his spunk must have come out in me, because he used to love to perform, too. He was funny, he could tell a good story, he could do magic tricks.''         When Gilda was 12, her father became terminally ill. Two years later, he died and left her a large estate. Majored in Drama         She majored in drama at the University of Michigan, dropped out and followed a boyfriend to Canada, where she landed a role in the Toronto production of ''Godspell'' and later with the comedy revue ''Second City.'' In 1974 she came to New York to do ''The National Lampoon Radio Hour'' and ''The National Lampoon Show.''         Soon after, Lorne Michaels, the creator of ''Saturday Night Live,'' began putting together the show. He had seen some of Miss Radner's work. ''I felt there was a remarkable quality to her, a goodness which came through whatever she was doing,'' he said. When, in 1975, he was ready to sign on cast members, he chose Miss Radner first.         In 1979, Miss Radner took her television characters - including Baba Wawa, a spoof of Barbara Walters - to Broadway, where she appeared at the Winter Garden in a revue ''Gilda Live.'' The production was then filmed and released as a movie. In Several Films         After ''Saturday Night Live'' she appeared in several films, including ''First Family'' and ''The Woman in Red,'' a 1984 hit written and directed by her co-star and future husband, Mr. Wilder. She also appeared in ''Haunted Honeymoon,'' ''Hanky Panky'' and ''It Came From Hollywood.''         Miss Radner also starred in a dramatic role on Broadway in the play ''Lunch Hour'' with Sam Waterston, in 1980. ''Wanna know my biggest fear?'' she asked just before a performance of the Jean Kerr play. ''It's that I'll come out and someone in the audience will yell, 'Hey, Gilda! Do Roseanne Roseannadanna!' ''         Funeral services will be private.       
        Margot Zemach, an award-winning children's book illustrator and author whose witty, lively works reinterpreted folk tales for younger readers, died of Lou Gehrig's disease Sunday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 57 years old.         Margot Zemach, an award-winning children's book illustrator and author whose witty, lively works reinterpreted folk tales for younger readers, died of Lou Gehrig's disease Sunday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 57 years old.         Ms. Zemach was the illustrator or author of more than 40 children's books, including ''Duffy and the Devil,'' ''The Judge,'' ''A Penny a Look,'' ''Salt'' ''Mommy, Buy Me a China Doll,'' ''It Could Always Be Worse'' and ''To Hilda for Helping.''         ''Margot not only revivified the American picture book, but was one of the very few who helped elevate it to an art form,'' said Maurice Sendak, the children's book author and illustrator. ''She was one of the most accomplished picture-book artists on the international scene - a superlative draftsman, a shrewd psychologist and most important, a passionate, tragicomic original.'' Won the Caldecott Medal         ''I consider her the consummate illustrator for children's literature,'' said William Steig, the childrens' book author and illustrator, and a magazine artist for The New Yorker. ''There's no doubt her work will endure.''         In 1974, for ''Duffy and the Devil,'' Ms. Zemach won the Caldecott Medal, the most prestigious American award for children's book illustration, sponsored by the American Library Association. She was twice selected as the American nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration, the most prestigious international children's book award.         Ms. Zemach was born Nov. 30, 1931 in Los Angeles, and studied at the Los Angeles County Art Institute. She won a Fulbright Scholarship to study drawing in Vienna in 1955. Collaborated With Her Husband         In 1957, she and another Fulbright student, Harvey Fischtrom, were married and began a children's-book collaboration that was to last until her husband's death in 1974.         Their first book, ''Small Boy Is Listening,'' published under the double byline of Margot and Harve Zemach appeared in 1959. She did the drawings and he wrote the text.         At the time of her death Ms. Zemach was working on a picture book of ''Mother Goose'' nursery rhymes. Her principal publisher, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, plans to issue it in 1990.         She is survived by her stepfather, Benjamin; a sister, Amielle; four daughters, Heidi, Rachel, Rebecca and Kaethe Zemach-Bersin, and two granddaughters.       
        Joanna Roos, an actress, died of a ruptured aorta on May 13 at the Medical Center at Princeton (N.J.) She was 88 years old and lived in Hightstown, N.J.         Joanna Roos, an actress, died of a ruptured aorta on May 13 at the Medical Center at Princeton (N.J.) She was 88 years old and lived in Hightstown, N.J.         Miss Roos, who was born in Brooklyn, attended Syracuse University. She appeared on Broadway and in summer stock from 1921 until the late 1960's, working with such actors as Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. She acted in the San Diego and New York Shakespeare Festivals, as well as in films and television. She retired in 1979 from the soap opera ''Love of Life.''         She was a founding member of the New Dramatists Committee. Several of the plays she wrote for the group won awards.         Miss Roos is survived by her son, Peter Rickett, of Greenville, S.C., and by four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
        Sally Kirkland, a chronicler of fashion for more than 30 years, died of emphysema Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Sally Kirkland, a chronicler of fashion for more than 30 years, died of emphysema Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         From 1947 to 1969 she was the fashion editor of Life magazine, making that general-interest weekly influential in international fashion. She stopped traffic in the Place de la Concorde in Paris to get a fashion picture. A cover photograph of Sybil Connally, the Irish designer, put Ireland on the fashion map.         She received the Order of the Star of Solidarity in 1954 from the Italian Government for her reports on Italian clothes. ''I was secretly pleased,'' she told a friend, ''because the medal was green and gold and looked well on an orange evening dress I had to whip up for the affair.''         Along with Grace Kelly and Vera Maxwell, the designer, she received a Neiman-Marcus award in 1955 for contributions to fashion.         After graduating from Vassar College in 1934, she worked in the college shop at Lord & Taylor, then the headquarters for the best casual American clothes. In 1939 she became an assistant editor of Vogue magazine, leaving nine years later to become the fashion editor of Life.         She was the first fashion editor to do multiple-model sittings, recalled Nancy White, the former fashion editor of Harper's Bazaar. A dozen or more models would stretch across one or two pages for a dazzling presentation that was widely copied.         After she left Life magazine, Mrs. Kirkland wrote a book about Claire McCardell, her favorite designer, and contributed articles to the RAM Report, a monthly trade journal.         She is survived by a daughter, Sally Kirkland, the actress, of Los Angeles, and a brother, Robert T. Phinney of Santa Fe, N.M. The funeral will be private.       
        Zinka Milanov, the leading dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly 30 years until her retirement in 1966, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had suffered a stroke on Saturday.         Zinka Milanov, the leading dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly 30 years until her retirement in 1966, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had suffered a stroke on Saturday.         It was generally acknowledged that Miss Milanov was the greatest dramatic soprano after Rosa Ponselle, who retired early in 1937. On Dec. 17, 1937, the young Yugoslav soprano made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Leonora in Verdi's ''Trovatore.'' It was not one of the more fabulous debuts in the Met's history, and critics hedged about the new singer.         But when Miss Milanov settled down after a few performances and demonstrated what she could do, it became clear that the great Ponselle had a worthy successor. In her first season at the Metropolitan Opera, Olin Downes, then the chief music critic of The New York Times, constantly referred to her ''magnificent'' voice and her ''grand manner.'' Virgil Thomson in The New York Herald Tribune wrote that she had a voice ''with a beauty unmatched among the sopranos of this country.''         Everything about Miss Milanov commanded respect, and that included her physical and vocal size.         When Edward Johnson, then general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, heard her in 1937 at the Salzburg Festival, where she was singing under the baton of Arturo Toscanini, he immediately recognized her potential and offered her a contract that had two stipulations: She had to learn her roles in Italian (up to then she had been singing Italian operas in her native Croatian or in German), and she had to take off 25 pounds. English, After a Fashion         She not only learned to sing in impeccable Italian, but she also learned English, after a fashion. For many years she would order a ''martinelli'' instead of a martini, an allusion to the musical associations with the tenor Giovanni Martinelli.         She was always struggling with her weight and often tried to diet. But she liked to eat, and was herself a good cook, specializing in Yugoslav dishes. Once she took off considerable weight and a critic wrote that the dieting had also brought with it ''a disturbing lessening of her powers.''         Miss Milanov shrugged off the comment. ''You try to do your best to please the public, please critics, please everybody,'' she said. ''Then you lose weight and they don't like you. What you do? You get bugs in the head.'' A Formidable Ego         Miss Milanov was a legend around the Metropolitan Opera in more ways than one. Her ego was commensurate with her stature as a vocalist.         ''I love applause,'' she once said to an interviewer. ''Money is not everything. Money is last.'' Rash was the singer who would try to upstage Miss Milanov at curtain calls.         Stories about her circulated in the house almost from the moment she first set foot on stage. Once, during a stage rehearsal, she looked into the auditorium and saw the team of backup singers for ''Il Trovatore.'' She advanced to the footlights. ''Listen, listen, listen - learn, learn, learn,'' she told the young singers. In a Mischievous Mood         It is said that she could drive her colleagues crazy during performances when she was in a mischievous mood. George London, as Amonasro in ''Aida,'' would be preparing for his big baritone solo. Miss Milanov at that moment would whisper in his ear, ''How's the baby, George?'' Or, in the ''Aida'' Nile scene with a tenor she did not particularly like: ''You're not in good voice tonight, are you? Do you think you can make that high B?''         She could be inconsistent in her singing. It was noticed time and again that Miss Milanov could sing like an angel in one act and have pitch troubles in another.         But there was never a time in any opera when she did not thrill her audiences, and she did so entirely through her voice, because she never was much of an actress. Definitely of the old operatic school of acting, she used the exaggerated gestures and facial expressions that went out in the early days of silent films. But she was a fine musician and never used her voice in an exaggerated manner.         Her singing was refined, subtle, powerful, sensitive or dramatic, as the music demanded. She produced a big, warm sound and had an equalized scale up to a secure high C. In the ''Aida'' Nile scene she was able to take a haunting pianissimo on the C that will forever float in memory. She was equally impressive in ''Il Trovatore,'' an opera that she ''owned.'' Fortunately, she recorded that opera with Jussi Bjoerling and Leonard Warren, and connoisseurs believe it is the greatest performance of that work ever put on disks. Born to a Musical Family         She was born in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, on May 17, 1906, the daughter of a bandmaster named Rudolf Kunc. The family was musical, and her brother, Bozidar, became a pianist and composer who often was her accompanist for her recitals. She also had an uncle who composed songs for her early recitals. She started singing as a child and made her recital debut in Zagreb when she was 15 years old.         Milka Ternina, a great Wagnerian soprano at the turn of the century, heard the young soprano and took her as a pupil for three years. After graduating from the Royal Music Academy in Zagreb, where she won first prize in singing, Miss Kunc became a member of the State Opera, making her debut as Leonora in ''Il Trovatore.''         Soon she was singing in opera houses in Germany and Central Europe, and appearing with orchestras under conductors like Bruno Walter. Toscanini invited her to Salzburg in 1937 to sing the soprano solo in the Verdi Requiem. She was to sing it with him many times in the future.         She married a Yugoslav actor and director, Predrag Milanov, in 1937. He served as her dramatic coach for many years. Gave 445 Met Performances         At the Metropolitan Opera she specialized in Verdi roles, above all ''Aida,'' which she sang at the house and on tour with the Met 75 times. She also appeared in ''Il Trovatore'' 49 times, ''La Forza del Destino'' 37 times, ''Un Ballo in Maschera'' 30 times, ''Otello'' 17 times, ''Simon Boccanegra'' 10 times and ''Ernani'' 8 times. Her other roles were Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' which she sang 57 times, Ponchielli's Gioconda, Puccini's Tosca, Bellini's Norma (a role ventured by only three sopranos at the Met in the 60 years before Miss Milanov sang it), Mozart's Donna Anna and Maddalena in Giordano's ''Andrea Chenier,'' the role she sang at her farewell. All told, she gave 445 performances with the company.         Miss Milanov became an American citizen in 1946. ''When you come to America,'' she said, ''you get independent like American women.'' At that time, she was getting a divorce from Mr. Milanov. In 1947, she married Gen. Ljubo Ilic of Yugoslavia. Though trained as an architect, he had served as a general with the Resistance in southern France.         At the time of his marriage, General Ilic, a close friend of Marshal Tito, was a diplomat. Miss Milanov left the Met from 1947 to 1951, returning to Yugoslavia with her husband. Accused of Being a Spy         In 1949 she was accused by the Soviet Union of being a United States spy. She said the charge was ''silly.'' Her manager, Jack Adams, laughed at the allegation. He said that Miss Milanov could never have been a spy because she could never keep a secret, and that she was interested only in music, clothes, good food and wine.         She was honored on her 25th anniversary at the Metropolitan Opera with an on-stage ceremony, with Rudolf Bing, the Met's general manager, as master of ceremonies. She decided to retire at the end of the 1965-66 season, just before the opening of the new opera house in Lincoln Center. ''It is better,'' she said, ''to go away on two legs rather than on one.''         In her last operatic performance, on April 14, 1966, she sang the role of Maddalena in ''Andrea Chenier.'' In a ceremony on stage after the third act, Mr. Bing presented her with a Steuben glass cup and Lowell Wadmond, the chairman of the Met's board, gave her a silver tray. Two days later, Miss Milanov made her final appearance in the house. During the festivities on April 16, the final day at the old Met, she sang a ''Chenier'' duet with Richard Tucker.         In her years of retirement, Miss Milanov kept up a lively interest in the affairs of the Metropolitan and devoted much of her time to coaching younger singers (among them Christa Ludwig, Regine Crespin and Anna Moffo). She divided each year between Manhattan and Yugoslavia. Her recent birthday was celebrated with a party for 20 close friends and relatives in her home, for which the soprano, as was her custom, did all the cooking.         She is survived by her husband.       
        Christine Jorgensen, a former Army private from the Bronx who underwent surgery and hormone treatments in Denmark in 1952 to change from a male to a female, died of cancer yesterday in San Clemente, Calif. She was 62 years old.         Christine Jorgensen, a former Army private from the Bronx who underwent surgery and hormone treatments in Denmark in 1952 to change from a male to a female, died of cancer yesterday in San Clemente, Calif. She was 62 years old.         The San Clemente General Hospital issued a statement saying Miss Jorgensen's death followed a long bout with bladder and lung cancer.         Miss Jorgensen was born in the Westchester section of the Bronx on May 20, 1926, and was named George Jorgensen Jr. In her book, ''Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Biography,'' published in 1967, Miss Jorgensen said she had a normal, happy childhood but on growing up became frustrated by feelings that she was a woman trapped in a man's body. A Sensation in Tabloids         As George Jorgensen, she served as a clerk in the Army. After being honorably discharged, she decided to seek a sex change operation.         Her sexual conversion began with hormone injections in 1950, when she was 24 years old. It was completed in 1952 with surgery at the Danish State Hospital in Copenhagen under the care of Dr. Christian Hamburger, a Danish hormone expert whose first name she took to form her own.         On her return to the United States in 1955, her transsexualism was sensationalized in the daily tabloids, some of which she gave exclusive interviews.         One tabloid headline read, ''Bronx GI Becomes a Woman!'' and went on, ''Dear Mum and Dad, Son Wrote, I Have Now Become Your Daughter.''         The New York Times carried a five-paragraph Associated Press story headlined, ''Bronx 'Boy' Is Now A Girl.''         ''At first I was very self-conscious and very awkward,'' Miss Jorgensen said in an interview in 1970. ''But once the notoriety hit, it did not take me long to adjust.''         Miss Jorgensen was the first transsexual in the United States to publicly announce her change of sexual identity. Rather than withdraw from public attention, she turned the notoriety to her advantage with a series of lucrative tours on the lecture and nightclub circuit. Her nightclub act featured the theme song, ''I Enjoy Being a Girl.''         ''I decided if they wanted to see me, they would have to pay for it,'' she said. Chose Not to Marry         She made headlines again in 1959 when she sought, but was denied, a license to marry because her birth certificate said she was a male. She later chose not to marry. She could not have had children.         In an interview last year, she said she never regretted her decision to change sexes. She linked the public reaction to her decision, in part, to the awakening that led to the sexual revolution of the 1950's and 1960's.         But as a person who had experienced both sides of the issue, she said in an interview in 1972 that she did not understand the women's liberation movement.         Discussing the subject with a group of students at the University of Minnesota at Duluth, Miss Jorgensen said: ''I don't know very many women who arent't liberated. Men need liberation too.''         For the last 20 years, she lived in California, the last two in San Clemente.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy, and two nieces.       
        Christine Weston, a novelist and short-story writer whose work was set largely in India, died Wednesday in her apartment in Bangor, Me., her family reported. She was 85 years old.         Christine Weston, a novelist and short-story writer whose work was set largely in India, died Wednesday in her apartment in Bangor, Me., her family reported. She was 85 years old.         Praising her work, E. M. Forster wrote in 1950: ''Mrs. Weston writes seriously, carefully compassionately; she is not interested in the glamorous East or in the boosting of this or that political creed; she writes for those who are emotionally involved in the country and who love it.''         Reviewing her novel ''Indigo'' in The New York Times in 1943, Willard Thorp cited ''the richness of the setting - the fragrance and the filth of the river and its plains, the languorous days and liq=uid nights, the rank jungle growth, the tug of racial conflict.''         For her part, Mrs. Weston once wrote: ''The country of one's childhood is always predominant in one's memory: India is a beautiful, kindly land, and notwithstanding all the perils of life in the tropics, it is a fine country for any child to grow up in.''         Mrs. Weston wrote 10 novels; more than 30 short stories, most of which appeared in The New Yorker magazine; two nonfiction books - on Ceylon and Afghanistan, respectively - and a children's book.         She was born Christine Goutiere in Unao in what is now Uttar Pradesh in northern India. She was the daughter of Georges Goutiere and the former Alicia Wintle. Her father was a British barrister who was descended from French indigo planters in India. She grew up in India, assisted her father, married an American businessman, Robert Weston in 1923, and moved with him to Maine, where she resided thereafter. Some of her fiction is set in New England.         Her other books include the novels ''Be Thou the Bride'' (1940), ''The Devil's Foot'' (1942), ''The Dark Wood'' (1946), ''The World Is a Bridge'' (1950), ''The Hoopoe'' (1970) and a volume of short stories, ''There and Then'' (1947).         She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1940.         After her first husband's death in the early 1950's, she married Roger Griswold in 1960. He died in 1973.         Mrs. Weston is survived by a sister, Geraldine Goutiere Acomb, of Avon, Conn., and two brothers, Vernon, of Patterson, Calif., and Peter, of Coral Springs, Fla.       
        Lisa Sergio, a pioneer radio news broadcaster in Mussolini's Italy who became a dedicated anti-Fascist and a news commentator for WQXR and other American radio stations, died of a heart attack Thursday at her home in Washington. She was 84 years old.         Lisa Sergio, a pioneer radio news broadcaster in Mussolini's Italy who became a dedicated anti-Fascist and a news commentator for WQXR and other American radio stations, died of a heart attack Thursday at her home in Washington. She was 84 years old.         Miss Sergio, a slender, fiery contralto once known as ''the Golden Voice of Rome,'' also translated the dictator's blustering speeches into English and French almost simultaneously on the air until her modifications of propaganda commentaries prompted her dismissal from Rome radio.         Faced with arrest and internment in 1937, she was smuggled aboard a trans-Atlantic liner by a family friend, Guglielmo Marconi, the radio developer. She settled in New York City, where she soon became a guest observer for NBC radio and the host for broadcasts including Metropolitan Opera performances and Berkshire music festivals.         She then became one of the few female news commentators with her own program, broadcasting seven times a week on WQXR from 1939 to 1946, when the station dropped single news commentaries in favor of forum talks. 'Mental Honesty'         ''Lisa Sergio was a most attractive personality both on and off the air,'' said Elliott M. Sanger, a founder and longtime executive of the station. In his 1973 book about WQXR, ''Rebel in Radio,'' he hailed her comments on foreign news and cultural events.         Miss Sergio was a fervent advocate of democracy, free speech and feminism. Analyzing her broadcasts, she said, ''Mental honesty is essential because the microphone has a strange and impolite way of sending over the airwaves not only what the commentators say, but also what they think.''         The commentator was born Elisa Sergio in Florence to Baron Agostino Sergio, a landowner, and the former Margaret FitzGerald of Baltimore.         With no professional background, she soon became the editor of Italian Mail, an English literary weekly in Florence, worked as a freelance writer and researched and wrote on archeology. After her broadcasting career in Rome and New York, she taught propaganda analysis at Columbia University, lectured widely at American colleges and wrote several books, including ''I Am My Beloved: the Life of Anita Garibaldi'' (1965). She was also a board member or trustee of many philanthropic and cultural groups.         There are no immediate survivors.

She was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Edith Begner, a novelist whose work focused on the medical profession, died of lymphatic leukemia on Wednesday at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass. She was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Begner, a native New Yorker, wrote five novels, including ''Just Off Fifth'' (1959), ''Son and Heir'' (1960) and ''Accident of Birth'' (1977).         She is survived by a son, Thomas, of Concord; a sister, Theodora Baron, of Miami, and two grandchildren.       
        Fran Allison, the warm-voiced human component of the popular television show ''Kukla, Fran and Ollie,'' died of bone marrow failure at the Sherman Oaks (Calif.) Community Hospital yesterday. She was 81 years old and lived in Van Nuys, Calif.         Fran Allison, the warm-voiced human component of the popular television show ''Kukla, Fran and Ollie,'' died of bone marrow failure at the Sherman Oaks (Calif.) Community Hospital yesterday. She was 81 years old and lived in Van Nuys, Calif.         To a generation of children in the late 1940's and the 50's, Miss Allison was the girlfriend, mother and gentle conscience of the Kuklapolitan Players, the puppet troupe created by Burr Tillstrom. Thanks to Tillstrom and Miss Allison, who treated the puppets like people, their exploits and personalities made them family favorites on prime-time television for 10 years.         ''I adored Kukla and Ollie - they were never anything but real to me,'' Miss Allison said in an interview.  Joining the Kuklapolitans She was born in La Porte City, Iowa, and after graduating from Coe College became a teacher. Later, she auditioned as a singer on a local radio station. By 1937, she was a popular radio personality in Chicago.         In 1947, she joined the Kuklapolitan Players, and they made their television debut the following year. ''I needed a girl who could talk to a dragon,'' Tillstrom explained.         By 1950, the show had six million viewers. As Fran, Miss Allison seemed particularly fond of Ollie, an outrageous, single-toothed dragon who adored buttered popcorn and putting his hair in curlers. Kukla loved to lean on Ollie's head, messing his hair. Fran was the soothing character.         In those years, television was performed live and Miss Allison once admitted she never knew in advance exactly what the puppets would say. ''On the air, you say exactly the same thing you would say if it happened for the first time, off the air,'' she said in an interview. A Baritone Dragon         In the early 1950's, Miss Allison made her Town Hall debut, assisting Ollie, whose full name was Oliver J. Dragon, in his first Manhattan performance as a baritone.         ''It may be ironic,'' The New York Times observed in 1952, ''but Kukla and Ollie still seem so real that it's always a little disturbing when Burr Tillstrom steps into view.''         When the program went off the air, it left a group of sad adults and children. ''One of the most imaginative shows ever developed in the electronic medium,'' wrote the Times critic. The program reappeared briefly in the 1970's. Burr Tillstrom died in 1985 at the age of 68.         In the 1960's, Miss Allison was host of a show of films for children and appeared in musicals on television. In Los Angeles, she was host of a program for the elderly, ''Prime Time,'' on KHJ-TV.         Miss Allison is survived by her brother, Lynn, of Chicago.       
        Dayal Kaur Khalsa, an author and illustrator of children's books, died of breast cancer Monday at her home in Vancouver, British Columbia. She was 46 years old.         Dayal Kaur Khalsa, an author and illustrator of children's books, died of breast cancer Monday at her home in Vancouver, British Columbia. She was 46 years old.         Ms. Kaur Kalsa, who adopted the Sikh religion in the early 1970's, wrote several books that received critical acclaim for their evocation of childhood.         ''Tales of a Gambling Grandma,'' published in 1986, recounted the fanciful stories she was told by her Russian-born grandmother. ''I Want a Dog'' (1987), ''Sleepers'' (1988) and ''How Pizza Came to Queens'' as well as other books, all published by Clarkson N. Potter, also drew heavily on memories of childhood. Two works completed before her death will be published this fall and next spring.         Ms. Kaur Khalsa was born in Queens and was a graduate of City College of New York.         She is survived by a brother, Louis Schoenfeld, of New York City.       
        Nancy Andrews, a stage actress and singer hailed for starring performances in ''Little Me'' opposite Sid Caesar and in ''Tobacco Road'' with John Carradine, died on Saturday of a heart attack at St. John's Hospital in Queens. Miss Andrews, who was 68 years old, had lived in Manhattan for decades, but was confined to a nursing home in         Nancy Andrews, a stage actress and singer hailed for starring performances in ''Little Me'' opposite Sid Caesar and in ''Tobacco Road'' with John Carradine, died on Saturday of a heart attack at St. John's Hospital in Queens. Miss Andrews, who was 68 years old, had lived in Manhattan for decades, but was confined to a nursing home in Queens for the last year.         She won a Theater World Award for her 1949 Broadway debut in a hit revue, ''Touch and Go,'' and had later popular successes in ''Hazel Flagg,'' ''Plain and Fancy,'' ''Pipe Dream'' and ''Juno.''         Appraising ''Touch and Go,'' by Jean and Walter Kerr, Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times that ''Nancy Andrews is a versatile comedian who can contribute something out of her own bag of tricks to round out the humor of a song.         ''As an incidental ballad, 'Miss Platt Selects Mate,' may not be exactly uproarious, but it is by the time Miss Andrews gets through larding it up with some very funny mugging.'' Other Stage Roles         Off Broadway, her favorite roles included Mrs. Peachum in the long-running ''Three Penny Opera,'' Julie in Jerome Kern's ''Show Boat,'' Mother Grieg in ''Song of Norway,'' Aunt Eller in ''Oklahoma!'' Mrs. Mister in the award-winning revival of ''The Cradle Will Rock'' and the title role of a corrupt cosmetician in ''Madame Aphrodite.''         On tours, she had leading roles in such musicals as ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,'' ''Funny Girl,'' ''Flower Drum Song,'' ''South Pacific'' and ''A Little Night Music.'' She also often starred in such straight plays as ''The Glass Menagerie'' and ''A Taste of Honey.'' Born in Minneapolis         Nancy Andrews was born in Minneapolis to a hotel owner and a drama coach. She studied at Beverly Hills (Calif.) High School, the Pasadena Playhouse and the American Shakespeare Academy. She also studied the piano, wrote skits and music for a cabaret act, acted in a few films, including ''Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams'' and appeared widely on television.         Surviving is a daughter, Tanima Cynthia Bossart, of Jamaica, Queens.

        Frances Woodworth Wright, a Harvard University astronomer who taught celestial navigation to Navy officers, died of cancer Sunday. She was 92 years old and lived in Cambridge.         Frances Woodworth Wright, a Harvard University astronomer who taught celestial navigation to Navy officers, died of cancer Sunday. She was 92 years old and lived in Cambridge.         In more than half a century of research and teaching, Miss Wright engaged in studies that ranged from investigating specks of cosmic dust called spherules to calculating the brightness of galaxies and developing efforts to observe comets and meteors.         Her special interest was celestial navigation, the guiding of ships by the stars. Among her students were Army engineers and Navy officers enrolled in special courses in World War II. She also taught Harvard undergraduates and weekend sailors and wrote three books on sailing by the stars.         Miss Wright taught astronomy and mathematics at Elmira College in New York before going to Harvard in 1928, where she became a lecturer. She earned a doctorate in astronomy from Radcliffe College in 1958 and retired in 1971.       
        Antonia Brico, a conductor who led her own orchestras in New York in the 1930's and who devoted her life to fighting prejudice against women in the orchestral world, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 87 years old and had lived at the Bella Vita Towers, a nursing home in Denver, since 1988.         Antonia Brico, a conductor who led her own orchestras in New York in the 1930's and who devoted her life to fighting prejudice against women in the orchestral world, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 87 years old and had lived at the Bella Vita Towers, a nursing home in Denver, since 1988.         Miss Brico, who was the subject of the 1974 film ''Antonia: Portrait of a Conductor,'' made her way in the male-dominated musical world largely through the force of her personality as well as her unshakable determination and a facility with both the standard orchestral literature and contemporary American works.         Those qualities helped her break many barriers. In 1930 she became the first woman to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic. Seven years later she became the first woman to conduct an opera performance by a major New York company when she led the New York Hippodrome Opera production of Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel.'' And in 1938 she made her debut with the New York Philharmonic, becoming the first woman to conduct that orchestra.         She had mixed feelings about these distinctions, however. ''I do not call myself a woman conductor,'' she said in interviews. ''I call myself a conductor who happens to be a woman.'' Moved to U.S. at 6         Miss Brico was born in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on June 26, 1902. Her family moved to Oakland, Calif., when she was 6 years old. She intended to be a pianist at first, but in 1919 she enrolled at the University of California, where she took a liberal arts degree in 1923. During her student years, she supported herself by playing piano recitals and became interested in conducting while working as an assistant to Paul Steindorff, the director of the San Francisco Opera.         In 1927, she went to Berlin to study conducting at the Berlin State Academy of Music. Among her teachers was Karl Muck, a former director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, who was then conducting the Hamburg Philharmonic and who helped her obtain a coaching position at Bayreuth.         When she made her Berlin Philharmonic debut in 1930, the critic of the Allgemeine Zeitung wrote that she ''possesses more ability, cleverness and musicianship than certain of her male colleagues who bore us in Berlin.'' Later that year she conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic but failed to win a conducting post she sought there. After a successful tour of Poland and the Balkans, she returned to New York, where she made her debut conducting the Musicians' Symphony Orchestra. She Founded Her Own         Miss Brico continued to seek a conducting post with one of the established orchestras in the United States, and when she did not succeed, she founded an ensemble of her own, the Women's Symphony Orchestra, which flourished from 1935 until 1939, when it became the Brico Symphony Orchestra.         When her career in New York began to falter, around 1940, she moved to Denver, where she taught and was a guest conductor. In 1947 she became director of the Denver Businessmen's Symphony, which was later renamed the Brico Symphony. She held that post until she retired from conducting in 1985. She also directed the Denver Opera Association, the Women's String Orchestra and the Boulder Philharmonic and was active as a teacher. One of her students in the 1950's was Judy Collins, who became famous as a folksinger in the late 1960's and who directed the ''Antonia'' film.         Miss Collins's film rekindled interest in Miss Brico. When she returned to New York to conduct the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra in 1975, her single scheduled concert sold out so quickly that a second was added. CBS recorded her concerts for release on LP. Her last New York appearances were in 1977, when she performed with the Brooklyn Philharmonia.         There are no survivors.         Correction:  August 18, 1989, Friday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Aug. 5 about the conductor Antonia Brico misidentified a film on her life and credited it incompletely. The film was ''Antonia: A Portrait of the Woman,'' and Jill Godmilow was a co-director with Judy Collins.       
        Lavinia Williams, a dancer and teacher, died of a heart attack on July 19 at the Canape Vert Hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. She was 73 years old.         Lavinia Williams, a dancer and teacher, died of a heart attack on July 19 at the Canape Vert Hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. She was 73 years old.         Miss Williams danced leading roles with the Katherine Dunham Dance Company from 1940 to 1945. She appeared with the company in the Broadway musical ''Cabin in the Sky'' and in the films ''Stormy Weather'' and ''Carnival of Rhythm.''         After leaving the Dunham company, Miss Williams toured Europe with the Noble Sissle revival of ''Shuffle Along,'' dancing the role originated by Josephine Baker. Miss Williams also appeared on Broadway in a 1946 revival of ''Showboat'' and in ''Finian's Rainbow'' and ''My Darlin' Aida.''         She was considered a leader in teaching Haitian dance. Miss Williams arrived in Haiti in 1953 to work with members of the National Folkloric Troupe. She founded the Haitian Institute of Folklore and Classic Dance in 1954, and taught in Antigua, the Bahamas, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad.         She also taught at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center School in Manhattan.         Miss Williams wrote many essays and articles on Haitian dance and also a book, ''Haiti Dance.'' Joining Von Grona Troupe         Miss Williams was born in Philadelphia, and began studying dance at the age of 3. As a scholarship student at the Art Students League in Manhattan, she was invited to sketch dancers during a rehearsal of the Eugene Von Grona American Negro Ballet, and she was invited to join the company. She remained with the company for three years, appearing with the Von Grona Swing Ballet in Lew Leslie's ''Blackbirds of 1939.''         She danced in Agnes de Mille's ''Black Ritual,'' presented by Ballet Theater in its first season, in 1940. Miss Williams's teachers included Anna Sokolow, Martha Graham, Lisan Kay and Kyra Nijinsky.         Miss Williams's marriage to Shannon Yarborough ended in divorce. She is survived by two daughters, Sara Yarborough Smith and Sharron.

Roberta Worrick, who wrote under the pen name Maria Thomas, was among the eight Americans killed last Monday in the crash of the airplane carrying United States Representative Mickey Leland of Texas. She lived in Addis Ababa; her age could not be learned last night.         Her husband, Tom, the deputy director of the United States Agency for International Development in Ethopia, was also killed in the crash.         Mrs. Worrick's novel, ''Antonia Saw the Oryx First,'' published by SoHo Press and distributed by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 1987, drew critical praise for its depiction of the tensions between colonial whites and Africans on a continent buffeted by changes.         After the success of the novel, Soho Press issued ''Come to Africa and Save Your Marriage,'' Mrs. Worrick's collection of short stories in which she told of the difficulties of various people -Peace Corps volunteers, foreign academics, Indians, American blacks and white hunters left behind by colonial empires - in finding their way in black Africa.         Mr. Worrick and her husband went to Africa with the Peace Corps in 1971 and stayed on, pursuing their own careers. In addition Ethiopia, they lived in Tanzania, Liberia, Nigeria and Kenya.       
        Louise Varese, an American biographer and translator of French and the widow of the composer Edgard Varese, died on July 1 in Eugene, Ore. She was 98 years old.         Louise Varese, an American biographer and translator of French and the widow of the composer Edgard Varese, died on July 1 in Eugene, Ore. She was 98 years old.         Mrs. Varese wrote a biography of her husband, ''Varese: A Looking-Glass Diary,'' which was published in 1972. Among the authors whose works she translated are Stendhal, Proust, Georges Simenon, Julien Gracq, St.-John Perse and Arthur Rimbaud.         In 1948, she received the Denyse Clairouin Award - named for a French Resistance heroine who died in a concentration camp - for her translation of Baudelaire's ''Paris Spleen.''         Mrs. Varese is survived by a son from an earlier marriage, Michael T. Norton, and a granddaughter, Sylvia Calderwood, both of Eugene, Ore., and three great-grandchildren.       
        Oriana Atkinson, a writer and the widow of Brooks Atkinson, a former drama critic of The New York Times, died of pneumonia on Monday at the Huntsville (Ala.) Hospital. She was 94 years old and had lived in Huntsville for 10 years.         Oriana Atkinson, a writer and the widow of Brooks Atkinson, a former drama critic of The New York Times, died of pneumonia on Monday at the Huntsville (Ala.) Hospital. She was 94 years old and had lived in Huntsville for 10 years.         Mrs. Atkinson was the author of eight books of fact and fiction, two of which were best sellers. ''Over at Uncle Joe's,'' published in 1947, was a personal account of her life among the Russians in wartime and postwar Moscow in the 10 months she spent there with her husband.         Her 1954 best seller, ''Manhattan and Me,'' lightly described the changes that had occurred in her native New York since the time she had grown up in Greenwich Village. In the book, she wrote that although New York was the least beloved of cities, it was the most desired. She also wrote poetry and articles for The New York Times and other publications.         The Atkinsons maintained a farm in Durham, N.Y., in the Catskills, where they lived after Mr. Atkinson's retirement. Later, for health and family reasons, they moved to Huntsville, where he died in 1984 at age 89. They had been married since 1926.         Mrs. Atkinson is survived by a son from a previous marriage, James Torrey MacIlveen of Huntsville; two grandsons, James Torrey MacIlveen of Decatur, Ala., and Dr. Robert Bruce MacIlveen of Portland, Ore., and six great-grandchildren.         Correction:  August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Wednesday about Oriana Atkinson, a writer and the widow of Brooks Atkinson, longtime drama critic of The New York Times, listed her survivors incompletely.         They include two additional grandchildren - Heather MacIlveen Nemeth of Ringwood, N.J., and Andrew MacIlveen of Plano, Tex. - and three additional great-grandchildren.       
        Diana Vreeland, the legendary fashion editor and creator of spectacular fashion exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, died of a heart attack yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was believed to be in her late 80's and had been in failing health for several years.         Diana Vreeland, the legendary fashion editor and creator of spectacular fashion exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, died of a heart attack yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was believed to be in her late 80's and had been in failing health for several years.         In the more than 40 years that she was associated with the fashion world, she was called an oracle, the high priestess of fashion, a myth maker. She was the fashion editor of Harper's Bazaar from 1937 to 1962, when she moved to Vogue. There, she was editor in chief until 1971.         Instead of resting on her laurels, she went on, as consultant to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to a new career of staging annual fashion exhibitions that drew almost one million visitors a year and made the museum a center of fashion excitement for New York City and the world.         ''She was and remains the only genius fashion editor,'' Richard Avedon, the photographer, said yesterday. Their professional relationship at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue was the inspiration for the movie ''Funny Face'' starring Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn.         Despite a predilection for aristocratic luxury that recalled the gracious days before World War I, she had an innate understanding of the extraordinary pace of change in 20th-century life. She had an eye for what was new and imaginative, and many fashion designers say she gave them a crucial boost at an early stage in their career.         Her sense of theater was evidenced in the way she moved - Cecil Beaton described her as ''an elegant crane picking her way out of a swamp'' -and the way she looked. Her cheeks and ear lobes were rouged, her lips and nails colored a clear red and her hair lacquered black until the end of her life.         She was fashionably thin, and her favorite costume when she was working or partygoing was narrow black pants with either a black turtleneck sweater or elaborate tunic, depending on the occasion. For years she wore her hair in a snood - it became a kind of trademark - and wore ankle-strap low-heel sandals.         She was born around the turn of the century in Paris - she was never very specific about her birth date - to the former Emily Key Hoffman, an American, and her husband, Frederick Y. Dalziel, who was Scottish. She had a younger sister, Alexandra.         ''We went to Venice or Deauville in the summer or wherever everybody else went,'' she said of her childhood in Europe. ''Our parents spent their days having a good time. They never contributed a bloody thing and they and all our friends lived the life of Riley.'' Ballet and Riding         In 1914, spurred by the onset of the war, the family moved to New York, where the Dalziel sisters went to ballet classes three times a week, learned to ride from Buffalo Bill Cody and occasionally attended schools such as Brearley for a few months. Diana Dalziel made her debut in 1922, and two years later, while vacationing in Saratoga, met and married T. Reed Vreeland, a banker who graduated from Yale the year she came out.         They lived in Albany for four years and had two sons, Thomas R. Vreeland Jr., who became an architect, and Frederick, who entered the diplomatic service. Then they moved to Europe, where for a brief time Diana Vreeland ran a lingerie shop in London. When they returned to the United States in 1936, she began writing a column for Harper's Bazaar called ''Why Don't You . . . .''         For a country in the midst of a Depression, it offered such heady suggestions as ''Why don't you put all your dogs in bright yellow collars and leads like all the dogs in Paris?'' or ''have a furry elk-hide trunk for the back of your car?'' It was widely satirized and widely read and the next year she was made fashion editor of the magazine. Made a Few Mistakes         During most of the 1960's, when fashion was in turmoil, she presided over Vogue magazine, where the fashion world took everything she said seriously and where she made a few apparent mistakes, such as having experimental photographs taken with a wide-angle lens that distorted the models, giving them big heads and tiny feet. Nevertheless, fashion photographers were widely influenced by those pictures and began trying to see what their lenses could do.         She breakfasted on tea and oatmeal, worked in bed in the mornings and showed up in her office around noon.         Her legend grew as her aphorisms were circulated within the fashion world. ''Pink,'' she said, ''is the navy blue of India.'' ''The bikini is the most important thing since the atom bomb.'' She pronounced Celanese, the American fabric company, as if it were Italian: chelahnayzay, and broke down corduroy to its original components: cord du roi.         She avoided the typewriter. ''Has anyone ever written a great love letter on a typewriter?'' she asked. ''A great suicide note?'' And she made pronouncements. Of Chanel, she said, ''her first customers were princesses and duchesses and she dressed them like secretaries and stenographers.''         During this period, she asked Giorgio di Sant'Angelo, who was working in plastics and sculpture, to make accessories and then clothes.         ''She sent me to Arizona,'' he said, ''with Veruschka, the model, four suitcases full of fabrics, wires and tape and told me to wrap and tie everything as I wanted and then she gave me eight pages in the magazine.'' Two Job Opportunities         When Oscar de la Renta came to New York from Paris with a letter of introduction, she invited him to tea. He had two job opportunities, he told her, one doing custom clothes for Elizabeth Arden, the other designing ready-to-wear for Christian Dior-New York.         ''What do you want to do with yourself?'' she asked.         ''I want to get into ready-to-wear because that's where the money is,'' he told her.         ''Then go to Arden because you will make your reputation faster,'' she advised. ''She is not a designer, so she will promote you. At the other place, you will always be eclipsed by the name of Dior.''         ''That is exactly what happened,'' he said. ''And when I did go into ready-to-wear, she helped me. When I made all those gypsy clothes and the caftans in 1967, 1968, it was all Diana's suggestions.''         She had a sense of fantasy that enveloped both her own image and her friends.         ''Her thought process was very original,'' said Bill Blass, who became a friend of Mrs. Vreeland and her husband, who died in 1966. ''She always insisted I was British, no matter how many times I told her I was a hoosier from Indiana,'' Mr. Blass said. Last Career With Museum         Her last career, with the Metropolitan Museum, began in 1973 with a retrospective showing of Balenciaga's clothes, from his first collection in 1938 to the wedding dress he made in 1972 for the Duchess of Cadiz, General Francisco Franco's granddaughter, a month before he died.         The same year, she pulled together an exhibition called Innovative Designers in Paris, and each year there followed another eye-catcher that drew not only fashion enthusiasts but also people captivated by the color and drama of romantic Hollywood clothes, stylish American women (including Irene Castle, Isadora Duncan, Josephine Baker and Elsie de Wolfe), Russian peasants, the costumes of the Ballets Russes, fashions of the Hapsburg era, Yves Saint Laurent's designs, equestrian costumes, Chinese mandarin robes and dance clothes throughout history.         The parties that heralded the openings each fall became major New York events where figures prominent in art, social and fashion circles mingled for dinner and dancing in the museum; the evening was capped by a stroll through the exotically lighted display halls with appropriate music and the flash of photographers' lights. Mrs. Vreeland was in the center of the action at all the parties except the one for ''Dance'' in 1986, when her health was too fragile. 'Elegance Is Innate'         During the museum period, Mrs. Vreeland became the undisputed voice of the fashion world, and her presence at other parties and fashion openings was eagerly sought. She received awards from such diverse groups as the Italian fashion industry and the Rhode Island School of Design and she became a chevalier of the French National Order of Merit.         In a book of her favorite photographs and sketches edited by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and published by Doubleday in 1980, she continued her penchant for aphorisms. ''Elegance is innate,'' she wrote. ''It has nothing to do with being well dressed.'' She also said, ''I loathe narcissism, but I approve of vanity.''         In her memoirs, ''D. V.,'' published in 1984 by Alfred A. Knopf, she did not restrict her pronouncements to fashion. ''Chutney is marvelous,'' she wrote. ''I'm mad about it. To me, it's very imperial.'' And ''lettuce is divine, although I'm not sure it's really food.'' A Practical Slant         Sometimes her observations had a remarkably practical slant. ''Whatever the fashion,'' she wrote in The New York Times in 1977, ''the important thing is time for upkeep. We take it for granted that a girl gets the best she can for herself. But, if she doesn't keep it up, if it isn't in beautiful condition, if the shoes aren't cleaned before she wears them every day and her bag isn't cleaned and everything in it cleaned, she'll never look like anything.''         She was an early enthusiast on the subject of keeping fit, and the magazines she edited were filled with articles on exercise, skin and hair care and grooming long before these topics became major obsessions.         ''The body must stay fit,'' she once explained. ''Fit people like themselves much better.''         The woman who was sometimes described as having the profile of a cigar-store Indian told an interviewer once that ''you don't have to be born beautiful to be wildly attractive,'' and her friends insist that she carried this maxim out in her own life.         ''Dinner alone with D. V. was one of the best ways I could think of to spend an evening,'' said Bill Blass.         She lived in a basically red apartment on Park Avenue decorated by Billy Baldwin with lots of pictures, patterns, bibelots and calculated clutter. When she was editor in chief at Vogue, she also had her office painted bright red. Link to Aristocratic Years         As fashion became more egalitarian during the later years of the 20th century, Diana Vreeland provided a link to the aristocratic years when it was the province exclusively of the very rich. At a time when most people were concerned with the practical qualities of synthetic fibers, she could speak of ''the feel of a perfect piece of silk'' as the ''greatest projection of pleasure.''         She had the theatrical knack of a Diaghilev, whom she greatly admired and whom she made the subject of one of her Metropolitan Museum exhibits along with the costumes for his Ballets Russes. For the increasingly computerized fashion industry, she was a symbol of the grandeur of the past when drama and imagination were all. She had a glimpse of that past in her early years in Europe. In recreating it in her later life, she smoothed out the bumps and made it seem more exhilarating than perhaps it ever was.         She is survived by her two sons, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         The funeral will be private. A memorial service is planned for the fall, with the date to be announced later.       
        Jan DeGaetani, an American mezzo-soprano who became a champion of avant-garde music, died of leukemia Friday night in Genesee Hospital in Rochester. She was 56 years old and a resident of Rochester.         Jan DeGaetani, an American mezzo-soprano who became a champion of avant-garde music, died of leukemia Friday night in Genesee Hospital in Rochester. She was 56 years old and a resident of Rochester.         Miss DeGaetani developed into one of the most respected singers and musicians on the international scene, and in the opinion of many critics, the finest song recitalist that the United States has ever produced. Her creamy voice was wide in range, perfectly placed and produced, always on pitch and handled with consummate artistry.         Miss DeGaetani, who sang everything but opera, had one of the largest repertories of any singer before the public. It ranged from Renaissance music to Cole Porter. It encompassed the world of German lieder and French chanson. She was as much at home with a Beethoven mass as with a Berlioz song cycle with orchestra. She sang Stephen Foster songs and Victorian ballads.         She was called the Queen of the Avant-Garde by some critics. She sang in many languages as though each were her native tongue. Her concert tours took her all over the world, and she sang with virtually every major orchestra and conductor in such works as Bach's B-minor Mass, Beethoven's Mass in C and Ravel's ''L'Enfant et les Sortileges.''         She was exceptionally well known as a specialist in contemporary music. Many composers, and many specialists, considered that to be the most important part of her work. Jobs as Secretary and Waitress         At the Juilliard School she developed an interest in contemporary music. Immediately after graduation, she joined the Gramercy Chamber Ensemble and the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble. She took many jobs to keep going, including secretarial work, waiting on tables, baby-sitting and occasional television commercials.         The turning point in her musical life came after her graduation in 1955, when in addition to her other work she devoted an entire year to learning Arnold Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' a seminal work composed in 1912.         Studying ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' she once said, ''opened my mind to endless kinds of beauty, and music hasn't been the same to me since.'' She eagerly sought out other music of the avant-garde, and established a special relationship with many composers.         George Crumb wrote his ''Ancient Voices of Children'' for her. Jacob Druckman, Peter Maxwell Davies, Gyorgy Ligeti and Pierre Boulez all wrote music with her voice in mind, often dedicating the scores to her. She sang the world premieres of many of their compositions. Other composers with whom she was closely associated were Elliott Carter, William Schuman, Richard Wernick and Mario Davidovsky. Her interest in new music made her a hero to the avant-garde, and she soon became a cult figure.         From the beginning, Miss DeGaetani used the same accompanist, Gilbert Kalish, and an unusual rapport developed between them. Critics noted that they thought alike and breathed alike. Miss DeGaetani said their concerts were ''joint recitals, mutual in every respect.'' The Ultimate Gift         She had, in addition to her other natural attributes, the ultimate gift of the song recitalist - the ability to make every member of the audience feel as though she was singing for that person and that person alone.         Donal Henahan of The New York Times wrote after a 1981 concert that Miss DeGaetani had the ability ''to do with apparent ease what most singers find impossible to do at all, which is to sing straight into the listening heart and mind.''         Despite the wide-ranging variety in her programs and the musical difficulties that many posed, she was anything but a dry or intellectual singer. She believed, as she told an interviewer a few years ago, that intuition was at the very least as important as intellect. ''You must use your most opulent, raw, gut intuition,'' she said. ''You don't take that out of yourself when you use your intellect.''         Miss DeGaetani was born in Massillon, Ohio, on July 10, 1933, sang in the church choir there and later said she knew then that she was going to be a singer. Her father, Earl D. Reutz, a lawyer, encouraged his talented daughter, whose given name was Janice. After her marriage to the conductor Thomas DeGaetani, she sang under the name Jan DeGaetani. Taught at Eastman and Aspen         For many years Miss DeGaetani taught at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and at the summer festival in Aspen, Colo. Among her pupils were Lucy Shelton, William Sharp, Amy Kaiser and Milagro Vargas.         Miss DeGaetani made more than 35 recordings. They were typical of her repertory, ranging from Renaissance music to music of the current decade. Among her most famous disks are Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' music by Ravel, George Crumb's ''Ancient Voices of Children,'' a Stephen Foster disk and a recent one named ''Songs of America,'' which received rave reviews.         She made her last record last March while fatally ill. The recording contains 10 Mahler songs and the Berlioz ''Nuits d'Ete.'' It will be released in the fall by Bridge Records.         Her marriage to Mr. DeGaetani ended in divorce in 1966. In 1969 she married the oboist Philip West, also a teacher at Eastman. Mr. West has participated in many of his wife's recitals.         Surviving are her husband; the two children of her first marriage, Mark West of Rochester and Francesca Watson of the Philippines ; her mother, Eleanor Ruetz of Portland, Ore., and a sister, Vera McKenna of Portland.         There will be a private service and a memorial this week at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester.       
        Genia Nemenoff, a pianist who toured widely in the 1940's and 1950's as part of a duo with her husband, the pianist Pierre Luboshutz, died of heart failure on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Genia Nemenoff, a pianist who toured widely in the 1940's and 1950's as part of a duo with her husband, the pianist Pierre Luboshutz, died of heart failure on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Miss Nemenoff was born in Paris in 1905 and began her performing career accompanying singers. In 1931, she married Mr. Luboshutz, who had been her teacher, and the couple moved to New York. In 1937, they made their debut at Town Hall as a duo piano team. Howard Taubman, reviewing the concert in The New York Times, wrote that ''their playing had coordination, boyancy and grace, and on occasion it was searching in its grasp of feeling and flavor.''         Mr. Luboshutz and Miss Nemenoff gave more than 800 performances in the United States before they returned to Europe to make their joint debut in 1952. They toured much of the world, and worked to expand the duet repertory by transcribing such works as Mozart's ''Magic Flute'' Overture, Bach concertos, and Fritz Kreisler miniatures. They also gave the premieres of concertos composed for them by Bohuslav Martinu and Vittorio Giannini.         In 1956, they toured with programs of Mozart's music for two and three pianos, with their nephew, the pianist and opera impresario Boris Goldovsky. Miss Nemenoff and Mr. Luboschutz began to curtail their performing career in the early 1960's, when they accepted teaching posts at the New England Conservatory and Michigan State University, and Miss Nemenoff continued to teach privately after her husband's death in 1971.         She is survived by Mr. Goldovsky; a niece, Irene Wolf, and several great-nieces and great-nephews.

Gertrude Tonkonogy Friedberg, a playwright and an author, died of cancer on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81 years old.         She wrote two Broadway plays, called ''Three-Cornered Moon,'' which starred Ruth Gordon and Brian Donlevy and which was made into a movie, and ''Town House,'' based on stories by John Cheever. She also published humorous short stories and a science-fiction novel, ''Revolving Boy.''         She is survived by a son, Richard; a daughter, Barbara; a sister, Letty Osserman, and her brothers, Eugene and Andrew, all of Manhattan.

        Margaret Sidney Eaton Boyle, a retired reporter for The Reporter Dispatch in White Plains, died of heart failure Friday at St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains. She was 75 years old and lived in Katonah, N.Y.         Margaret Sidney Eaton Boyle, a retired reporter for The Reporter Dispatch in White Plains, died of heart failure Friday at St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains. She was 75 years old and lived in Katonah, N.Y.         She worked for the paper from 1958 to 1973. Previously, she wrote for Collier's magazine. Born in Bridgeport, Conn., she graduated from Wellesley College. From 1973 to 1978 she was executive director of the Westchester Easter Seals Society.         Surviving are two sons, William and Charles, both of Somerville, Mass.       
        Bette Davis, who won two Academy Awards and cut a swath through Hollywood trailing cigarette smoke and delivering drop-dead barbs, died of breast cancer Friday night at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She was 81 years old and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.         Bette Davis, who won two Academy Awards and cut a swath through Hollywood trailing cigarette smoke and delivering drop-dead barbs, died of breast cancer Friday night at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She was 81 years old and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.         Miss Davis was en route to her home from the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain, where she had been honored for her acting career. She arrived in Paris on Tuesday and was to fly to Los Angeles, but was taken instead to the hospital, on the outskirts of Paris.         Her lawyer, Harold Schiff, said she had undergone a mastectomy in 1983.         ''The doctors had told us the cancer had spread, that it was terminal,'' he said. ''The doctors had said let her go on going about her business.'' #2 Oscars, 10 Nominations For more than a half century, Bette Davis reigned as a Hollywood star in the grandest meaning of the term. With her huge and expressive eyes, her flamboyant mannerisms and her distinctive speaking style, she left an indelible mark on her audiences in a wide variety of roles.         Nominated for 10 Oscars, Miss Davis was a perfectionist whose tempestuous battles for good scripts and the best production craftsmen for her films wreaked havoc in Hollywood executive suites.         ''I was a legendary terror,'' she once recalled. ''I was insufferably rude and ill-mannered in the cultivation of my career. I had no time for pleasantries. I said what was on my mind, and it wasn't always printable. I have been uncompromising, peppery, intractable, monomaniacal, tactless, volatile, and ofttimes disagreeable. I suppose I'm larger than life.''         She was indeed. Few in the entertainment industry could deny that Bette Davis possessed all the legendary indestructibility of the New England Yankee that she was. Starting as a stage actress, she won spectacular fame as a screen star and, as she grew old, shifted effortlessly to high-paying television roles.         Miss Davis's two Oscars for best performance by an actress were won in 1935, for ''Dangerous,'' and in 1938, for ''Jezebel.'' But perhaps she is best recalled for her tour de force as Margo Channing, the tough-talking but soft-hearted stage actress in ''All About Eve,'' for which she was nominated for an Academy Award.         She made almost 100 films. Her 10 nominations for Oscars are the most any actress has received. And she received many other honors, including the Life Achievement Award of the American Film Institute and the Cesar Award of the French film industry. In 1987 she received the Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievements in the performing arts.         The Kennedy Honors coincided with the release of ''The Whales of August,'' a film in which Miss Davis co-starred with Lillian Gish and for which she won wide critical praise. She appeared in that movie and in television and film roles despite having had a mastectomy and a series of strokes while hospitalized in 1983. ''It was my terror that I'd never work again,'' she said afterwards, ''for I have always very much loved to work.''         Last April 24, Miss Davis was honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center at its annual tribute, joining the company of such previous honorees as Sir Laurence Olivier and Charlie Chaplin. ''An honor I'm delighted to get,'' she said at the time. ''Greedy, greedy. Can't have too many awards. I've gotten just about every award there is.''  Enduring Popularity  'Acting Should Be Larger Than Life'         Although Miss Davis reached the apex of her popularity in films between the mid-1930's and the early 50's, her appeal swept across generations, due largely to her frequent appearances in made-for-television films and the repeated showings of her old, now-classic movies on television.         These classics include ''Of Human Bondage,'' ''Dark Victory,'' ''The Corn Is Green,'' ''The Letter,'' ''The Great Lie,'' ''A Stolen Life,'' ''Now, Voyager,'' ''Mr. Skeffington,'' ''The Little Foxes,'' ''The Petrified Forest'' and ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?''         New generations of entertainers, many of them female impersonators, have found her distinct mannerisms and clipped speech irresistible material for their acts.         ''Oh Petah, Petah, Petah,'' such an impersonator will say, rolling exaggeratedly widened eyes and puffing savagely on a cigarette. ''What a dump!'' And, inevitably, the memorable line that Margo Channing utters as she walks drunkenly up the stairs at her party: ''Fasten your seat belts; it's going to be a bumpy night.''         ''You know, I've learned from the imitators,'' Miss Davis said in an interview this year. ''I really have. I was never conscious I moved my elbow like that'' - she moved it from side to side - ''until I saw someone doing me.''         She was always proud of her approach to acting. ''Natural!'' she said. ''That isn't the point of acting. The public must believe us. They must also be somehow ennobled. Did I ever try to be low-key? Never, never, never! I fought that from the beginning. I think that acting should be larger than life.''  At First, Simply 'Betty'  A Broken Home And School Away         Born Ruth Elizabeth Davis in Lowell, Mass., on April 5, 1908, Miss Davis came from a firmly rooted Yankee background. Her mother was the former Ruth Favor; her father, Harlow Morrell Davis, a Harvard Law School graduate who became a Government patent attorney.         Her father divorced her mother when Miss Davis was 7 and her sister, Barbara, was 5, leaving her mother to rear the children alone. In later years Miss Davis said many times that she saw the divorce as her father's abandonment of his family, and that it left her barren of love for him and preternaturally devoted to her doting mother.         Mrs. Davis put the girls in boarding school in Massachusetts and moved to New York. In 1917, she was joined by her daughters.         It was at about that time that ''Betty'' Davis took the more exotic-sounding name that would become world-famed. A friend of her mother's who was reading Balzac's ''La Cousine Bette'' suggested the name-spelling change, telling her that it would ''set you apart, my dear.''         In her teens, Miss Davis returned to New England, living in several towns there while her mother worked as a portrait photographer. She waited on tables at her schools, and once, to help with family expenses, posed nude for a woman making a sculpture.         Miss Davis decided in her teens that she wanted to become an actress, and her mother took her to New York in 1928, where she arranged for her to read for Eva Le Gallienne, whose Civic Repertory Theater was then one of the most popular touring companies.         ''Miss Le Gallienne thought I was not serious enough in my approach to warrant my attendance at her school,'' Miss Davis recalled years later.  Breaking Into the Business  Stage Experience, Looks and a Voice         Miss Davis's first professional acting job was with a winter stock company in Rochester, run by the director George Cukor, who dismissed her after a few months. She made her New York acting debut in 1929, at the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village, in Virgil Geddes's ''The Earth Between.'' Brooks Atkinson, critic for The New York Times, wrote that she was ''an entrancing creature.''         Successes and disappointments were to come in rapid order after that. The young actress, then only 21 years old, was in her first Broadway hit, ''Broken Dishes,'' quickly followed by ''Solid South,'' in which she played the beguilingly named Alabama Follensby, the first of many Southern-belle roles that were to come her way.         The movies had learned to talk only a few years earlier, and Hollywood was greedily spiriting away Broadway actors and actresses who had good speaking voices as well as looks. It was thus perhaps inevitable that a fresh young actress with some training and experience and a couple of good notices would be asked to take a screen test.         She was given a $300-a-week contract by Universal Pictures, and Miss Davis and her mother went to Los Angeles in 1930. Her first movie role was in ''Bad Sister,'' notable only for the fact that it also introduced Humphrey Bogart to films. But the movie's cinematographer, Karl Freund, passed the word to studio bosses that ''Davis has lovely eyes,'' and just as she was to be dropped, her option was picked up for another 13 weeks.         By the end of 1932, Miss Davis, discouraged after having appeared in six lackluster movies and finally without a contract, prepared to return with her mother to New York. Then she got a call from George Arliss, the highly respected English actor, who was to be her mentor until his death.         He hired Miss Davis as his leading lady in ''The Man Who Played God,'' her breakthrough movie role.         The film was a success, and its producer, Warner Brothers, signed Miss Davis to her first contract. It was the start of a love-hate relationship with the studio that was characterized by Miss Davis's frequent storming off sets, being suspended for refusing to act in what she considered inferior movies, and going to court to sever her ties with Warners.         But in her first three years at Warners Miss Davis made 14 films, including Edna Ferber's ''So Big,'' with Barbara Stanwyck starring, and ''20,000 Years in Sing Sing,'' which was, she was to say, ''my only film with the great Spencer Tracy, to my everlasting regret.''         ''He was the finest actor I ever worked with,'' she said.  Getting Parts, and Noticed  Unafraid to Play The Villainess         She was working hard, in mostly forgettable fare, but Miss Davis was also learning the movie craft and earning the respect of technicians.         From the start Miss Davis, unlike leading ladies of the day, had no qualms about playing unsympathetic roles, and so was overjoyed in 1934 when she was lent by Warners to the rival RKO studios to play the cruel and slatternly waitress Mildred in W. Somerset Maughham's ''Of Human Bondage,'' opposite Leslie Howard as the crippled hero Philip.         ''Every actor who becomes a star is usually remembered for one or two roles,'' she said, ''like Judy Garland in 'The Wizard of Oz', Garbo in 'Camille,' Brando in 'A Streetcar Named Desire.' Mildred in 'Of Human Bondage' was such a role for me. She was the first leading-lady villainess ever played on a screen for real.''         ''It's odd that people remember me best for my evil roles,'' she said, ''since I played so many other kinds of characters. But villains always have the best-written parts.''         She was widely praised for her performance as Mildred and nominated for an Academy Award, but she failed to win one, mostly, she said, because Warner Brothers did not want to promote an Oscar for a film it did not produce. She came to regard the Oscar that she won the next year, for ''Dangerous,'' as ''a consolation prize.''         She was always proud of her two Oscars, though, and said this year: ''I'm not a bit modest about them. I don't use those boys for door stops.''         Warners was treating her with new respect, giving her movies like ''The Petrified Forest,'' with Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart, but Miss Davis harbored a festering resentment against what she called ''the contract slave system'' at the studio.         Deciding in 1936 to defy the strictures of her contract, Miss Davis agreed with an English company to go to London to make two movies. Years later she was to ruefully confess that before she left, Jack L. Warner, the studio head, offered her a chance ''to play one of the great screen roles of all time, but I didn't know it.''         '' 'Please don't leave. I just bought a wonderful book for you,' '' she quoted Mr. Warner as saying. ''And I said, 'I'll bet it's a pip!' and walked out of his office.'' She learned later that the role she turned down was Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.'' Mr. Warner later gave up his option on it.  The Glorious Years  Memorable Roles, One After Another         In England, Miss Davis was sued by Warner Brothers, which succeeded in preventing her from working for another producer while under contract to Warners. But once she had returned to the United States, Warners gave her a new contract calling for fewer pictures at a much higher salary.         They also gave her excellent, high-budget pictures, like ''Jezebel,'' for which she won her second Oscar in 1938. In a single year, 1939, Warners released no fewer than four blockbuster Davis movies: ''Dark Victory,'' ''Juarez,'' ''The Old Maid'' and ''The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex,''         ''Jezebel'' began her halcyon years, she said, and ''in 1939 I secured my career and my stardom forever; I made five pictures in 12 months, and every one of them made money.''         The memorable Davis roles continued in swift order: The murderous and unfaithful planter's wife in Maugham's ''The Letter'' in 1940, quickly followed the next year by ''The Great Lie'' and ''The Little Foxes,'' in which she played the scheming Regina Giddens. In 1942 she scored again in ''Now, Voyager,'' as Charlotte Vale, a frumpish spinster who blossoms into a confident beauty and finds true love with Paul Henreid. The film is remembered by movie buffs for the scenes in which Mr. Henreid lights two cigarettes at once and gives one to Miss Davis.         There were other triumphs in the 1940's - ''The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' ''Watch on the Rhine,'' ''Mr. Skeffington,'' ''The Corn Is Green'' and ''A Stolen Life.'' But Miss Davis's luck began to run out with critical and box-office disasters like ''Winter Meeting'' and ''Deception,'' and in 1949 Warner Brothers, after 19 years, released her from her contract while she was making the ludicrous melodrama ''Beyond the Forest.'' In it a by-then plumpish Miss Davis uttered one of her most famous ''camp'' lines, so often used by her mimics, ''What a dump!''  Anguish and Acclaim  Role of a Lifetime In 'All About Eve'         With the end of the Warners era, Miss Davis's third marriage, to William Grant Sherry, an artist by whom she had a daughter, Barbara Davis Sherry, was also ending. She won custody of her daughter.         Miss Davis had previously been married to Harmon Oscar Nelson Jr., a band leader, and she said in 1982 that on his insistence she had two abortions. ''That's what he wanted,'' she said. ''Being the dutiful wife, that's what I did.'' The marriage ended in divorce.         But for decades afterward, Miss Davis publicly battled with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, insisting that she had bestowed her first husband's middle name on the Oscar. ''The Academy has fought stoically to claim that they named the Oscar,'' she said. ''But of course I did. I named it after the rear end of my husband. Why? Because that's what it looked like.''         Miss Davis's second husband, Arthur Farnsworth, a businessman, died of head injuries suffered in a fall in 1943.         Miss Davis was filming ''Payment on Demand'' in 1949 - it was not released until 1951 - when she was offered a role of a lifetime in what she was to call ''that charmed movie, 'All About Eve.' '' She was a last-minute replacement for Claudette Colbert, for whom the director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, had written the role of Margo Channing, the fading Broadway star. Miss Colbert was unable to begin the film on schedule because she ''hurt her back, thank God,'' as Miss Davis liked to recall it.         ''When I finished reading 'All About Eve' I was on Cloud Nine,'' said the actress. ''That night Joe Mankiewicz told me Margo Channing was the kind of dame who would treat her mink coat like a poncho.''         She played Margo that way, and brilliantly, and with the aid of a witty, literate script, sharp direction by Mr. Mankiewicz, and a sparkling cast that included Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, George Sanders, Marilyn Monroe (in a supporting role), and Thelma Ritter, the movie became one of the all-time great Hollywood films.         During the filming of ''All About Eve,'' Miss Davis became romantically involved with her leading man, Gary Merrill, and they were married in 1950. Soon afterward they adopted two children, Margot and Michael.  The 'Darkest Decade'  A Broadway Flop, A Retreat to Maine         Miss Davis received another Oscar nomination for ''The Star,'' released in 1953, but the film was unsuccessful. She was by then 45 and younger actresses were being offered the parts that would have once been hers. She accepted an offer to return to Broadway in a revue, ''Two's Company.''         When the show opened in New York in December 1952, Miss Davis recalled years later, ''The ovation was, to say the least, heartwarming, the reviews were bloodcurdling.'' The revue closed after 90 performances.         Miss Davis and Mr. Merrill took an option to buy a home in Maine and, she said with wry amusement, ''We called our house Witch Way because we didn't know which way we were going and a witch lived there. Guess who?''         ''For three years I was solely a wife and mother and Gary fell out of love with me,'' Miss Davis was to say years later. During that period it also became apparent that the Merrills' adopted daughter, Margot, was retarded, and at the age of 3 she had to be put in a special school. Margot has since lived in homes for the retarded.         During what she was to call her ''darkest decade,'' the 1950's, while the the Merrills' marriage continued to disintegrate, Miss Davis again played Elizabeth I in ''The Virgin Queen'' and a year later, in 1956, appeared in Paddy Chayefsky's ''A Catered Affair'' as Ma Hurley, a Bronx housewife, which she sometimes said was her favorite role. The Merrills also traveled cross-country doing one-night stands in ''The World of Carl Sandburg'' until 1960, when they were divorced.  Friends and Enemies  Fonda, Crawford, Cagney and Flynn         Having settled into character acting, Miss Davis in 1961 scored a success as the gin-soaked ''bag lady'' Apple Annie in ''Pocketful of Miracles.'' That same year she was praised for her performance on Broadway in Tennessee Wiliams's ''The Night of the Iguana,'' which she left in April 1962 to film ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'' a box-office winner that earned her yet another Accademy Award nomination for best actress of the year.         The horror movie, in which Miss Davis wore pasty white makeup and padded herself to appear overweight, revolved around two show-business has-been sisters living in creepy seclusion in a Hollywood mansion. The role of the loony Baby Jane Hansen, addled into thinking she was going to make a comeback in vaudeville, gave Miss Davis a chance to pull out all the acting stops, and she did so with relish. The other, wheelchair-bound, sister was played by Joan Crawford.         The casting of Miss Davis and Miss Crawford in ''Baby Jane'' resuscitated longstanding rumors that they had feuded when both were Warners stars. In 1982 Miss Davis told an interviewer, ''I never feuded with Joan Crawford. During 'Baby Jane' the whole world hoped we would fight but we did not. We were both pros.'' In any event, Miss Davis was not reticent about revealing her rancor against other performers. She accused Miriam Hopkins, with whom she co-starred in ''The Old Maid'' and ''Old Acquaintance,'' of upstaging her and scene-stealing. She also disliked Errol Flynn, her co-star in ''Elizabeth and Essex,'' calling him ''unprofessional.''         Intense as her rivalries were, her friendships were deep and long lasting, particularly for Claude Rains, Henry Fonda, James Cagney, Paul Henreid, Olivia de Havilland, Anne Baxter and Geradine Fitzgerald.         As she grew older, Miss Davis continued making movies, many of them horror thrillers or melodramas, like ''The Anniversary'' (1968), in which she wore a patch over one eye.         Unlike many of her contemporaries who held out against appearing on television when it was in its infancy in the 1950's, Miss Davis embraced it. She appeared as a guest on the Jimmy Durante comedy show, and made episodes of popular series like ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Perry Mason.''  Writing Her Own Epitaph  'The Sweetness Of My Joy'         Despite advancing age Miss Davis kept on working, appearing on television and in an occasional movie, some of them made for television. She said she worked into her later years because the money came in handy, and work was part of her Yankee heritage. ''It is only work that truly satisfies,'' she said. ''No one has ever understood the sweetness of my joy at the end of a good day's work. I guess I threw everything else down the drain.''         This included her personal life, she said, adding: ''All my marriages were charades, and I was equally responsible. But I always fell in love. That was the original sin.''         It was never a secret that Miss Davis was temperamental, opinionated and often difficult to get along with, but in 1985 a scandalous book about her, by her own daughter, shocked her critics as well as her fans.         In ''My Mother's Keeper,'' B. D. Hyman portrayed Miss Davis as an abusive, domineering and hateful mother and as a grotesque alcoholic who was largely responsible for her own mistreatment by certain of her husbands. Two years later Miss Davis replied to Mrs. Hyman's charges with her own bestseller, 'This 'N That,'' in which she defended herself as the victim of a lying and ungrateful child. She confessed later that her estrangement from her daughter pained her.         For some years after her last divorce Miss Davis lived in Weston, Conn., but in the late 1970's she moved into an apartment in West Hollywood.         ''Indestructible,'' she once said. ''That's the word that's often used to describe me. I suppose it means that I just overcame everything. But without things to overcome, you don't become much of a person, do you?''         ''I know what I want as my epitaph,'' she said. ''Here lies Ruth Elizabeth Davis - she did it the hard way.''         Correction:  November 11, 1989, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Oct. 8 about Bette Davis credited her incorrectly with a distinction held by another actress.         As a letter from a reader has pointed out, it is Katharine Hepburn who has received the most Academy Award nominations. The obituary also included a film incorrectly among Miss Davis's nominations. She was not nominated for the 1934 film ''Of Human Bondage.''

Dr. Phyllis Greenacre, a psychoanalyst and author, died yesterday at a nursing home in Ossining, N.Y. She was 95 years old and lived in Garrison, N.Y.         Dr. Greenacre, a native of Chicago, came to New York in the 1930's to direct the outpatient unit of the Payne-Whitney Psychiatric Clinic at New York Hospital.

Dr. Greenacre wrote several books dealing with the development of infants and small children, including ''Trauma, Growth and Personality,'' (W. W. Norton; 1952) and ''Swift and Carrol: A Psychoanalytic Study of Two Lives,'' (International Universities Press; 1955). She was a former president of the American Psychoanalytic Association. She was professor emeritus of clinical psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College.         Dr. Greenacre is survived by a daughter, Ann R. Roy of New Orleans; a son, Dr. Peter Richter of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
        Mary McCarthy, one of America's pre-eminent women of letters, died of cancer yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Castine, Me., and Paris.         Mary McCarthy, one of America's pre-eminent women of letters, died of cancer yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Castine, Me., and Paris.         In her long and prolific career as a novelist, memoirist, journalist and critic, Miss McCarthy earned recognition for her cool, analytic intelligence and her exacting literary voice - a voice capable of moving from the frivolously feminine to the willfully cerebral, from girlish insouciance to bare-knuckled fury.         In 1984, she was awarded both the Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contributions to literature and the National Medal for Literature.  'A Subversive Soul'         ''If there were any real ancestor among American women for Mary McCarthy it might be Margaret Fuller,'' the critic Elizabeth Hardwick, a friend, once observed, referring to the 19th-century American editor, essayist, poet, teacher and translator. ''Both women have will power, confidence and a subversive soul sustained by exceptional energy.''         Miss McCarthy's accounts of sexual shenanigans in ''The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt'' in 1941 and ''The Group'' in 1963 created something of an uproar when they first appeared. But her notoriety in literary circles stemmed less from the scandal quotient of her fiction than from her adversarial literary and political stands. She had celebrated public skirmishes with Philip Rahv, Diana Trilling and Lillian Hellman; issued vitriolic pronouncements on Watergate and the Vietnam War, and became known for the ferocity of her book and theater reviews.  Perverse Opinions         At their worst, those reviews pointed up Miss McCarthy's weakness for catchy one-liners and her taste for willfully perverse opinions. Of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire'' she wrote, ''His work reeks of literary ambition as the apartment reeks of cheap perfume,'' and of Eugene O'Neill and ''The Iceman Cometh'' she declared, ''He is probably the only man in the world who is still laughing at the Iceman joke or pondering its implications.''         Yet at her best (as in ''The Stones of Florence'') Miss McCarthy was an erudite cultural historian, using her familiarity with history, politics and the arts - and the application of some plain old-fashioned common sense -to draw surprising connections and to make her readers reconsider their preconceptions.         ''A career of candor and dissent is not an easy one for a woman; the license is jarring and the dare often forbidding,'' Ms. Hardwick said. ''Such a person needs more than confidence and indignation. A great measure of personal attractiveness and a high degree of romantic singularity are necessary to step free of the mundane, the governessy, the threat of earnestness and dryness. Moderating influences are essential.''         In the case of Miss McCarthy, she said, ''the purity of style and the liniment of her wit, her gay summoning of the funny facts of everyday life, soften the scandal of the action or the courage of the opinion.''         To Robert Lowell, Miss McCarthy was ''our Diana, rash to awkwardness,'' blurting ''ice clear'' sentences above the ''mundane gossip and still more mundane virtue'' of her colleagues. To Alfred Kazin, she was the owner of ''a wholly destructive critical mind,'' a critic with an ''unerring ability to spot the hidden weakness or inconsistency in any literary effort and every person.'' And to Norman Mailer, she was ''our First Lady of Letters'' -''our saint, our umpire, our lit arbiter, our broadsword, our Barrymore (Ethel), our Dame (dowager), our mistress (Head), our Joan of Arc.''  Heroines Were Self-Portraits         The most tireless mythologizer of her life, however, remained Miss McCarthy herself. There were her memoirs: ''Memories of a Catholic Girlhood'' (1957), the beautifully observed portrait of her painful youth, and the later, more workmanlike ''How I Grew,'' published in 1987. In addition, the heroines in Miss McCarthy's fiction form a sort of continuing portrait of the author: Meg in ''The Company She Keeps'' (1942), the clever Vassar girl, ''a princess among the trolls''; Martha, ''the bohemian lady'' in ''A Charmed Life'' (1955), whose need to ''tell the truth'' continually gets her into trouble; Kay, the skeptical iconoclast in ''The Group'' (1963), and Rosamund, the esthetic mother figure in ''Birds of America'' (1971).         These novels also included sharp-edged portraits of many of Miss McCarthy's friends and lovers: her second husband, the critic Edmund Wilson, was portrayed as a loud, unappealing intellectual in ''A Charmed Life''; and Rahv, her roommate and mentor as editor of The Partisan Review, turned up in ''The Oasis'' (1949).         Yet if Miss McCarthy's novels often read like thinly disguised exercises in autobiography, they also attempted to provide an idiosyncratic chronicle of American life - at least within her own intellectual set - as it changed over some five decades. Sexual freedom in the 1930's, radicalism in the 40's and 50's, Vietnam and the social upheavals of the 60's, Watergate and terrorism in the 70's - these are the larger issues that flicker in the background of the novels.  Fiction Was Difficult         There is a certain didacticism to these books, a feeling of willed creation, and Miss McCarthy herself acknowledged that she found it considerably more difficult to write fiction than essays or reviews.         Each novel, she once said, had its genesis with an idea. ''Birds of America,'' which chronicled the coming of age of a teen-age ornithologist, was meant to be ''a novel about the idea of equality and its relation to nature''. ''The Groves of Academe'' (1952), a satiric portrait of a scheming scholar and his colleagues, was intended to address the question ''Where is the justice for an impossible person?'' ''The Group,'' a chatty gossip sheet about the lives of eight Vassar women, was conceived as a study of the illusory idea of social and political progress that captivated so many young people in the 1930's.         That last novel, which brought Miss McCarthy both a popular audience and a movie sale, enhanced her almost legendary reputation for enraging old friends and acquaintances who thought they saw themselves as the thinly disguised and gleefully skewered characters in her fiction.  A Painful Childhood         Throughout her career, Miss McCarthy seemed preoccupied with two themes: what she called ''the idea of justice'' and the idea of self-reliance. Both impulses originated in her painful childhood, and both, in a sense, led to her later attempts to invent an identity true to her platonic conception of herself.         Mary Therese McCarthy was born on June 21, 1912, in Seattle, the daughter of Roy Winfield McCarthy, a member of a prominent Roman Catholic family in Minneapolis, and the former Therese Preston, whose father, a transplanted New Englander, was one of Seattle's most successful lawyers. She had three brothers, Kevin, Preston and Sheridan.         The early years of Miss McCarthy's life seem to have been a romantic idyll; she would later portray them as a lovely succession of parties and holidays, with May baskets and valentines.         ''Both my parents were handsome, winning and romantic,'' she wrote. ''Their marriage was opposed by both families, partly for religious reasons, and partly because my father was an invalid, with an invalid's febrile vitality. He had a bad heart, and it was prophesied, from the first, that he would die young and leave his wife with a pack of children.''  'Dickensian Cruelty'         In fact, both he and his wife died in the great flu epidemic of 1918, and the 6-year-old Mary and her three brothers were sent to live with their great-aunt Margaret and her husband in Minneapolis. There, they experienced what she once called ''circumstances of almost Dickensian cruelty and squalor.'' The children were made to stand outdoors for three hours at a time in the snow, and they were regularly thrashed with a razor strop; Miss McCarthy recalled being beaten in one instance for receiving a school prize, lest she become ''stuck up.''         Miss McCarthy's bitter recollection continued: ''Two blocks away, my McCarthy grandparents, dwelling in sumptuous middle-class style, instilled in us the contrast between wealth and penury by occasional treats and vacations; it was thought beneficial that we should know we were orphans and fitted for a different destiny than our well-tended cousins.         ''Today, some of my relations allege my literary successes and my brother Kevin's career as an actor as proof that the harsh formula followed in our upbringing produced results; nevertheless, I cannot feel grateful. Nor do I believe that artistic talent flowers necessarily from a wounding of the stem on which it grows.''         When she was 11, Miss McCarthy was rescued from her misery in Minneapolis by her maternal grandfather, Harold Preston, who took her to Seattle and gave her a fine education at the Forest Ridge Convent and the Annie Wright Seminary.  Puritanism vs. Romance         As ''Memories of a Catholic Girlhood'' and ''How I Grew'' indicate, the twists and turns of Miss McCarthy's melodramatic childhood would develop two distinct sides to her personality: on one hand, the puritanical student who wants to win prizes for her scholarship and dreams of becoming a nun; on the other, the die-hard romantic who writes moody stories about suicide and prostitution and dreams of becoming an actress. In fact, before she left for college in 1929, Miss McCarthy took some acting classes at the Cornish Drama School in Seattle, where she met the actor Harold Cooper Johnsrud, whom she married a week after her graduation from Vassar. She would divorce him three years later.         By the time Miss McCarthy left Vassar in 1933, she said, she had become ''a wayward modern girl,'' determined, in the words of her colleague William Barrett, ''to hold her own with men - both intellectually and sexually.'' Her finely observed collection of interconnected stories, ''The Company She Keeps,'' would chronicle - in slightly disguised fashion - many of her adventures in these early post-college years, including the breakup of her first marriage, her desultory love affairs and her dabbling in Trotskyite politics.         Writing of that time, Mr. Barrett described the girlishly pretty writer as ''a Valkyrie maiden, riding her steed into the circle, amid thunder and lightning, and out again, bearing the body of some dead hero across her saddle.''         Two influential men of letters, Rahv and Wilson, would play important roles in the shaping of Miss McCarthy's career. Rahv, with whom she lived during the 1930's, helped her to get her first literary job - writing theater reviews for the magazine; Wilson, whom she married in 1938, persuaded her to try writing fiction. He put her in a room, she recalled, and told her to stay there until she finished a story. Their tempestuous marriage produced one son, Reuel, and ended in divorce in 1946. Later that year she married Bowden Broadwater, a writer and teacher.  Satiric Wit         With a clinical eye and an apparently total gift for recall, Miss McCarthy used her satiric wit to illuminate the pretensions and prejudices of her fellow intellectuals. Much of her writing was devoted to exposing what she regarded as the ignorance, bigotry, dishonest sentimentality and affectation that cluttered the intellectual marketplace.         She defended Hannah Arendt and William Burroughs when it was fashionable to assail them, and attacked J. D. Salinger, Kenneth Tynan and Arthur Miller when others were singing their praises.         The litigious Lillian Hellman was so incensed, in 1980, by Miss McCarthy's description of her in a television interview as a ''dishonest writer'' that she instituted a $2.25 million defamation suit.         Hellman's death in 1984 placed the lawsuit in limbo, making Miss McCarthy feel somewhat put out. ''I still feel disgusted by the amount of lying that didn't stop,'' she said in an interview in 1987. ''I wanted it to go to trial, so I was disappointed when she died.''  Busy Despite Health Problems         Miss McCarthy married James Raymond West, a former director of information for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in 1961. They divided their time between an apartment in Paris and their house in Maine.         In addition to her husband and son, Miss McCarthy is survived by two stepsons, Daniel West of Los Angeles and Jonathan West of Lodz, Poland; a stepdaughter, Alison West of Manhattan; two brothers, Kevin, of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and Preston, of Millsboro, Del., and two grandchildren.         In recent years, Miss McCarthy had several operations for hydrocephalus (water on the brain), but maintained a hectic schedule, working on another volume of memoirs, contemplating a study of Gothic architecture, teaching literature at Bard College and learning German. She recalled telling a friend some two decades ago that she ''never woke up in the morning without a feeling of intense repentance and a resolve to be better.''         ''I don't do that anymore - or almost never,'' she said in a recent interview. ''But I do have this idea of improvement, if not in one's powers, at least in one's vision, in one's understanding. I suppose it's all tied up with the American belief in progress. Not that I have that as an idea, but I certainly have it in my personal life. I couldn't live without feeling I know more than I did yesterday.''

Dolores Ibarruri was better known at home and abroad under her battle name, La Pasionaria, the Passion Flower. A Basque left-winger who was a founder of the Spanish Communist Party, she won international renown during the Spanish Civil War for her indomitable stand.         In her first broadcast after the outbreak of war in 1936 she told Spanish republicans: ''It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees! They shall not pass!'' The last two words - ''no pasaran'' in Spanish -became the rallying cry of the dying republic.         Later, in her years living in Moscow, she met many Soviet and non-Soviet Communist leaders, including Mao and Ho Chi Minh. Asked in a 1983 interview which of them was most impressive, she answered without hesitation, ''Logically, Stalin.'' In many broadcasts and messages from the Soviet Union to Spain, she advocated collaboration between Communists and all other left-wing and so-called progressive forces, including Roman Catholic groups.         While the Franco regime never forgave her for her role before and during the civil war, which ended in 1939, Spanish anti-Communists would reluctantly acknowledge that she had shown courage and determination. Some backers of Franco would even say privately that La Pasionaria, though in error, was ''a great Spaniard.'' A Delicate Child         Dolores Ibarruri was the 8th of 11 children of a miner's family in the harsh mountains near Bilbao, in northern Spain. Born in the village of Somorrostro on ''a day in December 1895,'' as she wrote in her autobiography, she went to school until she was 15, two years longer than required by law, because she was of delicate health and her parents thought she might become a teacher rather than a manual worker.         The family's poverty prevented this. After being apprenticed to a dressmaker for a short time, she worked for three years as a maid.         At the age of 20 she married Julian Ruiz, a miner from Asturias who had migrated to the Basque country. In her memoirs, ''The Only Way,'' published in Paris, Havana and Mexico in 1962-63, La Pasionaria wrote curiously little about her husband, by whom she had six children, including three girls born as triplets in 1923. All but two of the six died soon after birth. Her only son, Ruben, born in 1922, was reportedly killed in World War II fighting for the Soviet Union.         Deeply religious as a girl, she lost her Roman Catholic faith when she started reading Karl Marx and other radical writers. In 1918 she began working on the miners' newspaper El Minero Vizcaino. Soon she chose her pseudonym for contributions to revolutionary publications. A Founder of Party         She was a member of the first provincial committee of the fledgling Spanish Communist Party in her home province in 1920 and was elected a delegate to the first national Communist congress, which led to the formal founding of the party in 1921. During the next years she emerged as a spellbinding orator, agitator and organizer.         In 1930, elected to the Central Committee of the party, she backed the national leadership in its fight against Trotskyists in Catalonia - a quarrel that was to come into the open again during the civil war.         La Pasionaria moved to Madrid in 1931, having been placed in charge of the party's official organ, Mundo Obrero. Her first visit to the Soviet Union was in 1933-34. She was elected to the Spanish Parliament as a deputy for Asturias in 1934. There, as in other public places, she invariably appeared dressed in black.         In a dramatic session on July 11, 1936, La Pasionaria is said to have exclaimed, ''This is your last speech!'' when Finance Minister Jose Calvo Sotelo, the monarchist leader, attacked the republican Government. On July 13 Mr. Calvo Sotelo was kidnapped and slain by left-wing terrorists, an event that marked the beginning of the civil war. Anti-Communists accused La Pasionaria of having instigated the killing. She denied it.         Throughout the war she made many speeches and broadcasts to urge the country to resist the Nationalist insurgents the way it had resisted Napoleon's troops in 1808. She told women to fight with knives and burning oil. In contrast to her verbal truculence, she is credited by some reports with having saved the lives of nuns who were threatened by mob violence in Madrid early in the war. Communists Grow in Power         As the civil war proceeded, the Communist Party, though comparatively small, became more and more powerful in the republican camp, and La Pasionaria was the most influential Spanish Communist. She consistently backed Palmiro Togliatti, later leader of the Italian Communist Party, whom Moscow had sent as its representative in Spain.         In the spring of 1936, acting on Moscow's orders, she helped bring about the downfall of Francisco Largo Caballero, the Socialist who had been the republic's Prime Minister since September 1936. Juan Negrin, who was Mr. Largo Caballero's successor, is known to have intensly disliked La Pasionaria, but he kept collaborating with the Communists until the republic's collapse in 1938.         La Pasionaria left Spain early in March 1938, shortly before the fall of Madrid. Together with Mr. Negrin and other republican leaders she flew to France and then proceeded to Moscow, where she had sent her two surviving children, Ruben and Amaya, in 1934 for schooling. Organized an Underground         During World War II La Pasionaria made propaganda broadcasts in support of the Soviet war effort. Later she devoted much time to organizing a Communist underground movement for Spain.         After 38 years in Moscow, she returned to Spain in 1977, two years after Franco died. When she made her first appearances in post-Franco Spain, crowds greeted her with chants of ''Si si, si, Dolores esta aqui - ''Yes, yes, yes, Dolores is here.''         The Spanish Communist Party was made legal two years after Franco's death. In 1977 La Pasionaria was re-elected to Parliament, but she later withdrew because of infirmity and age.         She was separated from her husband, Mr. Ruiz, in the 1930's. He died not long after her return to Spain.         Correction:  November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary yesterday about Dolores Ibarruri, the Spanish Communist leader known as La Pasionaria, misstated the year of the fall of the Spanish republic and of her departure for Moscow. It was 1939, not 1938.

        Parmenia Migel Ekstrom, a biographer, ballet historian, exhibition organizer and founder and president of the Stravinsky-Diaghilev Foundation, died of cancer on Tuesday at her home in New York. She was 81 years old.         Parmenia Migel Ekstrom, a biographer, ballet historian, exhibition organizer and founder and president of the Stravinsky-Diaghilev Foundation, died of cancer on Tuesday at her home in New York. She was 81 years old.         Known to a wide public for ''Titania,'' her biography of the novelist and storyteller Isak Dinesen, Mrs. Ekstrom was known to a smaller audience for the huge collection of ballet material she had assembled over many years. Researchers were welcome to consult her collection, and many of them did so.         In 1986 Mrs. Ekstrom put on an exhibition of ''Four Hundred Years of Dance Notation'' at the Grolier Club in New York; it was later shown at the Harvard Theater Collection in Cambridge, Mass. In 1972 she published ''The Ballerinas: From the Court of Louis XIV to Pavlova.'' Later, in association with Dover Publications, she published three books of ballet material: ''Pablo Picasso: Designs for 'The Three-Cornered Hat' '' (1978), ''Great Ballet Prints of the Romantic Era'' (1981) and ''Great Ballet Stars in Historic Photographs'' (1985).         She was born in New York on June 14, 1908, and educated in the United States and in France. She founded the Ballet Guild before World War II and was a board member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Her early poems were translated into Spanish by the Nobel Prize-winning poet Juan Ramon Jimenez.         In 1933 she married the art dealer Arne H. Ekstrom, now owner and director of the Cordier & Ekstrom Gallery in New York. She lived in France from 1946 to 1955. She was founder and co-director of the Galerie Michel Warren in Paris and also organized concerts for the city of Paris.         After her return to New York, she founded the dance department of the New School for Social Research and wrote extensively on ballet.         She is survived by her husband and by their son, Nicolas H. Ekstrom.

        Norma Terris, who was catapulted to stardom as a lead in the original production of ''Show Boat,'' died Wednesday after a brief illness at her summer home in Lyme, Conn. She was 87 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Norma Terris, who was catapulted to stardom as a lead in the original production of ''Show Boat,'' died Wednesday after a brief illness at her summer home in Lyme, Conn. She was 87 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Miss Terris played Magnolia in the Florenz Ziegfeld production of the hit musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II. Opening in 1927, the show ran on Broadway for two and a half years with Miss Terris, who was critically acclaimed for her lovely voice and charming acting.         While she was rehearsing for ''Show Boat,'' Kern and Hammerstein wrote a song for her, ''Why Do I Love You?'' one of the musical's enduring songs. She repeated her success in a 1932 revival on Broadway.         While she went on to other roles in the musical theater, Miss Terris remained linked to her most glittering triumph and never surpassed it. For 10 years in the 1930's and 1940's, she was a star of the Municipal Opera Company of St. Louis, appearing in plays by Noel Coward and Moss Hart. She also acted in Hollywood films in the 1930's. Role as a Patron         By the end of the 1940's, she moved gracefully into the role of patron of the musical theater. A 30-year member of the board of the Goodspeed Opera House Foundation, in Chester, Conn., Miss Terris sang there occasionally and supported the theater.         In 1984, the Goodspeed opened the Norma Terris Theater in her honor, dedicated to developing new musicals. Miss Terris performed a one-woman show of impersonations of great musical-comedy stars, donating the proceeds to the center. Later, she established a fund to encourage performing artists and composers and endowed an intern program at the Goodspeed Opera House, which aids young people starting theatrical careers.         Miss Terris, a devoted animal lover, donated 30 acres of land in East Haddam, Conn., as a nature center and regional office for the Humane Society.         She was born in Columbus, Kan., to a singer, who named her after the Bellini opera ''Norma.'' She got her first show business break in the title role of George M. Cohan's ''Little Nellie Kelly.''         She is survived by her husband, Albert D. Firestone.

May Garelick McClintock, an author and editor of children's books, died of cancer Wednesday at the Village Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Mrs. McClintock, who wrote under the name May Garelick, was born in Russia and brought to the United States when she was nine months old.

        Stella Gibbons, who won fame with her first novel, ''Cold Comfort Farm,'' died Tuesday at her home in north London. She was 87 years old.  Miss Gibbons, who was a journalist before she turned to books, wrote more than 30 novels and volumes of short stories and poems, but none rivaled her most celebrated story, which parodied an earthy, regional school of writing popular at the turn of the century.         Stella Gibbons, who won fame with her first novel, ''Cold Comfort Farm,'' died Tuesday at her home in north London. She was 87 years old.  Miss Gibbons, who was a journalist before she turned to books, wrote more than 30 novels and volumes of short stories and poems, but none rivaled her most celebrated story, which parodied an earthy, regional school of writing popular at the turn of the century.         ''Cold Comfort Farm,'' published in 1932, tells how the sophisticated Flora Poste visits her rural relatives, the weird Starkadder family, and reclaims them from gloom, doom and feuding.         In guidebook manner, the novelist inserted asterisks to mark passages characteristic of the authors she parodied, including Sheila Kaye-Smith, Mary Webb and D. H. Lawrence.         Miss Gibbons's 1933 poem ''The Marriage of Machines'' prophesied world pollution and destruction of wildlife. Her fiction included ''Miss Linsey and Pa,'' ''Roaring Tower and Other Short Stories,'' ''My American'' and ''The Bachelor.''         Miss Gibbons's second husband, the actor and singer Allan Webb, died in 1959.

        Esther McCoy, an architectural historian and critic, died of emphysema on Friday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 85 years old.         Esther McCoy, an architectural historian and critic, died of emphysema on Friday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 85 years old.         A specialist in West Coast architecture, Ms. McCoy was the author of many books and hundreds of articles in leading architectural publications.         ''It was she, almost single-handedly, who awakened serious scholars to the extraordinary richness of California architecture,'' wrote Paul Goldberger, architecture critic for The New York Times, when a new edition of Ms. McCoy's 1960 work, ''Five California Architects,'' appeared in 1975. Her book, he added, was largely responsible for rescuing the five almost-forgotten architects - Bernard Maybeck, Irving Gill, R. M. Schindler and Charles and Henry Greene - from obscurity.         Calling Ms. McCoy ''the pre-eminent writer of California architecture,'' Cesar Pelli, a former dean of the Yale School of Architecture, told The Times in an interview five years ago, ''Our knowledge of Southern California architecture has been primarily formed by her research, her first-hand knowledge and her writing, which is so precise and passionate.''         She was born in Coffeyville, Kan., and was an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. She began her career in New York writing architecture reviews for a number of publishers.         She worked as a draftsman in the Hollywood office of R. M. Schindler from 1944 to 1947 and began writing about the architects she had come to know. In 1985, she was given the American Institute of Architects' national honor award for excellence.         She is survived by a sister, Ruth Hahn of Denver, Colo., and a nephew, John McCoy of Shanghai.

She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Arlene Robbins Wolberg, a psychoanalyst and an educator and author, died of a heart attack yesterday at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Wolberg and her late husband. Dr. Lewis R. Wolberg, were co-founders of the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in Manhattan in 1945. She was considered an authority on the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorders and wrote two books on the subject, ''The Psychoanalytic Treatment of the Borderline Patient in the Individual and Group Setting'' published in 1960 by Karger, Basel, and ''The Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy of the Borderline Patient,'' published in 1982 by Thieme-Stratton.         Mrs. Wolberg received a master's degree in social science from Smith College School of Social Work in 1930 and a certificate in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis at the Postgraduate Center in 1952. She had been director of community services and dean of community service and education since 1959.         She is survived by two daughters, Barbara Jane Hamburger and Ellen May Baumwoll, both of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.       
        May Swenson, a poet known for her cerebral, playful verse, and a recipient two years ago of a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, died yesterday in Ocean View, Del. She was 76 years old and had been suffering from chronic asthma.         May Swenson, a poet known for her cerebral, playful verse, and a recipient two years ago of a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, died yesterday in Ocean View, Del. She was 76 years old and had been suffering from chronic asthma.         Miss Swenson, who came to New York half a century ago from her birthplace, Logan, Utah, published her first collection of poems, ''Another Animal,'' in 1954. That book led the critic John Ciardi to declare: ''May Swenson is not a promise, but a fact. She has daring, a true feeling for the structure of the whole poem, precision of phrase, and a magic eye for the exact image.''         In all, Miss Swenson published nine volumes of poems, many of which first appeared in The New Yorker. Unlike many of her counterparts, she did not treat poetry as a tragic expression, a mode of despair. She was associated instead with a more joyful, clever, often lighthearted sensibility. In her poem ''Analysis of Baseball,'' she wrote:  It's done  on a diamond,  and for fun.  It's about  home, and it's  about run.         She transformed her daily experiences - a walk in fresh snow, a view of the surface of water, the observation of a bee sipping nectar from a yellow rose - into objects of art. She was able, as one critic wrote, to make her readers see what they had only glanced at before. 'A Dazzling Technician''         In 1979, when her collection ''New and Selected Things Taking Place'' was published, a reviewer in The New York Times spoke of Miss Swenson's ''refreshing delight in the metaphysically absurd.'' The poet and critic Anne Stevenson called Miss Swenson ''a dazzling technician and manifestly an intelligent and sympathetic woman.''         The idea of the 1979 volume was not so much to write poems but, in the words of the title, to describe ''things taking place.'' Miss Swenson concerned herself with the observations her eyes made, as in this line from a poem entitled ''Colors Without Objects'':  I wait for a few  iridium specks of idea to thrive  in the culture of my eye.         Reflecting poetically on the relationship between observation and intellect, vision and thought, Miss Swenson in 1963 closed a poem entitled ''Cabal'' this way:  Eye light and mind light,  lightning-taming leather  I will turn, and be  a swiftness on the dark.         Miss Swenson, who lived for the last two decades of her life with her companion, R. R. Knudson, in Sea Cliff, L.I., graduated from Utah State Agricultural College. She worked for a year on a Salt Lake City newspaper before coming to New York in the late 1930's. She worked for several years as a stenographer and then as an editor for New Directions, writing poems all the time.         With recognition came awards, including Rockefeller, Guggenheim, and Ford Foundation grants, the Brandeis University Creative Arts Award and, in 1981, the Bollingen Prize in Poetry from Yale University. Two years ago, she received a $130,000 Fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation.         Miss Swenson is survived by eight brothers and sisters, all of Utah.
