        Madeleine M. Low, a trustee of the Hudson Guild neighborhood house for 55 years, died of heart failure on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94 years old.         Madeleine M. Low, a trustee of the Hudson Guild neighborhood house for 55 years, died of heart failure on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94 years old.         Mrs. Low, who was born in Chicago and was a 1914 graduate of Smith College, worked with Jane Addams at Hull House and continued her settlement-house service in New York after her marriage to Clarence Low in 1915.         In 1938 Mrs. Low established Trade Winds, a store for articles produced at home by German refugees who were making a new start in the United States.         At the Hudson Guild Mrs. Low initiated a New Neighbors program in the Chelsea section to assist residents who did not speak English. She was the guild's first female president and later served as its chairwoman and honorary chairwoman.         Mrs. Low was an active member of Altro Health and Rehabilitation Services for emotionally disabled people until she was in her 90's. In 1986 she was elected a charter member of the Settlement Hall of Fame.         Mrs. Low is survived by a sister, Hortense Mayer Hirsch of Manhattan, who is 101; by two sons, Stuart, of Darien, Conn., and Robert, of Manhattan, a former New York City Councilman and Environmental Protection Administrator; a daughter, Doris Hirsch of Stamford, Conn.; eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
        Laurie Shields, co-founder of the Older Women's League, died of breast cancer yesterday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 67 years old.         Laurie Shields, co-founder of the Older Women's League, died of breast cancer yesterday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 67 years old.         Born in Chicago, Mrs. Shields graduated from the University of Wisconsin. After her husband died in 1970, she co-founded the Alliance for Displaced Homemakers, later the Displaced Homemakers Network, for women who had spent their careers as homemakers and had lost their husbands, and thus their incomes, through divorce or death. She worked for the National Organization for Women as coordinator for displaced homemaker organizations, many of which were established in the 1970's.         At the time, Mrs. Shields noted: ''We're in our middle years and caught in an era of rising expectations for women that we're not prepared for. What we need is help in that transition period between dependency and self-sufficiency.''         She was an organizer of the White House Mini-Conference on Older Women in 1980. At her death she was a member of the board of directors of the Older Women's League, based in Washington.         Initially, the organization was run from her home. Among its goals were improving low-cost health care insurance for older women and giving women more equitable treatment under the Social Security laws.         Mrs. Shields was the author of ''Displaced Homemakers: Organizing for a New Life,'' published in 1981 by McGraw-Hill, and the co-author of ''Women Take Care: The Consequences of Caregiving in Today's Society,'' published in 1987 by Triad Publishing Company.         She was the widow of Arthur Shields, an actor. Surviving are a daughter, Christine, of Oakland, and a sister, June McVeigh, of Sarasota, Fla.       
        Jane Packard Schirber, a retired social worker and former president of the New Jersey Council of Social Workers, died of pneumonia Saturday at the Princeton (N.J.) Medical Center. She was 91 years old and since 1976 had been a resident at the Presbyterian Home in Hightstown, N.J.         Jane Packard Schirber, a retired social worker and former president of the New Jersey Council of Social Workers, died of pneumonia Saturday at the Princeton (N.J.) Medical Center. She was 91 years old and since 1976 had been a resident at the Presbyterian Home in Hightstown, N.J.         Mrs. Schirber, a 1938 graduate of the New York University School of Social Work, was executive director of the Middlesex County Tuberculosis and Health League from 1922 until her retirement in 1969.         She was a founder of the Middlesex County Mental Health Association and also established the Kiddie Keep Well Camp in Edison, N.J. She received distinguished service awards in 1938 and 1946 from Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.         She is survived by her son, Eric, of Skillman, N.J.; two brothers, E. Vernon Packard of Edison and Preston K. Packard of Blue Bell, Pa., and two grandchildren.       
        Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Steloff founded the Gotham Book Mart in 1920 and, over the years, turned it into an international literary haven. It is still thriving at 41 West 47th Street in Manhattan, an anachronism in a time of failing independent bookstores.         Soon after the store opened, it attracted authors, dramatists, poets and artists. Among those who came to chat, to browse and to see if their books and plays were on the shelves were Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos, H. L. Mencken and Eugene O'Neill. Her customers included George and Ira Gershwin, Ina Claire and Charlie Chaplin, and, more recently, Alexander Calder, Stephen Spender, Woody Allen, Saul Bellow, John Guare and Garson Kanin.         She championed the experimental and challenged the censors. Her courage in purchasing shipments of the banned ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' directly from D. H. Lawrence in Italy in the late 1920's and in ordering smuggled copies of ''Tropic of Cancer'' from Henry Miller in Paris during the 1930's led to lawsuits and landmark decisions on censorship.         Although Miss Steloff sold the Gotham in 1967 to Andreas Brown, another book lover, she continued to live in an apartment on the third floor, above the store, and remained as a working consultant. She ignored her age and her semiretirement, descending every afternoon to sit at a desk in her own corner, occasionally jumping up to press books on browsers, and then to direct them to the cash register. Browsers Welcome         Essentially a person of no literary pretensions, Miss Steloff made her bookstore a place cherished as the habitat for the new and the avant-garde in literature, where small magazines and forgotten books of poetry, out-of-print books on belles-lettres and works on film and the theater could be found in an atmosphere congenial to browsers.         Under her guidance the Gotham became a meeting place for the literati and a bibliophile's paradise. The number of well-known writers, dancers, artists and theater people who were her customers, clients and friends made up an encyclopedia of 20th-century culture. At her 100th birthday celebration, on Dec. 31, 1987, greetings arrived from all over the world.         Miss Steloff was one of the founders of the James Joyce Society, which still meets at the Gotham, although she never met the author. ''Sylvia Beach took care of his book wants at Shakespeare & Company in Paris,'' she said. ''But sometimes Joyce ordered books from the Gotham directly by mail - including during the last year of his life.''         After working in several bookstores, she opened her own on West 45th Street in 1920. The store moved twice to larger quarters. ''It was a struggle at the beginning,'' she recalled. ''There were some days during the Depression when we didn't sell a single book.'' An Interest in the Mystical         ''I am not the great brilliant person to decide about how good a book is,'' she said once. ''I judge books by my customers who buy them and spark others to read them.'' She was greatly interested in Oriental teachings, mystical experiences and philosophers not connected with established Western churches. Books in these fields were represented in her corner of the store.         Along with its fame and reputation, the Gotham was also a very carefully operated book business. As the owner and the person who paid the salaries, Miss Steloff was demanding, irascible, unwearying and unable to understand why no one else was willing to put as many hours or as much concentration into the store as she did.         Miss Steloff recalled some of the clerks who had worked for the Gotham over the years. ''There was Allen Ginsberg and LeRoi Jones and many poets in their youth,'' she said. ''Tennessee Williams lasted less than a day - he couldn't get here on time in the morning and, also, he wasn't very good at wrapping packages.'' Sold Flowers in Hotels         Ida Frances Steloff was born Dec. 31, 1887, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a town full of gaiety in the summer and a bleak, wintry place for the rest of the year, especially for the poor. The Steloffs, who lived year round in Saratoga Springs, were among the very poor. When Miss Stefloff was little, she sold flowers on the verandas of the big hotels. The early death of her mother increased her misery, especially when her stepmother expressed her frustrations with poverty in the harshness she showed the children.         At 12, Miss Steloff was taken in by a couple who offered her a home. But she soon found herself a menial in the household and was forced to drop out of the seventh grade - her last formal schooling. Once in desperation she ran away to New York City. It was not until she was 19 that she made a final move to New York. She landed a job at Loeser's, a Brooklyn department store, working in ''corsets.'' But during the Christmas rush, she was transferred to the books department.         It was like giving a copy of Euclid to Isaac Newton: She had found herself and a way of life.         For the next 12 years she worked in various bookstores: Schulte, Brentano and McDevitt-Wilson, where she developed what one friend called ''an instinctive taste for the best in modern literature,'' a taste that she was willing to gamble on when she had her own shop. She never referred to Gotham as a store; it was always a ''shop.''         Her stature concealed her stamina. She ran the place, but she also opened the correspondence, wrapped and mailed packages, climbed up and down ladders and argued with publishers. Bookstore people were continually helping her down from ladders in her 80's. ''She feels,'' Mr. Brown said, ''as if she still has to stock the store.'' A Doctorate From Skidmore         Miss Steloff was awarded a prize by the National Institute of Arts and Letters for distinguished service to the arts, was listed in Who's Who in the Theater and received an honorary doctorate from Skidmore College - an award that stood in sharp contrast to one of her remarks:         ''I used to feel bitter and cheated about not having a formal education. But why should I? How could I, no matter what my education, ever have had the wonderful chance to have Thornton Wilder and other people talk to me personally, and right here in my shop! As if they were in their classrooms! I couldn't ask for anything more.''         A battle to save the bookstore ended last February, when Mr. Brown bought the building that houses the store from the American Friends of the Hebrew University Foundation. With the $1 million proceeds, the foundation has established a scholarship at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in the name of Miss Steloff's parents.         It was quiet yesterday at the cozy bookstore, with a sprinkling of students and literary buffs brousing through the volumes. In the hall on the second floor hung oversized photographs of Miss Steloff - with Dylan Thomas in 1952, Anais Nin in 1966, Jean Cocteau in 1948, Salvador Dali in 1963, Marianne Moore in 1967. Memorial Service Is Planned         Although funeral arrangements were not yet complete, Mr. Brown said yesterday that Miss Steloff would be buried Monday in the family plot in the Jewish Cemetery at Saratoga Springs.         The Gotham will be closed on that day in her memory. Mr. Brown said he would post a sign and pictures of Miss Steloff in the bookstore window. A memorial service is to be held in three or four weeks, he said.         On May 11, Miss Steloff was to have been presented Brandeis University's Notable Achievement Award.         Miss Steloff was married to David Moss in 1923. They were divorced in 1930 and had no children.         Surviving are a half sister, Belle Sidoroff, of Wilmington, Del., and a half brother, Al Steloff, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.       
        Emily Davie Kornfeld, an author and actress, died of emphysema Friday at her home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         Emily Davie Kornfeld, an author and actress, died of emphysema Friday at her home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Kornfeld was the author of ''Profile of America,'' published in 1954 by Thomas Y. Crowell Company. The book, an illustrated history of the United States, was a compilation of writing by Americans like Thoreau and Jefferson. It was critically acclaimed and a best seller.         But Congress refused to appropriate money for the United States Information Agency to purchase the book for its libraries abroad after a House appropriations subcommittee objected to the work on the basis of pictures that showed a rural schoolhouse and a plain-looking schoolteacher.         The action created a furor in newspapers and magazines. ''What kind of puerility is this?'' asked an editorial in The New York Times. ''Is Congress to pass on every book, to censor every publication?''         The foreword to the book was written by Charles A. Lindbergh, and the introduction was by Louis Bromfield. Mrs. Kornfeld, who wrote the book before she was married, waived her royalties.         Mrs. Kornfeld was a granddaughter of a founder of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. She was born in Tuxedo Park, graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and appeared on the stage on Broadway and at the Old Vic in London.         She was predeceased by her husband, Joseph S. Kornfeld. In 1978, she established a foundation in the name of her husband and herself, which awards grants in medical research and related fields. Mrs. Kornfeld was the founder of the Tuxedo Historical Society.         She had no survivors.       
        Lucille Ball, the irrepressible queen of television comedy for nearly a quarter-century, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles a week after undergoing heart surgery there. She was 77 years old.         Lucille Ball, the irrepressible queen of television comedy for nearly a quarter-century, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles a week after undergoing heart surgery there. She was 77 years old.         A hospital spokesman, Ron Wise, said the actress had suffered a rupture of the aorta after having improved steadily from a seven-hour operation.         Miss Ball, noted for impeccable timing, deft pantomime and an endearing talent for making the outrageous believable, was a Hollywood legend: a contract player at RKO in the 1930's and 40's who later bought the studio with Desi Arnaz, her first husband.         She made her last public appearance four weeks ago at the Academy Awards ceremonies, when she and Bob Hope introduced a production number.         The elastic-faced, husky-voiced comedian was a national institution from 1951 to 1974 in three series and many specials on television that centered on her ''Lucy'' character. The first series, ''I Love Lucy,'' was for six years the most successful comedy series on television, never ranking lower than third. The series, on CBS, chronicled the life of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, a Cuban band leader played by Mr. Arnaz, who was Miss Ball's husband on and off screen for nearly 20 years.         It was a major national event when, on Jan. 19, 1953, Lucy Ricardo gave birth to Little Ricky on the air the same night Lucille Ball gave birth to her second child, Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha 4th. The audience for the episode was estimated at 44 million, a record at the time, and CBS said 1 million viewers responded with congratulatory telephone calls, telegrams, letters or gifts. Miss Ball's first child, Lucie Desiree Arnaz, was born July 17, 1951, three months before the show went on the air.         The Ricardos were the best-known, best-loved couple in America, and the first ''Lucy'' series is still in syndication in more than 80 countries, at times with six episodes a day in a single area.         Analyzing the reasons, Miss Ball explained why her inspired exaggeration of an average middle-class housewife was credible: ''I believe it all the way. I do what I do with all my strength and heart.''         ''Lucille Ball will always be the first lady of CBS,'' William S. Paley, the chairman of the network, said yesterday in a tribute issued by his office. ''Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever.''         Miss Ball was also an astute business executive. From 1962 to 1967, she headed Desilu Productions, one of the biggest and most successful television production companies. Also, starting in 1968, she and her second husband, Gary Morton, a former nightclub comic, headed Lucille Ball Productions.         She bought Mr. Arnaz's share of Desilu Productions in 1962 with a $3 million bank loan, and she sold the company to Gulf and Western Industries in 1967 for $17 million. Her share totaled $10 million.         Discussing how she became an executive, Miss Ball said: ''My ability comes from fairness and a knowledge of people. I ran my studio like I run my home, with understanding of people. We touch in our house. I tell my children, 'There's so little time.' ''         Miss Ball was a tireless worker. ''I have to work or I'm nothing,'' she once said. ''I've never been out of work except for two hours once between contracts.'' On the set, she was said to know every term, every lighting fixture and every worker. A Veteran of Motion Pictures         Before entering television, Miss Ball appeared in more than 50 films, beginning in 1933 as an unbilled chorus girl in an Eddie Cantor musical farce, ''Roman Scandals.'' Her other films included ''Having Wonderful Time'' (1938), ''Room Service'' (1938), ''The Big Street'' (1942), ''Best Foot Forward'' (1943), the title role in ''Du Barry Was a Lady'' (1943), ''Without Love'' (1945), ''Sorrowful Jones'' (1949) and ''Fancy Pants'' (1950).         James Agee, the writer and film critic, observed that Miss Ball ''tackles a role like it was sirloin and she didn't care who was looking.'' Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote in 1938 that she ''is rapidly becoming one of our brightest comediennes.'' In 1960 she also starred in a Broadway musical, ''Wildcat.''         In 1964 there was a Lucy Day at the New York World's Fair, and in 1971 she became the first woman to receive the International Radio and Television Society's Gold Medal. Her many other awards included four Emmys, induction into the Television Hall of Fame and a citation for lifetime achievement from the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Daughter of a Pianist         Lucille Desiree Ball was born on Aug. 6, 1911 in Celoron, outside Jamestown, N.Y. She was the daughter of the former Desiree Hunt, a pianist, and Henry Dunnell Ball, a telephone lineman, who died when she was 3.         As a girl she spent a great deal of time with her maternal grandparents, who instilled in her a deep family loyalty and a commitment to hard work. Her favorite times were attending vaudeville shows and silent films and acting out episodes and plays. Of a school production of ''Charley's Aunt,'' she said, ''I played the lead, directed it, cast it, sold tickets, printed the posters and hauled in furniture for props.''         She embarked on a show-business career at 15 by going to Manhattan and enrolling in John Murray Anderson's dramatic school. From the first, she was repeatedly told she had no talent and should return home. She tried and failed to get into four Broadway chorus lines. From Soda Jerk to Cigarette Girl         She worked variously as a waitress and as a soda jerk in a Broadway drugstore. She then became a hat model in Hattie Carnegie's salon and also modeled for commercial photographers. She won national attention as the Chesterfield Cigarette Girl in 1933. This got her to Hollywood as a Goldwyn chorus girl in ''Roman Scandals.''         Over two years, she played unbilled and bit roles in two dozen movies and made two-reel comedies with Leon Errol and the Three Stooges. She then spent seven years at RKO Radio Pictures, getting many leading roles in low-budget movies. She was typed and mostly wasted in films, but a few roles suggested her talents - a cynical young actress in ''Stage Door'' (1937), a temperamental movie star in ''The Affairs of Annabel'' (1938), a rejected lover in the 1939 melodrama ''Five Came Back,'' a gold-digging stripper in ''Dance, Girl, Dance'' (1940), a handicapped egotist in ''The Big Street'' (1942) and a tough-talking secretary in ''The Dark Corner'' (1946).         ''I never cared about the movies,'' she said later, ''because they cast me wrong.'' A Regular on the Radio         In radio, Miss Ball did regular stints on Phil Baker's and Jack Haley's comedy-variety shows in the late 30's and 40's and, from 1947 to 1951, she played the precursor to Lucy: the hare-brained wife of a Midwestern banker (Lee Bowman and later Richard Denning) in the CBS radio comedy ''My Favorite Husband.'' The show's writers were Madelyn Davis and Bob Carroll Jr., who were to write many Lucy scripts in later decades.         On the stage, Miss Ball won favorable notices for a 22-week tour in the title role of Elmer Rice's fantasy ''Dream Girl.''         In 1950, she and Mr. Arnaz tried to sell the ''I Love Lucy'' television show to CBS. Network executives objected, contending the public would not accept the team of an American redhead and a Cuban bandleader with a heavy accent. To prove their case, the couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour with a 20-minute act that included a ''Cuban Pete-Sally Sweet'' medley. They produced a 30-minute film pilot with $5,000 of their own money. The broadcast officials were won over. Premiere in 1951         ''I Love Lucy'' had its premiere on Oct. 15, 1951, and within a few months millions of Americans tuned in every Monday evening to watch the antics of the Ricardos and their best friends, Fred and Ethel Mertz (William Frawley and Vivian Vance).         ''I Love Lucy'' was one of the first shows to be filmed rather than performed live, making it possible to have a high-quality print of each episode for rebroadcast, compared with the poor quality of live-show kinescopes. The change eventually led to a shift of television production from New York to Hollywood. The show was the first to be filmed before an audience, and crew members used three cameras at once to permit motion-picture-type editing. The series won more than 200 awards, including five Emmys.         Jack Gould of The Times offered this analysis: ''The extraordinary discipline and intuitive understanding of farce gives 'I Love Lucy' its engaging lilt and lift. Only after a firm foundation of credibility has been established is the element of absdurdity introduced. It is in the smooth transition from sense to nonsense that 'I Love Lucy' imparts both a warmth and a reality to the slapstick romp that comes as the climax.'' Miss Ball's superb timing, Mr. Gould wrote, makes her ''the distaff equivalent of Jack Benny,'' her professional idol. A Fortune in Rerun Rights         Mr. Arnaz made a fortune for the couple by obtaining rerun rights for the series. He later sold the rights to CBS, allowing the couple's production company, Desilu, to buy a studio, the former RKO lot where Miss Ball's film career had languished and where they had met in 1940 while appearing together in ''Too Many Girls.''         Despite the continuing popularity of ''I Love Lucy,'' the couple sought a less demanding schedule and ended the series in 1957 after making 179 episodes. The format persisted, however, for three more years through a series of hourlong, high-budget, around-the-world specials called ''The Luci-Desi Comedy Hour.'' Their collaboration ended with their divorce in 1960. Mr. Arnaz died in 1986.         Two years after their divorce, Miss Ball revived ''Lucy,'' playing a widow in ''The Lucy Show'' for 156 episodes until 1968, then did ''Here's Lucy'' for 144 episodes from 1968 to 1974. In these two series she was joined by her two children, her longtime friend Vivian Vance and Gale Gordon, who succeeded Mr. Arnaz as her masculine foil. In shaping situation comedies, Miss Ball consistently sought superior writers, followed their advice, gave them unstinting credit and paid close attention to production details.         In later movies, she co-starred with Bob Hope in two comedies, ''The Facts of Life'' (1961) and ''Critic's Choice'' (1963), and appeared with Henry Fonda in ''Yours, Mine and Ours,'' a 1968 farce about a couple with nearly a score of children. In 1974 she starred in a film version of the stage hit ''Mame.'' Last Series Failed         Miss Ball also appeared occasionaly in television specials and played a spunky bag lady in a 1985 television movie, ''Stone Pillow.'' John J. O'Connor of The Times said she was ''as wily and irresistible as ever'' and ''in total control.'' In 1986, she returned to weekly television as a grandmother in another sitcom series called ''Life With Lucy,'' but it failed to gain an audience.         Addressing a group of would-be actors, she said the best way to get along with tough directors was ''don't die when they knock you down.'' She said she was very shy at the start of her career, but overcame it when ''it finally occurred to me that nobody cared a damn.''         Associates called Miss Ball self-reliant, sympathetic and sometimes tempestuous. ''Life is no fun,'' she once said, ''without someone to share it with.''         For many years she and Mr. Morton had homes in Beverly Hills and Palm Springs and in Snowmass, Colo.         Miss Ball is survived by her husband, her daughter, her son and three grandchildren.         Funeral plans were incomplete last night.

Moto Saito, a restaurateur who was among the first to introduce Japanese cuisine to New Yorkers, died of heart failure June 13 in Tokyo. She was 82 years old and lived in Tokyo.         From 1957 to 1985, Mrs. Saito maintained a restaurant, Saito, first on West 55th Street and later on East 46th Street. In 1985 she returned to Japan, where she had established another Saito.         She was a familiar figure in the New York restaurant, dressed in traditional costume and supervising the service. She also cut a dashing figure in other restaurants, bejeweled and fur clad, believing that restaurateurs should sample the cooking of other establishments.         Mrs. Saito was born in Nagoya, Japan. She said she grew up in a geisha house and was trained in Kabuki dancing. In her restaurant, she continued the art of pleasing people, attempting to explain sushi and educate diners.         A memorial is to be held July 28 at 6 P.M. at the Japanese American Association of New York at 7 West 44th street.         There were no survivors.

She was 87 years old and had lived at the Bella Vita Towers, a nursing home in Denver, since 1988.         Miss Brico, who was the subject of the 1974 film ''Antonia: Portrait of a Conductor,'' made her way in the male-dominated musical world largely through the force of her personality as well as her unshakable determination and a facility with both the standard orchestral literature and contemporary American works.         Those qualities helped her break many barriers. In 1930 she became the first woman to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic. Seven years later she became the first woman to conduct an opera performance by a major New York company when she led the New York Hippodrome Opera production of Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel.'' And in 1938 she made her debut with the New York Philharmonic, becoming the first woman to conduct that orchestra.         She had mixed feelings about these distinctions, however. ''I do not call myself a woman conductor,'' she said in interviews. ''I call myself a conductor who happens to be a woman.'' Moved to U.S. at 6         Miss Brico was born in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on June 26, 1902. Her family moved to Oakland, Calif., when she was 6 years old. She intended to be a pianist at first, but in 1919 she enrolled at the University of California, where she took a liberal arts degree in 1923. During her student years, she supported herself by playing piano recitals and became interested in conducting while working as an assistant to Paul Steindorff, the director of the San Francisco Opera.         In 1927, she went to Berlin to study conducting at the Berlin State Academy of Music. Among her teachers was Karl Muck, a former director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, who was then conducting the Hamburg Philharmonic and who helped her obtain a coaching position at Bayreuth.         When she made her Berlin Philharmonic debut in 1930, the critic of the Allgemeine Zeitung wrote that she ''possesses more ability, cleverness and musicianship than certain of her male colleagues who bore us in Berlin.'' Later that year she conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic but failed to win a conducting post she sought there. After a successful tour of Poland and the Balkans, she returned to New York, where she made her debut conducting the Musicians' Symphony Orchestra. She Founded Her Own         Miss Brico continued to seek a conducting post with one of the established orchestras in the United States, and when she did not succeed, she founded an ensemble of her own, the Women's Symphony Orchestra, which flourished from 1935 until 1939, when it became the Brico Symphony Orchestra.         When her career in New York began to falter, around 1940, she moved to Denver, where she taught and was a guest conductor. In 1947 she became director of the Denver Businessmen's Symphony, which was later renamed the Brico Symphony. She held that post until she retired from conducting in 1985. She also directed the Denver Opera Association, the Women's String Orchestra and the Boulder Philharmonic and was active as a teacher. One of her students in the 1950's was Judy Collins, who became famous as a folksinger in the late 1960's and who directed the ''Antonia'' film.         Miss Collins's film rekindled interest in Miss Brico. When she returned to New York to conduct the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra in 1975, her single scheduled concert sold out so quickly that a second was added. CBS recorded her concerts for release on LP. Her last New York appearances were in 1977, when she performed with the Brooklyn Philharmonia.         There are no survivors.         Correction:  August 18, 1989, Friday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Aug. 5 about the conductor Antonia Brico misidentified a film on her life and credited it incompletely. The film was ''Antonia: A Portrait of the Woman,'' and Jill Godmilow was a co-director with Judy Collins.       
        Marcia Whitney Schott, a prominent figure on the American horse racing scene for almost 30 years, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 66 years old.         Marcia Whitney Schott, a prominent figure on the American horse racing scene for almost 30 years, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 66 years old.         Mrs. Schott's familiar red, white and blue racing colors were carried by a number of outstanding horses, including Willow Hour, who won the Jim Dandy and Travers Stakes at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 1981. In the Travers, Willow Hour beat Pleasant Colony, winner of the Kentucky Derby.         With her husband, Lewis, a retired executive, Mrs. Schott supported the University of Florida and its law school, from which she graduated. The couple established a chair in her name at the university.         She also took an active interest in design and was associated with Marcia W. Schott Interiors, a decorating concern in Manhattan, for about 15 years until shortly before her death.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Lady de Rothschild of London; two sons, Nash, of Washington, and Steven, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
        Fernanda Wanamaker Munn Kellogg, a philanthropist interested in wildlife, conservation and other concerns, died of heart failure Sunday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 69 years old and also lived in Manhattan.         Fernanda Wanamaker Munn Kellogg, a philanthropist interested in wildlife, conservation and other concerns, died of heart failure Sunday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 69 years old and also lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kellogg, a descendant of John Wanamaker, founder of the Philadelphia-based department store chain, became interested in conservation as early as age 8, when she first began hunting.         In the early 1960's, she founded the Louwana Fund to preserve wildlife. In 1963 the fund bought the first equipment to maintain wildlife habitats in Kenya and in 1967 established the first anti-poaching units in East Africa. Mrs. Kellogg also served on the board of the African Wildlife Foundation.         She was a board member of Just One Break, a Manhattan-based employment agency for the handicapped; the Triangle Club, a Palm Beach organization for the rehabilitation of alcohol and drug abusers, and Gratitude House, a half-way house for recovering alcoholics and drug abusers in Palm Beach.         Her marriage to Francis L. Kellogg of Manhattan ended in divorce in 1971.         She is survived two children, Christopher G., and Fernanda Gilligan, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
        Rose Schulman, an acting teacher at the nation's oldest repertory company, the Hedgerow Theater of Rose Valley, Pa., died after a heart attack on Sunday at the Crozer Chester (Pa.) Medical Center. She was 79 years old.         Rose Schulman, an acting teacher at the nation's oldest repertory company, the Hedgerow Theater of Rose Valley, Pa., died after a heart attack on Sunday at the Crozer Chester (Pa.) Medical Center. She was 79 years old.         For 57 years Miss Schulman worked with Hedgerow as actress, director and teacher. She and Jasper Deeter, the actor who founded the company, established the Hedgerow Theater School. Her students included Libby Holman, Richard Basehart, Alfre Woodard and Margo Skinner.         She is survived by a brother, Albert, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Dorothy Bordock of Brooklyn.       
        Valentina Nicholaevna Sanina Schlee, the fashion designer known by her first name who made clothes for social and theater personalities in the 1920's through the 50's, died of Parkinson's disease yesterday at her Manhattan home. She was 90 years old.         Valentina Nicholaevna Sanina Schlee, the fashion designer known by her first name who made clothes for social and theater personalities in the 1920's through the 50's, died of Parkinson's disease yesterday at her Manhattan home. She was 90 years old.         Valentina was the widow of George Schlee, the financier who served as her business partner and as an adviser to Greta Garbo, who was one of Valentina's notable clients. Valentina's other clients included Katharine Hepburn, Mary Martin, Gloria Swanson and Gertrude Lawrence. A trip to Hollywood in the late 1930's brought her additional clients like Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell and Norma Shearer.         Valentina was her own best publicist, wearing clothes with a bravado that made other women want to buy them. Her costumes for Judith Anderson in ''Come of Age'' in 1933 were better received than the play, which soon went off the boards. But the costumes established Valentina's reputation as a designer for the stage and brought her commissions to design for other plays, including ''Idiot's Delight'' and ''The Philadelphia Story.'' Lynn Fontanne, who played a Russian adventuress in ''Idiot's Delight,'' not only wore her clothes but also copied Valentina's speech and mannerisms.         ''She made many wonderful clothes, but nobody looked as well in them as she did,'' said Bill Blass, who made some linen dresses for her in 1970. Valentina had closed her own business in the late 1950's. Prominent in Cafe Society         Valentina was born in Kiev at the turn of the century and was studying drama in Kharkov when the Revolution broke out. She met her husband in the Sevastopol railroad station, she often recalled, when she was trying to escape with her family's jewels. He served as her protector as they fled the country.         After the couple were married, they lived briefly in Athens, Rome and Paris until they came to the United States in 1923. They were prominent in New York cafe society, where Valentina stood out for her clothes and her style. When other women were wearing short skirts, she appeared in floor-length styles; when others wore low-neck dresses, she wore covered-up styles.         In 1928, with her husband's support, she opened a shop on Madison Avenue stocked with 13 dresses from her own wardrobe. In the first year, sales totaled $90,000.         Soon afterward, Valentina went to Paris to study the technical aspects of dressmaking. ''I only learned one thing and that was never copy,'' she said later.         It was one of her many aphorisms, the best known of which is ''Mink is for football.'' She reportedly said that to a customer to whom she was trying to sell a sable coat and who confessed that she had just bought a mink. Later, she said, ''Ermine is for bathrobes.''         Valentina said she always aimed for simplicity. ''Simplicity survives the changes of fashion,'' she said in the late 1940's. ''Women of chic are wearing now dresses they bought from me in 1936. Fit the century, forget the year.''         She was known for her turbans and flowing dresses. Her clothes combined the intricacy of the bias cut of Vionnet with the graceful flow of styles by Alix Gres. Like those by the two French designers, all her clothes were made to order. She estimated that she dressed perhaps 2,000 women in her career. Her husband died in 1974.  She is survived by a nephew, Igor Kamlukin of Milwaukee, and two grand nieces, Nina Frantzen of Manhattan and Manya Drobnack of Seattle.       
        Jan DeGaetani, an American mezzo-soprano who became a champion of avant-garde music, died of leukemia Friday night in Genesee Hospital in Rochester. She was 56 years old and a resident of Rochester.         Jan DeGaetani, an American mezzo-soprano who became a champion of avant-garde music, died of leukemia Friday night in Genesee Hospital in Rochester. She was 56 years old and a resident of Rochester.         Miss DeGaetani developed into one of the most respected singers and musicians on the international scene, and in the opinion of many critics, the finest song recitalist that the United States has ever produced. Her creamy voice was wide in range, perfectly placed and produced, always on pitch and handled with consummate artistry.         Miss DeGaetani, who sang everything but opera, had one of the largest repertories of any singer before the public. It ranged from Renaissance music to Cole Porter. It encompassed the world of German lieder and French chanson. She was as much at home with a Beethoven mass as with a Berlioz song cycle with orchestra. She sang Stephen Foster songs and Victorian ballads.         She was called the Queen of the Avant-Garde by some critics. She sang in many languages as though each were her native tongue. Her concert tours took her all over the world, and she sang with virtually every major orchestra and conductor in such works as Bach's B-minor Mass, Beethoven's Mass in C and Ravel's ''L'Enfant et les Sortileges.''         She was exceptionally well known as a specialist in contemporary music. Many composers, and many specialists, considered that to be the most important part of her work. Jobs as Secretary and Waitress         At the Juilliard School she developed an interest in contemporary music. Immediately after graduation, she joined the Gramercy Chamber Ensemble and the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble. She took many jobs to keep going, including secretarial work, waiting on tables, baby-sitting and occasional television commercials.         The turning point in her musical life came after her graduation in 1955, when in addition to her other work she devoted an entire year to learning Arnold Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' a seminal work composed in 1912.         Studying ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' she once said, ''opened my mind to endless kinds of beauty, and music hasn't been the same to me since.'' She eagerly sought out other music of the avant-garde, and established a special relationship with many composers.         George Crumb wrote his ''Ancient Voices of Children'' for her. Jacob Druckman, Peter Maxwell Davies, Gyorgy Ligeti and Pierre Boulez all wrote music with her voice in mind, often dedicating the scores to her. She sang the world premieres of many of their compositions. Other composers with whom she was closely associated were Elliott Carter, William Schuman, Richard Wernick and Mario Davidovsky. Her interest in new music made her a hero to the avant-garde, and she soon became a cult figure.         From the beginning, Miss DeGaetani used the same accompanist, Gilbert Kalish, and an unusual rapport developed between them. Critics noted that they thought alike and breathed alike. Miss DeGaetani said their concerts were ''joint recitals, mutual in every respect.'' The Ultimate Gift         She had, in addition to her other natural attributes, the ultimate gift of the song recitalist - the ability to make every member of the audience feel as though she was singing for that person and that person alone.         Donal Henahan of The New York Times wrote after a 1981 concert that Miss DeGaetani had the ability ''to do with apparent ease what most singers find impossible to do at all, which is to sing straight into the listening heart and mind.''         Despite the wide-ranging variety in her programs and the musical difficulties that many posed, she was anything but a dry or intellectual singer. She believed, as she told an interviewer a few years ago, that intuition was at the very least as important as intellect. ''You must use your most opulent, raw, gut intuition,'' she said. ''You don't take that out of yourself when you use your intellect.''         Miss DeGaetani was born in Massillon, Ohio, on July 10, 1933, sang in the church choir there and later said she knew then that she was going to be a singer. Her father, Earl D. Reutz, a lawyer, encouraged his talented daughter, whose given name was Janice. After her marriage to the conductor Thomas DeGaetani, she sang under the name Jan DeGaetani. Taught at Eastman and Aspen         For many years Miss DeGaetani taught at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and at the summer festival in Aspen, Colo. Among her pupils were Lucy Shelton, William Sharp, Amy Kaiser and Milagro Vargas.         Miss DeGaetani made more than 35 recordings. They were typical of her repertory, ranging from Renaissance music to music of the current decade. Among her most famous disks are Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' music by Ravel, George Crumb's ''Ancient Voices of Children,'' a Stephen Foster disk and a recent one named ''Songs of America,'' which received rave reviews.         She made her last record last March while fatally ill. The recording contains 10 Mahler songs and the Berlioz ''Nuits d'Ete.'' It will be released in the fall by Bridge Records.         Her marriage to Mr. DeGaetani ended in divorce in 1966. In 1969 she married the oboist Philip West, also a teacher at Eastman. Mr. West has participated in many of his wife's recitals.         Surviving are her husband; the two children of her first marriage, Mark West of Rochester and Francesca Watson of the Philippines ; her mother, Eleanor Ruetz of Portland, Ore., and a sister, Vera McKenna of Portland.         There will be a private service and a memorial this week at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester.       
        Norma Terris, who was catapulted to stardom as a lead in the original production of ''Show Boat,'' died Wednesday after a brief illness at her summer home in Lyme, Conn. She was 87 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Norma Terris, who was catapulted to stardom as a lead in the original production of ''Show Boat,'' died Wednesday after a brief illness at her summer home in Lyme, Conn. She was 87 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Miss Terris played Magnolia in the Florenz Ziegfeld production of the hit musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II. Opening in 1927, the show ran on Broadway for two and a half years with Miss Terris, who was critically acclaimed for her lovely voice and charming acting.         While she was rehearsing for ''Show Boat,'' Kern and Hammerstein wrote a song for her, ''Why Do I Love You?'' one of the musical's enduring songs. She repeated her success in a 1932 revival on Broadway.         While she went on to other roles in the musical theater, Miss Terris remained linked to her most glittering triumph and never surpassed it. For 10 years in the 1930's and 1940's, she was a star of the Municipal Opera Company of St. Louis, appearing in plays by Noel Coward and Moss Hart. She also acted in Hollywood films in the 1930's. Role as a Patron         By the end of the 1940's, she moved gracefully into the role of patron of the musical theater. A 30-year member of the board of the Goodspeed Opera House Foundation, in Chester, Conn., Miss Terris sang there occasionally and supported the theater.         In 1984, the Goodspeed opened the Norma Terris Theater in her honor, dedicated to developing new musicals. Miss Terris performed a one-woman show of impersonations of great musical-comedy stars, donating the proceeds to the center. Later, she established a fund to encourage performing artists and composers and endowed an intern program at the Goodspeed Opera House, which aids young people starting theatrical careers.         Miss Terris, a devoted animal lover, donated 30 acres of land in East Haddam, Conn., as a nature center and regional office for the Humane Society.         She was born in Columbus, Kan., to a singer, who named her after the Bellini opera ''Norma.'' She got her first show business break in the title role of George M. Cohan's ''Little Nellie Kelly.''         She is survived by her husband, Albert D. Firestone.       
        Rachel Wischnitzer, an authority on synagogue architecture and a professor emeritus at Yeshiva University, died Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 104 years old.         Rachel Wischnitzer, an authority on synagogue architecture and a professor emeritus at Yeshiva University, died Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 104 years old.         Born in Minsk, Russia, she immigrated to New York and was the author of several books, including ''The Messianic Theme in the Paintings of the Dura Synagogue,'' published in 1948 by the University of Chicago Press. She established the Fine Arts Department in Yeshiva's Stern College, where she taught from 1956 to 1968, when she retired.         Surviving are her son, Leonard Winchester of Cincinnati, and a grandchild.       
        Dr. Priscilla White, whose research sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic women, died Saturday at her home here. She was 89 years old.         Dr. Priscilla White, whose research sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic women, died Saturday at her home here. She was 89 years old.         A statement from the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston said Dr. White found that a fetus of a diabetic mother would often be healthy a month before delivery but would die if allowed to go to full term. She concluded that babies of diabetic women should be delivered early.         She also found that although infants of diabetic mothers usually are normal or larger than normal in size despite premature birth they require the same special care needed for premature infants.         Dr. White's research and the treatment process she developed increased the fetal survival rate around the country from 54 percent in the 1920's to about 97 percent in the late 1970's and 1980's, the center said.         Born in Boston, Dr. White attended Radcliffe College and graduated third in her class from Tufts University Medical School in 1923.         She joined a diabetes practice headed by Elliott P. Joslin, and in 1924 became the youngest member of the team that established the Joslin center.         Dr. White taught at Harvard Medical School and was an assistant professor of medicine at Tufts. She received numerous honors and was the first woman to receive the Banting Medal, the American Diabetes Association's highest scientific award.       
        Nancy W. Green, a theater producer and television casting director, died of a heart attack on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72 years old.         Nancy W. Green, a theater producer and television casting director, died of a heart attack on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72 years old.         Mrs. Green produced plays in the late 1940's to the 1960's, and helped found such theater companies as the the New Parsons Theater in Hartford, the New Dramatists in Manhattan and Theater Inc. in Manhattan, which became the Phoenix Theater.         Theater Inc. was established to present revivals, experimental works and productions from abroad, and its shows included ''The Old Vic,'' starring Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, and ''The Playboy of the Western World,'' starring Burgess Meredith.         She worked with a theater-and-film production company called Play-Pix, which produced the film ''Georgy Girl.'' She also served on the board of John Houseman's troupe, the Acting Company, in Manhattan. She was also the executive casting director for the Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony in the 1970's and early 1980's.         Mrs. Green studied at the Moscow Art Theater Lab School, and began her career working in radio and advertising before producing shows for the U.S.O. in World War II. She also worked for the movie producer David O. Selznick.         She is survived by her husband, Jules L. Green of Manhattan; a son, Morley Anthony Stern of Los Angeles; a daughter, Susan Cookson of Southfield, Mass.; a stepson, Steven Green of Pembroke Pines, Fla., and eight grandchildren.
