Mura Dehn, a Russian-born dancer and choreographer who became known as a film maker and a specialist in American black dance, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan.
Miss Dehn, who directed a company of black dancers until 1973, was considered a pioneer in documenting the various styles of black social dance.

''I consider these films a portrait of our century because all the important events of our time were reflected in dance in one way or another,'' Miss Dehn told The New York Times in November.
Josephine Baker, the American dancer who became a star in Paris in the 1920's, ignited what was to be Miss Dehn's long-lasting passion for jazz dance.
In her New York dance debut in 1932, Miss Dehn choreographed a work, ''The Wise and Foolish Virgins,'' that used a chanting black chorus.
The troupe evolved into the Traditional Jazz Dance Company, which was made up of black entertainers and which toured internationally.

She performed with the company through 1951, when she left to dance with the New York City Ballet.
She began studying dance at the age of 5, working with the celebrated choreographer Michel Fokine.
The answers I have found, sometimes right and sometimes wrong, constitute my contribution to the young American dancer of ballet: not to accept until you understand (at least to your own satisfaction), and not to dance any role, ancient or new, until you do understand.

But Miss Maracci was even better known as ''one of the major dance figures of our time,'' in the words of Walter Terry, the dance writer, until several career setbacks in the late 1940's and early 50's led Miss Maracci to devote herself to the teaching she had begun in the mid-1930's.

''Theater dance is the way the American dancer expresses his culture, his understanding of the time,'' Mrs. Theodore said in 1978, before the company's first Broadway appearance.
Her last ballet, ''Dance Timecapsule,'' will be performed by American Dance Machine next month in New York.
