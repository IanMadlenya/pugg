         Bettina Louise Chow, an internationally acclaimed model, restaurateur, jewelry designer, sculptor and fashion collector, died on Friday at her home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. She was 41 years old.         Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said. She worked with AIDS organizations and talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission.         Mrs. Chow, known professionally as Tina Chow, began her career at the age of 16, modeling for Shiseido, a leading cosmetics company in Japan. Soon she found herself working at fashion shows and for photographers, appearing on major magazine covers and in pictures for advertisements and fashion news articles. She was a favorite model of Cecil Beaton, among other photographers.         In the early 1970's, she married Michael Chow and worked with him in running his Mr. Chow restaurant in London, a fashionable restaurant featuring Peking cuisine. Later they moved to Manhattan, opening a branch of the restaurant on 57th Street, and then to California to create a third branch in Beverly Hills. Crystals on Cords         She began designing jewelry in the mid-1980's and was a trendsetter for her use of quartz and other crystals as amulets and rings in a variety of settings and as pendants on silk cords. She had outlets in leading stores in several cities, including in Manhattan at Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue and at the Ted Muehling Shop in SoHo.         More recently she had shifted into abstract and organic sculpture in crystal and furniture design.         Regularly listed as one of the best-dressed women, she acquired a large collection of designer clothes and patterns, part of which is to be shown at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan starting March 16. Rizzoli Publishing is working on a book on the collection.         She remained professionally active while fighting her illness and worked with Angel Food, an organization that delivers food to AIDS patients.         Mrs. Chow was born in Lakeview, Ohio. As a teen-ager she moved with her family to Tokyo, where her father, Walter Edmund Lutz, worked in international trade. Mrs. Chow was educated at Sophia University in Tokyo.         She was divorced from Mr. Chow. She is survived by her parents, Mr. Lutz and Mona Furuki, who now live in Los Angeles; a son, Maximillian, and a daughter, China, both of Pacific Palisades, and a sister, Adelle Lutz of Manhattan, who is the wife of the rock musician David Byrne.       
         Bettina Louise Chow, an internationally acclaimed model, restaurateur, jewelry designer, sculptor and fashion collector, died on Friday at her home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. She was 41 years old.         Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said. She had talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission, and even before she knew she would be stricken, she was active in AIDS organizations because of the epidemic's toll on colleagues and friends.

         Sally Mugabe, an anti-colonialist and the wife of President Robert Mugabe, died Monday. She was 60 years old and had suffered from a kidney disease, the Government announced.         Mrs. Mugabe, who was born in Ghana, met Mr. Mugabe when he was teaching there in the 1950's. They married in 1961.         She was often arrested by colonial police in what was previously called Southern Rhodesia for campaigning with her husband against white rule and spent six weeks in prison in 1961.         President Mugabe is expected to cancel scheduled visits to a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York and talks in London with British Prime Minister John Major.         The Mugabes' only child, a boy named Nhanodzenyika, which means "our country has problems" in the their tribal Shona language, died of cerebral malaria at the age of 3.       
         Jean R. Yawkey, the majority owner of the Red Sox, a fixture at Fenway Park for almost half a century and a major Boston philanthropist, died yesterday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, six days after suffering a severe stoke. She was 83 years old.         Despite reports that she had been in failing health last year, Mrs. Yawkey had continued to attend Red Sox home games.         In addition to her active role with the Red Sox and her extensive charitable work, Mrs. Yawkey had been a director of the National Baseball Museum and Hall of Fame since 1984, when she became the first, and so far only woman elected to the board.         As the widow of Thomas A. Yawkey, the multimillionaire sportsman who bought the Red Sox for $1 million in 1933 and lost an estimated $10 million trying to build championship teams over the next 44 seasons, Mrs. Yawkey saw it as her duty to live up to his free-spending ways after his death in 1976.         For a while, however, it appeared that the team would fall into other, less generous, hands. In 1978, the Yawkey estate was on the verge of selling the team to a syndicate formed by Haywood C. Sullivan, a Red Sox executive, and the team's former trainer, Edward G. (Buddy) LeRoux Jr., with Mrs. Yawkey as a limited partner.         But the deal was so heavily leveraged that it failed to win the approval of the baseball commissioner until Mrs. Yawkey, who put up the Fenway real estate as part of her stake, agreed to join the group as the third general partner. At the time of the transaction, the club was valued at $20 million.         The arrangement proved stormy almost from the start, with Mr. LeRoux pressing for measures that would earn profits for the partnership and Mrs. Yawkey just as determined to continue operating the team in the grand Yawkey tradition. Mr. Sullivan for the most part sided with Mrs. Yawkey, and Mr. LeRoux was increasingly isolated.         By 1987, Mrs. Yawkey held a two-thirds interest to Mr. Sullivan's one-third share, and she was very much in charge from then on, relegating Mr. Sullivan to little more than a figurehead. Denied the Ultimate Goal         Although Mrs. Yawkey's business adviser and presumptive heir, John Harrington, the president of the JRY Corporation, which holds the Yawkey Red Sox shares, was often mistaken for the real power behind the franchise, those close to the club insisted that Mr. Harrington was merely the prime minister and Mrs. Yawkey was always the queen.         Like her husband, who saw his team win three pennants but never a World Series championship, Mrs. Yawkey, too, was denied the ultimate goal. During her tenure, the Red Sox won the American League East three times, but in their only World Series appearance, lost to the Mets in 1986.         Mrs. Yawkey, whose original name was Jean Remington Hollander, was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 24, 1909, and raised in Freeport, L.I.         Her first marriage apparently ended in a divorce within a short time, and from the early 1930's until the 1940's, Jean R. Hiller, as she was known, worked as a model at Jay Thorpe, a fashionable women's store on West 57th Street in Manhattan.         It was there that she supposedly met Mr. Yawkey during a visit to the store with his first wife, Elise Sparrow Yawkey. The couple, who had married in 1925, six years after Mr. Yawkey had inherited $20 million at the age of 16, divorced in November 1944, and Mr. Yawkey remarried the next month. Followed Games Closely         At Fenway, Jean and Tom Yawkey maintained his and her rooftop boxes. He liked to sit and drink with his cronies and cuss, it was once explained, while the more dignified Mrs. Yawkey sat with their wives or close friends.         Her attendance at Red Sox games was more than duty. She meticulously kept score in a custom-bound set of score cards.         Mrs. Yawkey rarely missed the annual visit to Cooperstown, N.Y., for Hall of Fame inductions. She became a major benefactor of the museum, donating two wings to the building and commissioning the famous basswood statue of Williams at work by Armand LaMontagne.         She apparently has no immediate survivors.       
         Marguerite Ross Barnett, who as president of the University of Houston was the first black woman to lead a major American university, died yesterday at Maui Memorial Hospital in Wailuku, Hawaii. She was 49 years old.         She had a blood disorder involving hypoglycemia and metastatic cancer, said Timothy Maloney, the hospital administrator. Dr. Barnett was on medical leave from the University of Houston, where she had been president since 1990. She was visiting Hawaii with her husband, Walter E. King, on a trip to where they had spent their honeymoon.         Before becoming president at Houston, Dr. Barnett had been an administrator at other major universities, including the City University of New York. She had a reputation as a successful fund-raiser and a pragmatic academic who urged that urban universities play a dominant role in spurring economic growth and solving social problems in the same way that land-grant colleges of a century ago did in developing America's agricultural economy.  Seeking Stronger Links         "What will characterize the superb 21st century university," she said at her inaugural in 1990, "will be its ability to manifest and focus areas of unquestioned institutional excellence on the challenging issues of the day."         Her views were representative of a substantial shift in higher education as universities, once isolated from their locales, sought stronger connections to their surroundings. And in many ways, Dr. Barnett was seen as representing a new generation of educational leader. While she had access to politicians and business leaders, she also worked to reach out to the public schools where she worked.         As vice-chancellor for academic affairs at the City University of New York from 1983 to 1986, she was instrumental in establishing a program to help poor high school students make the transition to college and good jobs. She instituted a similar program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, where she was chancellor from 1986 to 1990, and did the same in Houston.         Houston is a public university with 33,000 students that performs $45 million a year in scientific research. It has become especially well known for its work in superconductivity. Recording Firsts         In 1989, Dr. Barnett was considered a leading candidate to replace Chancellor Richard R. Green of the New York City schools after Dr. Green died. The position went to Joseph A. Fernandez.         When she was named the first black and the first woman to be president of the University of Houston, there were few other women in charge of colleges that were neither historically black nor all female, a situation that still exists. The only woman to lead a campus larger than the University of Houston is Donna Shalala, who is chancellor of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, which has 38,000 students.         But Dr. Barnett constantly tried to play down the racial distinction of her position. When interviewers persisted in asking her how it felt to be the first black woman to head the University of Houston, she would turn to her assistant, Wendy H. Adair, and ask "Well, how does it feel to be the first red-haired associate vice president of the university?" That usually ended the conversation.         During her brief tenure in Houston, Dr. Barnett became a leading spokeswoman for urban universities and university-driven economic development. She also played a key role in raising more than $150 million for her institution, including a donation of more than $50 million from an alumnus, John Moores, one of the largest gifts ever made to a publicly financed university.         Dr. Barnett was born in Charlottesville, Va., on May 21, 1942. She graduated from Antioch College in 1964 and received her master of science and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Chicago. She taught at the University of Chicago and at Princeton, Howard and Columbia universities before turning to university administration.         She was a member of the boards of the Student Loan Association and the Educational Testing Service. Last July she was the only university representative named to the President's Commission on Environmental Quality, a group that will recommend ways to slow the destruction of the environment without restricting business excessively.         Dr. Barnett is survived by Mr. King; her daughter by a previous marriage, Amy Barnett, of New York City, and her mother, Mary Eubanks, of Houston.       
         Mary Childs Black, an art historian, folk art expert, former museum director and writer, died yesterday at her home in Germantown, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, said M. J. Gladstone, a friend.         Mrs. Black's greatest contribution to American folk art scholarship was her identification of the unsigned paintings of known American 18th- and 19th-century artists, attributions she based largely on social history.         Mrs. Black organized more than 100 exhibitions seen in the United States, Britain or Israel. She made her most important discovery in the late 1960's, when she identified portraits attributed to four unidentified painters as the work of one man, Ammi Phillips, an itinerant 19th-century artist born in Connecticut. She disclosed her findings in 1969 in the book "Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter, 1788-1865," which she wrote with Barbara and Lawrence Holdridge, folk art collectors. The biography was published when she was director of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York City, where she had organized the first major show of Phillips's work. A Start at Williamsburg         Her museum career began in 1956 when she was hired as a research assistant at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Two years later she became curator at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center at Williamsburg, and was named director in 1961.         She left Williamsburg in 1964 to become the director of the Museum of American Folk Art. In 1969 she moved to the New-York Historical Society, where she remained as the curator of sculpture, painting and decorative arts until 1982, when she was abruptly dismissed by the director, Dr. James B. Bell.         Mrs. Black protested the dismissal and was widely supported in the museum world. After a complaint was filed with Federal and state agencies contending that the society had violated sex- and age-discrimination laws, the society settled out of court, awarding Mrs. Black a sum equal to the back pay and vacation owed to her, and restoring her full pension. Dr. Bell resigned in 1988.         At her death, Mrs. Black was working on an exhibition of Colonial American painters to be presented at the New-York Historical Society, said Barbara Knowles Debs, the director and president. A Childhood Interest         Mrs. Black often said her interest in folk art stemmed from seeing Erastus Salisbury Field's 19th-century portraits of her ancestors in her grandparents' home when she was a child in Pittsfield, Mass., where she was born.         Mrs. Black graduated from the Women's College of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1943, did graduate work at Catholic University in Washington and earned a master's degree in art history at George Washington University in 1952.         Her books include "Old New York in Early Photographs" (1973), "What Is American in American Art" (1971), "Erastus Salisbury Field" (1984) and "Gracie Mansion: A History of the New York Mayor's House" (1984). She was the co-author with Jean Lipman of "American Folk Painting" (1967).         She is survived by a daughter, Merrill Black of New Durham, N.H., and a grandson.       
         Emilia Sherman Maurer, who put the Rockettes through their paces from the gala opening of Radio City Music Hall on Dec. 27, 1932, until she retired as director of the dancers more than 40 years later, died on Friday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhassett, L.I. She lived in Point Lookout, L.I., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Miss Sherman, who used her maiden name professionally, had kept her age a secret and left "explicit instructions" that it remain so, her son said. She died after a long illness, he said.         A close associate of Russell E. Markert, who founded the Rockettes in 1926, Miss Sherman choreographed many of the young dancers' routines. These included signature tap routines as well as her specialty, dance presentations she developed from the folk dances of many nations.         When Mr. Markert moved his troupe to Rockefeller Center in 1932, Miss Sherman became its captain as well as a dancer in the chorus line. She drilled the other dancers, showed them their steps and movements and kept them in line.         She quickly became a principal aide to Mr. Markert and, for more than 15 years, was his associate director. She became director upon his retirement in 1971. She retired in 1973.         Miss Sherman, a native of New York City, attended Professional Children's School here and later studied ballet and flamenco dancing. She made her vaudeville debut at the age of 6 and first went on a Broadway stage when she was 12 years old.         She learned her first tap steps from another dancer in Shubert Alley minutes before an audition, winning a job as a specialty act. From then on, she was known for her ability to pick up steps quickly and create new ones on her own.         This led her to choreography as a career. At Radio City, this entailed conjuring up a new spectacle with every change in the movie program, about once a month. Miss Sherman also played den mother and sergeant major to the 46 precision dancers in the troupe, any 36 of whom kicked off four times daily in a wheeling straight line nearly a city block long. In addition, she rehearsed the dancers four hours a week.         Miss Sherman is survived by her husband of 56 years, Henry S. Maurer; their son, Henry S. Jr., of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a daughter, Arnelle Liblit of Commack, L.I., and one grandson.       
         Alice Lee Marriott, an anthropolgist and author who helped popularize American Indian culture and the role of Indian women, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Oklahoma City, Okla. She was 82 years old and lived in Oklahoma City.         She died of heart failure, said Margaret Lefranc Schoonover, a friend and colleague.         Though she was not the first to study American Indians, Miss Marriott promoted an appreciation of their culture by a wider audience and helped break the stereotype of Indians as uncivilized savages.         "Indians are not beautiful, quaint and exotic creatures, like museum pieces," she said in an interview in 1963. "They have a very rich and very complex culture with deep metaphysical and philosophical meanings."         Her more than 20 books were noted for reporting the unique culture of Indians with sensitivity while also portraying their universal humanity. She lived near Indian settlements and often stayed with tribes.         She was a specialist in arts and crafts for the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and helped organize two significant early exhibits of Indian art, at the 1939-40 Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco and at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1941.         Her first book, on the Kiowas, was "The Ten Grandmothers" (University of Oklahoma, 1945). A New York Times review called it "remarkable" and "distinguished." Another major work was "Maria: The Potter of San Ildefonso" (University of Oklahoma, 1948).         The Christian Science Monitor in 1963 said she "has probably done more than any other woman to contribute to the understanding of the American Indian, his plight, his spiritual power and the impact on him of white civilization."         Born in Wilmette, Ill., she graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1930 and in 1935 became the first woman to earn a doctorate in anthropology there.         She is survived by a brother, Richard, of Los Angeles.       
         Maria-Helena Vieira da Silva, a painter prominently associated with the School of Paris, died in Paris on March 6. The Portuguese-born artist was 83 years old and had lived in Paris since 1928.         She died of cancer, said a spokeswoman for the French Ministry of Culture.         Although Miss Vieira da Silva had been a French citizen since 1956, she was regarded by many as Portugal's greatest contemporary artist. Her poetic canvases, vast semi-abstractions in which mosaiclike patches of color were linked by lines into labyrinthine compositions, interested artists of the American Abstract Expressionist school, who first saw her work in New York in 1946.         To observe her 80th birthday in 1988, a major Vieira da Silva retrospective was presented at the Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon and the Grand Palais in Paris. Her paintings are in important museum collections throughout the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in Paris, the Tate Gallery in London, the Stedelijk in Amsterdam, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. She was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French Government and France's National Arts Prize in 1966. In 1961, she won the painting prize at the prestigious Sao Paulo Bienal in Brazil. One Theme Was War         The themes of her paintings are varied: landscapes, games, city streets, atmospheric effects, the seasons, spatial arrangements. Influences on her work ranged from the winding streets of her native Lisbon and the traditional glazed tiles of Portugal to the horrors of World War II. During that period, canvases like "Le Metro" and "The Disaster" of 1942 reflected the grim scene in Europe.         Miss Vieira da Silva was born in Lisbon on June 13, 1908. At 19, she began to study sculpture in Paris with Antoine Bourdelle and Charles Despiau; later she took up painting under the tutelage of Fernand Leger and Othon Friesz. Her first show was in 1933 at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher. In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, she and her husband, Arpad Szenes, a Hungarian-born painter she married in 1930, fled to Rio de Janeiro. There she did murals for the University of Agriculture and had several solo exhibitions. The couple's home in Rio became a gathering place for emerging Brazilian artists.         Miss Vieira da Silva's first postwar exhibition was in New York in 1946 at the Marian Willard Gallery. The next year, she returned to Paris, where she exhibited regularly, working until shortly before her death. She also had a studio in Lisbon, and a former silk factory near it is now being turned into a museum of her work.         Mr. Szenes died in 1985. The couple had no children.       
         Margaret T. Barker, an actress and director who was an original member of the Group Theater, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had homes in New York City and Fairfield, Conn.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         Miss Barker was born in Baltimore, where her father was a prominent doctor. She attended Bryn Mawr College, where a fellow actor in student productions was Katharine Hepburn, and began her career in 1928 as the flirtatious Alice Fordyce in the Broadway production of "The Age of Innocence," which starred Katharine Cornell. Three years later, she appeared as Henrietta in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" with Miss Cornell. She left that production to join the Group Theater, taking major roles in "The House of Connelly," "Men in White" and Clifford Odets's "Till the Day I Die." In 1937, when the Group Theater split into warring factions, she was dismissed.         In addition to many Broadway appearances in the 1940's and 50's, including roles in the original productions of Lillian Hellman's "Autumn Garden" and Carson McCullers's "Member of the Wedding," she performed with the Williamstown Summer Theater in Massachusetts for 10 years and was a member of the Circle Repertory Company in New York. She also directed, produced and performed in Off Broadway plays, regional theaters, television and film.         Her companion was Ann Macfarlane.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Nika Hazelton, whose cookbooks have been a mainstay of serious cooks for nearly half a century, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of natural causes after a lingering illness, said her son, Dr. S. A. Standen, who lives in London.         Mrs. Hazelton, the daughter of a German diplomat, was born in Rome, attended school there, and studied at the London School of Economics. She began her career as a reporter in 1930, covering the League of Nations for the German Press Association and then moving on to freelance work.         After marrying and emigrating to the United States in 1940, she began writing cookbooks with recipes culled primarily from home cooks throughout Europe and South America.         She published 30 books and they reflected her firm, no-nonsense taste in food. "American Home Cooking" (Bobbs Merrill, 1967), "French Home Cooking" (Viking Penguin, 1979,) "International Cookbook" (Harper & Row, 1967) and "The Italian Cookbook (Henry Holt, 1979) remain standards.         She was also a frequent contributer to the major food magazines and for several decades wrote a column about food, wine and travel for The National Review.         As cooking became trendy and precious in the United States, she seemed to raise a speculative eyebrow. Facing a group of wine writers in New York several years ago, Mrs. Hazelton waved aside questions about white truffles and little-known family vineyards. "I'm here to show you a meal from Tuscany that has the virtue of not being too expensive and not taking much genius or fuss to prepare," she informed her audience and proceeded to demonstrate the proper way to make escarole and rice soup.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1954. She married Harold Hazelton in 1956. He died in November.         Mrs. Hazelton is survived by two sons, Dr. Standen and J. O. Standen, a lawyer in San Francisco, and three grandchildren.         A memorial service will be held at 3 P.M. on April 28 at St. Agnes Church on East 43d Street in Manhattan.         Correction:  April 18, 1992, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about the cookbook author Nika Hazelton misstated the day of her death and the date of a memorial service. She died on Wednesday, and the service will be on April 27, at 3 P.M., at the Church of St. Agnes, 141 East 43d Street, in Manhattan.       
         Louise Speers Croix, a chemist who worked on anesthetics, died on Monday at the King James Care Center in Chatham Township, N.J. She was 72 years old and lived in Summit, N.J.         The cause of death was cancer, said a friend, Walter Mac Williams of Bernardsville.         Dr. Croix was born in Nanking, China, where her Presbyterian-missionary parents taught at the university. She graduated from Vassar College in 1940 with a chemistry major and earned her Ph.D. in chemistry at Columbia University in 1949.         She started a 35-year-career in 1949 with the Ohio Chemical and Surgical Division of the Air Reduction Company. Working in its laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., she specialized in anesthetics and related products. She retired in 1984. The company now is the Airco Gases Division of Britain's BOC Group.         She is survived by her brother, James Speers of Pensacola, Fla., and a sister, Elizabeth Bagley of Rock Hill, S.C.       
         Dr. Rosa Lee Nemir Audi, a pulmonary and pediatrics specialist who worked 60 years as a doctor, teacher and researcher, died on Monday at Tisch Hospital at New York University in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Dr. Nemir, who used her maiden name professionally, died of lung fibrosis, her family said.         Among the first American women to become a full professor of pediatrics, Dr. Nemir promoted medical careers for women as president of the American Medical Women's Association, North American vice president of Medical Women's International and its representative to the United Nations.         Tuberculosis was a major focus of her work. Before the discovery of antibiotics to treat the disease, Dr. Nemir studied the effects of steroids in tuberculosis patients. She also was the first to use rifampin, which became a standard drug for TB, to treat children and followed one group of patients from childhood through the next 30 years.         Her entire career was at New York University's medical school and Bellevue Hospital Center, where she remained active until her recent illness. She had served as director of the Bellevue Children's Chest Clinic, medical director for the Adolescent Girls Clinic at the Judson Health Center and director of Pediatric Laboratories at Gouverneur Hospital.         She was also an officer of the Young Men's Christian Association, Brooklyn chapter manager for the American Red Cross and a member of the boards of the Irvington House for Children, the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society and the Willoughby House Settlement.         Born in Waco, Tex., she graduated from the University of Texas in 1926 and Johns Hopkins University Medical School in 1930.         Her husband of 35 years, E. J. Audi, who ran a furniture and carpet business, died in 1968.         She is survived by two sons, Alfred, of Syracuse, and Robert, of Lincoln, Neb.; a daughter, Elaine Audi Macken of Brooklyn; a sister, Aline Nemir Speer of Austin, Tex., and eight grandchildren.       
         Molly Picon, the comedic actress and singer who lightened and brightened the often dolorous themes of Yiddish theater with shows that were sprightly operettas, died yesterday in Lancaster, Pa. She was 94 years old.         She died in her sleep at the home of her sister, Helen Silverblatt, said Seymour Rexite, president of the Hebrew Actors Union.         Miss Picon, who was an indefatigable performer well into her 80's, had a stage career that dated from first efforts when she was 5 years old. With her sparkling         ganayvishe oygen,         or mischievous eyes, and her sturdy delivery of Yiddish songs with appropriate gestures and intonation, she reigned supreme in more than 200 productions along the Yiddish theater row that was lower Second Avenue during the 1920's.         She also appeared on Broadway, achieving her most notable success in a two-season run of "Milk and Honey," a hit musical that opened in 1961, when she was in her mid-60's. When she co-starred with Robert Morley in a London production of "A Majority of One," she was acclaimed by critics.         But it was in Yiddish theater, where audiences often measured their enjoyment by the volume of tears on both sides of the footlights, that Miss Picon established an international reputation by playing for laughs. An Idol in Jewish Neighborhoods         To millions of Jews in major cities of the United States, Europe, South America, Africa and Australia, "our Molly" meant the slender, vivacious comedian with the dark, dancing eyes and elfin face whose songs, dances and mimicry provided hilarious joy. Among the songs she helped turn into hits were "The Story of Grandma's Shawl" and "The Working Goil." She was idolized in Jewish neighborhoods, where children and clubs were named after her during her heyday in the 1920's.         Hers was the expansive, emotional style that would have been restricted by the colder performances tailored to the realism of Broadway. When she performed her first English-speaking starring role, in 1940 in Sylvia Regan's drama "Morning Star," Brooks Atkinson, who did not care for the show itself, wrote about Miss Picon in The New York Times, "To coin a phrase, she is a darling."         This was the universal sentiment that she aroused in critics and audiences alike with her talent for generating warmth and rapport. Miss Picon loved the uninhibited audiences of the Yiddish theater.         She had a flair that averted staleness and repetition. On the Yiddish stage, she used Broadway dance routines as much as possible and flooded the dialogue with English. Jacob Kalich, her husband and colleague from 1919 until his death in 1975, wrote more than 40 scripts for her, and Joseph Rumshinsky, the well-known composer, did most of her music. Mr. Kalich wrote for her one of her most sustained presentations, the play "Yankele," a sort of Yiddish Peter Pan story in which she portrayed a little boy. She later said she had appeared in it 3,000 times, a figure that might be taken merely to mean that it went on quite often. Her Yiddish Was Acquired         Curiously, Miss Picon had to develop her knowledge of Yiddish. She was born on Broome Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, on June 1, 1898, to an immigrant couple. They moved to Philadelphia when she was a child, a migration that made her English sound a bit alien in later years to Jews with the accent of East Side New York.         At the age of 5, Miss Picon won a teddy bear in a burlesque-house amateur program. Her mother recognized her talent and encouraged her, and young Molly started singing for 50 cents a night.         At age 15 she joined a Yiddish repertory company and toured as Topsy in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," switching languages -- English or Yiddish -- to suit the ears of the audience. Because she thought of a future in English-language theater, Miss Picon drifted into the cross-country vaudeville circuits, where she perfected her timing and her uncanny instinct for audience response. Made a Film With Sinatra         Her career changed suddenly when her vaudeville troupe was stranded in Boston. There Mr. Kalich persuaded her to join the Yiddish company he managed. After their marriage she went with him, in 1919, to Eastern Europe, where she perfected her Yiddish. Upon their return in 1923, she made her stage debut as the star of "Yankele."         In more recent decades, Miss Picon did less Yiddish theater, of which there was less to do. After "Milk and Honey" she worked mostly in English-language undertakings, in such plays as "Paris Is Out" in 1970 and "Something Old, Something New" (later called "The Second Time Around") in 1977 with Hans Conried. She appeared in the films "Come Blow Your Horn," which starred Frank Sinatra, and "For Pete's Sake," with Barbra Streisand.         In 1959, after an interval of many years, she returned to Second Avenue to star in a Yiddish vehicle, "The Kosher Widow." She wrote the lyrics to the music by Sholom Secunda, and the book was by Mr. Kalich and Louis Freiman. She had two roles in it, and the audience determined the story's outcome with an applause meter.         Miss Picon was particularly touched in 1946 when she and her husband were among the first entertainers to visit European camps for displaced people.         As she recalled in an interview years after the visit, "A woman came up with a child and said, 'My child is 2 years old and she has never heard the sound of laughter.' "         Her husband told Miss Picon: "Molly, that's our job. Make them laugh!"         In 1960, "Molly!," an autobiography written with Jean Bergantini Grillo, was published by Simon & Schuster.         Miss Picon is survived by her sister.         Correction:  April 8, 1992, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the actress and singer Molly Picon misstated the publication date of her autobiography, "Molly!" It was 1980.       
         Marlene Dietrich, the film star who embodied not only the fantasies of millions but also aspects of the complex German psyche, was buried today in her native Berlin, where people are still not sure what to make of her.         Several hundred mourners crowded around the entrance to the small cemetery where Miss Dietrich was laid to rest. When the open black Cadillac carrying her coffin appeared, they applauded, threw flowers and called her name.         "I loved her because she was always her own person, and never did what people expected her to do," said a young man carrying a single red rose. "That's the same reason why many people here don't like her."         An elderly woman in the crowd, who said she had come out of curiosity, said she and most of her friends "didn't feel much" for Miss Dietrich.         "She was a hard person," the woman said. "As far as I know, she never did much of anything for Germany."  'Love-Hate Relationship'         The funeral marked Miss Dietrich's final return to a country with which she maintained what she once called "a love-hate relationship."         The world remembers Marlene Dietrich mainly as a composite of the alluring but stubbornly independent heroines she portrayed in screen classics like "The Blue Angel," a star who embodied romance, mystery and eroticism. Germans share those memories, but here Miss Dietrich's legacy is more complicated.         For many Germans, especially Berliners, Miss Dietrich calls up memories of the turbulent years between the two world wars. She represents the golden era when this country was one of the world's great artistic and intellectual centers, when figures like Bertolt Brecht, Walter Gropius and Albert Einstein were shaking the conventional world.         When Germany's democratic government collapsed in the early 1930's and the Nazi dictatorship began, Miss Dietrich chose exile. She lived in the United States during the war, and even renounced her German citizenship to become officially American.  She traveled to war zones to entertain and encourage American soldiers who were fighting the Nazi army.  Vowed Never to Return         Some Germans have never forgiven Miss Dietrich for those choices. On her last visit here in 1960, she had to face anonymous threats, stink bombs and a large banner reading, "Marlene, Go Home." Afterward she vowed never to return to Germany.         "When I die, I would like to be buried in Paris," she once said. "I would leave my heart to England, and to Germany nothing."         At a simple graveside service today, a Lutheran minister read the 23d Psalm and lamented the fact that Miss Dietrich "was often not understood in her beloved homeland."         The police had feared that the funeral would be disrupted by rightist groups offended by Miss Dietrich's anti-Nazi background, but no protests materialized.         Guests at the funeral included Miss Dietrich's children and grandchildren, along with politicians, diplomats and a handful of longtime friends, among them Maximilian Schell and Hildegard Knef.         Berlin's Mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, was booed when he appeared. Many Berliners have been angered and disappointed by the city's failure to mount a formal tribute.  Buried Near Her Mother         Miss Dietrich died in Paris on May 6 at the age of 90. According to her grandson, Pierre Riva, she had not left her room for five years.         Few had expected that Miss Dietrich would choose to be buried in Berlin. She said in her will that she made the choice because she wanted to lie near her mother, in Friedenau Cemetery in the Schoneberg section of the western part of Berlin.         Germany's senior political leaders were lavish in their tributes to Miss Dietrich this week.         "No one understood better than Marlene Dietrich how to combine the cool charm of a 'femme fatale' with a passionate woman's love for life," Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in a statement.         "She risked a great deal when she turned her back on the Third Reich and resisted countless attempts by the Nazis to lure her back," he added.  "We admire her commitment to freedom and human rights."  Considered Traitor by Some         Miss Dietrich's return to Berlin for burial has not been universally welcomed. Several letters in newspapers this week described her as a traitor who deserved no public funeral.         "What did this woman ever do for Berlin?" one letter-writer asked.  "While we were living in misery and poverty, she was living the high life abroad."         The Berlin official responsible for cultural affairs, Ulrich Roloff-Momin, deplored such statements. He said Miss Dietrich "deserves the thanks of all Germans, because despite many appeals, she refused to be used by the Nazi propaganda machine, and on the contrary showed, together with other emigrants, that Germany was not populated only by Nazis."         City officials are under heavy criticism for the way they have handled the funeral. At first they announced that a gala tribute to Miss Dietrich's life and work would be held at the Deutsche Theater, where she began her career. But after a day and a half of confusion, they canceled the tribute, saying prominent invitees like James Stewart and Billy Wilder were unable to attend.         Newspaper columnists described the decision as scandalous and a blow to Berlin's ambition to rejoin the ranks of the world's great cities.  City Elections Due         Some commentators suggested that Mayor Diepgen and other leaders of the conservative Christian Democratic Union did not want to mount a major tribute to a figure who is unpopular in some rightist circles.  City elections are to be held next weekend.         Admirers of Miss Dietrich have been eager to show their respect. The Green party, for instance, issued a call to members to pause for one minute today to reflect on her example.         Hanna Schygulla, the German film actress, wrote in a tribute: "We, the ones born afterward, the postwar generation, are proud that there were people like you, people who during the Hitler period took the side of the enemy, and did it out of love for a better Germany."         "Mary Magedelene Dietrich is dead, but Marlene Dietrich remains," Miss Schygulla wrote. "The Blue Angel does not die."       
         Theodora Wiesner, the former director of the American Dance Festival and of the dance division of Brooklyn College, died on Saturday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 83 years old.         She died of cancer, said her brother, Alwin, of Lake Nebagamon, Wis.         Dr. Wiesner, who was born in Rice Lake, Wis., was a physical-education major at the University of Wisconsin in Madison when she discovered the university's dance program. After receiving a bachelor's degree in 1930, she did graduate work in dance and physical education at New York University.         Dr. Wiesner taught dance before World War II at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago. She served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy Women's Reserve during the war and was director of emplacement for the Waves in San Diego.         In 1949, she became an administrative assistant at the Connecticut College School of Dance in New London, which presented the American Dance Festival, this country's leading summer festival of modern dance.         Dr. Wiesner was also director of the dance program at Brooklyn College from 1950 to 1975, when she retired.         Her brother is her only survivor.       
         Marlene Dietrich, the magnetic movie star and singer who was an international symbol of glamour and sex for more than half a century, died yesterday at her home in Paris. She was 90 years old.         In her films and record-breaking cabaret performances, Miss Dietrich artfully projected cool sophistication, self-mockery and infinite experience. Her sexuality was audacious, her wit was insolent and her manner was ageless. With a world-weary charm and a diaphanous gown showing off her celebrated legs, she was the quintessential cabaret entertainer of Weimar-era Germany.         The Dietrich image, personified by Lola-Lola, the seductive cabaret singer in top hat and silk stockings whom she portrayed in "The Blue Angel," was that of a liberated woman of the world who chose her men, earned her own living and viewed sex as a challenge. Audiences were captivated by this creature out of no one's experience but out of everyone's imagination. 'Most Vulnerable Fantasies'         Her manner, the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, was that of "a serpentine lasso whereby her voice casually winds itself around our most vulnerable fantasies."         "She has sex but no positive gender," Tynan wrote. "Her masculinity appeals to women and her sexuality to men."         Her friend Maurice Chevalier said: "Dietrich is something that never existed before and may never exist again. That's a woman."         The Dietrich image was born in the Berlin of the 1920's, when she appeared in plays, cabaret, and film roles of varying importance (she was an extra in G. W. Pabst's 1925 "Joyless Street," which featured Greta Garbo). Her mentor, the American director Josef von Sternberg, made her an international star with "The Blue Angel," which was filmed in 1930 in both German and English. Although in the movie's offstage scenes her 5-foot-5-inch frame seemed a bit blowzy and her manner a bit too Teutonic, her portrayal of Lola-Lola, who degrades and destroys an infatuated elderly professor (Emil Jannings), won her a Hollywood contract. She shed 30 pounds, and in six more von Sternberg movies the director and his star molded the legend.         Her hair became a golden blond, makeup and lighting made her cheekbones and nose appear patrician, and her dreamy blue eyes were framed by thinly penciled, sweepingly arched brows.         Perhaps the best description of her face was provided by Erich Maria Remarque, her longtime friend, in his novel "Arch of Triumph":         "The cool, bright face that didn't ask for anything, that simply existed, waiting -- it was an empty face, he thought; a face that could change with any wind of expression. One could dream into it anything. It was like a beautiful empty house waiting for carpets and pictures. It had all possibilities -- it could become a palace or a brothel." A Lifelong Task Of Creating an Image         Working with von Sternberg, the actress became a thorough professional and perfectionist, expert in makeup, lighting, clothes and film editing. In later decades, she repeatedly had cosmetic surgery to keep her face taut, and adroitly had herself filmed with soft-focus, gauze-covered lenses.         "Glamour," she observed, "is assurance. It is a kind of knowing that you are all right in every way, mentally and physically and in appearance, and that, whatever the occasion or the situation, you are equal to it."         In clothes, she was a trend setter. Both on screen and off, she often wore trousers and mannish costumes. By proving that a woman could still look feminine in such clothes, she established "the Dietrich silhouette," emphasizing trimness and inconspicuous hips and bust.         The Dietrich-von Sternberg collaboration produced "Morocco" (1930), in which Miss Dietrich, again a cabaret singer, spurns and then pursues a French legionnaire (Gary Cooper) in the Sahara; "Dishonored" (1931), about a spy who betrays her country for love of a worthless man (Victor McLaglen), and "Shanghai Express" (1932), a melodrama in which she is a China Coast prostitute who offers herself to a warlord (Warner Oland) to save the life of a former lover (Clive Brook).         The last three Dietrich-von Sternberg films were "Blonde Venus" (1932), a mother-love soap opera; "The Scarlet Empress" (1934), an opulent and visually stunning melodrama about a lascivious Catherine the Great, and "The Devil Is a Woman" (1935), an erotic tale about a soldier-corrupting vamp in turn-of-the-century Seville.         Because it displayed her beauty most effectively, "The Devil Is a Woman" was her particular favorite. But it angered Spanish officials, at whose demand Paramount Pictures soon withdrew it and destroyed the master print. Miss Dietrich gave her own print of the film to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it is shown frequently.         The von Sternberg movies were increasingly self-indulgent, lyrical, exotic romances with pallid plots that trapped the actress in elaborate decor and special effects. They were losing a fortune, so Paramount's top executives, to protect their big investment in Miss Dietrich, barred von Sternberg from directing her again.         Seeking variety, she made her first comedy, "Desire," in 1936. It was a satire about an urbane jewel thief who steals a choice necklace from a Parisian jeweler and, in efforts to keep it, becomes involved with a hayseed Detroit engineer (Gary Cooper).         A second comedy, "Destry Rides Again," a 1939 spoof of the Old West, was even more successful. The actress, as a freewheeling saloon entertainer, seduces a valiant sheriff (James Stewart) and has a hair-pulling, face-pummeling brawl with a competitor (Una Merkel).         Miss Dietrich was a Berliner who was an early and passionate opponent of Nazism. When Hitler started arresting Jews, she financed the escape of several friends. Rejects Germany; Films Are Banned         In 1937, while filming the melodrama "Knight Without Armour" in England, she was approached by agents of Hitler offering her an almost blank check to return to Germany to star in movies of her choice. She angrily rejected the offer, and her films were banned in Germany. Soon after, she applied for American citizenship, which was granted in 1939.         During World War II, Miss Dietrich became somewhat of a symbol of free Germany. She made anti-Nazi broadcasts in German, took part in many war-bond drives and, in three years, entertained half a million Allied troops and war prisoners across North Africa and Western Europe.         Tirelessly and good-humoredly, she roughed it with the G.I.'s, standing patiently in food lines, washing with snow and sleeping in dugouts and ruins, often near the front lines. She sang her movie songs, the international wartime ballad "Lili Marlene" and some current songs, and even played a musical saw, a skill she had mastered for the Berlin stage. The troops loved her.         After the war, she was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor the United States Government bestows. France named her a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor and Belgium dubbed her a Knight of the Order of Leopold.         Her most noteworthy movie roles after the war were as an exotic gypsy in Mitchell Leisen's "Golden Earrings" (1947), with Ray Milland; a manipulative Berlin cabaret singer in Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair" (1948); a saloon manager hiding outlaws in Fritz Lang's "Rancho Notorious" (1952); a duplicitous wife in Mr. Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution" (1958); a cynical brothel-keeper in Orson Welles's "Touch of Evil" (1958) and an aristocratic widow in Stanley Kramer's "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961).         "Touch of Evil" provided Miss Dietrich with one of her most memorable lines. She admonished the character played by the corpulent Welles to "lay off the candy bars."         Her last film was a small part in the forgettable 1979 melodrama called "Just a Gigolo." In 1986, Maximilian Schell made a documentary about her, entitled "Marlene"; she did not appear on screen because of vanity, but she was interviewed and her voice is heard almost continuously.         Miss Dietrich began her cabaret performances in 1954, and for more than two decades, for fees up to $30,000 a week, she hypnotized audiences in such disparate cities as London, Las Vegas, Paris, New York, Montreal, Johannesburg and Tokyo and Tel Aviv (where she sang in German with some apprehension, but with stunning success). Her manner matched her movie image: at once intimate and elusive.         In 1960, also with trepidation about wartime animosities, she sang in Berlin. There were a few hecklers, but the vast majority of Berliners welcomed her home.         To keep her shows up to date, she interspersed the nostalgia with new songs, and in 1963 she performed in London with -- or perhaps against -- the youthful Beatles.         Marie Magdalene Dietrich was born in Berlin on Dec. 27, 1901. Her father, Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, who was a police lieutenant and a former cavalry major, died when she was 9 years old.         Her mother was Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine Felsing, the daughter of a well-to-do watch merchant, who soon after being widowed, married Edouard von Losch, a cavalry lieutenant. He was killed on the Russian front in 1918.         The young Marie Magdalene and her elder sister, Elisabeth, were brought up strictly in an upper-middle-class Prussian home. Marie Magdalene attended a private school in Weimar, studied French and took violin lessons, hoping for a concert career. But when she was 18, a hand injury threatened that dream and she decided to try dramatics, contracting her two given names to Marlene because her family disapproved of acting.         She failed an audition with Max Reinhardt and joined the chorus of a touring musical revue. A year later, she passed a second audition and was admitted to Reinhardt's drama school.         Soon after, she won small roles on the stage and in German films. Her only substantial role was in the film "Tragedy of Love" (1923). She was assigned the part by Rudolph Sieber, a young Czechoslovak production assistant. They were married on May 17, 1924, and the next year had a daughter, Maria.         After the early years of their marriage, Mr. Sieber was rarely seen with his wife. He held movie jobs in New York and Hollywood and, in 1953, became a chicken farmer in California in the San Fernando Valley. They never divorced, but lived apart for most of their remaining years. He died in 1975.         In the late 1920's, Miss Dietrich won increasingly important leading roles on the German stage and was likened in the German press to Greta Garbo. A Director's Search For a Cruel Temptress         In early 1930, von Sternberg arrived in Berlin to make "The Blue Angel," based on the Heinrich Mann novel "Professor Unrat." The director had been searching for an actress who could exude the electric eroticism of the movie's cruel temptress. He saw Miss Dietrich in a play and knew his search was over.         Two decades later, the actress was referred to by the press as "the world's most glamorous grandmother." Her daughter, also an actress, married William Riva, a scenic artist, in 1947, and had four sons. Miss Dietrich was often seen with her grandsons in Manhattan, wheeling their carriages in Central Park, later seeing them off to camp at Grand Central Terminal and even carrying their laundry.         She was deeply devoted to her family, worked hard to advance her daughter's career and helping her daughter and son-in-law financially. To be with her family, Miss Dietrich lived in Manhattan when not touring, but in 1972 she moved her chief residence from Park Avenue to Paris, where she lived in a four-room apartment on Avenue Montaigne, in the Eighth Arrondissement.         She was a close friend of many famous people, including Ernest Hemingway and Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. She also had widely reported love affairs with the writer Erich Maria Remarque and the actors Jean Gabin, Michael Wilding and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. "I've always been attracted to intelligent men," she once said. "I can pick 'em in a full room, just like that. I don't care what age they are."         Miss Dietrich kept in touch with friends around the world by telephone and letter. She often cooked delicacies for friends, as well as for stagehands and doormen. Her specialties included goulash and apple strudel. She was also knowledgeable about antiques, and owned paintings by Delacroix, Cezanne, Utrillo and Corot. A Faith in Astrology, For Herself and Others         Deeply influenced by astrology, she regularly had horoscopes prepared for friends. On that subject, she once remarked: "Astrology! Of course. After all, everyone knows that the moon pulls the sea away from the land, and farmers don't plant when the moon is wrong.         "Why should humans escape?"         She granted occasional interviews to friendly journalists, but over the years she grew impatient with those who asked questions she regarded as stupid or pointless.         In her memoirs, "Marlene Dietrich's ABC," published in 1962, she wrote: "Once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast."         Miss Dietrich, who stopped performing in the mid-1970's, lived the last years of her life as a virtual recluse in her Paris apartment.         A photograph of her in "Shanghai Express" was chosen to publicize this year's Cannes International Film Festival, which starts Thursday. The poster adorns billboards all over France.       
         Joyce Macwatty Black, called "the ultimate volunteer" for her nearly 40 years as an officer of more than 75 charitable organizations and government panels, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 65 years old, and her primary residence was in Manhattan.         She died of metastasized breast cancer, her family said.         As a leader in many causes, Mrs. Black became an expert on volunteerism and served as a consultant and coordinator of volunteer activities at local, state and Federal levels.         Last year, President Bush appointed her to the National Community and Service Commission. She was also an officer in the National Center for Voluntary Action and co-chairwoman of the National Congress on Volunteerism and Citizenship.         Mrs. Black served as the co-chairwoman of New York City's Voluntary Action Council under Mayors John V. Lindsay, Abraham D. Beame, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. Since 1986, she had been the executive director of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Office for Voluntary Service, the only paid job she ever held. Won Mayoral Award 3 Times         In 1988, Leonard W. Stern, executive director of the National Assembly, a coalition of charitable organizations, called her "the ultimate volunteer."         "She has probably done more work in more organizations at higher levels and had more influence than any private citizen," he said at the time.         Three times she won the Mayoral Award for Outstanding Voluntary Service. She was also honored by the New York Medical Society, the Hospital Association of New York State and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         Children and health were her major themes and she was a leading advocate of improving day and foster care.         At her death, she was president of the Day Care Council of New York City. She had also headed the Child Welfare League of America, the Y.M.W.C.A. Day Care Corporation and the New York State Advisory Committee on Day Care.         Appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, she was the first woman to serve on the New York State Banking Board. She was also the first woman to become the local and national president of Big Brothers-Big Sisters of America and the first to serve as a trustee of New York University Medical Center. 'Born Into a Good Life'         Born in Englewood, N.J., Mrs. Black grew up in in Ridgewood, N.J. While studying at Skidmore College, where she graduated in 1948, she volunteered as a nurse's aide.         She attributed her career to her family roots, a pledge she made during an illness and guidance from an educator. Her grandfather, James Harkness, was a prosperous and civic-minded businessman. "I was born into a good life," she said, "and was encouraged to give back what I could."         Stricken with polio as a young adult, she said she vowed to help others if she recovered. When she considered becoming a social worker, she said Dr. Alex Rosen, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, had told her, "You will do a lot more good going on boards, raising money and getting involved in direct service to meet community needs."         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Hiram D. Black, a retired lawyer and financial consultant; a daughter, Suzanne O'Toole of Darien, Conn.; a sister, Suzanne Morris of Delray Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Pola Nirenska, a noted teacher and choreographer who danced with Mary Wigman, died on Saturday after a fall from the balcony of her apartment in Bethesda, Md. She was 81 years old.         The death was ruled a suicide by the Montgomery County Medical Examiner.         Miss Nirenska was a major force in dance in Washington, as a teacher, as director of a company whose dancers included Liz Lerman and Sharon Wyrrick (later choreographers in their own right), and as a creator of impressively fashioned dances filled with often raw emotion. Her last piece, presented at Dance Place in Washington in 1990, was inspired by Holocaust victims she had known and was called "In Memory of Those I Loved . . . Who Are No More."  Little Early Training         "Her dances are strong and stark, like massive three-dimensional sculpture in volume and weight," George Jackson, a Washington-based dance critic, said after Miss Nirenska's death. "Her figures are larger than life, but with very distinct personalities."         Miss Nirenska, who was born in Warsaw, insisted on a dance career as a child. She had very little early training, but graduated with honors from a music and dance school in Dresden, Germany, run by Wigman, the influential German Expressionist choreographer. Miss Nirenska performed with Wigman's company during its 1932-33 tour of the United States and Germany. She then embarked on a career as a solo dancer, teacher and choreographer, working in Warsaw, Vienna and Italy. In 1934 the International Dance Congress in Vienna awarded Miss Nirenska a first prize for choreography and a second prize for performing.         At the start of World War II, Miss Nirenska, who was Jewish, immigrated to England, where she gave solo recitals, choreographed musicals and entertained the troops. She also worked there with the choreographers Kurt Jooss and Sigurd Leeder and modeled for the sculptor Jacob Epstein.         Miss Nirenska left for the United States in 1949. She studied in New York with leading American modern-dance choreographers and teachers, among them Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, Jose Limon and Louis Horst. She moved to Washington in 1951 and established a career there as a teacher at local ballet and modern-dance schools and at her own studio, and as a highly regarded choreographer with a company of her own.         Her marriage to Count John Ledesma, an actor and military pilot, ended in divorce. She is survived by her second husband, Jan Karski.       
         Marion P. Ames, a major force for court reform in New York State for 35 years and a leader in many other public causes, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         She died after an operation for spinal bone cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Ames was a Wall Street lawyer for 10 years but left that career to rear her children and concentrate on volunteer activities.         She worked to consolidate the antiquated system of diverse state and local courts, give proper financing and modern management, provide for discipline in instances of judicial misconduct, eliminate political abuses and promote merit selection of jurists.         The American Judicature Society, a national group for improving the courts, honored her with an award for the major progress she made on all those points. Led League of Women Voters         Serving as the president of the State League of Women Voters and head of its courts committee, Mrs. Ames waged her campaign in speeches, reports, news releases, lobbying, coalitions, testimony at hearings and letters to the editor.         She also served as vice chairwoman of the state Committee for Modern Courts, a non-profit organization. In 1973 Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed her to a new State Judicial Screening Committee -- and she publicly criticized its limitations.         "She really was the guiding light of the league's work, which played a lead role in court reform," said Elizabeth Hubbard, executive director of the Committee for Modern Courts. "She was always at the center of the movement to improve the system, someone we and political leaders and other groups always looked up to."         Mrs. Ames's other activities included serving as the board chairwoman of the College of New Rochelle and vice chairwoman of Barnard College.         She also led private social service agencies as president of the statewide Health and Welfare Network, New York Communities Aid Association and State Association for Community Services. Broad Spectrum of Causes         Among the issues she championed were liberalized voter registration laws, permanent political primary schedules, equitable welfare benefits and education aid, impartial legislative redistricting, an improved automobile insurance system and the release of mental patients from state institutions to local residences with support services.         Mrs. Ames was born in Manhattan. Her nickname was Pat, from her maiden name, Patterson.         She graduated from Barnard in 1937 and Fordham Law School in 1943. Her law practice specialized in estates, trusts and labor law.         Surviving are her husband of 51 years, George J. Ames, a partner in Lazard Freres & Company; four daughters, Ruth Solie of Northampton, Mass., Joan Berkowitz of Guilford, Conn., Margery E. Ames of Manhattan and Dorothy Cummings of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, William H. Patterson of Cincinnati, and five grandchildren.       
         Linda J. Laubenstein, a Manhattan physician who in 1981 discovered some of the first mysterious cases of what became the worldwide AIDS epidemic, died on Saturday at her summer home in Chatham, Mass., on Cape Cod. She was 45 years old.         Her family said an autopsy was pending. She suffered from severe asthma and weakness from childhood polio, an illness that required three major operations and left her a paraplegic at the age of 5.         "She is incredibly important in the history of AIDS, a genuine pioneer and a real fighter for what she believed," said Larry Kramer, an author and a leader in AIDS causes.         Dr. Laubenstein inspired the character of Dr. Emma Brookner, a principal role in Mr. Kramer's play on acquired immune deficiency syndrome, "The Normal Heart." He said an agreement was near on the production of a movie version by Barbra Streisand, with Ms. Streisand playing the Laubenstein-Brookner part.         Dr. Jeffrey B. Greene, a colleague, called Dr. Laubenstein "the ultimate AIDS physician." Despite her handicap, she met patients in the emergency room in the middle of the night and even made house calls, using her motorized wheelchair and public buses. "She was sicker than most of her patients but didn't let it stop her," Dr. Greene said. First Paper on Subject         Dr. Laubenstein and Dr. Alvin Friedman-Kien wrote the first paper to be published in a medical journal on the alarming appearance of Kaposi's sarcoma, a previously rare disease of lesions of the skin and other tissues. Most of the cases were in young gay men suffering a puzzling collapse of the immune system.         Recalling one of the first cases, she described a 33-year-old man with two purple spots behind his ears. Initially he responded to the cancer drugs she prescribed. But 18 months later he was dead, his body covered with 75 lesions.         Many more cases followed. By May 1982, she had seen 62 patients with AIDS -- a fourth of the national total recorded at the time. She said then that "this problem certainly is not going away."         Her father, George Laubenstein, said yesterday, "She told us from the very beginning that this is going to be a terrible epidemic."         Dr. Laubenstein's private practice grew to be predominantly AIDS cases. She and Dr. Freidman-Kien arranged the first full-scale medical conference on AIDS, at New York University in 1983. She also help to found the Kaposi's Sarcoma Research Fund in 1983. Jobs in Office Services         In 1989, she and Dr. Greene founded Multitasking, a nonprofit organization selling office services to other businesses and employing people with AIDS as the workers. Her concern was that AIDS patients often lost their jobs and that work was vital to emotional and physical health as well as for financial support.         Dr. Laubenstein was outspoken about what she said was the neglect by government and society in fighting AIDS. Some of her views were controversial among gay groups, particularly her belief that bathhouses should be shut down to discourage unsafe sex.         Born in Boston, she grew up in Barrington, R.I. She graduated from Barnard College and New York University Medical School. Her specialties were hematology and oncology, and she was a clinical professor at the New York University Medical Center.         Surviving are her parents, George and Priscilla of Harwich Port, Mass., and a brother, Peter of Melvin Village, N.H.

         Edith R. Peterson, a medical researcher into cell cultures at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Saturday at Horton Memorial Hospital in Middletown, N.Y. She was 78 years old and had moved to Middletown two years ago from the Bronx.         She died of a stroke, said Art Oshins, a spokesman at Albert Einstein.         Ms. Peterson, who was born in Brooklyn, had been associated with the college since 1966. She was known for several innovations in her specialty, organotypic cultures -- cultures typical of an organ -- of nerve and muscle tissues.         The college reported that one important contribution led to the recognition that myelin, the insulating sheath around nerve cells, can be grown in test tubes. The finding, which she made in 1948, aided multiple-sclerosis research, since the destruction of myelin causes that disease, the college said.         Ms. Peterson graduated from Barnard College in 1937 with a major in zoology, and earned an M.A. in that discipline at Columbia University two years later.         Ms. Peterson is survived by her husband, Charles; a son, Wesley; a daughter, Ronnie, and three grandchildren, all of Middletown.       
         Barbara Miller Solomon, a Harvard educator and leader in women's studies, died Thursday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Solomon, a historian, taught Harvard's first course on the history of American women, the forerunner of what evolved into a broader women's studies program.         She also directed a major collection of historical material on women, served as Harvard's first female assistant dean and was a mentor to other female scholars.         Her book "In the Company of Educated Women: A History of Women and Higher Education in America" (Yale University Press, 1985) won the Frederick W. Ness book award. The text traced the struggle of American women to gain access to college and assessed the importance of their education to them and to society in opening up new careers and roles. Family and Studies         Dr. Solomon, a native of Boston, graduated from Radcliffe in 1940, continued her studies there part time while starting a family and earned a doctorate in American civilization in 1953.         She first gained attention by turning her doctoral thesis on immigration into a book, "Ancestors & Immigrants: A Changing New England Tradition" (Harvard University Press, 1956). It is widely used as a college text and was honored by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.         Dr. Solomon started her teaching career at Wheelock College in Boston in 1957 and joined Harvard's faculty in 1959.         That year she became the director of the Women's Archives at Radcliffe, now known as the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. Her work won national recognition when Lady Bird Johnson invited her to be guest of honor at the White House.         She also served as a college administrator, first as an associate dean at Harvard's affiliated Radcliffe College from 1963 to 1970, then as an assistant dean at Harvard from 1970 to 1974. After retiring from teaching in 1985, she was a scholar in residence at the Schlesinger Library.         Her husband of 48 years, Peter H. Solomon, a shoe company executive, died in 1988. She is survived by two sons, Peter Solomon of Toronto and Daniel Solomon of Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Maida Solomon of Cambridge, and four grandchildren.       
         Alice Woodard Fordyce, a philanthropist whose support of medical research in the last five decades included her involvement in the awarding of one of science's most prestigious prizes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fordyce died of heart failure, her son, James Woodard Fordyce, said.         For almost 50 years, Mrs. Fordyce and her sister, Mary Woodard Lasker, were the driving forces behind the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, which awarded the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards.         The $15,000 awards, given for significant achievement in basic and medical research, have long been considered second in prestige only to the Nobel Prizes. Forty-nine Lasker Award recipients were later awarded the Nobel Prize.         The foundation and the awards program were founded by Mrs. Fordyce, Mrs. Lasker and her husband, Albert, in 1944 to draw attention to major achievements in basic and clinical medical research and stimulate Federal financing of research. Mr. Lasker died in 1952.         Mrs. Fordyce served as executive vice president of the foundation and director of the awards program until December 1990. She remained a member of the foundation's board and a consultant to the awards program until her death.         Mrs. Fordyce, who was born in Watertown, Wis., the daughter of a bank president, graduated from Smith College in 1928 and studied at the Sorbonne and the University of Grenoble in France. The sisters' interest in supporting medical research stemmed from the ear infections that Mary Lasker endured and from both their mother and father's suffering from hypertension.         Mrs. Fordyce served on many governmental committees and with health-related organizations, including the United States branch of the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the International Council for Coordinating Cancer Research, the United States Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation, the Rockefeller University Council, the Geriatric Advisory Council of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Psychiatry Department at Columbia University.         Mrs. Fordyce was also involved with civic activities that included the American Museum in Britain, the Leeds Castle Foundation, Bargemusic and the Port of Entry Program at Queensboro College, which helps Chinese students learn American customs and practices.         Mrs. Fordyce's husband, A. Grant Fordyce, an architect, whom she married in 1939, died in 1972. She is survived by her sister, Mary Lasker of Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn.; her son, James of Greenwhich, and three grandsons.       
         Bernice Gera, the first female umpire in professional baseball, died of kidney cancer Wednesday in Memorial Hospital West in Pembroke Pines, Fla. She was 61 years old.         In 1972, Mrs. Gera, who fought in courtrooms for the preceding five years to achieve her goal, gained national attention when she umpired a Class A minor league game between the Geneva Rangers and the Auburn Phillies of the New York-Penn League.         Mrs. Gera resigned after the game, saying she became disenchanted with umpiring when the other umpires refused to cooperate with her on the field.         "Bernice would always say, 'I could beat them in the courts, but I can't beat them on the field,' " Steve Gera, her husband, said. No woman has ever umpired in the major leagues.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Gera is survived by two brothers and two sisters.       
         Anna Johnstone Robinson, who designed the costumes for many major films and Broadway shows and was nominated for Academy Awards for "The Godfather" and "Ragtime," died on Friday at the Kimball Farms nursing home in Lenox, Mass. She was 79 years old and lived in the Bronx and Canaan, N.Y.         She died after a long illness whose nature was not disclosed, a funeral home spokesman said.         Mrs. Robinson, who worked under her maiden name, Anna Hill Johnstone, designed the costumes for more than 60 films. Tricks of the Trade         Her movies included "Serpico," "The Wiz," "On the Waterfront," "East of Eden," "America, America," "Prince of the City," "The Verdict," "Running on Empty," "Baby Doll," "Edge of the City," "Dog Day Afternoon" and "A Face in the Crowd."         While preparing for the filming of "The Group" in 1965, Mrs. Robinson divulged some tricks of her craft. She combed through the closets and attics of friends in Riverdale and scrounged through thrift shops on the East Side of Manhattan looking for just the right clothes for the story's era.         Sometimes she cheated a bit on authenticity. For one outfit, satin had to be substituted for the scripted taffeta, for example, to avoid making distracting rustling sounds that would ruin the soundtrack.         Mrs. Robinson got started by helping with student productions in college, then became a seamstress for summer stock stage shows.         Her first full credit for costume design was for the 1937 Broadway hit "Having Wonderful Time." Her other stage productions included "Bell, Book and Candle," "Lost in the Stars," "Tea and Sympathy," "The Tender Trap" and "A Streetcar Named Desire."         Turning to movies in 1948, Mrs. Robinson got her first film credit as a costume designer for "Portrait of Jennie." She continued doing movies for 40 years, frequently working for the directors Elia Kazan and Sidney Lumet. She also designed costumes for some television shows.         Born in Greenville, S.C., Mrs. Robinson grew up in Richmond. She graduated from Barnard College in 1934, and 40 years later received an honorary degree there.         For more than 50 years she was married to Curville Jones Robinson, a mechanical engineer, who died in 1989.         There are no immediate survivors.         Correction:  October 31, 1992, Saturday         An obituary on Oct. 19 about Anna Johnstone Robinson, a theatrical designer, listed a stage credit for her in error. Lucinda Ballard, not Mrs. Robinson, was the costume designer for "A Streetcar Named Desire."       
         Dottie Green, the savvy, strong-armed catcher for the original Rockford (Ill.) Peaches, who dominated the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League from its inception in 1943 to its demise in 1954, died on Monday at her home in Natick, Mass. She was 71 years old.         According to Mary Bond, the longtime friend who took care of her during her final illness, she died of cancer.         Although Miss Green had the same first name, and played the same position on the same team as the character portrayed by Geena Davis in "A League of Their Own," the 1992 movie based on the famous women's league, that was merely a coincidence, according to those familiar with the league and the movie, including Kelly Candaele, whose story was the basis of the movie. Handled Pitchers Well         "Dottie was a popular name back then and we had a lot of Dotties," said Dottie Collins, a former member of the Fort Wayne Daisies, who recalled Miss Green yesterday as a smart catcher who handled her pitchers well and had a dead-eye throw to second.         "I was a pitcher and I know catchers," said Mrs. Collins, who also serves as the treasurer of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association, the nonprofit organization that owns the rights to the league's name and emblems.         Dorothy M. Green, who was born in Natick, grew up as an all-round athlete and was captain of the girls' softball, basketball and field hockey teams in her senior year at Natick High School.         After graduation, she played semipro softball for the Olympettes, a women's team that played in Boston Garden.         When Philip K. Wrigley, the owner of the Chicago Cubs, decided to start a women's baseball league to keep up the nation's interest in the sport during World War II, Miss Green was one of several Olympettes recruited by the new league.         Assigned to the Rockford Peaches, one of the four teams that began play in 1943, she played four seasons, until a knee injury forced her to abandon her career. She was later a chaperone with the league. Rooted for the Red Sox         She became a recreation officer at the state prison for women at Framingham, Mass., and was captain of the guards when she retired several years ago.         According to Miss Bond, Miss Green was not a fan of major league baseball until later life, when she began rooting for the Red Sox.         "She thought the men were too slow," Miss Bond said. "She said she didn't care to watch them."         Miss Green is survived by a brother, John H. Green, and a sister, Beatrice Clews.       
         Joan Mitchell, an American painter who was an important figure in the second generation of American Abstract Expressionists, died yesterday in a hospital in Paris. She was 66 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said Robert Miller, her dealer.         An ecstatic and inventive colorist with a way of putting on the paint that was unmistakably her own, Miss Mitchell worked as much with memories of her childhood in Saugatuck, Mich., and of her youth on the East River in Brooklyn, as with the treasured landscape on which she looked out every day from her house above the town of Vetheuil, near Paris.         Throughout her life, she insisted that the tumultuous and airborne expression of feeling in her paintings was not a matter of instinct left free to run wild. As she said to the historian Irving Sandler: "The freedom in my work is quite controlled. I don't close my eyes and hope for the best." The historian Leo Steinberg once wrote of her ability "to score triumphantly for the willed act as against chance effect." Appreciation Grew         Like many another American expatriate, she sometimes felt herself underrated by New York opinion. But in recent years, working on a scale even larger than that favored by the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, she found both a glorious fulfillment in her work and an eager response from collectors and critics.         Her recent shows at the Robert Miller Gallery in New York City won wide praise, and the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum and the National Gallery were among the museums that had recently bought major works of hers.         Joan Mitchell was born in Chicago on Feb. 21, 1926. She was the daughter of James Herbert Mitchell and Marion Strobel, co-editor with Harriet Monroe of Poetry magazine. As a child, she came to know T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Thornton Wilder, Dylan Thomas and others as visitors to the family home.         As a young woman in Chicago, Miss Mitchell became acquainted with the great paintings by Cezanne, Matisse and others. She was a graduate of Smith College and later attended the art school of the Art Institute of Chicago, after which she came to New York. Won a Traveling Fellowship         Thanks to the $2,000 that came with an Edward L. Ryerson traveling fellowship from the institute, she spent a year in France in 1948-49, working first in Paris and later in Le Lavandou in Provence. While in France, she married Barney Rosset, the founder of the Grove Press publishing house.         Back in New York in 1950, she soon became accepted as a promising member of the downtown art scene. One of the few women to be admitted to membership in the influential Artists' Club, she participated in 1951 in the "Ninth Street Show" organized by the Club and supervised by Leo Castelli.         By the mid-1950's her work was admired by some of the best judges of the day. In 1957 she took part in "Artists of the New York School: Second Generation," organized at the Jewish Museum by Meyer Schapiro and introduced by Leo Steinberg.         A return to Paris in 1955, three years after her divorce from Mr. Rosset, led to a gradual withdrawal from New York and an ever-increasing identification with life in France. This was reinforced by her meeting with the painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, who was to be her companion from 1955 until 1979. Denied Monet Influenced Her         After the death of her mother in 1967, Miss Mitchell inherited enough money to buy a two-acre estate above Vetheuil, a little town on the Seine that is best known for the residence there of Claude Monet. She lived there permanently from 1968 until her death.         Her house looked out over a panoramic view of the river that inevitably put every visitor in mind of Monet. But Miss Mitchell was characteristically emphatic in her denials that Monet had had any influence upon her.         In recent years, a hip operation hindered her movements, though it did not prevent her from maneuvering the path from her house to her favorite restaurant far below.         Among her major retrospective exhibitions were those at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1974), the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (1982), and in 1988 a touring exhibition that went to the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and elsewhere. Earlier this year, "Joan Mitchell Pastels" was seen at the Whitney Museum. In 1991 she received the Grand Prix des Arts from the City of Paris.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Bertina Suida Manning, a scholar of Italian art and a collector of French and Italian paintings and drawings, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         She died of heart failure, said a friend, Mary Jane Harris.         Mrs. Manning was born in Vienna and was the only child of William E. Suida, an eminent Viennese art historian known for his work on Leonardo da Vinci and Genoese painting. She moved with her parents to the United States in 1939 and attended Queens College and the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, where she met her husband, Robert Lee Manning, an art collector who became director of the art gallery at Finch College in Manhattan.         With her father, she wrote a book on Luca Cambiaso, a 16th- century Genoese painter. From her father, Mrs. Manning inherited thousands of Italian and French paintings and drawings, to which she and her husband added major works. During the 1950's she advised the collector Walter P. Chrysler Jr. In 1962-63, she and her husband organized the first United States exhibition of Genoese painting, which traveled from Dayton, Ohio, to Sarasota, Fla., to Hartford. Since 1989 she had served as president of the Godwin-Ternbach Museum at Queens College.         The Mannings were known for making their collection at their home available to students, curators and many others from around the world. Works from the Suida Manning collection have been donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Morgan Library and the National Gallery in Washington, among other institutions. Paintings by Guercino and Mattia Preti are among the works now on loan to the Metropolitan, where they are on view in the museum's galleries of Baroque painting.         She is survived by her husband; her daughter, Sandy Manning Dolnier, and a grandson, John Robert Dylan.       
         Saundra D. Shepherd, a pediatrician and educator who campaigned for medical care for needy children in New York City and in Africa, died on Thursday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of chronic pulmonary disease, a family spokesman said.         For the last eight years Dr. Shepherd was the director of social pediatric training at the Montefiore Medical Center. Since the early 1980's she taught there and at City College and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She also had a private practice.         The harm to children's health from poverty, discrimination and the lack of housing was a major theme of her work. She was a frequent speaker in public and professional forums and testified before government bodies.         She was a consulting physician to the Legal Services Corporation and the Legal Aid Society for the last 16 years and worked with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Prisoners' Legal Services, the Newark Public Defender and the Rutgers Law School Homeless Rights Project.         Dr. Shepherd also served with the New York City Mayor's Advisory Council on Child Health, Physicians for Reproductive Health, the Teen-Age Adolescent Pregnancy Care and Prevention Program and the New York State Advisory Panel on Primary Physicians.         Her service in Africa included work on the Committee for Health in Southern Africa, a physicians' evaluation team in Liberia, the medical college planning committee for Africa University in Zimbabwe and the United Methodist Church medical aid program for Mozambique.         Dr. Shepherd was born in Manhattan. After graduating from City College in 1968, she earned a master's degree from Hunter College in 1971 and a medical degree from Yale in 1975. Early in her career she studied and did laboratory work in hematology.         Surviving are her husband of 19 years, Dr. Peter Finch; her parents, Sylvia Shepherd of Manhattan and Archibald Shepherd Jr. of Florida; a daughter, Abi Shepherd-Finch of Manhattan; a brother, Lawrence of Manhattan, and her grandmother, Doris Allman of Barbados.       
         Dorothy Kirsten, an American lyric soprano who sang leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera for 30 years and was particularly renowned for her performances of Puccini heroines, died yesterday morning at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of complications from a stroke she suffered on Nov. 5, said Peter Gravina, her longtime press representative.         At the height of her career, in the 1950's and 60's, Miss Kirsten appealed not only to opera fans, who knew her as an attractive, intelligent, thoroughly musical singer and a fine actress, but also to a broader public that knew her from her frequent radio and television appearances or from her performances in the films "The Great Caruso," with Mario Lanza, and "Mr. Music," with Bing Crosby.         On the opera stage, her repertory ran from staples like Mimi in Puccini's "Boheme" to comparative rarities like the title role in Charpentier's "Louise." In her concert and television appearances, she sang not only opera arias but theater and popular songs as well, and she co-starred with Frank Sinatra on the radio show "Your Hit Parade." Musical Heritage         Miss Kirsten was born into a musical family in Montclair, N.J., on July 6, 1910 (although she gave her birth year variously as 1917 and 1915). Her mother was an organist and music teacher. Her great-aunt, Catherine Hayes, had an operatic career and was known as "The Irish Jenny Lind." Her grandfather was a conductor and an early president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians.         She was drawn to music and acting early in life, but did not set her sights on an operatic career until she had achieved some modest success as a popular singer. After leaving high school when she was 16 years old, Miss Kirsten worked as a demonstrator of Singer sewing machines and as what she called a trouble-shooter at New Jersey Telephone, while studying voice in New York City at night. When she had made some progress and wanted more frequent lessons than she could afford, she agreed to work for her teacher, Louis Darnay, as both secretary and maid in exchange for lessons.         By 1937, she was singing professionally on radio, both as a member of the Kate Smith Chorus and in her own solo spots with several dance orchestras. The soprano Grace Moore heard her in 1938 and became her mentor and benefactor, sending her to Rome for a year of study with Astolfo Pescia, who was Beniamino Gigli's vocal coach. She had planned to spend a second year in Italy and then a year in France, but returned to New York at the start of World War II.         Upon her return in 1939, Miss Kirsten made her professional concert debut in a stage show at the New York World's Fair. She was also reunited with Miss Moore, who recommended her to the Chicago Grand Opera, where Miss Kirsten made her operatic debut as Pousette in Massenet's "Manon" in 1940. Miss Kirsten sang 15 minor roles during her first season and the following year shared the stage with Miss Moore in a Chicago performance of "La Boheme," singing Musetta to Miss Moore's Mimi.         In 1942, Miss Kirsten began to sing leading roles with the San Carlo Opera Company, in Washington and New York City. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1943, and by 1945 had performed with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras. Starting in September 1943, she had her own radio program, "Keepsakes," which ran for a year.         Miss Kirsten's Metropolitan Opera debut, as Mimi in "La Boheme" on Dec. 1, 1945, was a critical success, and was the start of a 30-year association with the house. In 1971, when she celebrated her 25th anniversary with the company, she reminisced about that debut, and recalled that Miss Moore sat in the first box, at the side of the stage, and threw roses to her. When Miss Moore died in a plane crash in Denmark in 1947, Miss Kirsten sang Schubert's "Ave Maria" at her funeral.         Miss Kirsten's career was centered in the United States, but she did tour Europe and, in 1962, the Soviet Union. There, besides giving recitals, she sang Violetta in a Bolshoi Opera performance of "La Traviata," to considerable acclaim, even though, as she said later, she had to go on without the benefit of a stage rehearsal. Worked With Composers         During her years at the Met, Miss Kirsten sang most of the important Puccini roles, including the title roles in "Manon Lescaut," "Tosca" and "Madama Butterfly," and she starred as Minnie in a revival of "La Fanciulla del West" that helped restore the work to the repertory. She prepared for the title role in "Louise" by going to France to study it with the composer. She also worked with the composer Italo Montemezzi on "L'Amore dei Tre Re" before she performed it in San Francisco and at the Met.         In addition to the Puccini heroines, her repertory included the female leads in Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette" and "Faust," Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Verdi's "Traviata." She sang in the American premieres of Walton's "Troilus and Cressida" and Poulenc's "Dialogue des Carmelites," both in San Francisco.         Miss Kirsten's voice was not huge, but she used it gracefully throughout her long career. When she gave her farewell performance at the Met, on Dec. 31, 1976, Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times that "she sang and acted the part of Tosca with the vocal control and dramatic acuity of a prima donna in mid-career."         In an article she wrote for Opera News just before that performance, Miss Kirsten attributed her vocal longevity to her refusal to accept roles that she felt were too heavy for her voice.         "I've always believed in the principle of protection, and I never sang a role I felt was not right for my voice," she wrote. "This took courage and drew some criticism along the way, but after 30 years of preserving Puccini's legato and tessitura I don't have to apologize to anyone, do I?"  Video Releases         Miss Kirsten's autobiography, "A Time to Sing," was published in 1982. Recently, several of her television performances on the "Voice of Firestone" program, including the Poker Scene from "Fanciulla," "Vissi d'Arte" from "Tosca" and several popular songs, have been released on tape by Video Arts International. And her recordings of several Romberg operettas have been reissued by Angel Records.         Miss Kirsten's first marriage, to Edward MacKayes Oates, ended in divorce in 1949. In 1951 she married Dr. Eugene Chapman, who died in 1954. In 1955, she married Dr. John Douglas French, a neurosurgeon who was director of the Brain Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. When Dr. French developed Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980's, Miss Kirsten testified at a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and in 1983 she set up the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research. Dr. French died in 1989.         She is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Parker of Tucson, Ariz., and Ethel Anderson of Lenoir, N.C., and a brother, George, also of Lenoir.       
         Alice I. Bryan, a psychologist who fostered the advancement of women in her profession and who led a major study on the role of libraries, died on Friday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, her relatives said. Her death was reported yesterday by Columbia University, where she had taught for 35 years.         Dr. Bryan was a founder and president of the National Council of Women Psychologists. Its first meeting was held in her apartment. She was also an officer of the American Association for Applied Psychology and the American Psychology Association.         This year she addressed the American Library Association, which honored her on the 40th anniversary of her book "The Public Librarian." Based on interviews with more than 3,000 librarians, it explored the role of libraries as centers of mass communication.         Dr. Bryan started teaching part time at Sarah Lawrence College and Pratt Institute in the 1930's, and joined Columbia's Library School in 1939 as a psychologist and teacher. She became its first female full professor and helped organize its doctoral program. She retired in 1971.         Dr. Bryan, whose family name was Bever, was born in Kearny, N.J. Her marriages to Chester Bryan and Frank Blasingame ended in divorce. Her third husband, George V. Fuller, died in 1960.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Hanya Holm, a major choreographer of modern dance and Broadway musicals, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 99 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia, said Heidi Holm, her daughter-in-law.         To theatergoers, Miss Holm was known as the choreographer of musicals including Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Out of This World" and Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's "My Fair Lady" and "Camelot." To modern-dance aficionados, Miss Holm was the most significant choreographer and dancer to have come out of the Central European Expressionist dance tradition in Germany. Its most noted figure was Mary Wigman, and Miss Holm was her student. Her 1937 "Trend," a dance of social protest, is considered a masterwork of American modern dance. Miss Holm has been considered a member of a pantheon of American modern-dance choreographers that included Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman.         A funny, humane and uncompromising woman, Miss Holm encouraged her pupils to find their own individual ways of artistic expression. Her students included leading choreographers as diverse as Alwin Nikolais, Murray Louis, Glen Tetley, Don Redlich and Lucinda Childs. Sound and Movement         Born in Worms, Germany, Miss Holm, whowas originally named Johanna Eckert, pursued a career in dance against her family's wishes. She had been exposed to dance at the Dalcroze Institute of Applied Rhythm in Frankfurt in 1915. The theories of Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, a Swiss composer and teacher who helped his music and dance students develop a sense of rhythm by translating sounds into movement, had at that point influenced a generation of German modern dancers, of whom the best known was Wigman. Miss Holm was dancing with Wigman's troupe by 1921 and taught in her school in Dresden. She remained a leading Wigman teacher and dancer for 10 years, creating roles in "Feier" and "Totenmal," which she helped Wigman choreograph. It was during this time that she changed her name.         In 1930-31, Sol Hurok brought the Wigman company to the United States for a transcontinental tour. Hurok had urged Wigman to found an American school, and she agreed, sending Miss Holm to America to direct it. Miss Holm arrived in New York City in September 1931, and for the next five years she devoted herself to teaching. She bought the school when its popularity began to decline after the first year, and in 1936 the school was renamed the Hanya Holm School of Dance. The new style she was developing, she told her pupils, was based on the proposition that "emotionally the German dance is basically subjective and the American dance is objective." The distinction, she added, was "one of 'being' as contrasted with 'doing.' "         Miss Holm took on other teaching positions in important dance institutions, among them, in 1934, the Bennington College Summer School of Dance, the forerunner of the American Dance Festival, where the "Trend" was first performed. In 1941, she developed the influential summer dance program at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, where she continued to teach until 1983. Part of the success of her teaching lay in her pithy instructions to students. "Keep the beat," she told them, "but undermine it." Another instruction was to "use the feet as if you would pick up a flower with your toes." Her students were familiar with the command to "feel it, children, don't schlep it." 'Living Essence'         She often expressed her disagreement with what she saw as an emphasis on chill technical expertise in American dance teaching. "If I see one more leg extension, I've had it," Miss Holm said in 1984. "There is security in a major leg extension. But it means nothing. The simplest thing is to shun the emotions and emphasize technique. But you become like a nice stove that doesn't give any heat." One had to be careful, she noted, of trying to instill that "little bit of living essence." "You can't take something away without         giving         something," she said.         She had begun choreographing in 1928, but her American concert career began in 1937 with a tour of Midwestern colleges. She made her New York debut that year in a program that included "Trend," her first major work in America, which had a cast of 33 dancers, some of them from her own company and the rest students at Bennington. A depiction of society's being destroyed by its false values, then saved by a cataclysm, "Trend" was an ambitious, architectonic dance that unfolded in eight sections on a massive set designed by Arch Lauterer that consisted of free-standing columns, an elevated platform and a ramp. Many years later, Miss Holm said the difficulties and expense of reconstructing the set prevented her from reviving the dance.         John Martin, writing in The New York Times, called "Trend" a "substantial piece of artistry" that "undertakes to deal with a colossal subject" in dance whose "designs appear in great sweeping dimensions, developing out of their own content, unhurried and unfaltering." He added that "Trend" was "not only the season's most important work but might be considered also as one of the most important works of the period, for it advances the dance signally along the road it has so rightly chosen."         One of the best descriptions of Miss Holm's dances and of "Trend" came, however, in an observation made by the choreographer about Wigman's work. "In her dances she alternately grapples with space as an opponent and caresses it as though it were a living, sentient thing," Miss Holm said. "In her gestures and movement she carves boldly and delicately visible and fluid forms, shaping, surrounding and sinking in the space which presses close about her." Early TV, Then Broadway         Miss Holm became a United States citizen in 1939, the same year she received the Dance Magazine Award for "Tragic Exodus," a powerful dance of social commentary. In 1939, she also became the first concert dancer to present her work on television in the United States, showing a shortened version of "Metropolitan Daily," a humorous depiction of a daily newspaper.         Miss Holm had abandoned modern dance for the Broadway stage by 1947, although she continued to create dances for her summer students and choreographed four well-received dances for the Don Redlich Dance Company in the mid-1970's and mid-1980's. Her first success was with the 1948 "Ballet Ballads," a suite of dances she created with Katherine Litz and Paul Godkin to music composed by Jerome Moross, with lyrics by John Latouche.         As a result of the success of her dance, "The Eccentricities of Davy Crockett," Miss Holm was invited to choreograph "Kiss Me, Kate" in 1948 and won a New York Drama Critics Award. Over the next 18 years, she created dances for 13 musicals becoming known for her ability to meet the stylistic needs of each show. In 1952, she became the first choreographer to copyright a dance: her choreography for "Kiss Me, Kate," submitted as a written Labanotation score on microfilm.         Among Miss Holm's other Broadway musicals were "Out of This World," "My Darlin' Aida" and "The Golden Apple." She also created the dances for the London and Tel Aviv productions of "My Fair Lady." She choreographed and directed the opera "The Ballad of Baby Doe" in 1956 in Central City, Colo., and Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice" for the second annual Vancouver International Festival in 1959. Among her film and television assignments were the dances for the 1955 film version of "The Vagabond King." Miss Holm was also known for her essays, published in periodicals and books, on dance teaching and technique.         Her honors included an award from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies for her contributions to modern dance in 1958, the Capezio Award, the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award in 1984 and the Astaire Award in 1987. "It just happened," Miss Holm said of her career in accepting the Scripps Award, "and whatever has happened was with love, dedication, good will, gladly and well. I keep on doing it as good as I can and as long as I can."         Miss Holm's marriage to Reinhold Martin Kuntze, a painter and sculptor, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, Klaus, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and three granddaughters, Karen Trautlein of Wilkes-Barre, Angela Holm of San Diego and Jessica Werbin of New Haven, Conn.       
         Blanchette Ferry Hooker Rockefeller, a major benefactor of the Museum of Modern Art and the widow of John D. Rockefeller 3d, died on Sunday at her home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. She was 83 years old.         A family spokesman said the cause of death was Alzheimer's disease complicated by pneumonia.         For four decades, Mrs. Rockefeller was a regal presence in philanthropy, helping to attract financial support and volunteers for causes ranging from children's welfare to the Juilliard School. Lay Administrator         But it was the Museum of Modern Art that was her predominant interest. She twice served as its president, although she insisted she had no curatorial expertise. "I'm not an expert on modern art," she once said, "just a person who has become interested."         Still, as a lay administrator, as she called herself, she had a major impact on the museum, leading a successful fund-raising campaign that enabled it to complete an expansion that doubled its gallery space.         These and other changes enabled the financially troubled museum to progress from a cultural institution dependent on the Rockefeller family and private support, to a more independent public institution attracting increased corporate and government support.         In 1979, while she was president, an expansion plan generated a dispute over the practice of selling the air rights of the museum to an outside developer to secure needed funds.         Mrs. Rockefeller, who upheld the sale, which brought in $17 million, was asked whether resorting to marketing techniques could be accomplished without jeopardizing the museum's standards.         "I hope so," she replied. "I hope we're not going to sell our birthright just to raise money. We have to find ways of doing it that don't compromise the basic premise of the museum, the reason for its existence." Believer in Hard Work         The innovative expansion program permitted the construction of a 52-story apartment tower at the Museum's 53d Street site, giving the museum additional exhibition space on lower floors. A law was also passed in Albany that, in effect, allowed the building's owners to give the museum a yearly sum that was the equivalent of taxes it would have paid to New York City. Other institutions have since copied that practice.         As the museum's president, Mrs. Rockefeller also favored adding new and younger trustees to the museum board, warning that they should not be named simply because they had wealth. She said, "We want them to bring some real contribution, like hard work."         Born in New York City on Oct. 2, 1909, Mrs. Rockefeller was heiress to the Ferry seed fortune through her mother. Her father was an engineer who became president of the Hooker Electro-Chemical Company.         She attended Miss Chapin's School for Girls, where she was known as "Hookie," and then Vassar College, graduating with a degree in music in 1931. A year later, she married Mr. Rockefeller, the eldest of the five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr.         At 24, and newly married, she began her involvement in the city's charitable and civic activities, joining the Central Council of the Community Service Society, one of the country's oldest and largest private family and health agencies. She was the first woman elected vice chairman.         She was a trustee of the Brearley School and of Vassar College, and she shared her husband's many philanthropic interests and his pleasure in collecting art. He was interested particularly in Asian art, and the Rockefeller homes were adorned with both Asian and American works. She once described their personal art collection as a "mishmash."         Mr. Rockefeller left his Asian collection to the Asia Society, which he founded in 1956 to promote better relations between the Asian and American continents. He was killed in an automobile accident on July 10, 1978, before he fulfilled his plans to increase significantly his financial gifts to the society and its new building on Park Avenue.         Mrs. Rockefeller was a member of the Asia Society's Gallery Advisory Committee and of the Japan Society's Gallery Advisory Committee. From 1974 to 1980, she was a member of the National Council on the Humanities and served on the New York State Council on the Arts. She was a member of the New York Philharmonic Symphony Society, the English-Speaking Union, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other leading cultural institutions.         She is survived by a son, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, and three daughters, Sandra Ferry of Massachusetts, Hope Aldrich of New Mexico, and Alida R. Messinger of Minnesota.         A memorial service will be held at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on Friday at 11 A.M. The family requests contributions be made to the Museum of Modern Art.       
         Kathryn Beck Kris, a psychoanalyst and psychiatrist, died Sunday at her home in Brookline, Mass. She was 59.         Dr. Kris died of cancer, said Harvard University, where she worked.         Dr. Kris, who received her M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1959, was assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the medical school and psychiatrist to the University Health Services. The major themes of her scholarly work were the emotional development of students and their interactions with teachers and counselors.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Anton O. Kris; two sons, David S. and Michael M. Kris, and a sister, Mary Ellen B. Wohl.       
         Elaine Whitelaw, for half a century the chief fund raiser and a major force for the March of Dimes, died on Tuesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 77.         She died of cancer, said her daughter, Patricia Snyderman of San Francisco.         In 1943, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt tapped her to join the national women's committee of the March of Dimes, which he founded to fight polio, Miss Whitelaw recognized the philanthropic potential of middle-income Americans. By creating a network of volunteers and programs for children and mothers, she made them the backbone of one of the country's most successful charities.         A dozen years after it began, the March of Dimes was helping to rid America of polio and has used the network Miss Whitelaw created to continue financing the fight against a variety of birth defects. 'She Was Irresistible'         "She was the general of a volunteer army," said Beverly Sills, the national chairwoman of the March of Dimes and a longtime friend of Miss Whitelaw's.         As a fixture on the national charity-ball scene, Miss Whitelaw embodied can-do do-gooding. Both colleagues and those she tapped relentlessly for contributions said she practiced what she preached. They described her as demanding, innovative, boundlessly energetic and fiercely determined.         "When she approached me about becoming involved with the March of Dimes she said, 'Other charities want to put your name on their stationery. I want your time, your energy and your money,' " Ms. Sills recalled. "She was irresistible."         Roseamond Elaine Whitelaw was born on Nov. 21, 1914, the oldest child of Louis Whitelaw, a wealthy diamond merchant, and his wife, Dora. Along with two younger brothers, Seymour and Jordan, Miss Whitelaw grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She graduated from Smith College, where she studied American history and art. She returned and embarked on a lifelong mission of balancing society and its entitlements and the social obligations of Roosevelt's New Deal.         "There was no question that I was going to work," she said last year. "But of course I wasn't going to work at some perfume counter and take a job from someone who needed it." After a brief stint as a script reader, an early marriage that ended in divorce and the birth of her daughter, Patricia, she volunteered to raise money for the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War. She moved on to volunteer for the National War Fund.         She later married Otto Brodnitz, an economist and stockbroker, and the couple lived on the Upper East side of Manhattan until his death in the mid-1970's.         After joining the March of Dimes in 1943, Miss Whitelaw created a network of volunteers who sought donations in cinemas and door to door. She also used her prodigious organizational abilities to help orchestrate the field tests of the Salk polio vaccine. "Her influence was all pervasive,' said Dr. Jonas Salk, founder of the Salk Institute in San Diego, Calif.  Serving Hot Meals         Later, along with Eleanor Lambert, she organized a fashion show to benefit the March of Dimes that Time magazine called "the event of the year." In 1976, she began "Gourmet Galas," dinners prepared in various cities by local celebrities and judged by culinary experts. Today, there are 40 different galas across the United States.         After retiring from the March of Dimes last year, Miss Whitelaw volunteered as a regional director of the Enterprise Foundation, a national organization involved in housing the poor. Increasingly concerned with homelessness, drug use and AIDS, she spent nights last winter riding a Planned Parenthood van and counseling women who lived or worked on the streets in the Bronx.         "The only way we're going to get them in for treatment is to feed them," she told a reporter at the time. "They don't know they might be sick. They know they're hungry, their children are hungry." Within days, she had cooking equipment and food donations, and, in her Adolfo suits and Ferragamo shoes, she helped serve hot meals from midnight to dawn.         One of the young women she fed, a runaway, took words from Miss Whitelaw's vocabulary to describe her. "She's a great dame," she said.         Miss Whitelaw is survived by her daughter; her brother, Seymour Whitelaw of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.       
         Helen Joseph, a white dissident who was repeatedly detained and harassed by the South African Government in a long struggle against apartheid, died today in a hospital here. She was 87.         She died of complications from a stroke she had suffered two weeks ago, news agencies reported.         Mrs. Joseph became prominent here as a symbol of white opposition to the racial policies of her adopted land in the years after World War II when apartheid gained legal force. In this way, she was ahead of most other white foes of the system of racial separation.         The Government responded in kind, for more than three decades placing the often-ailing, ever-defiant Mrs. Joseph under various forms of house arrest and issuing banning orders that prohibited her from receiving more than one visitor at a time.         She was also declared a "listed person," a punishment intended to prevent her from being quoted in any form.         Even when formally silenced, she never accepted the restrictions, imposed under the Suppression of Communism Act. "You can't silence yourself," she once told an interviewer.         In the ranks of anti-apartheid campaigners, Mrs. Joseph was a militant, an associate of Nelson and Winnie Mandela, who once referred to her as part of their "family." From Polite Background         It was not a role that her upbringing might have suggested. Born in Sussex in England in 1905, Helen Beatrice May Fennell seemed set for a middle-class English life. She graduated with an honors degree from the University of London in 1927 and went on to teach for three years in India.         Arriving in South Africa in 1931, she settled in Durban, married a dentist, and "threw herself into the life style of a socialite," as The Weekly Mail of Johannesburg said in 1986. "In those days," the profile of her added, "she was known as beautiful and flighty, leading a life of wining and dining and bridge parties."         Friends say her service as an information and welfare officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in World War II and a subsequent decision to become a social worker in Cape Town and Johannesburg exposed her to some of the realities of South Africa.         Divorced in 1948, she became a founder of the Congress of Democrats, the white wing of the African National Congress. In 1955, she was present for the adoption of the congress's Freedom Charter, a blueprint for a South Africa without racial discrimination.         The following year, Mrs. Joseph helped lead a march of 20,000 women on the Union Buildings in Pretoria to protest the extension of laws requiring blacks to carry passes. She was arrested and charged with treason, and a year later was put under the first of a series of banning orders. Overcame Cancer         In 1961, Mrs. Joseph was acquitted of treason after a marathon trial. But from 1962 to 1971, as a banned person, she was not allowed to receive visitors on weekends or at night, or to socialize with more than one person at a time. The order was lifted when she entered a hospital for cancer treatment.         "I had a cancer operation and then I had a major heart attack," she told an interviewer, "and they must really have thought, 'This old girl can't go on much longer.' "         But she did go on, campaigning at English-language universities. In 1978, she was jailed again, this time for contempt after she refused to testify against Winnie Mandela.         In August 1983, she became a sponsor of the United Democratic Front, which orchestrated the protest campaign of the mid-80's on behalf of the still-outlawed African National Congress. The campaign led to international sanctions against South Africa and ultimately to President F. W. de Klerk's offer of political change and to Mr. Mandela's release in 1990.         By then some reforms had begun, including the lifting of racial restrictions in public places. It seemed that Mrs. Joseph had outlasted a legal system that persecuted her. But her age and health problems, like a painful infirmity from leg fractures, confined to a wheelchair. She was no longer strong enough to speak at rallies.         Nonetheless, when Mr. de Klerk conducted a referendum in March, seeking approval to continue talks toward nonracial democracy, Mrs. Joseph appeared in public to tell supporters that she was voting for changes she had sought for more than four decades.
