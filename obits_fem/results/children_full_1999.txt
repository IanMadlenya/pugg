         Betty Bryant, who had such a satisfying childhood career in the backwaters of show business that she never bothered to try to top herself in the Broadway mainstream, died on Jan. 15 at her home in Park Ridge, Ill.         She was 76 and was recalled as the third generation of a family of showboat performers who brought corn  pone and culture to riverside mid-America.         If her life wasn't actually written by Edna Ferber or set to music by Jerome Kern, it was surely because Miss Bryant was only 4 when Ferber's novel ''Show Boat'' came out in 1926, two years before Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d translated it to the Broadway stage.         By then Miss Bryant was an experienced on-board performer, one who had made her acting debut at the age of 6 weeks, stoically (she didn't cry) portraying the slave girl Eliza's baby in the dash across the ice in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.''         If ever an actress was at home in the theater it was she.         The family showboat was both her home and her stage, and for 20 years, until World War II helped bring the showboat era to an end, she spent her springs, summers and falls going from town to town along the Ohio River and its tributaries, sometimes stopping for several weeks in bigger river cities like Pittsburgh or Cincinnati.         During the off-season, with the boat tied up in West Virginia, the family would visit New York or Chicago, sometimes staging variety acts, sometimes just taking in the theatrical sights.         With her mother as her tutor, Miss Bryant managed to get her high school diploma from a cooperating school that monitored her progress.         Based on Miss Bryant's 1994 book ''Here Comes the Showboat'' (University Press of Kentucky), hers was an idyllic life and one she was certainly born to.         To say that show business was in her blood would be something of an understatement. Her grandfather, Sam Bryant, a onetime gardener at Buckingham Palace, had no known theatrical inclinations until he fell in love with a young Gilbert and Sullivan actress named Violet Chapman, who had inclinations enough for both of them.         After the couple married and came to the United States in 1884, it didn't take many years of nagging before Lady Violet, as she preferred to be known, had persuaded her husband to seek thespian adventure, initially, as it turned out, in a horse-drawn traveling medicine show in which Dr. Sam, as he was known, would hawk a cure-all mixture of gasoline and red pepper on the first night in a town, then stage a tent show on the second.         The couple's children, Billy and Florence, were part of the dodge from the beginning and by the time the family graduated to vaudeville a few years later, they had become the Four Bryants.         A chance summer booking on a turn-of-the-century Mississippi River showboat gave them the river bug. Within a few years, Dr. Sam and Captain Billy, as his son was soon known, had acquired first the Princess and then, in 1918, Bryant's New Showboat.         By then, Captain Billy had married the floating troupe's piano and calliope player, Josephine Costello, who gave birth to Betty four years later.         From her start in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' Miss Bryant swiftly advanced to other roles and vaudeville turns, including impressions of George M. Cohan and Eddie Cantor.         As the only member of her generation among the now six Bryants (although Aunt Florence was increasingly an absentee actress), she played boys as often as girls, but regardless of the sex, she soon learned, her forlorn character was sure to die before the final curtain.         That's because the Bryant plays tended to be heavy, heart-rending  melodramas, which never failed to delight their small-town audiences.         Captain Billy did stage an abridged version of ''Hamlet'' once,  but after he got a look at the dazed audience on its way out, he quickly reverted to more familiar fare, replacing it with ''Ten Nights in a Barroom,'' a sure audience pleaser, partly, no doubt, because Miss Bryant died so convincingly.         By the time she graduated to grown-up roles, Miss Bryant had mastered the psychological subtleties of the showboat method of melodrama.         As she wrote in her book, ''A dependable leading lady must be able to run, duck, fall, get up, fall again, crawl over a bed and under a dresser, scream, swing by a rope, deliver an uppercut, struggle and kick and still have enough breath left to say, 'If this is aristocracy, thank God I'm a country girl.' ''         At 20 she married a fellow showboat actor, Jat Herod, a jazz violinist who joined the Army and was soon entertaining troops, as he and his wife continued to do after the war.         She is survived by two daughters, JoAleene Miranda of Des Plaines, Ill., and Mary Perry of Park Ridge, and three grandchildren.         After their divorce in 1962, Miss Bryant, who never tried to win acting jobs in New York or Hollywood, settled in Park Ridge, where she directed amateur theatrical productions and frequently gave lectures on what it was like to grow up on a showboat.       
         Sarah (Sadie) Delany, the last of the storied Delany sisters, died peacefully in her sleep at age 109 yesterday at her home in Mount Vernon, N.Y., spokesmen for her family said.         She was the oldest survivor of one of America's most remarkable families, the daughter of a man who had been born a slave, and the first colored woman -- the term she preferred -- ever permitted to teach home economics in white New York City schools.         Miss Delany and her younger sister, Dr. A. Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, were always celebrated in Harlem, where they lived and flourished from 1916 to 1957, after leaving their native Raleigh, N.C.         Dr. Delany, who received her doctorate in dental surgery from Columbia in 1923, was the second black woman licensed to practice dentistry in New York State. She had an office in Harlem and was known to thousands of people only as ''Dr. Bessie.'' She charged $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling and never raised her rates in 27 years of practice.         The sisters gained widespread fame after the publication in 1993 of a memoir they called ''Having Our Say; The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years.'' They wrote it with Amy Hill Hearth as an oral history from their early days in the Jim Crow South to their arrival in New York City during the Harlem Renaissance to their life in a white suburb.         The book, now part of curriculums at hundreds of colleges and high schools, was on the New York Times hardcover best-seller list for 28 weeks and on the paperback list for 77 weeks. They followed it in 1995  with ''The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom.''         In 1995, ''Having Our Say'' was adapted by Emily Mann into a Broadway play that was nominated for three Tony awards. The play followed the sisters in virtually nonstop conversation while they prepared an annual meal celebrating their father's birthday in the home they owned on a dead-end street in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         The sisters lived in that house from 1957 to 1995, and Miss Delany  remained there after Dr. Delany died in 1995 at 104. ''She is my right arm,'' Miss Delany had told an interviewer shortly before her sister's death. ''If she were to die first, I'm not sure I would want to go on living because the reason I am living is to keep her living.''         But Sadie, as her friends called her, kept going, just as the Delany sisters always had. Her last book, with Ms. Hearth, ''On My Own at 107: Reflections on a Life Without Bessie,'' appeared in May 1997.         The sisters liked to say that Dr. Bessie was the acerbic one, who was convinced it was her duty to tell people the truth, whether it concerned race relations or their molars. Sadie would say to her, ''Bessie, don't you realize that people don't want to hear the truth?''         If Dr. Bessie was the vinegar, then Miss Sadie was the molasses, with an uncommon talent for getting along  and for being as sweet as the candy she used to make for extra money as a young teacher.         The Delanys were a mix of hard-working African, white and American Indian stock, a family that was rich in everything but money, reserved, aristocratic and irrepressible even as they suffered through segregation.         Sadie Delany always thought of herself as a ''colored woman'' or, if one insisted on labels, a Negro. She never saw herself as black -- that did not describe her color, she used to say -- nor did she care for the term African-American.         Henry Beard Delany, their gentle, scholarly father, was born into slavery in 1858. The Delanys were house slaves of a St. Marys, Ga., family named Mock, who taught them to read and write. Henry Delany later attended St. Augustine's School in Raleigh and became the first Negro bishop of the Episcopal Church. He met his future wife, Nanny James Logan, at St. Augustine's. Sarah Louise Delany, their second child, was  born Sept. 19, 1889, at an aunt's home in Lynch's Station, Va. She grew up with two sisters and six brothers on  the campus of St. Augustine's, where their father was vice principal.         Happy though they might have been, the South around them was not. The former Confederate states were still reacting to the loss of the war nearly 50 years before. The sisters took different approaches to the Jim Crow laws passed across the south around 1914. In ''Having Our Say,'' Sadie Delany wrote:         ''I'll tell you how I handled white people. There was a shoe store in Raleigh called Heller's. The owner was a Jewish man, very nice. If you were colored, you had to go in the back to try on shoes, and white people sat in front. It wasn't Mr. Heller's fault; this was the Jim Crow law. I would go in there and say, 'Good morning, Mr. Heller, I would like to try on those shoes in the window.' And I would say, 'Where, Mr. Heller?' And he would gesture to the back and say, 'Back there.' And I would say, 'Back where?' Well, I'd just worry that man to death. Finally, he'd say, 'Just sit anywhere, Miss Delany!' And so I would sit myself down in the white section, and smile.         ''Now Bessie thinks that I shouldn't play dumb like that,'' she recalled. ''But I don't care. I got to sit in the white section.''         Sadie Delany liked to say that  when she got her master's degree in education from Columbia in 1925, a white teacher there observed, ''That Sarah Delany. You tell her to do something, she smiles at you, and then she just turns around and does what she wants anyway.''         In this, Miss Delany said, she was ''just like Papa.''         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1910. Her first job was working for the black school system in Wake County, N.C., teaching subjects like sanitation, how to can food and how to care for newborn infants.         Years later, she remembered her students: ''They looked up to me and I showed them it was possible to live a better life, despite what white people were trying to do to us.'' She proudly recalled driving Booker T. Washington around when he visited.         The Delany sisters first saw New York City in 1915, on a visit with their mother. Their father agreed to let them move to New York to attend college. Sadie Delany moved first, in  1916, and Bessie came along a year later. It was one of the rare times when the sisters were separated. Eventually, 9 of the 10 Delany children moved to New York, and all received college educations. Only Lemuel, the oldest, stayed in the South. The sisters are survived by 13 nieces and nephews.         At one point, Sadie, Bessie, Julia, Hubert and Lucius Delany lived together at 2505 Seventh Avenue and West 145th Street in Harlem, each paying a $9 share of the monthly rent. Their neighbors complained.         ''They thought we were running a fast house!'' the two sisters recalled.  ''We don't know why it didn't occur to them that we were brothers and sisters, except that they must have had unclear minds. So we had a little talk with the super and straightened out the whole mess.'' The Delanys had quite a few such talks over the years with people who did not understand them, and they always straightened out the mess.         While she was teaching at Public School 119, Sadie Delany found she could not support herself on the salary, so she started baking cakes and selling them for a nickel a slice to other teachers. She also made lemon and cinnamon lollipops, which she sold for a penny a piece.         People liked her cakes and candies so much that she rented a loft on 121st Street in the late 1920's and made homemade chocolate fondant, a soft, creamy affair. Called ''Delany's Delights,'' it was soon sold all over New York, including Abraham & Straus, at $2 a pound. She closed her business down after the 1929 stock market crash. ''People had no money for chocolate fondant, that's for sure,'' she said.         After years of teaching at predominantly black grade schools, Miss Delany wanted to teach high-school level domestic science, as home economics was then called. She had a master's from Columbia, after all. No Negro had ever done that before. She applied for a job, and received a letter from the Board of Education asking to meet her.         She knew that if the board members saw her, they would not hire her. So she skipped the appointment, sent a polite letter explaining there had been a ''mixup,'' and just showed up at the all-white Theodore Roosevelt High School on the first day of class.         ''They just about died when they saw me,'' she recalled. ''A colored woman!''         She kept the job and spent the rest of her career teaching at excellent high schools before retiring in 1960. Among them were Girls' High School in Brooklyn, Evander Childs High School in the Bronx and Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, where she taught adults at night.         It was lonely, she said. Some of her  fellow teachers, who were all white,  were friendly, she said, ''but you couldn't count on any of them being your real friend.''         She told Ms. Hearth: ''New York was no piece of cake for a colored person, but it was an improvement over the South, child. But don't go thinking I don't love the South. I was born there, and I expect to be buried there, right next to my Mama and Papa. Raleigh will always be home.''         ''Sadie is molasses without even trying,'' her sister once said. ''She can sweet-talk the world, or play dumb, or whatever it takes to get by without a fuss.'' ''         But sometimes the molasses could boil. The Board of Education once sent her what she called a ''nasty'' letter. She had lived for so long that the bean counters had become convinced that she must have died and that somebody else was cashing all those pension checks. She was furious, but as usual straightened it all out.         Toward the end of her life, Sadie Delany did not want anybody to think that she and her sister were just a couple of old women letting life slip by as they sat in their rocking chairs. ''Why, we don't even own a rocking chair,'' she said.         She said she woke up every morning at 6:30, smiled and said, ''Thank you, Lord, for another day.'' Then she would wake up Bessie, a late sleeper, who would open her eyes and say, ''Oh Lord, another day?''         Then they would prepare their food, consuming as many as seven different vegetables a day and lots of fresh fruit. They took vitamin supplements, boiled their water despite assurances that people could drink Mount Vernon water and live. They took up Yoga. They ate milk shakes for dinner, watched the nightly news on public television, said their prayers (extra ones for the people Bessie didn't like) and went to bed.         They believed that their simple lives and good food contributed to their longevity. Bessie said another reason was they ''never had husbands to worry us to death.''         But Sadie Delany said, ''Life is short, and it's up to you to make it sweet.''       
         Naomi Mitchison, author of more than 70 books, bohemian free thinker and feminist long before the term was coined, died on Monday at her home on the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland. She was 101.         The subjects and genres of her novels, biographies, poems, memoirs, short stories, political tracts, book reviews and magazine articles ranged over the successive enthusiasms of her life: ancient Greece, socialism, genetics, science fiction, space, fascism in Spain, home rule for Scotland and independence movements in Africa, where she became the honorary mother of a tribe in Botswana.         Her personal life drew as much attention as her work, from shocking contemporary convention in the 1920's by declaring her marriage an open one to her championing of birth control in the 1930's to her continual fights with publishers who insisted on removing explicit references to sex from her books.         A rebel against social restrictions on women from her youth, she had a tendency to lash out physically at men to prove her point, once throwing a half-plucked partridge at the Labor Party leader Hugh Gaitskill and on another occasion bopping a dinner guest over the head because he asked the woman seated next to him to fetch his dinner from the kitchen.         Married for 54 years and the mother of seven children, she was asked on her 90th birthday if she had any regrets. ''Yes,'' she said, ''all the men I never slept with. Imagine!''         Naomi Margaret Haldane was born in Edinburgh in 1897 and brought up in Oxford as a member of a privileged family that produced a number of patrician politicians and noted scientists.         Taught alternately at a private school in Oxford and at home by a governess, she had a precocious interest from earliest youth in being a more active participant in life than the conventions of an upper-class girl's upbringing in Britain allowed. She assisted a brother and the young Aldous Huxley as they performed experiments on guinea pigs on the lawn.         In 1916 she married Gilbert Richard (Dick) Mitchison, a lawyer who was a Labor member of Parliament from 1945 to 1964, when he joined the House of Lords. She never used the title she gained, Lady Mitchison, preferring to be known by her nickname, Nou.         She told friends that she was disappointed by her introduction to sex, complaining that it was ''so unlike Swinburne.'' In 1925 she and her husband both subscribed to the idea of an open marriage, in keeping with her statement that marriage amounted to ''domestic prostitution'' and ownership of women.         ''It must be fairly obvious to everyone who considers it that there is something profoundly wrong with the sexual life of people in general and particularly perhaps of married people,'' she said.         She wrote her first book in 1923, and her early writing met with critical success while causing scandal with its emphasis on subjects like rape, infanticide, lesbianism and abortion. In 1931 she became a literary force in Britain with the publication of ''The Corn King and the Spring Queen,'' a fantasy set in Scythia in 200 B.C. with a story based on an act of incest.         She wrote less effectively on socialism, an interest she developed from her husband's involvement in Fabian Society politics and her observation of the victims of the Depression. She remained an activist the rest of her life, running unsuccessfully for Parliament herself in 1935 and then serving on a number of boards and councils representing Highland and island communities in Scotland until her 90's, when she was, in her words, ''booted out on grounds of age.''         From the late 1930's she held forth at Carradale, her 300-acre farm on the Mull of Kintyre in Argyllshire, riveting diffuse collections of writers, Labor politicians, African visitors, academics, scientists, local fishermen and hunters, children and grandchildren. She was not distracted from writing by all the people in her drawing room, and she once said she felt most creative when pregnant. The title of a 1985 memoir was ''Among You Taking Notes.''         Her husband died in 1970; she is survived by three sons, two daughters, 19 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.         She was a commanding presence in her own salon, speaking with a mystical authority that her fellow author and friend, Elizabeth Longford, likened to ''what I imagine to be the kind of voice possessed by a Celtic prophetess reading the runes.''         At a British Council party in the early 1960's she befriended an African student who invited her to Botswana for his investiture as chief of the Bakgatla tribe. She was later named ''honorary mother'' of the tribe and traveled there often into her 90's.         Over the years she changed her hobby listing in Who's Who from ''keeping up with the family'' to ''surviving so far'' to ''burning rubbish.''         Her keen pursuit of new subjects continued into her last years. ''Dying is quite the most interesting thing that is going to happen to me now,''  she recently said. ''I often wake up in the night and wonder if it's starting. I would really like to take notes.''         Correction:  January 20, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary on Saturday about Naomi Mitchison, the British writer and early feminist, misspelled the surname of the Labor Party leader at whom she once threw a half-plucked partridge. He was Hugh Gaitskell, not Gaitskill.       
         Dr. Katherine Bain, a pediatrician who became a high-ranking and an outspoken Washington official concerned with the well-being of infants and children, died on Jan. 10 in a Washington nursing home she entered in October. She was 101 and had lived in Washington since 1940.         Dr. Bain's family said that she was the author or a co-author of reports that led to the development of child-proof safety caps for medicines and for chemicals in the home, safety-release standards for the doors of refrigerators in order to keep children from being trapped and suffocated, and some of the first Federal guidelines for the nutrition of children.         Her family said that she had carried out a pioneering survey of breast-feeding practices in American hospitals' nurseries and that her findings had led to changes in doctors' opinions of nursing.         In 1940, she joined the Children's Bureau, an agency that was then part of the Department of Labor and is now part of the Department of Health and Human Services. She was the bureau's deputy chief from 1958 to 1964 and became assistant to the director of the Public Health Service in a reorganization in 1969. She devoted herself to children's welfare issues in foreign countries for the next four years and retired.         In a report in The Journal of Pediatrics in 1954, Dr. Bain presented statistics that pointed up the carelessness of American families in protecting children in the home.         Analyzing data supplied by the National Office of Vital Statistics, she said that 400 children under the age of 5 died each year in the United States from accidental poisoning. That rate was four times the rate reported for England and Wales.         Two-thirds of the deaths from accidental poisoning could be prevented, Dr. Bain said, if aspirin, barbiturates, kerosene, lye, lead and arsenic compounds were kept out of the hands of small children.         In a report issued in 1944, Dr. Bain said that World War II had intensified the need for regular advice to mothers on how to keep their babies well. ''We have a bumper crop of babies,'' she said. ''Nearly three million will be born in the United States this year. At the same time we have a shortage of doctors and nurses for the civilian population. About 50 percent of our younger practicing physicians have gone into the armed forces.'' Dr. Bain said the United States would have to work hard and fast to increase its number of clinics aimed at keeping babies well.         After the war, she bemoaned disparities in medical care available in different parts of the United States. Speaking to 500 child health and welfare experts in 1948 in Chicago, she said that a survey had found ''that 1,000 children in Illinois have on an average day twice as much medical care as 1,000 children in Alabama.''         ''One can only conclude,'' Dr. Bain added, ''that children in Alabama are receiving at the most only one-half as much care as they need.''         The honors Dr. Bain received included an award in 1960 from the New York Infirmary for work she had done in pediatrics and public health.         Dr. Bain was born in St. Louis, received a bachelor's degree in 1920 from the University of Missouri and her medical degree in 1925 from Washington University in St. Louis. She spent 13 years in private pediatric practice in St. Louis before going to Washington.         She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Frances Godowsky, a prolific painter and sometime singer better known as George and Ira's little sister, Frankie Gershwin, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 and the last of the Gershwin siblings.         In a family where talent abounded, Mrs. Godowsky and her slightly older brother, Arthur, inherited their share of the Gershwin genes, but when one older brother is one of the century's most acclaimed composers and another is among its most lionized lyricists, it is hard to measure up.         Not that Mrs. Godowsky didn't have her moments. An accomplished dancer who toured at 11 in a children's musical, ''Daintyland,'' she never let George and Ira forget that when they were grateful for $15 paychecks from Tin Pan Alley, she was the family's first big breadwinner -- never mind that most of her $40 weekly salary went to pay expenses.         Born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan on Dec. 26, 1906, 10 years to the day after her oldest brother, Ira, Mrs. Godowsky had a peripatetic childhood as her father, Morris, a man with an eclectic personnel file, repeatedly moved the family to be near his latest job. (Ira once calculated that between 1900 and 1917 the family lived in 28 apartments, 25 in Manhattan and 3 in Brooklyn.)         Although she sang in a couple of Broadway shows in the late 1920's, by the time the family moved into the house on West 103d Street made famous in the 1945 biographical movie, ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' Mrs. Godowsky seemed resigned to tailoring her career to her older brothers'.         Frequently summoned to George's lair on the fifth floor, she was often the first to sing Gershwin songs that would later be Broadway hits, and when George was in rehearsal for ''Lady Be Good,'' brother and sister would try out steps he had learned from the show's star, Fred Astaire.         Although her husky voice was small by stage standards of the day, George, who loved her interpretations of his sometimes complicated music, particularly the way she kept the rhythm going, made her his personal chanteuse, and the two entertained at countless flapper-era parties in New York and elsewhere.         In time, Mrs. Godowsky was glad enough to accept the benefits of being his beloved little sister.         In one episode in early 1928, Mrs. Godowsky, who was dating a boring doctor at the time, begged George to let her tag along on a European trip he and Ira were planning.         By the time she returned six months later, Mrs. Godowsky had so wowed Cole Porter at a party Elsa Maxwell gave in Paris that he designed a show for her at the storied nightclub Les Ambassadeurs, where she sang Gershwin tunes with George as her accompanist.         The limited engagement drew her a flood of professional offers, but George insisted she return with the rest of the party.         By then she had fallen in love with one of George's poker cronies, Leopold Godowsky Jr., the son of the celebrated Austrian pianist.         They married in 1930 and settled in Rochester, N.Y., where Mr. Godowsky helped invent Kodachrome, the acclaimed slide film.         Mrs. Godowsky, who had been her brother George's tryout singer, played a similar role for her husband, posing in bright red beret and bottle-green dress as a photographic test subject.         Soon after George's death in 1937, the couple moved to Westport, Conn.,  where Mrs. Godowsky, who had begun sculpturing in Rochester, hit her own artistic stride. She took up painting and turned out hundreds of well-received oils and acrylics.         The success of her painting helped soften the blow when the movie ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' came out in 1945 and excised her and Arthur from the Gershwin family. Arthur died in 1981.         Although painting remained her main artistic outlet, in her later years Mrs. Godowsky re-emerged as a singer. Her 1975 album, ''Frances Sings for George and Ira,'' won wide acclaim, and after a granddaughter suggested she get vocal training, she began a long-deferred professional career, singing Gershwin tunes at the Lambs Club and elsewhere until two years ago.         Mrs. Godowsky, whose husband and brother Ira both died in 1983, is survived by a son, Leopold 3d, of Manhattan; three daughters, Alexis Gershwin of Beverly Hills, Calif.; Georgia Keidan of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Nadia Natali of Ojai, Calif., and eight grandchildren.         Correction:  January 27, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary last Wednesday about Frances Gershwin Godowsky, an artist and the sister of George Gershwin, misstated the nationality of her father-in-law, the pianist Leopold Godowsky. He was born outside Vilna, in an area that once belonged to Poland but was then part of Russia and is now in Lithuania; he was not Austrian.       
         Dr. Judith Silberpfennig Kestenberg, a psychoanalyst specializing in child development and the emotional state of Holocaust survivors and their children, died Saturday at her home in Sands Point, N.Y. She was 88.         Dr. Kestenberg headed Child Development Research, which she founded 30 years ago, and Holocaust Child Survivor Studies, both based in Sands Point. With her husband, Milton, she started the research center's International Study of the Organized Persecution of Children.         She and her associates traveled all over the world to collect taped interviews with more than 1,500 child survivors of the Holocaust and their children, as well as the children of Nazis. Fluent in French, German and Polish, she wrote two German books used to teach German children about the Holocaust.         Judith Silberpfennig was born in Tarnov, Poland, and trained in medicine, neurology and psychiatry in Vienna. She came to New York in 1937 and completed her training at Bellevue Hospital and the New York Psychological Institute.         Her husband was born in Lodz, Poland, and became a lawyer there before coming to the United States in 1939. He managed real estate in New York and, after World War II, sued in German courts to seek compensation for Holocaust victims and also organized aid for their children.         They were married in the mid-1940's and became a team in their Holocaust pursuits when he started representing the victims, especially children, before the courts and found that many of them had only vague memories of their ordeals.         Dr. Kestenberg, a professor emeritus at New York University Medical School, taught generations of psychiatrists, psychologists, psychoanalysts and other experts on development, mental health and dance-movement therapy. She also was on the staff and faculty at Long Island Jewish Hospital.         She published seven books and some 150 professional articles. Most recently she edited, with Dr. Charlotte Kahn, ''Children Surviving Persecution: An International Study of Trauma and Healing'' (Greenwood, 1998).         Her other books in print include ''Sexuality, Body Movement and the Rhythms of Development'' (Aronson, 1995); with Dr. Ira Brenner, ''The Last Witness: The Child Survivor of the Holocaust'' (American Psychiatric Press, 1996), and, as editor with Dr. Eva Fogelman, ''Children During the Nazi Reign: Psychological Perspective on the Interview Process'' (Greenwood, 1994).         Milton Kestenberg died in 1991. Dr. Kestenberg is survived by a son, Howard, of Foxborough, Mass.; a daughter, Janet Kestenberg of West Chester, Pa., and four grandchildren.         Her work at Child Development Research is being continued by Dr. Fogelman and associates.       
         Mirra Komarovsky, a sociologist who was an innovative authority on gender, family and education, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 93.         Professor Komarovsky retired in 1970 after 32 years on the faculty of Barnard College. But she returned to Barnard in 1978 and became the chairwoman of its women's studies program for a time.         She was an advocate for women who has been credited with having initiated the contemporary analysis of gender roles with her book ''Women in the Modern World: Their Education and Their Dilemmas'' (1953, Irvington).         In that work she wrote that by making the purposes of women's education clearer, barriers to the attainment of a good life could be removed. As to the respective merits of training for a career and of education meant only for a homemaker, she wrote: ''To disagree with the antifeminist does not necessarily make one a feminist. We can reject the antifeminist program without having to embrace the old-fashioned feminism with its militant hostility towards, and its disparagement of, the homemaker.''         In 1991, Ellen V. Futter, who was Barnard's president at the time, said Professor Komarovsky's ''research has been crucial to our understanding of today's women and the choices they make.''         In that year Professor Komarovsky received the Distinguished Career Award of the American Sociological Association. Earlier, in 1973 and 1974, she was the second female president of the association, which was founded in 1905.         In her book ''Women in College: Shaping New Feminine Identities'' (1985) she described changing views of work, family and men that were held by students in the class of 1983 at Barnard, a women's college.         Reviewing that book in The New York Times Book Review, Adele Simmons, then president of Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., wrote: ''The impact of the women's movement on higher education becomes apparent to even the most skeptical reader.'' She noted that Professor Komarovsky observed bleakly that, as Dr. Simmons put it, ''while attitudes have changed, institutions have not. The gains of the last decade, she warns, will only be secure when society develops permanent measures to support women in the workplace as well as in the home.''         In researching the book, Professor Komarovsky used interviews, questionnaires and surveys to study the attitudes of more than 200 students in the Barnard class of 1983. Fully two-thirds of those young women were afflicted with what she called ''culture shock'' that differed from student to student. As Dr. Simmons put it, ''Ideas about virginity, femininity, sexual preferences and study habits all came under scrutiny as students' friendships evolved and intellectual challenges arose.''         Professor Komarovsky found that 76 percent of the female students planned, at the time they entered Barnard, on combining career, marriage and children in the coming years. And by the time the class graduated, fully 85 percent of its members had come to have that threefold ambition.         Two observations of Professors Komarovsky's that Dr. Simmons found intriguing were her finding that the most highly career-minded students had mothers who had not worked and regretted it -- or mothers who worked and enjoyed it; and her suggestion that the young women sought a mixture of sensitivity, self-awareness and masculinity in men.         Professor Komarovsky also found that most of the women she surveyed found it hard to attain relationships that they considered satisfactory with men, although those women had had chances to interact with men from a variety of backgrounds.         Rather similarly, Professor Komarovsky wrote, on the New York Times Op-Ed page in 1981: ''Young women are becoming aware that the call to equal opportunities for women outside the home is an empty slogan as long as the society insists on traditional role segregation within the family. Some women react to this discovery with equanimity, others with frustration, resignation or indignation. But the real touchstone of their aspirations is the longing for a society in which the rhetoric of equality will be realized as fact. There is no denying that this would require major institutional changes.''         What to do? ''We have much to learn from Sweden,'' Professor Komarovsky wrote: ''Modified work patterns for both sexes, housing patterns permitting more-cooperative ties among child-rearing families, accessible child-care centers of high quality for all economic classes.''         Over the years, she also wrote about various aspects of sociology, including theory and methodology.         She was born in Baku, on the Caspian Sea, in what was then Russia, to Mendel Komarovsky and the former Anna Steinberg, and she was raised largely in Baku. When she was 17, she and her family emigrated to the United States. She attended a high school for a year in Wichita, Kan., where some members of her family lived, and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in 1926 from Barnard, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was taught by the anthropologists Ruth Benedict and Franz Boas.         Nonetheless, as the book ''Women in Sociology'' (1991, Greenwood), edited by Mary Jo Deegan, reports: ''Komarovsky was puzzled'' by Barnard's ''extolling intellectual excellence while discouraging women from pursuing careers.''         She received a master's degree in 1927 and a doctorate in 1940, both in sociology, and both from Columbia. Her doctoral thesis was published as a book, ''The Unemployed Man and His Family'' (1940).         Earlier, she was a co-author of the book ''Leisure: A Suburban Study'' (1934). In addition, before joining the Barnard faculty as an instructor in 1938, she taught at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and was a research assistant at the Yale University Institute of Human Relations, at Columbia, and at the International Institute of Social Research in New York.         She was chairman of the sociology department at Barnard from 1949 to 1968 and was president of the Eastern Sociological Society in 1955 and 1956.         But she recalled years later that in the 1940's and even later, choosing women's issues to do research on was at a cost to her. The field lacked academic glamor and was not likely to further a career.         An early marriage, in 1926, ended in divorce in 1928. In 1940, she married Marcus A. Heyman, who died in 1970.         Her survivors include a sister, Dolly Cheser of Rockville Centre, L.I., and five nieces and one nephew.       
         Dr. Jan Hawkins, a pioneer in the use of computers and other technology in education, died Feb. 9 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 47 and lived in Cambridge, Mass., and on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Before joining the education faculty at Harvard University in September, Dr. Hawkins established her reputation through her work as director of the Center for Children and Technology, an agency founded in 1981 by the Bank Street College of Education in New York. Dr. Hawkins joined the group that year, long before computers had become an integral part of education.         ''She worked to find the mutual fit needed so technology could work in an educational setting,'' said Dr. Howard Gardner, a colleague of Dr. Hawkins's at Harvard. Dr. Hawkins was often called upon for help and advice by school districts, museums and other educational institutions looking for ways to integrate computers into their programs.         In her first studies during the early 1980's, she showed that children, especially girls, used computers in sociable and collaborative ways, not in isolation as critics had feared, said Dr. Margaret Honey, a longtime colleague of Dr. Hawkins's at the center.         In 1994, the Center for Children and Technology became a division of the Education Development Center, based in Newton, Mass. Dr. Hawkins became a vice president of that association, which, like the Center for Children and Technology, is a nonprofit research and development group financed by grants and contracts with foundations and government institutions.         Jan Hawkins was born in New Canaan, Conn., and received her bachelor's degree in psychology and English from Tufts University in 1973. She received a master's degree in psychology and a doctorate in developmental psychology from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in 1987.         She belonged to numerous boards and advisory groups in her field. She was an editor of professional journals and at Cambridge University Press, dealing with its ''Learning by Doing'' series.         Dr. Hawkins is survived by her parents, John and Francette Hawkins of Mountain View, Calif.; two sisters, Kim Hawkins of Cleveland and Cynthia Rahilly of Manhattan; a brother, John Hawkins of Virginia Beach, Va., and her fiance, Prof. Rand Spiro of East Lansing, Mich.       
         Gertrude B. Elion, a pioneer in drug research who shared a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988, died on Sunday in Chapel Hill, N.C., where she lived. She was 81.         Ms. Elion developed drugs for use in a vast array of conditions. They included drugs for herpes, leukemia, malaria, gout, immune disorders, and AIDS, and immune suppressants to overcome rejection of donated organs in transplant surgery. In perfecting one compound after another, Ms. Elion worked for four decades with Dr. George H. Hitchings, who died a year ago.         Ms. Elion broke down sex barriers in the male-dominated world of scientific research, becoming one of the rare women to win a Nobel Prize and, even rarer, a scientist who did not have a doctorate.         Ms. Elion shared the Prize with Dr. Hitchings, who hired her as a $50-a-week assistant in 1944. Also sharing the Prize was Sir James Black of Britain, who discovered two classes of drugs, beta blockers, for high blood pressure and heart disease, and H-2 antagonists, for ulcers.         Seldom does the Nobel committee in Stockholm honor employees of pharmaceutical companies, but all three that year worked or had worked for such a company. Ms. Elion and Dr. Hitchings collaborated throughout their careers at the company known today as Glaxo Wellcome. In awarding the Prize to the three scientists, the Nobel committee said their work ''had a more fundamental significance than their discovery of individual drugs.''         Ms. Elion was noted for her precise work, intellectual brilliance and ability to work with others.         Few scientists matched the wide array of drugs that Ms. Elion and Dr. Hitchings developed. The drugs include acyclovir (Zovirax) for herpes; azathioprine (Imuran) to help prevent rejection of transplanted organs and in treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis; allopurinol (Zyloprim) for gout; pyrimethamine (Daraprim) for malaria and trimethoprim (a component of Septra) for bacterial infections.         The two worked in lock step for much of their careers, but Dr. Hitchings was always one step ahead of Ms. Elion; as he moved into a new job, she filled the old one.         The two scientists wrote many papers together, sometimes with her name first, sometimes his. As Ms. Elion said, ''He had two arms of research and I was one of them.''         In 1991, President George Bush awarded Ms. Elion a National Medal of Science, saying her work had ''transformed the world.''         Gertrude Belle Elion was born in New York City on Jan. 23, 1918, and graduated with highest honors in chemistry from Hunter College in 1937. Ms. Elion decided to go into medical research as a teen-ager after her grandfather died of cancer and her father, a dentist and Lithuanian immigrant, encouraged her to develop a career. Her mother was from Russia.         But unable to find a laboratory position because she was a woman, Ms. Elion took a succession of jobs. First, she worked as a laboratory assistant in biochemistry. Then she worked as a food analyst, checking the acidity of pickles and making sure the berries slated for jam were not moldy. Next, she taught chemistry and physics in the New York City school system before earning a master's degree in chemistry at New York University in 1941.         After working for Johnson & Johnson for two years, Ms. Elion, helped by labor shortages in World War II, joined what was then Wellcome Research Laboratories, in Tuckahoe, N.Y., as a biochemist. Ms. Elion later became head of the company's experimental therapy department.         She retired in 1983, but continued working, helping to oversee work on the development of AZT as the first drug against H.I.V., the AIDS virus. Ms. Elion also served on the faculty of Duke University and the University of North Carolina.         While working for the drug company, Ms. Elion felt that her lack of a doctorate was a disadvantage, so she began a Ph.D. program at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. She took courses at night, commuting an hour and a half each way. But she eventually had to quit because she was told she would have to attend school full time to get a Ph.D., and she could not afford to give up her job.         When she gave her first scientific paper at a major meeting, she said she got into an argument with a distinguished scientist and stood her ground because ''I knew I was right.''         Ms. Elion never married. She was once engaged, but her fiance died of a heart infection. Ms. Elion said she would not have advanced in her career if she had chosen to marry and have children because women were not encouraged then to work while their children were young.       
         Bessie Cohen, who as a 19-year-old seamstress escaped the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. She was 107 and was one of the last two known survivors of the Manhattan fire, according to the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees.         Her son, Jack Kosslyn, an acting teacher and casting director, said she died at the Jewish Home for the Aging in Los Angeles, where she had lived for the last 14 years. Until six weeks ago, he said, she had retained much of her vitality and memory.         Over the years, she had graphically recalled for her family, as well as for historians and documentary filmmakers, what she experienced and witnessed on March 25, 1911, when the worst factory fire in New York history raged through the top three floors of the 10-story Asch Building on the northwest corner of Washington Place and Greene Streets. Inside, about 500 women, mostly Jewish and Italian immigrants, worked behind locked doors making shirtwaists. Shirtwaists were blouses of lightweight fabric, depicted as the uniform of modern womanhood in the illustrations of Charles Dana Gibson.         It was a Saturday afternoon, and Mrs. Cohen, then still Bessie Gabrilowich, was on the ninth floor. She had come alone from Russia to New York two years earlier and had worked in several shops as a stitcher, saving money to bring her sisters to America. The workers were near the end of their 6-day, 52-hour workweek, and since one of the women on the ninth floor had just become engaged, someone had brought a cake, and slices were being passed around.         For the rest of her life, Bessie Cohen would remember that earlier in the day, she had urged her friend, Dora Abramowitz, who was 15, to ask the foreman to give her a 50-cent raise to bring her salary up to the $3 a week that Bessie was earning. At the moment that someone screamed fire, Bessie was teaching a dance step to a fellow worker. The flames were coming up from the cutting room on the floor below.         Within the next 15 minutes, nearly 30 percent of all the Triangle Shirtwaist workers were killed. Mrs. Cohen would later tell her children that after the warning, she went to look for the cheap straw hat she had bought the day before, when she heard a foreman shout to her in Yiddish, ''Bessie, save yourself.'' She looked across the room and could see her friend Dora, looking frightened. But when she looked again, Dora was gone. She was one of those who jumped from the windows and died.         The fire trucks' ladders could reach only to the seventh floor. Firefighters held nets below, but so many women were jumping at the same time that the nets tore and did not hold them. Some rushed to the elevator shaft, hoping to escape by sliding down the cables, only to lose their grip. Most of those who lost their lives had worked on the ninth floor.         Later inquiries found that doors leading from the shop areas had been locked, presumably to keep the women at their sewing machines. The owners, who were tried for manslaughter, were acquitted when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were locked. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families.         On the day of the fire, Mrs. Cohen would recall, she somehow found her way to a staircase and covered her face with her purse as she ran to the street.         The next day, she returned to the street outside the building, where the bodies were arrayed so that friends and relatives might identify them. A newspaper photographer took a picture of her as she collapsed at the sight; Mr. Kosslyn said his mother kept that newspaper picture throughout her life.         She took other jobs, he said, and became active in the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, whose organizing efforts gained momentum after the fire. Two years before the blaze, a three-month strike of about 20,000 shirtwaist workers in New York City and Philadelphia had helped to entrench the union and had focused public attention on conditions in sweatshops. The needletrades union is a successor to the International Ladies Garment Workers.         At least one survivor of the fire is still living, according to The Associated Press. Rose Freedman, 105, of Beverly Hills, Calif., escaped by fleeing to the roof, her family said.         The Triangle Shirtwaist fire has become the most vivid symbol of the struggle for workplace safety. As outrage mounted after the fire, the union intensified its demands for safer working conditions. A huge crowd of sympathizers, Mrs. Cohen among them, paraded in mourning to the arch in Washington Square Park. Hearings were held, and by the end of 1911, the city of New York had established a Bureau of Fire Investigation, headed by the future Senator, Robert F. Wagner, who was later the father of the Wagner Labor Act. The bureau had the power to impose and enforce safety regulations.         The Asch Building, its interior long since gutted and rebuilt, became a part of New York University and still stands.         In 1915, Bessie married and moved with her husband, Lewis Cohen, to New London, Conn., where her son and daughter were born. For many years after the fire, her son said, she would react fearfully to thunder and lightning, burying her head in her arms and sobbing.         The family moved to Passaic, N.J., and then to New York. In 1940, after her marriage ended, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son was living. Mrs. Cohen, an independent woman, lived on her own until she was 93 in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, staying on after most of the Jewish residents had left.         When she was 89, she was mugged and had her jaw fractured by two men who took her purse, which contained a bus pass and 60 cents.         After two weeks, she returned to her home and neighbors, sipping liquids through her wired jaw for months. When she finally did leave for the nursing home, about 200 of her neighbors, almost all of them Hispanic, saluted her with a festive street party.         She is survived by her son, Jack, of Los Angeles, and a daughter, Sylvia Scott of Calistoga, Calif. A grandson, Jan Tangen, died last year.       
         Virginia Foster Durr, a well-born civil rights campaigner who was on hand when Rosa Parks was bailed out of jail where she was being held for not giving up her seat on a bus to a white man in 1955, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Carlisle, Pa. She was 95.         Mrs. Durr and her husband, Clifford, a lawyer, were New Deal veterans who were in the thick of the civil rights movement in their native Alabama in the 1950's and 1960's.         President Clinton said, in a statement: ''A white woman, born to privilege in the Deep South, Mrs. Durr refused to turn a blind eye to racism and intolerance in our society. Her courage and steely conviction in the earliest days of the civil rights movement helped to change this nation forever.''         In 1955 Mrs. Durr and her husband helped a black civil rights leader, E. D. Nixon, bail Mrs. Parks, a black seamstress active in the N.A.A.C.P., out of jail in Montgomery, Ala., said Dr. Patricia Sullivan, a historian and fellow at the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute of Afro-American Research at Harvard University.         Mrs. Parks's action touched off the Montgomery bus boycott by blacks, which helped spur the civil rights movement and brought the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to prominence.         Mrs. Parks said in a letter to the Durr family: ''I will miss you, old soldier, but the rich legacy you have passed to your children, grandchildren and great-grands lives on. We still have a long ways to go, but you, my friend, have made it easier for all of us.''         A native of Birmingham, Ala., Virginia Foster was reared there in the traditions of the Old South. She was a debutante, was prominent in the local Junior League and attended Wellesley College.         She moved to Washington in the 1930's, when Mr. Durr was on the staff of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. In the Washington of the 1930's, many New Deal Young Turks clustered around the couple. Her personal liberalism found expression in those years, and she was a founding member of the interracial Southern Conference for Human Welfare, which opposed segregation.         Mrs. Durr also helped Eleanor Roosevelt generate support for legislation to end the poll tax, which helped prevent many Southerners from voting. In 1948 she was an unsuccessful candidate of Henry A. Wallace's Progressive Party for the Senate from Virginia.         Three years later the Durrs moved to Montgomery, where they supported the bus boycott and other civil rights activities. In 1954 she was summoned before the Senate's Internal Security Subcommittee after being accused of harboring Communist sympathies. She testified that she did not belong to the Communist Party and had not attended any party meetings.         As Rosellen Brown, a novelist, has put it, ''While the majority of Alabamians considered Virginia and Clifford Durr traitors, not heroes, they represented to many of us the best of the white South, its native strength: they were sensible, outspoken, committed and only accidentally heroic.''         Mrs. Durr won applause for her autobiography, ''Outside the Magic Circle'' (University of Alabama, 1985)'' edited by Hollinger F. Barnard. Dr. Sullivan is also editing a  book of Mrs. Durr's letters.         The Durrs were married in 1926. Mr. Durr died in 1975.         Mrs. Durr is survived by four daughters, Ann Durr Lyon of Harrisburg, Pa., Lucy Durr Hackney of Philadelphia, Virginia Foster Durr of Sweden, Me., and Lulah Durr Colan of Milwaukee; 11 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothea Zack Hanle, a longtime editor at Bon Appetit, a cookbook writer and one of the founders of Les Dames d'Escoffier, an international women's organization that promotes fine dining and wine, died Tuesday at the home of her son, Alan, in North Brunswick, N.J. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan and Ship Bottom, N.J.         Ms. Hanle was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Ship Bottom, where her father, Richard A. Zachariae, was a real estate agent. Throughout her life, she was called Zack.         After attending Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., and Barnard College, she was hired by Mademoiselle, where she wrote on a wide range of subjects. Dell Publishing took note of her flair for dispensing useful advice and hired her as editor in chief of its special-projects division. At Dell, she wrote and edited more than 65 pocket-size how-to handbooks, and in 1964, under the name Dorothea Zack Hanle, wrote the book ''The Hairdo Handbook: A Complete Guide to Hair Beauty.''         In 1972, CBS Publications wooed her to edit a new publication, Epicure, but she remained at Dell, editing the first issue of Epicure under the pen name Carter Chase. She then left Dell and edited Epicure for two years under her own name, and later edited another CBS magazine, Everywoman's, which competed with Family Circle.         In 1976 she joined the staff of Bon Appetit, where she created several columns and features, including  ''The Bon Vivant,'' ''Entertaining With . . .'' and ''Profiles in Cooking.'' According to Tanya W. Steel, a senior editor for the magazine, her byline appeared more often than that of any other writer.         She was Bon Appetit's New York editor until 1990, when she was named an editor at large. From 1997 until her death she was a consultant to the magazine.         Her books include ''The Surfer's Handbook'' (1968), ''Cooking With Flowers'' (1971) and ''Cooking Wild Game'' (1974). With Martin Herz, she wrote a children's cookbook, ''The Golden Ladle'' (1945). She also wrote books on gardening, diet and exercise.         In 1990, Ms. Hanle was honored by the James Beard Foundation at its first annual Editor's Dinner.         She is survived by her son; a daughter, Jennifer Malahowski of Austin, Tex., and three grandchildren.       
         DEBBIE BOYLAN is a dinosaur and proud of it, the owner of an independent bookstore in Westchester County who is not persuaded that she wants to go head-to-head with Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com.         Her customers at Good Yarns in Hastings-on-Hudson are more than happy to bring their own coffee, a plain cuppa joe for 60 cents from the bagel place next door, rather than take out a loan for a double latte at the nearest superstore.         And they'd prefer to drop in for an hour of good conversation rather than order a book with the click of a mouse. Internet shopping may be  efficient, but it's not a way of finding out whose daffodils have popped and whose children have gotten into college.         Good Yarns, by all accounts, is a dying breed, a hole-in-the-wall in an era of megamalls, a brick-and-mortar business in the age of on-line commerce. It is one of 3,300 independent book stores, according to the American Booksellers Association, down from 5,200 in 1992.         In response to the threat of extinction, the trade group has hired a marketing heavyweight, begun a national advertising campaign to encourage people to shop small and created its own on-line store, scheduled to open this summer.         Ms. Boylan and her co-owner, Rowie Edelman, plan to read the prospectus on the joint venture, which Michael F. Hoynes, the association's new marketing director, says is ''like True Value Hardware,'' a way for the little guys to ''come together but keep their identity.'' But the owners of Good Yarns are skeptical.         ''I don't see us expanding on the Internet,'' Ms. Boylan said. ''We have a finite and loyal customer base. They want to touch books, look at books, talk about books.''         Good Yarns was abuzz with gardening chatter earlier this week, when 60 degree temperatures had snow dripping from eaves all over town, the current rushing in the Saw Mill River and doors open along Main Street. A landscape architect from Irvington came in for Faulkner's ''As I Lay Dying.'' She stayed to commiserate with Ginny Auld, a saleswoman, who was mourning a dead butterfly weed, whose orange blooms had brightened her yard for 19 years.         A former Hastings resident who now lives across the river in Nyack stopped in after her weekly Jewish history class at the temple. She left with ''A Boy's Life,'' by Tobias Wolfe and ''The Story of Little Babaji,'' a version of ''Little Black Sambo'' that restores much of the original 1899 text. But not before a lengthy discourse on roses.         THE hot book on this balmy day was a well-reviewed first novel, ''Amy and Isabelle,'' by Elizabeth Strout. Ms. Boylan had ordered two copies for regular customers from the nearby river towns who were willing to wait a few days rather than shop in one of several Barnes & Nobles on Central Avenue, the dreary commercial spine of the county. Both costumers rushed in as soon as they got the telephone call. ''I have it on order, too,'' Ms. Boylan said. Disappointment crossed her face. She could not ''borrow'' a copy for the early morning hours when she does most of her reading.         Ms. Boylan grew up just blocks from the store, graduated from Hastings High School and Mercy College in neighboring Dobbs Ferry. She went to school with half the merchants in the village, and her 53-year-old sister, Donna, with the other half. The women own a two-family house and share responsibility for their elderly father, who is blind. Reading time is scarce with the demands of an aging parent and a seven-day-a-week business. Ms. Boylan pines for the expansive days of childhood, when she would read ''Black Beauty'' over and over. At 12, she discovered ''Franny and Zooey,'' was ''knocked of my feet'' and ''never read another kids' book again.''         Now, binge reading is possible only  on vacation. During a recent week in Florida, she raced through three novels and found herself bookless at the airport. It was one of the few times in her life, Ms. Boylan said, that she has bought a book someplace other than at Good Yarns.         The store was once a needlepoint shop. But times changed, wives and mothers went to work, and the wool and crochet hooks gave way to novels and biographies. Ms. Boylan was a customer back then, buying books -- mainly 20th century American fiction -- to read on the train to Manhattan, where she worked as an editor. Later, with her sister, she owned a graphic design business. With the advent of desktop publishing, her business became obsolete and Ms. Boylan took part-time work at Good Yarns while she looked for something to do. That turned out to be buying a share of the store when Ms. Edelman's partner retired.         The two women seem quaintly oblivious to issues like foot traffic. ''I'm trying to envision a busy day, '' Ms. Boylan said. ''Fifty customers? A hundred? I'm guessing. But a good day is anything over $1,000.''         And what sells well in a village of 8,000 that supports four bookstores (one second-hand, one for foreign language books and one for first editions)? Hardcover nonfiction. Paperback fiction. Local authors. Whatever Ms. Boylan recommends -- lately Alice McDermott's ''Charming Billy'' or Don DeLillo's ''Underworld.''         ''Low-end political scandal and movie star books don't go here,'' she said. ''We've only sold two Monicas. If we sold three I'd be surprised.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Elizabeth Huckaby, who as a vice principal shepherded nine black students through the tumultuous integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957, died on March 18 in Little Rock.         Mrs. Huckaby, whose memoir, ''Crisis at Central High,'' inspired a 1981 television movie recounting the landmark civil rights confrontation, was 93.         In September 1957, Mrs. Huckaby was about to enter her 28th year at Central High. A native of Hamburg, Ark., the daughter of a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of the University of Arkansas, she was accustomed to the ways of the South. As she remembered it, ''I had never known any black well, except those in household employ.''         Soon, she would be trying to shield the first black students at Central High from intimidation by white students.         As an outgrowth of the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision, the Little Rock school board admitted nine blacks to Central High for the 1957-58 school year. But Gov. Orval E. Faubus called out the National Guard to prevent their entry. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock and placed the Arkansas guardsmen under Federal control to insure the black students' admission in the face of mob action.         On one occasion, 50 boys gathered atop the stairs at the school's entrance when no troops were in sight and shouted racial epithets at the blacks as they approached.         Melba Pattillo Beals, in her memoir, ''Warriors Don't Cry'' (Pocket Books, 1994), recalled what happened as she and other black students were about to retreat:         ''Vice Principal Huckaby made her presence known at the bottom of the stairs. Tiny, erect, and determined, she stood there all alone between us and our attackers, demanding they leave us alone. One by one she challenged the leaders, calling them by name, telling them to get to class or there would be hell to pay. Whether or not she favored integration, she had a heck of a lot of guts.''         The best-remembered image of the Little Rock events is a photograph showing a white girl, her face contorted in rage, screaming at Elizabeth Eckford, a black girl entering the school.         Mrs. Huckaby, the vice principal for girls and an English teacher, took the white student to her office.         ''I told her, hatred destroys the people who hate,'' Mrs. Huckaby recalled. ''She shrugged. Well, that was the way she felt, she said. Wasted breath.''         Mrs. Huckaby later persuaded Miss Eckford to remain in school after she came to her office in tears over continuing harassment.         The tensions took their toll on Mrs. Huckaby, who testified at a June 1958 court hearing: ''I would lie awake at night wondering what I could do. I had no social life at all because on weekends I was too tired. I would go out to the country and just sit.''         Eight of the nine black students remained through the school year, and at commencement ceremonies on May 27, 1958, Ernest Green became the first black graduate of Central High. Mrs. Huckaby stayed at the school until retiring in 1969. ''Crisis at Central High'' (Louisiana State University Press, 1980), based on journals she had kept during the confrontation, was made into a CBS movie that brought Joanne Woodward an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Mrs. Huckaby.         Mrs. Huckaby is survived by a sister, Clara Doyle, of Danville, Calif., and a brother, Clifton Paisley, of Tallahassee, Fla.         Mrs. Huckaby, who did not consider herself a social crusader, would recall having told Daisy Bates of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Arkansas that ''since my field was education, my immediate goal was having the black children in school as just ordinary children.''         She supported school integration, believing, she said, that ''no public school system segregated by law on the basis of race is consistent with democracy.''       
         Lucienne Bloch, an acclaimed muralist whose most significant contribution to art may have been a series of surreptitious photographs she took in 1933, died on March 13 at her home in Gualala, Calif. She was 90.         She was the photographer whose sneak pictures taken behind enemy lines on May, 8, 1933, are the sole visual record of the great Diego Rivera's ill-fated Rockefeller Center fresco with its doomed depiction of Lenin.         At a time of economic distress, when capitalism itself seemed vulnerable to competing currents of social change, if anybody was going to pin Lenin on a capitalist wall it was Diego Rivera, the fiery Mexican muralist whose artistic acclaim was matched only by his reputation as a fiercely committed, if renegade, Communist.         If anybody was going to stop him it was John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s son, Nelson A. Rockefeller, who had commissioned Rivera to paint a 1,000-square-foot fresco, ''Man at the Crossroads,'' in the great hall of the new RCA Building, the soaring Rockefeller Center capstone now known as the G.E. Building and at the time an especially potent symbol of capitalism.         Sure enough, when it became apparent that Rivera was intent on portraying Lenin as a charismatic leader, Rockefeller asked him to substitute an anonymous figure, and Rivera refused.         Realizing his work was doomed, Rivera hired a photographer to take pictures of the mural, but Rockefeller, determined that there be no record of what the family regarded as desecration of their property, had guards at the building thwart the effort.         Aware that the mural would be sealed off the next day, the Rockefellers could be complacent, but only because they had not reckoned on  Miss Bloch, an unpaid Rivera assistant who seemed an unlikely foot soldier in his anti-capitalist cause.         A Geneva-born daughter of the celebrated Swiss composer, Ernst Bloch, she was a child of privilege who had come to the United States with her family in 1917 and lived in Cleveland until 1925, when her father became director of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and her mother, aware that the composer would be comforted by mistresses, took her children to Paris.         There, Miss Bloch studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and made a yearlong side trip to the Netherlands, studying at the Leerdam glass works and turning out such impressive glass sculptures that she had a one-woman show in New York in 1931 and was invited by Frank Lloyd Wright to teach at his Wisconsin school.         By then, however, she had become fascinated by another art. Shortly after her arrival in New York in 1931, she was invited to a banquet honoring Rivera in connection with his famous one-man show at the Museum of Modern Art. Largely because Rivera spoke little English and no one else spoke Spanish, the 22-year-old Miss Bloch, who spoke French, a language Rivera also knew, was seated next to the great man.         During their animated conversation, a dark-haired woman came up behind Miss Bloch and said, ''I hate you,'' a comment of such disarming candor that Miss Bloch burst out laughing. The woman was Rivera's wife, the tortured artist Frida Kahlo, whose husband's philandering gave her reason to fear the worst, but not, as it happened, from Miss Bloch.         As the the daughter of a womanizing father, Miss Bloch made clear, she had no designs on Kahlo's womanizing husband, a pledge that laid the groundwork for a remarkable friendship.         Over the next few years, Miss Bloch worked on Rivera's controversial mural at the Detroit Institute of Art and on the Rockefeller Center project, along the way falling in love with the artist's chief plasterer, Stephen P. Dimitroff, a young Bulgarian immigrant, and immortalizing their romance in lyrical passages in her diary, which a granddaughter, Lucienne Allen, plans to use as the basis for a book.         The couple, who eventually married, became an artistic team, he handling the plaster and she the painting for frescoes all over the country, including her most acclaimed work, ''The Evolution of Music,'' at George Washington High School in upper Manhattan.         They lived for a time in Flint, Mich., where he became a union organizer and she photographed strikes for Life and other publications, before eventually moving to Mill Valley, Calif., where Mr. Dimitroff, who died in 1996, operated a frame shop until the couple retired to Gualala in 1965.         After a lifetime devoted to art, including wide-ranging sculptures in glass, wood and terra cotta and a famous series of photographs of Kahlo, Miss Bloch is nevertheless largely recalled for her association with another artist's work, but, then, the artist was Rivera, widely regarded as a 20th century giant, and her photographs are all that remain of his most famous work.         For that, Miss Bloch, who is survived by two sons, George Ernst Dimitroff of Tumwater, Wash., and Pancho Dimitroff of Aurora, Colo; a daughter, Sita Milchev, of Gualala; a sister, Suzanne Bloch Smith of New York; 8 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren, had only herself to blame.         It was she, after all, on the night after Rivera's hired photographer had been thwarted, who slipped a camera under her blouse and walked boldly into the RCA building with Mr. Dimitroff and Kahlo, who distracted the guards while Miss Bloch climbed up on the scaffold and proceeded to photograph the mural.         The next day, in what has been likened to a military operation, the mural was shrouded from public view.         Nine months later, after the resulting furor had subsided, it was scraped into oblivion -- almost.         Rivera did a copy in Mexico City, complete with Lenin, but it is only Miss Bloch's photographs that show it as it was -- on a Rockefeller wall.         Correction:  April 6, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary of the muralist Lucienne Bloch on March 28 misspelled the given name of her father. He was Ernest Bloch, not Ernst.       
         Ann Corio, the auburn-haired, green-eyed queen of burlesque whose long-running show, ''This Was Burlesque,'' kept alive the art of strippers and the comedy of baggy-pants clowns in the age of the X-rated film, died on March 1 at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. Ms. Corio, a resident of Cliffside Park, N.J., kept her age a closely guarded secret, but was believed to be in her 80's.         A survivor of a shapely sisterhood that included Gypsy Rose Lee, Maggie Hart and Georgia Sothern, Ms. Corio lasted long enough to reach the iconic status that enabled her to present the striptease as a put-on.         ''We emphasize comedy,'' she said one day in 1976 as she discussed her show, which began Off Broadway in 1962 and continued for at least two decades in various productions, tours and revivals with Ms. Corio as author, director, star and interlocutor. ''There is no total nudity. The girls are lovely and artistic, and they're terribly, terribly pretty.         ''What is called burlesque today isn't that at all. Those girls aren't artists. They just take clothes off, and they don't even do that very well. Burlesque is exactly what it says it is. It's from the Italian word burlare, to satirize, to laugh. That's what we do, and we are not offensive.''         Those old enough to remember when strippers in burlesque houses were regarded as hot stuff could recall Ms. Corio as a reigning beauty of the East Coast wheel of burlesque houses that extended from Boston to Washington, with many a whistle-stop in between.         Her fame won her roles in jungle films like ''Swamp Woman'' (1941) and touring stage productions like ''White Cargo,'' in which she sashayed onstage one night in Boston, playing a native girl under a light layer of brown powder and not much more. When she declaimed, ''I am Tondelayo,'' a Harvard undergraduate leaped from his seat and shouted, ''What an actress!''         Legend had it that it was said in Boston, ''You can't graduate from Harvard until you've seen Ann Corio.''         The play had the honor of being banned in Boston, Chicago and Hoboken, N.J.         Of her movies, Ms. Corio said, ''Those pictures always made money, and I made a lot of money. I asked for $10,000 a week and a percentage and got it, but I didn't know they were going to shoot the movie in six days. They didn't want the movie good. They wanted it Tuesday. I was the Queen of the Quickies. Those pictures weren't released, they escaped.''         As burlesque faded away, Ms. Corio toured in shows like ''Rain,'' ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' and ''Once More With Feeling'' until she conceived the idea of ''This Was Burlesque.''         ''We're naughty and bawdy, but never vulgar,'' she said. ''More than half our audience are women. They love it. Even the kids respond to it. To go to a movie these days, you need a computer to figure out the ratings. The whole family can see my show.''         ''Nudity,'' she added, ''is an invasion of privacy on both sides of the footlights.''         Ms. Corio was one of 12 children of Italian immigrants from Naples who settled in Hartford, where, she said, she was once a Sunday school teacher. Her father died when she was  young, and at 16, after working as a dancer, she discovered she could earn more on the burlesque circuit.         In addition to her husband, Michael P. Iannucci, she is survived by two sisters, Helen LaRue of West Hartford, Conn., and Lillian Denote of Bristol, Conn.         ''This Was Burlesque,'' billed as a musical satire based on Ms. Corio's recollections, opened at the Casino East Theater on Second Avenue and 12th Street in Manhattan and ran for 1,509 performances before it moved to the Hudson Theater on Broadway and ran for 124 more. Over the ensuing years, numerous productions played across the country from Miami to Las Vegas to San Juan. The last performance was in St. Petersburg, Fla., in 1991.         In a 1981 review of a revival at the Princess Theater on West 48th Street, Richard F. Shepard of The New York Times wrote: ''Miss Corio, who looks radiant, does it all by the book and, whether you like the book or not, it is to her credit that she catches the flavor of the old burlesque with little attempt to ennoble or elevate it. This is close to the real thing.''         Ms. Corio and her third husband, Mr. Iannucci, a former linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers, made millions from the show. Eventually, they leased the Playhouse on the Mall in Paramus, N.J., where, for many years, they presented legitimate productions and where ''This Was Burlesque'' was eventually filmed as an HBO cable attraction.         Ms. Corio, who retired about eight years ago, recalled that shortly after the show first opened on Second Avenue, the police showed up. ''One night we thought we were being raided, but it was only the cops arriving to escort Mike to the bank. We never had trouble with the police. And I was invited to Gracie Mansion. Mayor Wagner insisted I sit next to him for the photographers.''         As a result of charges that burlesque had become lewd and unsavory, it was banned in New York in 1937. Five years later, it was permitted to return, but without the use of the label and in a restricted format. A court finally lifted the ban in 1955.         Nevertheless, Ms. Corio's efforts to present her show at the 1964-65 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens, were rebuffed by Robert Moses, the pillar of municipal rectitude who presided over the corporation that ran the event.         ''You know, we're really quite mild compared to what children are exposed to on television -- topless bathing suits and all,'' Ms. Corio said.         But the show did not go on.         ''There's nothing really new,'' she said. ''It's comedy, pretty girls, bubble gum, stepping on toes, the kind of stuff you can leave your brains home for. It's burlesque.''         As she once put it, ''We do nothing you wouldn't write home about to your aunt in East Cupcake, Ohio.''         Correction:  March 10, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary of the burlesque performer Ann Corio yesterday misstated the given name of another prominent performer in her field. She was Margie Hart, not Maggie.       
         Lila Hotz Luce Tyng, the first wife of Henry R. Luce, founder of Time Inc., died on Wednesday at her home in Gladstone, N.J., five days after her 100th birthday.         Mrs. Tyng, the mother of Mr. Luce's children, was a leading figure in New York's social and philanthropic circles for several decades.         Though overshadowed in history by the editor's famous second wife, the author Clare Boothe Luce, Mrs. Tyng played an important role in the life of Mr. Luce, who sought her advice even after they were divorced, said Robert E. Herzstein, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina and the author of ''Henry R. Luce'' (Scribner, 1994).         Lila Hotz was born in Chicago in 1899, the daughter of Robert Schuttler Hotz, an inventor and financier, and Lila Ross Hotz. On New Year's Eve 1919, she met the young Luce through one of his Yale classmates, Thornton Wilder; they were married in 1923.         The young wife hoped that Time's growing success would eventually allow her workaholic husband to join her in the kind of social whirl she loved. But they divorced in 1935, not long after Mr. Luce met Clare Boothe, whose literary and journalistic drives and interests better matched his own. ''Lila was devastated when Luce confronted her with his intention to divorce her,'' Dr. Herzstein said. ''But they maintained a closeness and were in constant contact, often discussing their children's education and careers, among other things.''         Mrs. Tyng and Mr. Luce, who died in 1967, had two sons: Henry Luce 3d,  chairman and chief executive of the Henry Luce Foundation in New York City, and Peter Paul Luce of Englewood, Colo.         In 1939, she married Sewell Tappan Tyng, a lawyer, author, head of a mining company and assistant to the New York City District Attorney, Thomas E. Dewey. She became a fixture in New York society, serving on the boards of several institutions,  including the Henry Street Settlement, the Berkshire Farm School, the Spence-Chapin Adoption Service  and the Grosvenor Neighborhood House. She once reported attending 36 balls in 36 weeks.         Besides her two sons, Mrs. Tyng is survived by six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Vera Tolstoy, a Russian refugee who became a teen-age bride in Czechoslovakia, worked as a hairdresser in Prague, sang Gypsy songs in Paris, sold perfume in New York and spent 25 years with the Voice of America in Washington, died on Monday at her retirement home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. She was 96 and the last living link to her grandfather Leo Tolstoy.         To the world of the early 1900's, Leo Tolstoy was a literary giant who had become the ''hermit of Yasnaya Polyana,'' the luxurious family estate 150 miles south of Moscow where he lived for 48 years and wrote  ''Anna Karenina'' and ''War and Peace.''         To his granddaughter, who grew up on a nearby estate with her mother, Sophia, and father, Ilya, the author's second son, he was simply her beloved bushy-faced dedushka, the jolly man in a peasant shirt who bounced her on his knee and tickled her cheek with his whiskers.         A small, lively woman who could affect a magisterial air, Miss Tolstoy dropped her hereditary title, Countess, after she came to the United States in 1949, but as an aristocratic exercise of noblesse oblige saw no reason to correct friends who continued to address her that way.         Although she sometimes found the name Tolstoy a burden, and even called herself Vera Mansoureva (after her mother's family estate) during her years as a Russian-language broadcaster, she was proud enough of her family connections to regale friends with tales of the old days at Yasnaya Polyana and to give lectures on her family heritage.         As a second-generation descendant of a man who had 13 children (and now has some 200 living descendants) Miss Tolstoy, the youngest of seven surviving siblings, liked to call herself Tolstoy's last granddaughter and never mind that a cousin from the Swedish branch of the family might still be alive.         As she made clear to relatives, the Swedish branch, descended from  Tolstoy's son Leo didn't count since they didn't speak Russian.         For Miss Tolstoy, who was 7 when her grandfather died in 1910 and 10 when the outbreak of World War I gave her father an excuse to desert his family (he eventually settled in the United States and remarried), the aristocratic life was short-lived.         After the Russian Revolution she and her mother made a harrowing escape, eventually landing in Czechoslovakia, where Miss Tolstoy got a job as translator for a wealthy lumber merchant, Odo Bakovsky, and then married him in an Islamic ceremony, giving birth to a son, Serge, in 1922.         Five years later, after her husband had lost his money and, she said, become unfaithful and quarrelsome, she sought to have the marriage declared illegal, explaining that she would rather have an annulment than a divorce because as a prospective single mother she preferred to have an illegitimate Tolstoy than a legitimate Bakovsky.         Miss Tolstoy, whose son had been kidnapped by his father then rekidnapped by her, had to settle for a divorce, but her son, her only immediate survivor, who now lives in Washington, is known as Serge Tolstoy.         After supporting her mother and son by working as a hairdresser in Prague, Miss Tolstoy moved to Paris after her mother's death in the 1930's and worked as a nightclub singer.         It was her aunt Alexandra Tolstoy,  founder of the Tolstoy Foundation in Valley Cottage, N.Y., who sponsored her immigration to the United States in 1949. After a brief stay at the foundation's farm and a stint selling perfume for Elizabeth Arden in New York, she moved to Washington in 1954 and Florida in 1979.         In 1991 she went back to Russia for a family reunion that drew dozens of Tolstoys, including many who had remained in the Soviet Union, to Yasnaya Polyana, a museum that is virtually a shrine.         Finding the house much as she remembered it, including the formal dining room table with its elegant china and fine silver covered by a glass dome and her grandfather's signature wide-brim hat and peasant shirt hanging next to his washstand, Miss Tolstoy was in her element, spotting a photograph taken with her grandfather when she was 3, but not finding every detail to her liking.         When she saw an alabaster monument to Lenin, a distinct incongruity in a museum devoted to a member of the Russian nobility, Miss Tolstoy responded first by using an American barnyard epithet, then reverted to aristocratic type.         ''That statue,'' she said, poking her walking stick at the offensive item, and using her most imperious voice, ''should be taken away.''       
         Edith Anderson, an American writer who defied postwar ruin and harsh political realities to resettle in divided Berlin with her German Communist husband and lived just long enough to see her cold war memoir published and praised as a literary event, died on Tuesday at her home in Berlin. She was 83.         Ms. Anderson, whose last name was originally Handelsman, had returned to Berlin on April 7 after two weeks in New York to promote her new book, ''Love in Exile,'' published in March by Steerforth Press of South Royalton, Vt.         The product of decades of reminiscences, journalism and correspondence, the book traces Ms. Anderson's odyssey from a conservative Jewish upbringing in the Bronx, to a stint at the Communist newspaper Daily Worker, to encounters with Richard Wright, Simone de Beauvoir, Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym and other literati. She also wrote of her consuming romance with Max Schroeder, a surrealist poet, editor and antifascist whom she married and followed from his wartime exile in New York back to Soviet-controlled East Germany in 1947.         ''Love in Exile'' has been hailed by Grace Paley, Doris Lessing and Vivian Gornick, among other writers, as a sharp and gripping portrait of an ideological and human landscape as foreign to today's Americans as the dark side of the moon. A review in The New York Times Book Review  found the book most affecting when Ms. Anderson recounted her domestic anguish and search for love outside the marriage.         In an early section, she described how she landed her job at The Daily Worker in 1942, when she was 26.         ''Hastening down Broadway to my Marxist analyst who charged only $5 a session because I was unemployed (he too was still young) I bumped into a former college crony named Milton. He hailed me joyously. 'You're just the person I need!' He told me he was cultural editor of The Daily Worker but had just been drafted into the Army and must find a replacement by the weekend.''         She was overwhelmed. She would scrub floors at The Daily Worker. But she had no newspaper experience. She wrote:         '' 'I'll break you in,' he said.         '' 'In three days?         '' 'Less.' ''         She asked herself how she had the nerve to pass herself off as cultural editor. ''My analyst brushed these scruples aside. He was delighted that I had a real challenge to bite into; life, as Marx said, was a struggle and I was no more a fraud than anyone else.''         Still, she was soon dismissed and ended up as one of the women on train crews hired to replace men called to war. Shortly afterward, she met Mr. Schroeder, a craggy and mesmerizing onetime bohemian 17 years her senior. He had escaped from Nazi captivity in Vichy, France, and was editing an anti-fascist publication in New York.         After he returned to Germany in 1946, she followed the next year, via Paris, after almost joining the American Army in a desperate effort to enter restricted Berlin at a time when almost everyone there would have given anything to get out. She was to remain, with only intermittent visits home, for the next 52 years, although her husband died in 1958. They had a daughter, Cordelia, who still lives in Berlin.         In ''Love in Exile,'' Ms. Anderson said that as a widow she considered returning to the United States with her daughter but was deterred by the imagined voice of Max: ''What right have you to deprive her of the Socialism for which so many people died or went into exile? It may be imperfect but something can be made of it.'' The book ends in 1962.         Although clearly enamored of Marxism since youth, Ms. Anderson was not overtly political, said her childhood friend, the writer Helen Yglesias, a classmate at James Monroe High School in the Bronx. ''She was highly sympathetic to Max's idealism and his hope that a just society could be built,'' she said.         But she was a sharp and often corrosive chronicler of the death throes of the German Democratic Republic as Communism collapsed and the Berlin Wall fell in 1989: ''a kaleidoscope rolling downhill,'' as she described it.         In an account of the final days, later included in an anthology, ''Without Force or Lies'' (1990), she wrote of traveling through East Germany in a train compartment with her grandson and watching a young man and woman, strangers, suddenly shed their inhibitions and take up the taboo subject of politics.         The man, agitated, ripped off his tie, warning that East Germans  ''had just about had it,'' she wrote.         '' 'I give it one more year before something busts,' he said.         '' 'Six months,' she replied.''         Her grandson grew alarmed and Ms. Anderson sought to calm him. ''But I felt my own scalp creep, as if some law of nature had had broken, a sheep instead of baaing shouted in a human voice, 'Enough!'         ''The young woman had hit it right on the nose: six months. The unthinkable happened here.''         At the same time, Ms. Anderson also wrote acidly of the former West Germans ''tramping around'' the prostrate east, flooding it with inferior ''Western goods.''         Edith Handelsman grew up on Hoe Avenue in the Bronx and graduated in 1937 from New College, a division of Teachers College at Columbia University. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a brother, John Bernard Handelsman of Hampton Bays, N.Y., a cartoonist at The New Yorker, and a grandson.         Besides her memoir, Ms. Anderson also wrote ''Gelbes Licht'' (''Yellow Light'') in 1956 about her railroad work, and short stories, children's books and radio plays. A play, ''Wo Ist Katalin? (''Where Is Katalin?''), was produced in Weimar in 1977. From 1960 to 1977 she was the Berlin correspondent for The New York National Guardian.         Mr. Handelsman said that on her recent book-promotion visit to New York, his sister seemed confused and forgetful, possibly presaging her fatal stroke.         But Ms. Anderson's literary agent, Malaga Baldi of Manhattan, said any infirmities disappeared at a reading the author gave at the New School for Social Research on March 25.         ''She started to read an excerpt,'' Ms. Baldi said, ''but the people would not let her stop.''       
         Grace Zia Chu, who introduced a generation of Americans to Chinese cuisine though her cooking classes in Manhattan and her landmark book ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking,'' died Thursday at a nursing home in Columbus, Ohio. She was 99.         In an era when most Americans believed that chop suey was a classic Chinese dish, Mrs. Chu led her students and readers, step by step, down the complicated byways of Chinese cooking, which, she explained, differed from region to region and, ideally, relied on raw ingredients that did not come from a can. For home cooks bewildered by the unfamiliar ingredients and techniques involved, Mrs. Chu proved to be an ideal guide. Assuming, correctly, that her readers knew precisely nothing about Chinese cuisine, she wrote clearly and simply, tailoring her recipes to the realities of the American kitchen, even if that meant calling for creamed corn in the recipe for chicken velvet corn soup.         Mrs. Chu was born in Shanghai. She was the eldest of the nine children of Zia Hong-lai, a Christian educator and editor, and Sochen Sze. After graduating from the McTyeire School for Girls in Shanghai in 1918, she won a scholarship to Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass., where she earned a degree in physical education in 1924. After returning to China, she taught at McTyeire and taught physical education at Ginling College in Nanjing, and from 1935 to 1947, she was a vice president of the world Young Women's Christian Association.         In 1928, she married Chu Shih-ming, an army officer and an official in the Nationalist Government who at one time was an interpreter and aide-de-camp to Chiang Kai-shek.  When he was posted as a military attache to the Chinese Embassy in Washington in 1941, Mrs. Chu took on the entertaining duties that transformed her into an ambassador for Chinese food.         Mrs. Chu returned to China after World War II but left in 1950 and took up permanent residence in the United States, becoming a citizen in 1955. By that time she had settled in Manhattan, where she began teaching cooking classes at the China Institute. For the next 30 years, she taught at the institute, the Mandarin House restaurant on West 13th Street and at her apartment on West 111th Street.         Her classes later resulted in two cookbooks, ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking'' (1962) and ''Madame Chu's Chinese Cooking School'' (1975).         In ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking,'' Mrs. Chu patiently guided her readers through unfamiliar territory. She listed and described the basic ingredients of Chinese dishes, and the utensils and techniques used to prepare them. She showed how to use a Chinese cleaver, how to hold chopsticks, how to grow bean sprouts at home and how to order a proper Chinese meal in a restaurant. In a concession to American tastes, Mrs. Chu included recipes for chop suey, chow mein and other Chinese-American hybrids, but then pressed on to offer more authentic fare like string beans in bean curd sauce and lobster with black bean sauce, as well as challenging banquet dishes like shark fins with Chinese cabbage.         ''The book may well be the finest, most lucid volume on Chinese cooking ever written,'' Craig Claiborne wrote in The New York Times in 1962. To a generation of Americans familiar with the distinctions among Sichuan, Hunan and Cantonese cooking styles, ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking'' reads like a period piece, but in the early 1960's it was a badly needed instruction manual. It is telling that in his review of the book, Mr. Claiborne had to explain to readers that a wok was ''a Chinese cooking utensil.''         With Arthur Chu, Mrs. Chu wrote ''Oriental Antiques and Collectibles: a Guide'' (1973), ''Oriental Cloisonne and Other Enamels'' and ''The Collector's Book of Jade'' (1978).         Her husband died in 1965, and Mrs. Chu moved to Columbus in 1986. She is survived by her sister, Ruth Zia, of Columbus; two sons, Samuel, of Columbus and Daniel, of New York City; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.         MRS.

         Elizabeth Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, who transformed it from a tired magazine into a viable voice in fashion while she battled ovarian cancer and raised awareness of the disease, died yesterday morning at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 51 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.         Ms. Tilberis was highly respected for her ability as an editor, her warmth and her good humor in the face of debilitating treatments to halt the spread of the cancer that ultimately took her life. While hospitalized in December 1993 and again in the summer of 1995, she oversaw each issue of the monthly magazine, which she had taken over in February 1992. Until just a few days before her death, she was working on the June issue.         When Hearst Magazines, which publishes the 132-year-old Harper's Bazaar, hired Ms. Tilberis away from her job as editor in chief of British Vogue, it created a sensation in fashion magazine circles. She became the third reigning British editor of an important New York magazine, following Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue, and Tina Brown, who was then the editor in chief of Vanity Fair and later became the editor of The New Yorker and is now developing Talk magazine.         The fashion world was abuzz with gossip on two topics: speculation that Hearst was paying Ms. Tilberis an annual salary of $1.25 million (never confirmed or denied) and anticipation of a rivalry between Ms. Tilberis and Ms. Wintour, her predecessor at British Vogue, who had recommended Ms. Tilberis as her replacement there. (No outward signs of either hostility or warmth were seen in the years they competed in New York.)         Ms. Tilberis's aim when she took over Harper's Bazaar, she said, was to make it ''the most beautiful fashion magazine in the world.'' She hired talented stylists and famous photographers and brought in Fabien Baron to redesign the look of the magazine. Under his art direction, it developed a strong graphics style,  which was widely copied.         The first issue under Ms. Tilberis's direction, September 1992, had a stunning cover shot by Patrick Demarchelier of the model Linda Evangelista in a stark black dress against a white background with no other headline on the cover than ''Enter the Era of Elegance.'' It was a startling contrast to the usual fashion magazine cover with multiple headlines in different colors. Subsequent issues added text lines and color and eventually looked more like other fashion publications. An exception was this year's February cover of Madonna, also photographed by Mr. Demarchelier, in striking black and red.         Industry reaction to the first change in the magazine was mixed. Some saw it as coolly elegant. Others thought it boring and lifeless. But it won awards, including two National Magazine Awards in 1993.         In 1994, Ms. Tilberis was named editor of the year by Advertising Age and received an award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which was presented to her by Diana, the Princess of Wales. The two women became friends in London, where the Princess of Wales often dropped by the offices of British Vogue and also appeared on its cover twice while Ms. Tilberis was editor. The Princess was also twice on the cover of Harper's Bazaar under Ms. Tilberis's editorship, once during her lifetime and once posthumously.         The September 1994 issue of Harper's Bazaar contained an informative article by Aimee Lee Ball, ''Ovarian Cancer: One Woman's Fight,'' in which Ms. Tilberis linked her use of fertility drugs in the late 1970's to the ovarian cancer that was diagnosed in December 1993. The fertility treatments were unsuccessful. The article described the disease and its treatment, which included nine weeks of chemotherapy, which caused Ms. Tilberis to lose 30 pounds.         In another article in the magazine, in May 1996, Ms. Tilberis described in diary form a bone-marrow transplant she underwent the previous summer to eradicate vestiges of the cancer. In both articles, she chose to find something positive to say about her illness: she had gone from a size 14 to a fashionable size 6 and was pleased that her silver hair was as flattering in its new short length as it had been as a chin-length bob.         She also discussed her battle with the disease in ''No Time to Die,'' a memoir written with Ms. Ball and published last year by Little, Brown. In 1997, Ms. Tilberis became president of the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund.         Elizabeth Kelly Tilberis was born Sept. 7, 1947 in Alderley Edge, a village outside of Manchester, England, to Jane and Thomas Stuart-Black Kelly. Her father was an eye surgeon, who was a pioneer in laser retinal detachment surgery and in developing soft contact lenses in the 1960's.         She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in fashion design from Leicester Polytechnic, a British school comparable to New York's Fashion Institute of Technology. It was there that she met her future husband, Andrew Tilberis, an artist, who was her tutor. She and her husband later adopted two children, Robert, now 17, and Christopher, 14.         In addition to her husband and sons, she is survived by her relatives in England: her mother, of Bath; her sister, Lois Stuart-Black of London, and her brother, Dr. Grant Kelly of West Sussex. Following her graduation in 1970, Ms. Tilberis went to British Vogue as a fashion assistant and worked her way to the top, becoming editor in chief in 1987.         Ms. Tilberis was active on the New York charity social scene, serving as chairwoman of benefits for causes like pediatric AIDS, the New York City Ballet and the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         She was scheduled to receive a Humanitarian Award in June from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which will now be given posthumously, said Fern Mallis, the council's executive director. ''We are pleased that the award was announced earlier and not something added after her death,'' Ms. Mallis said yesterday.         Despite Ms. Tilberis's personal popularity and the publicity her tenure brought to the magazine, Harper's Bazaar never ousted Vogue from its pinnacle as the fashion publication with the largest circulation and the most advertising pages. As time went by under her editorship, the magazine lost some of its specialness and began to look more like other fashion publications. It also lost some high-profile editors and photographers to other magazines.         Unfazed, Ms. Tilberis pronounced herself pleased with the magazine in an interview in 1995. ''I think we made the niche we wanted to make, and I think we are the elegant fashion magazine I wanted to create,'' she said.         In an interview published last year in The Times, Ms. Tilberis discussed the stark contrast between her glamorous job and her illness: ''You can live in the fashion world and go to fashion shows and have your picture taken, et cetera, et cetera. But there's an important balance with what really goes on in life, which is sickness and suffering and people dying. Prior to having cancer, I didn't realize there was this whole different world. It's a great wake-up call.''       
         Dr. Mary D. Ainsworth, a developmental psychologist whose work revolutionized the understanding of the bond between mothers and infants, died in Charlottesville, Va., on March 21. She was 85.         Dr. Ainsworth's research contributed significantly to attachment theory, which emphasizes the importance of intimate human relationships, or attachments, in shaping children's development.         Dr. Ainsworth, who lived in Charlottesville, worked closely with Dr. John Bowlby, the British child psychiatrist whose work on separation, attachment and loss provided the foundation for attachment theory. She carried on his legacy in the United States, conducting systematic studies of attachments between mothers and infants.         ''No one had ever looked at that'' before Dr. Ainsworth's work, said Jude A. Cassidy, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Maryland at College Park. ''There had been little empirical observation.''         Dr. Ainsworth also developed methods for assessing the quality of the mother-infant bond. Attachment theory holds that infants need a ''secure'' attachment to thrive, and that ''anxious'' attachments can lead to problems later in life. ''She looked at a way of measuring which babies were securely attached and which were not,'' Dr. Cassidy said.         Though much of Dr. Ainsworth's research was for an academic audience, it also had a practical side. She argued, on the basis of her research, that picking up a crying baby does not spoil the child; rather, it reduces crying in the future.         ''That was a huge controversy over that,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''It had been thought that picking up a baby spoiled it and led to more crying. Instead, it teaches the baby that the world is a responsive place and leads to less crying long term.''         Psychologists continue to debate the issue.         Dr. Ainsworth's research also found that feeding an infant on demand rather than on a strict schedule led to a more secure attachment between infant and mother.         ''These findings had a big impact on how pediatricians advised mothers in the second half of the 20th century,'' said Robert S. Marvin, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Virginia.         Mary D. Salter was born in Glendale, Ohio, on Dec. 1, 1913, and spent most of her childhood in Toronto. She received her bachelor's degree in 1935, her master's degree in 1936 and her Ph.D. in 1939, all from the University of Toronto. She then was a lecturer in the university's psychology department until 1942, when she was commissioned in the Canadian Women's Army Corps, attaining the rank of major. She returned to the university as an assistant professor in 1946.         In 1950 she married Leonard Ainsworth, a graduate student in psychology. Shortly after their marriage she moved to London, where she began a lifelong partnership with Dr. Bowlby, who was investigating the impact on institutionalized children of prolonged separation from their mothers in early childhood. Dr. Ainsworth later moved to Kampala, Uganda, where she conducted one of the first studies of mother-infant interaction in the first year of life.         In 1955 she moved to Baltimore, where she joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University. She became a full professor there in 1963, a year after she began her study of infant-mother attachment. In the study, she and her researchers conducted four-hour home visits every three weeks for a year with 26 mothers and their infants. It took four years to collect the data and 10 years to analyze it.         ''The depth has never been matched,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''No one has done it as intensively.''         In 1974 Dr. Ainsworth, who was divorced from her husband in 1960, moved to Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, where she was a professor from 1975 to 1984. She retired as professor emeritus in 1984 and remained professionally active until 1992.         She wrote several books and many academic papers, and was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford in 1966 and 1967. She also received several awards from professional organizations. Last year she was awarded the Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Science of Psychology from the American Psychological Foundation.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Sloan of Vancouver, British Columbia.       
         Darlene Geis, an author and editor, died on March 25 in a fire at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         Ms. Geis wrote a number of popular books for young readers. ''The Little Train That Won a Medal'' was published in 1947 and has sold more than three million copies. She was also the author of ''Design for Ann'' (1949), ''The Mystery of the Thirteenth Floor'' (1953) and ''Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Animals'' (1959). She collaborated with Dione Lucas on ''The Gourmet Cooking School Cookbook'' (1964) and edited ''A Treasury of Great Recipes'' (1965) by Mary and Vincent Price.         Ms. Geis joined Harry N. Abrams, the art book publishers, in 1969 and eventually became senior editor for special projects. In that capacity she wrote and edited several books for Disney Enterprises, including ''Treasury of Children's Classics,'' ''The Fantasia Book'' and ''Treasury of Stories from Silly Symphonies.'' She also was instrumental in the creation of the ''The Joys of Wine'' (1977), working with Clifton Fadiman and Sam Aaron. Her other projects for Abrams included ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Operas'' and ''Encyclopedia of Quilts.''         She is survived by her husband, the publisher Bernard Geis; two sons, Peter, of La Honda, Calif., and Stephen, of Geneva; a sister, Jean S. Gottlieb of Fort Myers Beach, Fla.; eight grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Gladys Hasty Carroll, a novelist who wrote about the rural Maine of her childhood, died last Thursday at a hospital in York, Me. She was 94 and lived in South Berwick, Me.         Ms. Carroll earned a Pulitzer Prize nomination for her 1933 work, ''As the Earth Turns,'' the story of a long-established farm family in southern Maine and the Polish immigrants who buy neighboring land. A best seller, the book was turned into a movie by Warner Brothers the following year. In 1935, Ms. Carroll adapted it into a folk play, which was performed annually in South Berwick for more than a decade. She wrote of the experience in ''The Book That Came Alive,'' her last.         Born in Rochester, N.H., Ms. Carroll grew up in, and later returned to, the farmhouse her grandfather built during the Civil War in Dunnybrook, a hamlet on the outskirts of South Berwick. A day after graduating from Bates College, she married Herbert A. Carroll and started writing for children's magazines before  quickly producing three novels, ''As the Earth Turns,'' ''A Few Foolish Ones'' and ''Neighbor to the Sky.''         Ms. Carroll wrote a total of 23 other works, including ''Dunnybrook,'' a social history of 10 generations of farmers in her community.         She is survived by a son, Warren,  of Manassas, Va.; a daughter, Sarah Carroll Watson of South Berwick; two grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Betty Robinson Schwartz, who in 1928 as a 16-year-old high school junior became the first woman to win an Olympic gold medal in track and field, died Tuesday in Colorado. She was 87.         Her son, Richard Schwartz Jr. of Denver, told The Chicago Tribune she had suffered from cancer and Alzheimer's disease in recent years.         Robinson's life story -- which included prodigious athletic glory, a life-threatening accident and an amazing Olympic comeback -- sounded like the product of an overimaginative screenwriter.         Elizabeth (Babe) Robinson was born Aug. 23, 1911, in Riverdale, Ill., a small town south of Chicago. Her career started when a high school teacher and assistant track coach in Harvey, Ill., saw her running for a commuter train (the legend is that she caught it). She later ran 50 yards for him in a school corridor, and a track career began.         These were the nascent days of organized women's track and field at the national level. As she told The Los Angeles Times in 1984: ''I had no idea that women even ran then. I grew up a hick. That is when I found out that they actually had track meets for women.''         Three weeks after being discovered, Robinson made her racing debut in a regional meet and finished second to Helen Filkey, the United States record-holder at 100 meters. In her next meet, the Chicago-area Olympic trials, she equaled the world record of 12.0 seconds (the current world record is 10.49, set by Florence Griffith Joyner in 1988). In her third meet, the United States final trials in Newark, she finished second and made the Olympic team.         In 1928, the year Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, female track and field athletes were allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The 1928 Amsterdam Games would mark the fourth meet of Robinson's career, just four months after she took up the sport at age 16.         A week after qualifying for the Olympics, she and her teammates sailed to Amsterdam and worked out on a quarter-mile linoleum track laid around the ship's deck. In Amsterdam, she finished second in her trial heat and first in her semifinal and became the only American to reach the finals.         The finish was close in the finals, and the judges declared Robinson the winner over the favored Fanny Rosenfeld of Canada in an official time of 12.2. Because the 100-meter race was the first of five women's track and field events at the 1928 Games, Robinson had won the first gold medal handed out in her sport.         ''When the flag went up after the race,'' she said, ''I started crying like a baby.''         Rosenfeld and her Canadian teammates later defeated Robinson and the American team in the 4x100-meter relay, with the United States team taking the silver.         After Robinson won the gold, Douglas MacArthur, then the president of the American Olympic Committee, presented her with a small gold charm shaped like the world. When she returned home, she was honored by ticker-tape parades down Broadway in New York and State Street in Chicago. In her hometown, she received a diamond watch from an adoring public and a silver cup from her high school.         She was still a world-class athlete when a biplane she was riding in with her cousin crashed near Chicago in 1931. Both survived, but Robinson spent 11 weeks in a hospital with severe head injuries and a broken leg and arm. A silver rod and pin were inserted to stabilize the leg, which was placed in a hip-to-heel cast. For four months, she was in a wheelchair or on crutches, and the leg became a half-inch shorter.         ''If I had not been in such good physical condition,'' she said, ''I would not have lived through it.''         As it was, she was out of competition for three and a half years. When she tried a comeback in 1936, she could not bend a knee, so she had to make a standing rather than a crouching start in the 100 meters. Still, she made the Olympic relay team, along with Harriet Bland, Annette Rogers and Helen Stephens. This time in Berlin, the American team -- with Robinson running the third leg -- captured the gold when a member of the record-setting German team fumbled the baton pass before the last handoff. Robinson had completed an improbable comeback.         In 1939, she married Richard S. Schwartz, who owned an upholstery firm. They had two children.         Besides her son, she is survived by her daughter, Jane Hamilton of Denver, and three grandchildren.         Her career included world records at 50, 60, 70 and 100 yards. She was inducted into the National Track and Field, the United States Track and Field and the Helms Halls of Fame. After she stopped running, she was a coach, timer and public speaker.         She never received the publicity and public adulation of such American successors as Babe Didrikson, Wilma Rudolph and Griffith Joyner. Years after her Olympic triumphs, she said: ''I suppose most Americans don't even recognize me. It happened so long ago I still can't believe the attention I get for something I did so long ago.''       
         Shirley Katzander, a public relations consultant who specialized in promoting cultural and political figures, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.         She had congestive heart failure, a friend, James A. Moore, said.         For nearly 20 years, Mrs. Katzander ran her own public relations company, which included among its clients at various times Reading Is Fundamental, a federally funded organization that encouraged reading among inner-city children, and Playboy magazine.         During the 1950's and 60's Mrs. Katzander was a fixture at The Reporter, the liberal, anti-Communist magazine edited by Max Ascoli. There she promoted the work of the magazine's writers, among them Meg Greenfield, Marya Mannes and George Bailey.         After the magazine closed in 1968, she worked briefly for Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York.         Mrs. Katzander was born Shirley Saltzman on Jan. 31, 1921, in Philadelphia. Almost immediately on graduation from high school, she was hired as a reporter at The Philadelphia Inquirer, covering the city's nightlife.         She married Howard L. Katzander, also a reporter, just as the war in Europe started. When it ended, they moved to Frankfurt, Germany, where Mr. Katzander wrote for Stars and Stripes and Mrs. Katzander was a copy editor. They returned to New York City in the early 1950's and divorced in 1957.         She is survived by a brother, Edward Saltzman of Somers Point, N.J.       
         Virginia Wise Marx, an educator and psychologist who dedicated herself to the care of children and their families, died last Sunday at White Plains Hospital. She was 93 and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.         Since the early 1930's, Mrs. Marx had been involved in community affairs and a wide array of agencies. She set up remedial programs in five school districts and helped establish Westchester County's first full-time child guidance clinic.         More recently she devoted herself to the creation and expansion of a day care center at Westchester Community College. Now known as the Virginia Marx Children's Center, it serves nearly 100 children.         Many of their parents are single mothers on public assistance who attend the college. She created another center at Teachers College, Columbia University, for training educators in child care.         She and her husband, a New York developer, endowed the Virginia and Leonard Marx Professorship in Child and Parent Development and Education at Teachers College in 1993, as well the Marx Lecture Series at Teachers College. That program allows the college to give a platform to top researchers in child development. She also served on the advisory board of the Center for Infants and Parents.         Born in St. Louis, she graduated with a degree in psychology from  Washington University, then received a master's in social work. She  earned a master's in child psychology at Teachers College and spent a fellowship year in clinical psychology at what was then its Child Guidance Institute.         Before her marriage in 1930, she  designed children's toys for Macy's and was a contributing editor for Parents magazine. Her quarterly articles advised readers about child development.         Among Mrs. Marx's beneficiaries were the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, where she was a trustee for over 40 years and a longtime member of its Child Development Center committee. She supported its training branch, the Selig Educational Institute, and the Center for the Study of Social Work Practice, a joint undertaking with Columbia.         Other charities included UJA-Federation of New York, White Plains Hospital Center, Scarsdale Edgemont Family Counseling Service, and Camp Rainbow, a UJA affiliate serving handicapped children. Her interest in American antique furniture fueled her support of the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Friends of American Art at Yale University, and the Art Museum of Sarah Lawrence College.         Mrs. Marx is survived by her husband; their son, Leonard Jr. of Greenwich, Conn.; two daughters, Mary Lynn Bianco of Los Angeles, and Jennifer Gruenberg of Scarsdale; two sisters, Muriel Ducibella of Orange, Conn., and Jane Smith of St. Louis; a brother, Rudolph Wise Jr. of Baldwin, Mo.; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Mae Bertha Carter, who defied gunfire and the loss of employment to send her children to previously all-white public schools in Mississippi, eventually winning a legal battle that confirmed their right to be there, died on April 28 at her home in Drew, Miss. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said Francine E. Cheeks, a spokeswoman for the American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia, a Quaker organization that supported Ms. Carter and many other black families in the civil rights struggle of the 1960's.         Ms. Carter was born on Jan. 13, 1923, in Sunflower County, Miss. She married Matthew Carter in 1939, and the couple became sharecroppers, raising 25 acres of cotton and sharing the income with the landowners, on Pemble Plantation, near Drew.         In the fall of 1965, just after the Carters had enrolled 7 of their 13 children in local white schools, the owner of the plantation told them to withdraw the children, saying they would receive a better education in a black school.         Ms. Carter's response was to take an old phonograph onto the porch and play a recording of a speech by President John F. Kennedy on civil rights.         ''I birthed those children and bore the pain,'' she later told her husband. Referring to the plantation owner, she said, ''He cannot tell me what to do about my children.''         Public schools throughout Mississippi were desegregated by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the state enacted what it called a freedom-of-choice law and used it to intimidate blacks into remaining at inferior black schools.         The Carters, however, resolutely kept their children in the once-segregated white schools, even though their house was once riddled with bullets in the middle of the night and they were eventually evicted, losing their income and their house.         From 1965 to 1968, the Carters were the only black family to keep their children in the county's schools.         In 1967 the Carters and Marian Wright Edelman, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., sued the Drew school district, challenging the state freedom-of-choice law. They won the suit in 1969, removing the last legal hurdle to the desegregation of Mississippi's public schools.         Eventually, eight of the Carter's children graduated from what had been all-white schools in Sunflower County; five older children graduated from local black schools. Eleven also graduated from college -- seven from the once-segregated University of Mississippi.         The story of the Carter family's battle was recounted in a book, ''Silver Rights'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1995) by Constance Curry, a field worker with the American Friends Service Committee in 1966, who worked closely with the family. The title is an old rural-black colloquial abridgment, noted by the novelist Alice Walker, of the phrase ''civil rights.''         Mrs. Carter's husband, Matthew, died in 1988. She is survived by five sons, Carl, of Columbus, Miss., Stanley, of Tulsa, Okla., Larry, of Hampton, Va., John, of Lake Charles, La., and Matthew Jr., of Conway, Ark.; eight daughters, Beverly Carter of Drew, Naomi Granberry of Cleveland, Miss., Pearl Owen and Deborah Smith, both of Oxford, Miss., Gloria Dickenson of Battle Creek, Mich., Ruth Whittle and Bertha Huckleby, both of Toledo, Ohio, and Edna Threats of Kansas City, Kan., 35 grandchildren and 36 great-grandchildren.       
         State Senator Wynona M. Lipman, who in 1971 became the first African-American woman to be elected to the New Jersey Senate, died Sunday at her home in Newark. She was 67.         The cause was cancer, her office said.         Senator Lipman, a Democrat who represented Newark, was the longest-serving member of the State Senate. For 27 years she championed the causes of women, minority groups, children and small businesses. One bill she sponsored that became law increased penalties for adults who patronize under-age prostitutes. Another broadened the statutes on domestic violence to protect more victims and increase services to the children of troubled families.         She sat on the Governor's Council on AIDS, the Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect and the New Jersey Court Team on Domestic Violence.         A native of Georgia, she was educated at Talladega College, Tulane University and Columbia University, where she received a doctorate in philosophy on a Rockefeller Grant. She studied at the Sorbonne as a Fulbright scholar and taught high school. While serving in the Senate, she was also an associate professor at Essex County College.         For years she was not only the sole black but also the lone woman in a house she called a ''men's club'' some years ago. She held ranking positions on important committees, including those dealing with human services, the budget and appropriations.         Senator Lipman's survivors include her daughter, Karyne Anne Lipman of Atlanta, and a sister, Eloise Ransome of Virginia.       
         Catherine Brandel, one of the quiet forces behind the culinary tide called California cuisine, died on Tuesday night at her home in Berkeley, Calif.  She was 56.         She had waged a long battle with a rare muscle cancer, said her brother, Michael Terry of Richland, Wash., who is her only survivor.         She was an illustrator, chef, forager and mentor to other chefs as well as a prize-winning hula dancer and  exuberant acolyte of Hawaiian culture. She was a leading expert in wild edible plants and an indefatigable supporter of small family farms.         She opened and championed farmers' markets throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, lobbied on behalf of organic growers and helped create a conduit running from several thousand small-scale farmers to top restaurants nationwide.         One of two children of a Navy officer, Ms. Brandel was born in Philadelphia and grew up ''all over the place,'' her brother said, ''but the place that really got under her skin was Hawaii.''         She grew up artistic and after a brief marriage studied art and anthropology at Barnard College and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley.         Although she earned a teaching degree, she worked as a scientific illustrator before making a life in food in Berkeley. Neither her brother nor her longtime friend Nilofer King knew how Ms. Brandel became obsessed with cooking.         ''I think she just loved to eat and to cook,'' Ms. King said. ''And back in the late 1960's, all that joy and celebration was just in the air.''         Unlike the flamboyant star chefs, Ms. Brandel staked out a quiet role for herself. Initially, she gathered wild fruits, nuts and greens for Chez Panisse, Alice Waters's now-famous restaurant in Berkeley, and with Julia Child she organized the Great Chefs of France cooking program at the Robert Mondavi Vineyards.         She had ''this rare attitude toward food, serious and happy at the same time,'' Mrs. Child said yesterday.         On a segment of ''20/20,'' Ms. Brandel, a mischievous but soft-spoken storyteller, regaled the audience with tales of her curious shopping adventures to supply the Great Chefs of France. Her expert foraging in the Berkeley and Napa Valley hills seemed tame compared with her quest for the rooster testicles required for one of Pierre Troisgros's dishes.         ''Catherine was an original,'' Ms. Waters said. ''She could find anything, cook anything, teach anything, and I'm not sure the restaurant could ever have happened without her.''         In 1988, Ms. Brandel was named co-chef of Chez Panisse and used her position to create some of the dishes it has become famous for, like tangles of wild greens served on brick-oven-fired olive oil focaccia or local cheeses turned into ravioli with wild onions, beets and hazelnuts. She also increased public awareness of the plight of American farmers.         Above all, Ms. Brandel was a teacher. Throughout her career, she was a mentor to young chefs. In 1994, she left Chez Panisse to help create the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in St. Helena, Calif., the California outpost of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. Her course, ''Ingredients, Flavor Dynamics and Techniques of Evaluation,'' was one of the most popular courses, said Gregory Drescher, Greystone's director.         ''Rather than simply teaching cooking techniques,'' he said, ''Ms.  Brandel taught taste.''       
         Meg Greenfield, the editor of The Washington Post's editorial page, who brought a combination of sharp-eyed analysis and wry wit to bear on a generation of the nation's policy makers and politicians, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. She was 68.         She died of cancer, said The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham. The cancer had been diagnosed three years before, but not until the last six weeks did the disease sap her strength enough to silence her tart editorial voice. Her last column appeared in The Post on March 15.         Fred Hiatt, an editorial-page colleague, said yesterday, ''When it was time for her column, no matter how her body was conspiring against her, she would summon this incredible force of will and turn out a column that the rest of us would envy.''         In four decades as a reporter, editorialist and quietly influential opinion maker in the nation's capital, Miss Greenfield provided a stream of informed commentary that had an impact on the public perception of six Presidential administrations and scores of policy debates, ranging from affirmative action and abortion rights to the Panama Canal treaties and the Persian Gulf war. In 1978, when she was The Post's deputy editorial page editor, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.         In her role as the newspaper's editorial-page editor for the last 20 years and as a columnist for Newsweek magazine for 25 years, Miss Greenfield pored over the details of policy with the passion of a political scientist and wrote of the complex architecture of democracy with reverence. She also perfected a tone of sly mockery and an eye for the absurd, both of which informed the best of her work.         ''Meg has had a big influence,'' said Jodie Allen, who was lured into journalism by Miss Greenfield and is now a senior writer at U.S. News & World Report. ''She set the tone of debate early, before it became conventional wisdom. It's hard to see, because so many things she pioneered, like neoliberalism, are now in the water supply.''         Though capable of a passion for social justice, she sometimes irritated the city's progressive circles with her skepticism about any government's abilities to keep fallible citizens up to some moral mark. She also arched an editorial eyebrow at what she considered blunderbuss attacks on the conservative policies of the Reagan Administration.         A hands-on manager of both the editorial and op-ed pages of The Post, Miss Greenfield also spotted and showcased intellectual talent. Washington writers and commentators, including George Will, Michael Kinsley, Roger W. Wilkins and Charles Kraut hammer credit Miss Greenfield with starting or fast-forwarding their careers.         Her friends and confidants were legion, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board. Miss Greenfield's diminutive figure was a fixture in the elite dining rooms of Georgetown, where she lived near the home of her employer, who was also among her closest friends, Katharine Graham, the chairwoman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company, which owns both The Post and Newsweek. She was also close to Mrs. Graham's son, Donald, who is the company's current chairman and chief executive as well as The Post's publisher.         ''Meg was unique in her mind, character, and affinity for hard work,'' Mrs. Graham said in a statement yesterday. ''She was both brilliant and funny, a writer and an editor of amazing ability. She will be missed by all those affected by her original, independent thinking, by her family, her colleagues, and her close friends.''         As an editorialist, she was both a judge and a connoisseur of the foibles of the city's political and intellectual elites. ''Her mark was her obliqueness,'' Mr. Will said. ''Most columnists are Hemingway. She's Henry James, using understatement, nuance, indirection. It lasts better.''         Though missing in action from the televised punditry that began to dominate the nation's political discussion in the 1980's and 1990's, Miss Greenfield wielded her influence in many other venues, from the dinner parties of the powerful to the Columbia University offices where, from 1986 to 1995, she sat in judgment on her colleagues' work as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board.         She also had a keen sensibility for literature, history, fact and hypocrisy, and what dose of each goes into a person's reputation. That sensibility shone through one of her last columns, ''Goodbye, Columbus,'' in which she discussed the attitude of President Clinton's supporters toward Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia.         ''Senator Byrd was seen for a time as just another starchy, retrograde legislator, all hung up on the archaic lore of the Senate, ceaselessly spouting citations and precedents from the Constitution,'' she wrote. ''To be rude about it, as they were, they dismissed him as a bore.         ''But when it became apparent that his inclination and his own studies were leading him not to a love of Clinton or even to a degree of political solidarity with him, let alone any sympathy for what he did, but rather to conclusions about the Constitution that would be advantageous to Clinton, all that quickly changed. Byrd became in the Clinton supporters' depiction a great Roman statesman, a man beyond reproach -- a living, walking, breathing toga.''         Mary Ellen Greenfield -- she derived Meg from her initials -- was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Seattle, where her father, Lewis Greenfield, ran an antiques business. She graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1952, with a major in English literature, then spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar at Cambridge University in England, specializing in William Blake's works.         After considering an academic career, Miss Greenfield decided on journalism instead, joining The Reporter, a magazine of analysis and commentary, in 1957 as a researcher in its Washington bureau.         After three years of largely anonymous work, she published, in the heat of the 1960 Presidential campaign between Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy, a scathing intellectual profile of Mr. Nixon.         ''Refusal to answer a question by setting up a straw man to attack instead is a not uncommon device of debating,'' she wrote. ''But in Nixon's prose the straw man emerges as more than a debating device: it is an innate feature of his thinking. Nixon apparently finds it almost impossible to make a statement that is not, in some manner, an argument. Ideas never quite exist for him until they have been pitted against something else -- an extreme danger, a radically different point of view, or a potential attack from some sinister quarter.''         Miss Greenfield was promoted to staff writer at the magazine in 1961 and in 1965 became its Washington editor. When The Reporter shut down in 1968, Miss Greenfield became the first person hired by Philip Geyelin, the newly appointed editorial page editor of The Washington Post. One of Mr. Geyelin's early goals was to turn The Post away from the hawkish stance on the Vietnam War favored by its departing editorial page editor, J. Russell Wiggins.         As Mr. Geyelin and Mrs. Graham recount it, Miss Greenfield paid a courtesy call on Mr. Wiggins. Afterward, the unreconstructed cold warrior said to his dovish successor: ''My boy, you're making the mistake of your life. She's on my side.''         Few others would try to pigeonhole Miss Greenfield in the years that followed.         A year after she arrived at The Post, Mr. Geyelin made Miss Greenfield his deputy. A decade later, she replaced him. Even though she rose to the top of her profession during the years that saw the rise of the feminist movement, Miss Greenfield kept a studied distance from it.         Still, Miss Greenfield gleefully skewered some of the racism and sexism of the city's journalistic culture. In 1970, she solicited an op-ed article from Mr. Wilkins, a prominent black intellectual and policy analyst, about the Gridiron Dinner.         The piece focused on the raw humor featured at the dinner, which is an annual off-the-record event that brings the city's journalistic and political elites together for assorted high jinks. ''It was a piece that really kind of blew the town apart because people were not supposed to write about the Gridiron and I wrote about how racist that particular dinner was,'' Mr. Wilkins said.         Miss Greenfield and Mrs. Graham toured another Gridiron from the outside, trying to get a feel for the women's protests while ducking behind the dashboard of a car to avoid being seen. After the barriers fell, Miss Greenfield was a frequent guest at Gridiron dinners, attending the most recent one earlier this year.         An avid reader of literature, Miss Greenfield studied Latin in the 1970's so she could read more classic works. She was also a perennial on the college commencement circuit, receiving honorary degrees from Smith, Georgetown University, Wesleyan University, Williams College and Princeton University.         When she first became ill with lung cancer, Miss Greenfield returned to the region where she grew up and bought a home in the Puget Sound area. The property also allowed her more time to see her nephews and nieces. Her late brother's five children are her only remaining relatives.         In 1980, she wrote a mock lament to the knee-jerk excesses of her chosen profession. The piece was inspired by an embarrassing mistake at The Boston Globe that let a joke headline, ''More Mush From the Wimp,'' sneak into the newspaper over an editorial about a speech by President Jimmy Carter. After 100,000 copies were on the street, it was replaced with the headline ''All Must Share the Burden.''         ''That's the part that got us,'' Miss Greenfield wrote. ''All Must Share the Burden.'' She continued: ''Just put us in the presence of that headline and, we can't help ourselves, we start automatically and compulsively writing the editorial that goes with it. It's all about how men of good will should cease the bootless acrimony as there can be no winners in this tragic dispute and the biggest losers of all will be -- are you ready? -- well, of course, the nation's children.''         She added: ''When the end of the world finally comes about and editorial writers are all called to judgment, it won't be the headline pranks run amok, that sort of thing, that will get us. No, it will be all those other miles of editorial prose that fit so nicely under the headline ''All Must Share the Burden'' for which we will, collectively, fry.''       
         Kirsten Ralov, one of Denmark's greatest ballerinas and an authority on the unusually sparkling Danish style of classical dancing, died on Sunday at her home in Copenhagen. She was 77.         The cause was cancer, said Ebbe Mork, a dance writer in Copenhagen.         Miss Ralov was celebrated for her performances in the ballets of August Bournonville, the 19th-century Danish choreographer whose works emphasize a charming stage presence and fleet and light footwork. Associated with the Royal Danish Ballet throughout her career, Miss Ralov entered its school in 1922 and spent her artistic life from childhood to maturity on the stage of the Royal Theater in Copenhagen.         Her first major performances were in Bournonville ballets: she made her theatrical debut in a children's role in ''Konservatoriet'' in 1933 and received her first solo part as an adult dancer in ''La Ventana'' in 1941. She gave her farewell performance as the Ballerina Doll in Michel Fokine's ''Petrouchka'' in 1962. She then served as a ballet mistress for the Royal Danish Ballet and was its associate director from 1978 to 1988.         Miss Ralov's repertory in Copenhagen ranged from Myrta, the evil queen of the spirits in ''Giselle,'' to the sophisticated Street Dancer in Leonide Massine's ''Beau Danube''; she also danced a solo role in George Balanchine's abstract ''Symphony in C.'' But she was essentially a Bournonville specialist, starring in ballets like ''Napoli,'' ''The Kermesse in Bruges'' and ''A Folk Tale.''         Miss Ralov also did much to acquaint the world with Danish ballet. She and her husband, Fredbjorn Bjornsson, who died in 1993, were among the first Danish dancers to tour internationally, appearing with a small group of soloists at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1955 and with the full Royal Danish Ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1956.         After her retirement as a performer, Miss Ralov staged Bournonville productions for many companies.         She is survived by two sons.

         Wilmina Rowland Smith, who in 1971 became the first woman to serve as a guest chaplain of the Senate, died on June 5 at a retirement home in St. Petersburg, Fla. She was 91.         Billie Rowland, as she was known, was born in Augusta, Ga., on March 17, 1908, and received bachelor's degree from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa. She also earned master's degrees from Yale University and Union Theological Seminary in New York.         After college she traveled widely,  settling for a time in China to teach the children of American missionaries.         She worked for World Student Relief in Geneva after World War II, and in 1957 became the sixth woman to be ordained by the Presbyterian Church USA.         In the early 1960's, she was a staff member of the National Council of Churches in Greenville, Miss. She retired in 1973, two years after giving the opening prayer at a Senate session.         Her husband, H. Maxcy Smith, died in 1985.       
         Dolores Jimenez Alcantara, a blind singer who was one of Spain's leading flamenco artists, died on June 14 in a hospital in Malaga. She was 90.         Onstage Ms. Jimenez wore dark glasses and typically performed while standing, supporting herself with one hand placed on the back of a chair. She performed publicly until the late 1980's under the stage name La Nina de la Puebla (The Girl From  the Village) and was best known for her rendition of ''Los Campanilleros'' (''The Bell Ringers''), a popular Spanish ballad about children's folkloric choirs.         The daughter of a singing barber from Seville province, Ms. Jimenez was born on July 28, 1908, in La Puebla de Cazalla, which gave rise to her nickname. She had an eye infection when very young, and improper treatment caused permanent blindness.         Ms. Jimenez began musical instruction at age 8 when her family moved to Madrid. She warmed gradually to flamenco, received her first contract at 14 and gained a following after a successful performance at a festival in Moron de la Frontera, southeast of Seville, at 20.         In 1931, she made her debut in Seville and a year later, in Madrid. She took ''Los Campanilleros'' and moved it definitively into the realm of flamenco.         A fellow flamenco singer, Manuel Torre, earlier had converted the same spirited ballad into a melancholy flamenco song. But Ms. Jimenez's version was lighter, peppery, more accessible yet still mournful. The song became her trademark, and she performed it with traveling troupes known as flamenco operas, which appeared in bullrings and theaters.         She spent decades fashioning countless other songs in a style that flamenco experts often described as dulce, or sweet. She was comfortable performing much of the flamenco repertory and its multiple forms of haunting melodies and staccato laments.         In 1934 she married a fellow singer, Lucas Soto Martin, known professionally as Luquitas de Marchena.  He died in 1965. Their five children --  two of whom, Adelfa and Pepe, are professional flamenco performers --  survive her.         Ms. Jimenez had been scheduled to receive a gold medal from King Juan Carlos I for Merit in Fine Arts. The authorities will now deliver the award to her family.       
         Cecilia Danieli,  who helped revolutionize the world steel industry by developing the compact steel mills known in the industry as minimills, died last Thursday of cancer. She was 56.         Though women made broad strides in Italian business in her lifetime, Ms. Danieli was one of a handful who reached the top in the male domain of heavy industry. Her presence at the top, she once said, meant that Danieli consistently boasted a higher percentage of women in management posts than Italian companies of comparable size.         The company she ran, Danieli Group, founded by her grandfather in the family's hometown of Buttrio in Northern Italy, developed in the 1950's from a small manufacturer of scissors and shears to a supplier of compact steel mills to small Northern Italian steelmakers that mainly supplied the steel reinforcing bars that were the sinews of postwar Italian reconstruction.         Beginning in the 1970's, the company began shipping its engineers abroad to build mills in places like Mozambique to produce steel bars or rolling mills in the United States. These mills revolutionized steelmaking and tilted the market away from the developed world by giving scores of countries in Africa, South America and the East Asia the means to produce steel cheaply and efficiently. They ultimately led, in highly industrialized countries like the United States, to the decline of traditional big steel mills and their replacement by smaller, more flexible minimills.         Ms. Danieli, one of four sisters, was forced to take charge of the family company founded by her grandfather in 1914 in the mid-1970's, when the oil price increases in the first half of that decade drained the capital to invest in steel and scuttled further expansion. In 1976, the company posted its first loss ever. That year, she assumed the top position of managing director next to her father, Luigi, who remained president of the company but concentrated on the engineering side of the business.         She quickly rejuvenated Danieli's management, then gained a major breakthrough when the company captured a $240 million contract for a steel mill in the former East Germany from its nearest competitor, the giant Krupp group of the former West Germany. She also expanded sales in North and South America, Asia and the former Soviet Union.         In addition to its Italian headquarters, the company, with roughly 3,000 employees, had affiliates in Youngstown, Ohio, and in Sweden.         In 1984, to keep the company financially as well as technologically fit, Ms. Danieli took the unusual step for Italian family-run companies, and against the opposition of her more traditional father, of listing Danieli on the stock exchange. About 54 percent of the company remained controlled by her and Gianpietro Benedetti, her companion, with whom she shared management of the company in recent years.         Ms. Danieli entered the company in 1969 after earning a degree in economics at nearby Trieste University. A fluent English speaker, she once worked as a student for a summer on a truck farm near Schuylerville, N.Y. She avoided the limelight often favored by Italian executives. But Danieli's business success reflected her drive for technical superiority and her untiring sales efforts. A passionate student of history and a mountain climber, in the mid-1990's she once spent Christmas Day in the mountains of Iran to negotiate a sale.         She is survived by Mr. Benedetti and three children.       
         Rose Kryzak, an outspoken lobbyist for the rights of the elderly who was once credited with getting a utility charge overturned as unfair to older people, died on Thursday at her home in Queens. She was 99.         She first came to the public's attention in 1976, when she argued at a Federal Power Commission hearing in Washington that utility companies should not be allowed to pass along to customers -- many of whom were elderly people with restricted incomes -- the cost of plants that were still under construction and not producing power.         Mrs. Kryzak, then 75, bluntly challenged the lawyers and bankers who represented the utilities. ''We cannot afford plants that most of us would not live to enjoy,'' she said.         The commission decided not to allow such charges except in hardship cases, and The New York Times attributed the decision to the ''Kryzak problem.''         Mrs. Kryzak's victory was not final. In 1987, after the name of the agency had been changed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the utilities won the right to request rate increases that would cover up to 50 percent of the costs of plants under construction.         Mrs. Kryzak also helped organize groups of the elderly throughout New York State to lobby for a state-financed pharmaceutical plan to assist in paying for prescription drugs, worked to eliminate mandatory retirement laws and was vocal on increasing state supplements for Social Security.         Mrs. Kryzak, a member of the American Communist Party throughout her life, was one of the principal subjects interviewed for the documentary ''Seeing Red,'' shown at the New York Film Festival in 1983.         ''She held to her belief throughout her life,'' her son, Thomas, said. ''She refused to accept that there was any problem with the Soviet Union. Partly, it was patriotism for the old country. Both she and my father, who died in 1985, were born in Russia before the Revolution.         ''They considered themselves pioneers,'' he said, ''going down the road that this country should go down.''         Mrs. Kryzak, who was born on Oct. 15, 1899, was the oldest of six children. Her family immigrated to the United States in 1910. Her father, Isaac Marron, was an early member of the House Painters Union and a Socialist.         Mrs. Kryzak worked her entire adult life for an actuary until retiring in 1972.         In addition to her son, Thomas, of Fresh Meadows, Queens, she is survived by a daughter, Ann Herman of Lakeland, Fla., five grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.       
         Christina Foyle, London's best known bookseller and the creator and hostess of Britain's most famous literary luncheon series, died on Tuesday at her country home, Beeleigh Abbey, near Maldon in Essex. She was 88.         An autocratic boss who resisted commercial and technological innovation, paid her staff meager salaries and abhorred labor unions, she was the owner of Foyle's, the vast bookstore on Charing Cross Road in the city's West End, which at one time had more than 30 miles of shelves full of books.         Wealthy and eccentric, she boasted that she had never done her own housework or cooked her own meals, and that she drank only champagne. Even in her last years, she said that she continued to read an entire book every day.         The company W. & G. Foyle Ltd.  was begun in 1904 by her father, William, and her uncle Gilbert after they failed their Civil Service exams and advertised their preparation books for sale. They found there was a market for technical texts, and they went into business at their home in North London.         They moved into the present building at 119 Charing Cross Road, with its five warehouse-sized floors, in 1929. Miss Foyle, as she always preferred to be called, went to work there when she was 17 and became the managing director when her father died in 1963.         Buttressed by absolute power and her considerable fortune, she resisted all calls for modernization of the store's fusty sales practices. Foyle's long refused to take orders by phone and until this decade banned cash registers and calculators, insisting that all reckoning be done by hand.  Though famed for her determination and a gaze that could flash with impatience, Miss Foyle spoke in a high-pitched voice that one listener likened to the sound of someone who had just inhaled helium.         Finding the book you wanted from the ramshackle stacks in the dimly lit and chaotic shop was known to be such a trial that a competitor created bus stop posters saying, ''Foyled Again? Try Dillon's.'' Volumes were shelved by the names of their publishers rather than by their authors, and guidance was hard to get from the poorly paid staff, who often were newly arrived in London and had limited knowledge of English. A customer who once asked for ''Ulysses'' was told he had gone to lunch.         For decades Miss Foyle maintained a system of purchase that required obtaining a receipt and getting in line three times before finally reaching the desk where the book waited. In a much repeated comment, one survivor said, ''Imagine Kafka had gone into the book trade.''         Still, enough people preferred its gothic habits to the supermarket efficiency of modern bookstores to keep its aisles filled, and Miss Foyle's personal wealth covered any operating losses. Its quirky, anachronistic personality also turned it into a tourist destination, and it attracted as  many people as it infuriated. She turned aside all offers to buy the business or to take it public, disliking the thought of being accountable to shareholders as much as that of dealing with trade unions.         She began the literary lunches that continue to this day in 1930. She got the inspiration for them one morning behind the counter when an older man asked her to suggest a book for a train trip. She said she had just read ''The Forsyte Saga'' and could heartily recommend it. The customer bought a copy and left the shop, returning a little later to hand it back. It was inscribed, ''For the young lady who liked my book -- John Galsworthy.''         Excited by this personal contact with a famous writer, she dreamed up the idea of the monthly lunch so that outsiders could mingle with the literary set. Held at the Dorchester and Grosvenor House hotels, the occasions were derided as events for suburban ladies in fur hats, but they attracted a notable list of speakers. Among them were H. G. Wells, Evelyn Waugh, Kingsley Amis, Yehudi Menuhin, Charles Chaplin, Philip Larkin, D. H. Lawrence, Haile Selassie, Charles de Gaulle, Margaret Thatcher, Edith Sitwell, J. B. Priestley, Harold Macmillan and George Bernard Shaw.         She refused to let messages of regret be read out at her fetes, saying: ''The people who do come are the important ones; I don't bother about the others.''         Shaw complained after his meal that she had forgotten he was a vegetarian, but when she offered to invite him back with a promise of nothing but green fare, he declined in a note saying, ''I could not bear the noise of 2,000 people eating celery.''         Asked who had been the most boring literary lunch guest, she always told the story of Sir Walter Gilbey, director of the gin-making company. ''He spoke for one and a half hours,'' she said. ''A man in front of my father fell asleep so he hit the chap with the toastmaster's gavel. The man said: 'Hit me again. I can still hear him.' ''         Christina Agnes Lilian Foyle was born in London on Jan. 30, 1911, and went to boarding school in Hertfordshire and a finishing school at Wilderswil in Switzerland before beginning work in her father's shop.         In 1938 she married Ronald Batty, a childhood friend and executive at Foyle's. He died in 1994. The couple had no children, but at Beeleigh Abbey, their 12th-century home, she kept cats, dogs, peacocks and tortoises. ''Animals are always loyal and love you,'' she said, ''whereas with children you never know where you are''         When the other woman in British life who was often referred to as the Iron Lady lost her job, Miss Foyle was asked for her reaction. ''It's a shame about Mrs. Thatcher,'' she said. ''Luckily they can't chuck me out. I own the place, you see.''       
         Marguerite W. Cullman, a longtime theatrical investor who was also an author, died yesterday in her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 94, and her main residence was in Purchase, N.Y.         After working as an editor of the old Stage magazine, Mrs. Cullman began investing with her husband, Howard S. Cullman, who was chairman of what was then called the Port of New York Authority and was prominent in the tobacco industry, serving on the board of Philip Morris  Inc. He died in 1972.         The couple began investing in Broadway productions in the 1930's because, as their children said yesterday, while Mrs. Cullman worked at Stage she liked to be sure that a play the magazine wrote about would not fold before the next issue appeared.         As a family story has it, Mrs. Cullman proved prescient in guessing on behalf of the magazine which plays would prove durable. When her husband learned that, he proposed that she read the scripts of forthcoming Broadway productions and he study the financial prospectuses issued by their producers.         After Mrs. Cullman left the magazine, the couple began their investing, which continued into the 1970's and brought them renown for their shrewdness and energy.         Robert Whitehead, the theatrical producer, recalled last night, ''I could see that she got a kick out of the theater and a kick out of being associated with it through investment.''         Among the hits that the Cullmans helped bring to the stage were ''Life With Father,'' ''Oklahoma!,'' ''Carousel,'' ''Brigadoon,'' ''South Pacific,'' ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Teahouse of the August Moon,'' ''Death of Salesman'' and ''A Streetcar Named Desire.''         During the 1940's and 1950's, their children said, the couple's success rate was so high that their participation in a forthcoming show was enough to guarantee its full funding.         Marguerite Sanders, as she then was, was born and reared in Manhattan, attended Columbia University, worked as a writer and editor for the McNaught Newspaper Syndicate and contributed articles to The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker and other publications.         In addition, she wrote two books, ''Occupation Angel'' (1962), about Broadway, and ''Ninety Dozen Glasses'' (1960), about her life with Mr. Cullman in 1958, when he was the United States Commissioner for the World's Fair in Brussels.         She was also vice chairman of the Lighthouse for the Blind and served on the board of the Spence-Chapin Home for Adoption.         An early marriage was annulled. She married Mr. Cullman in 1935.         She is survived by a daughter, Marguerite P. Cullman of Severna Park, Md.; a son, Brian Henry Cullman of Manhattan; two stepsons, Hugh Cullman of Beaufort, N.C., and Paul T. Cullman of Ferndale, Wash.; 12 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren.       
         Anne Richardson, former chairwoman of Reading Is Fundamental, the nation's largest organization promoting children's literacy, died on Monday at a hospital in Cheverly, Md. She was 69 and lived in Mitchellville, Md., a Washington suburb, with her husband, former Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson.         The cause of death was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her son Henry.         Ms. Richardson was a founding member of Reading Is Fundamental and served as its chairwoman from  1981 to 1996. By the time she stepped down, the number of children the organization was serving had grown to 3.7 million from 3 million, the volunteer force to 219,000 from about 100,000, and Federal financing to $13.2 million from $7.6 million.         Ms. Richardson was born Anne Francis Hazard on Dec. 5, 1929, in Providence, R.I., the fourth of five children of a Rhode Island state senator. She graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe and later served on the Harvard University board of overseers.         In addition to her husband and her son Henry, who lives in Washington, she is survived by two other children, Nancy Carlson of St. George, Vt., and Michael Richardson of Upper Montclair, N.J.; a sister, Mary Conrad of Albuquerque, N.M.; two brothers, T. P. Hazard Jr. of Rockville, Md., and Oliver C. Hazard of Bedford, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.       
         Sola Sierra, who campaigned to bring to justice those responsible for the death of her husband and hundreds of other Chilean dissidents during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, died on July 1 at a hospital in Santiago, Chile, where she lived. She was 63.         She died of a heart attack during surgery for a back injury suffered in a fall several months ago, according to Jim Foster, a spokesman with the United States Embassy in Santiago.         Mrs. Sierra spent 23 years doing human rights work in Chile after her husband disappeared in 1976. Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Washington, said,  ''Anyone who was involved in human rights work at that time in Chile, especially taking the lead, was courageous.''         In 1984 she became president of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared, an organization that seeks an accounting of those who vanished under General Pinochet and prosecution of those involved in their deaths.         In the past year, she led protests in London in support of General Pinochet's house arrest there on a Spanish extradition warrant. An extradition hearing is scheduled for Sept. 27. The general, now 83, is charged with ordering torture and other crimes during his years in power, from 1973 to 1990.         ''The most important thing, the most crucial thing, was her perseverance, her unwavering dedication to this cause,'' said Apolonia Ramirez Caballero, who from 1976 to 1981 was one of the coordinators of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         Mrs. Sierra was born on Dec. 1, 1935, in Santiago and grew up in poverty, leaving school in her teens to help support her family. She worked for several years as a community worker for the Ministry of Social Development and Planning. She married Waldo Pizarro in 1962 and settled into a life as a working-class wife and, later, mother of three children.         In 1973, in a right-wing coup backed by the American Government, General Pinochet overthrew the Government of Salvador Allende Gossens, a democratically elected Marxist. And on Dec. 15, 1976, Mr. Pizarro, a Communist and labor activist, disappeared. It is presumed that he was taken prisoner and killed by agents from the DINA, a secret police run by the Chilean armed forces.         More than 1,100 Chileans who disappeared under General Pinochet are still unaccounted for.         Two days after Mr. Pizarro vanished, Mrs. Sierra and her children moved in with a sister, Adrina Sierra, whose support allowed her the time to search for her husband and work with the Association for the Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         In addition to her sister, Mrs. Sierra is survived by her son, Waldo Pizarro Jr. of Santiago; two daughters, Lenia Pizarro and Lorena Pizarro, both of Santiago, and eight other brothers and sisters.         Mrs. Sierra was often seen at human rights demonstrations in Chile, a black-and-white photograph of Mr. Pizarro hanging around her neck.         Over the years, the group she led discovered about 180 bodies of Pinochet prisoners, but no one has been convicted in connection with the deaths and disappearances. Since 1978, an amnesty has given members of the DINA and military leaders immunity from prosecution .         Mrs. Sierra was uncompromising in seeking not only the fate and bodies of the disappeared but also the revocation of the amnesty.         Mrs. Sierra was both a sympathetic and controversial figure in Chile, where many would prefer to forget about the dark side of General Pinochet's rule. Prominent foreign visitors, however, eagerly met with her. The rock star Sting wrote a song about her organization called ''They Dance Alone.''         The current democratic Government in Chile issued a statement mourning Ms. Sierra's death.         Secretary General Carlos Mladinic, who represented the Government at her funeral, said he understood the pain she must have felt. ''Unfortunately, people continue dying in Chile without knowing the truth,'' Mr. Mladinic said. 'I hope that in the near future this pain will end.''       
         Sherley Anne Williams, a daughter of migrant workers who became an award-winning novelist, poet and playwright as well as a professor at the University of California, died on July 6 at a hospital in San Diego. She was 54 and lived in San Diego.         The cause was cancer, Kate Callen, a university spokeswoman, said.         Ms. Williams fused her experiences in the dusty cotton fields and fruit orchards of the San Joaquin Valley with historical research to articulate the African-American experience.         In 1986, when she was already a celebrated poet, she ventured successfully into fiction with the historical novel ''Dessa Rose.''         A story of relationships, particularly the one between a privileged Charleston bride and a young pregnant slave sentenced to die after the birth of her baby, the work was praised by David Bradley in The New York Times as ''artistically brilliant, emotionally affecting and totally unforgettable.''         Ms. Williams's language, infused with rhythm and image, transcended the boundaries of genre.         ''While Ms. Williams shows that she can write a novel better than a lot of novelists, nowhere does she cut herself off from her poetic roots,'' wrote Mr. Bradley, citing a passage in which the character Dessa recalls her lover, Kaine:         ''Kaine, his voice high and clear as running water over a settled stream bed, swooping to her through her. . . . He walked the lane between the indifferently rowed cabins like he owned them, striding from shade into half-light as if he could halt the setting sun. . . . Talk as beautiful as his touch. . . . Kaine's eyes had been the color of lemon tea and honey. Even now against closed eyelids, she could see them.''         At her death, Ms. Williams was working on a sequel to ''Dessa Rose'' and on a novel set in the 20th century.         Her first book of verse, ''The Peacock Poems,'' was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award in 1975.         She won an Emmy Award for a television performance of poems from her second book of verse, ''Some One Sweet Angel Chile,'' which was another National Book Award nominee. Her one-woman drama, ''Letters From a New England Negro,'' was performed at the National Black Theater Festival in 1991 and at the Chicago International Theater Festival in 1992.         ''Working Cotton,'' a 1992 children's tale, won an American Library Association Caldecott Award and a Coretta Scott King Book Award, and was listed among the best books of 1992 by Parents magazine. Ms. Williams had recently published a second children's book, ''Girls Together.''         Born in Bakersfield, Calif., she grew up in Fresno, where her family worked as migrant workers. Her father died when she was 8, her mother when she was 16. After that she survived by picking crops in the same fields where her parents had toiled. Her upbringing, she later said, ''was the most deprived, provincial kind of existence you can think of.''         Though an impassioned reader, Ms. Williams had been discouraged from that activity by her mother, who felt she might be introduced to ambitions she would have no possibility of fulfilling. But in the eighth grade, a science teacher saw promise and urged her to enroll in college preparatory courses. In high school, she realized a love of language and was encouraged to apply to college.         The change was unsettling, she later recounted. ''To go from having no prospects at all to having seemingly limitless opportunity . . . well, in my case, I feel I just wasn't prepared for seemingly limitless opportunity.''         As a freshman at Fresno State University, she discovered the work of Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown, who she claimed were her earliest influences. ''I was just captivated by their language, their speech and their character because I always liked the way black people talk,'' she said. ''So I wanted to work that in writing.''         After completing a master's degree in American literature at Brown University, she joined the literature department at the University of California at San Diego in 1973 and remained there until shortly before her death.         She is survived by a son, John Malcolm Stewart of Lancaster, Calif.; a sister, Ruby Birdson, and three grandchildren.       
         Celestine Sibley, an Atlanta newspaper columnist who for 55 years wrote about the commonplaces of Southern life in a prose as soothing as the hum of cicadas in summer, died on Sunday at her vacation home on Dog Island, Fla.         Ms. Sibley was 85, and her last column was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on July 25.         In it, she writes of her own invalid's insomnia, when her thoughts turn to Key lime pie (''you stumble a bit fishing it out of the refrigerator, and Key lime has a tendency to slither'') and quilts (''when they are old and faded and weightless, you pull them up and remember the women who made them and the families they 'kivvered' with them'').         There were few regional columnists who could match Ms. Sibley for longevity, although the columnist Herb Caen of The San Francisco Chronicle did stretch his career over 58 years before his death in 1997.         But unlike other proud regional voices -- Mike Royko in Chicago or Atlanta's own Ralph McGill -- Ms. Sibley was not forceful as she passed on her musings about minutiae: choosing a Christmas tree, baking a pie, daydreaming about a Civil War battle and forgetting to pay a toll in the process. Echoes of the novelist Margaret Mitchell's ability to describe and evoke nostalgia run throughout Ms. Sibley's work.         ''It was a country-girl-come-to-the-city kind of column,'' said Bill Kovach, a former editor of The Journal-Constitution, who is curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. ''She was the last voice of the white-glove, tea-and-apple-blossom set that had not a sharp edge on it.''         Ms. Sibley was born near Pensacola, Fla., and joined The Atlanta Constitution as a reporter in 1941, covering murder trials and Georgia Statehouse politics. She was assigned her first column in 1944 when she had to take time away from the office to be with her children.         ''For generations and generations of Georgians, she embodied the South, the simple, folksy, homespun South,'' said Cynthia Tucker, the editorial page editor of The Constitution. But, Ms. Tucker cautioned, Ms. Sibley ''was not as one-dimensional'' as her columns about gardens and scotch pines, dogwoods and azaleas  might indicate. ''This was an intelligent woman with a lot of backbone,'' she said.         An article in The Journal-Constitution last week described Ms. Sibley's rebuff to Gov. Jimmy Carter after he had sent a letter to every state legislator disputing an article she had written about the legislative maneuvering involving one of the Governor's bills. When Mr. Carter invited her to his office to discuss the issue, she refused, saying, ''You mean you want to insult me publicly and apologize in private.''         And years after the racial turmoil of the 1960's that transformed the South, Ms. Sibley wrote a 1990 column about the movie ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' marked by a sharpness and almost rueful tone. Writing of a scene in the movie when painfully complacent Atlantans hear themselves chastised for inaction in the civil rights battles, Ms. Sibley said, ''It was an Atlanta attitude at the time, and many Atlantans took it like Miss Daisy, listening and looking at the empty chair beside her where her black servant and best friend, Hoke, should have been sitting if her courage had matched her good will.''         Ms. Sibley also wrote 25 books, most of them mystery novels, including some that featured Kate Kincaid, a reporter at The Atlanta Searchlight.         Her first husband, Jim Little, died  at age 45. Her second husband, James Strong, died in 1988. She is survived by two daughters, Susan Sibley Little Bazemore of Des Moines and Mary Everitt Little-Vance of Roswell, Ga.; a son, James W. Little 5th of Alford, Fla.; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Joan Braden, a former State Department official who was a hostess and friend to high-ranking Washington figures and whose eight children inspired the ABC television series ''Eight Is Enough,'' died on Monday in Alexandria, Va. She was 77 and a longtime resident of the Washington area.         The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported. Mrs. Braden collapsed at Sutton Place Gourmet, a food store in Alexandria,  and was pronounced dead at a local hospital.         For two years beginning in 1976, Mrs. Braden was the State Department's coordinator of consumer affairs and special assistant to the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. She had also been an aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller and had worked in political campaigns for  John and Robert Kennedy.         The 1975 book ''Eight Is Enough,'' by her husband, Tom Braden, tells of their family of eight children. In 1977 the book was adapted as the ABC series, starring Dick Van Patten, which was broadcast by the network until 1981.         In the book, Mr. Braden, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate from 1968 to 1986, described his wife's personality: ''She's blithe. That's what it is about her, and that is why she is so everlastingly cheerful.''         By 1976, when Mrs. Braden took up her State Department posts, her friends included Vice President  Rockefeller, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and many other powerful figures, who would assemble at the Bradens' large yellow clapboard house in Chevy Chase, Md., a Washington suburb.         According to those who dined there, the food was simple but good,  and the furniture pleasant and necessarily childproof. There were always flowers and candles and, if the weather was right, a fireplace ablaze.         But it was not those things that made Mrs. Braden's dinner parties special, and her invitations a status symbol.         Rather, it was said in Washington, the main magnet was Mrs. Braden herself, a slight woman (5 feet 5 inches tall, admittedly too thin at 103  pounds) with short auburn hair and a wide smile -- blithe, as her husband said, and everlastingly cheerful.         Mrs. Braden herself wrote a book, ''Just Enough Rope: An Intimate Memoir'' (1989). Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Maureen Dowd said, ''Joan Braden has taken a lot of heat for this book, which has been criticized as a vapid kiss-and-sell by a Washington society hostess with the capital's most notorious 'open' marriage.''         ''The title refers to the amount of freedom the author has received from her husband,'' Ms. Dowd wrote.  ''Washington insiders, however, sniff that it also alludes to the fact that she has hanged herself with this 'intimate memoir.' ''         But ''this reviewer does not take such a harsh view,'' Ms. Dowd continued, adding that after all, how can a book be all bad that features ''a shower scene with Nelson Rockefeller, a bedroom scene with Bobby Kennedy, a toe-tingling lunch with Kirk Douglas and an account of Frank Sinatra singing 'High Hopes' without his toupee?''         Mrs. Braden was born Joan Ridley in Indianapolis, and was reared in the nearby town of Anderson and in Washington. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Northwestern University, and  worked in the Pentagon during World War II.         From 1946 to 1951, she was an assistant to Mr. Rockefeller, who was then in the middle of a succession of Federal posts he filled before becoming Governor of New York in 1959. She went on to be a special assistant for public relations to  Oveta Culp Hobby, the Eisenhower Administration's Secretary of  Health, Education and Welfare.         Later she and her husband moved to California, where Mr. Braden -- with the assistance of a $100,000 loan from Mr. Rockefeller, whom he had known for years -- bought a small daily newspaper, The Oceanside Blade-Tribune. Mr. Braden published the paper for more than 13 years before selling it to South Coast Newspapers for $1.6 million.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Braden's survivors include five daughters, Mary Poole of Alexandria, Joan Ridder of Denver, Susan Zarker of Takoma Park, Md., and Nancy and Elizabeth Braden, both of Denver; two sons, David, who lives in Taiwan, and Nicholas, of Alexandria, and 12 grandchldren. One of the Bradens' sons, Tom, died in 1994.       
         She had not even known exactly what the word ''philanthropy'' meant, but the elderly washerwoman who gave away practically every dollar she ever made to endow a scholarship fund for poor students in Mississippi would become a symbol of selfless giving.         Oseola McCarty, who gave away a life savings of $150,000 to help complete strangers get a college education at the University of Southern Mississippi here in her hometown, died late Sunday afternoon in the frame house where she took in laundry and ironing and made her small fortune a dollar or two at a time.         Miss McCarty was told that she had liver cancer three weeks ago, about a year after she underwent surgery for colon cancer. She wanted her last days to be spent in the little house where she spent most of her life. She was 91.         ''I don't want to close my eyes because I don't know if I'll open them again,'' the tiny, frail woman told a visitor recently. ''But I am not afraid.''         In anticipation of her death, she decided in the summer of 1995 to give away most of her life savings, saying there was nothing in particular she wanted to buy and no place in particular she wanted to go. An only child who had outlived her relatives, she lived a solitary existence, surrounded by rows of clothes she made pretty for people who knew her only as the washerwoman.         ''I'm giving it away so that the children won't have to work so hard, like I did,'' she said in July 1995.         She did not want any monuments, any proclamations, said people who  knew her. But the selflessness of her gift would bring her worldwide attention. The woman who had gone out only for some preaching at the Friendship Baptist Church in Hattiesburg and to buy groceries would be honored by the United Nations, would shake hands with President Clinton and would receive more than 300 awards. People all over the world knew who she was and what she did.         The woman who acted in anticipation of death found a life she could have never imagined. She flew on a plane for the first time in her life and laughed out loud when the food did not fall off the tray as the plane rumbled through the sky. She stayed in a hotel for the first time in her life, and before she checked out, she made the bed.         ''People treated her like a monument,'' said Jewel Tucker, the secretary to the president of the university and Miss McCarty's traveling companion in those almost giddy years after the gift. ''But she was really a movement. It will keep moving.''         Contributions from more than 600 donors have added some $330,000 to the original scholarship fund of $150,000. After hearing of Miss McCarty's gift, Ted Turner, a multibillionaire, gave away a billion dollars.         ''He said, 'If that little woman can give away everything she has, then I can give a billion,' '' Ms. Tucker said.         If anyone can say they felt adoration in their life, Ms. Tucker said, Miss McCarty could. People would see her in airports and flock to her. Some people just wanted to touch her, as though she was good luck.         Along with all the plaques and trophies or other honors -- she received the Presidential Citizen's Medal, the nation's second-highest civilian award, and an honorary doctorate from Harvard University -- she was awarded other things that were pure fun.         In 1996, she carried the Olympic torch through part of Mississippi. Later that year, hers was the hand on the switch that dropped the ball in Times Square in New York's New Year's Eve celebration. In fact, she said at the time, it was the first time she had stayed up past midnight.         Miss McCarty will lie in state in the rotunda of the university's main building on Saturday.         Friends like Aubrey K. Lucas, president emeritus of the University of Southern Mississippi, said it warmed him and others that came into contact with her to know that a lifetime of loneliness had been pushed aside by all the positive attention that her gift brought.         Horace Fleming, the university's president, said he sometimes wondered if all the attention that came her way was really welcome. But he believes now that it was.         Her traveling companion, Ms. Tucker, knows that Miss McCarty did enjoy it.         Although she never asked for it, ''She loved every minute of it,'' Ms. Tucker said.         In time, people came to see her almost like an oracle and listened closely for pearls of wisdom at the little woman's knee.         But her friends know that Miss McCarty's wisdom was really a mix of common decency and common sense.         ''There's a lot of talk about self-esteem these days,'' she once said. ''It seems pretty basic to me. If you want to feel proud of yourself, you've got to do things you can be proud of. Feelings follow actions.''         The university's president said that a New York reporter once asked him out of earshot of Miss McCarty to tell him the true story of her gift.         ''How did it really happen?'' the reporter asked him.         The president told the reporter that it happened just as Miss McCarty said, that she had wanted to do something good with the money she had made. It is not any more complicated than that, Mr. Fleming said.         In a world in which people are suspicious of things too good to be true, he said, Miss McCarty really was good and true.       
         Anneli Cahn Lax, a professor and editor who was a leader in the publishing of mathematical literature, died on Friday at her home on Manhattan's Upper West Side. She was 77.         Professor Lax had pancreatic cancer, said her husband, Peter Lax.         She retired in 1992 from New York University, where she had been a professor for 31 years after holding other posts there for 18 years.         In her dissertation at N.Y.U. and in later publications, she made significant contributions to the theory of hyperbolic equations, a complex mathematical theory about aspects of the behavior of many kinds of waves.         She may be best known, however,  for her contributions to the understanding of mathematics by both students and lay people, especially as the editor of the Mathematical Association of America's New Mathematical Library Series.         The series, started in 1961, included 36 published volumes by 1995. It was planned, by Professor Lax and others, to make mathematics accessible to the general reader without stinting on technical accuracy. Its first two books, ''Numbers: Rational and Irrational'' by Ivan Niven and ''What Is Calculus About?'' by W. W. Sawyer, are still in print after a third of a century.         In addition, Professor Lax ''led the way in changing mathematical pedagogy, in exploring the connections of mathematics to the larger curriculum, in understanding the interplay between language and mathematics,'' Joanne V. Creighton, president of Mount Holyoke College, said in awarding her an honorary degree in 1997.         President Creighton said Professor Lax's experiences in mathematics and family life had endowed her with a special awareness of the challenges confronting young women interested in mathematics.         Professor Lax was a longtime active member of the New York Academy of Sciences and was instrumental in shaping its program of science education for children.         ''There is a misconception among people and schoolchildren about the nature of mathematics,'' she said in a 1979 interview. ''They consider it a matter of rules and regulations instead of thinking.'' The pressure, she said, was for pupils to come up with the right answer quickly, without time to analyze.         The honors she won included an award for ''distinguished service to mathematics'' from the mathematical association.         Professor Lax was born in Kattowitz, Germany. She and her family fled Hitler's Germany in 1935 and settled in New York. She received a bachelor's degree in 1942 from Adelphi College and her doctorate in 1956.         Besides her husband of 51 years, who is also a professor of mathematics at N.Y.U., she is survived by a son, Dr. James D. Lax of Manhattan,  and three grandsons.       
         Marion Zimmer Bradley, a science fiction writer and the creator of the Darkover series of fantasies, died on Saturday at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif. She was 69 and lived in Berkeley.         The cause was a heart attack, said Elisabeth Waters, her cousin and secretary.         Ms. Bradley rose to fame in 1958 with the publication of ''The Planet Savers,'' the first of her top-selling Darkover novels. The series eventually comprised 21 books, written almost exclusively by Ms. Bradley, which told the story of a planet discovered at the end of the 21st century  and colonized by Earth.         She later worked primarily in the fantasy genre, often adding a feminist spin to well-known myths. In 1983, she published her most famous work, ''The Mists of Avalon,'' a retelling of the legend of King Arthur  from the vantage point of its principal women, Viviane, Gwynyfar, Morgaine and Igraine. Hailed by Maureen Quilligan in The New York Times as ''a massive narrative that is rich in events placed in landscapes no less real for often being magical,'' the novel remained on The Times best-seller list for four months. In her 1987 work ''The Firebrand,'' she retold the story of the Trojan War from the perspective of the prophet  Cassandra, whom she renamed Kassandra.         Born in Albany, N.Y., Ms. Bradley began to write as a teen-ager and by the age of 17 had created a magazine for science-fiction fans. Two years later she began writing for pulp magazines. In 1964 she graduated from  Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Tex., and then did graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley from 1965 to 1967.         Though she continued to write until her death, Ms. Bradley's poor health in the early 1990's limited her activities. She devoted much of her time to editing magazines, including her own, Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine, which she started in 1988. She also edited an annual anthology called ''Sword and Sorceress'' from Daw Books in New York.         Ms. Bradley's marriage to Robert Alden Bradley ended in divorce in 1964. She is survived by three children, David Bradley of Oakland, Calif.; Patrick Breen of Denver, and Moira Stern of Sparks, Nev.; a brother, Leslie Zimmer of East Greenbush, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Lenon Hoyte, better known as Aunt Len, who shared her dream of a doll museum with Harlem children and  collectors from around the world for two decades, died Aug. 1 at a hospital in New York. She was 94.         A public school art teacher, she  founded Aunt Len's Doll and Toy Museum, one of the most extensive private collections of dolls and related toys in the United States, and long one of New York City's choice specialty museums. She closed the museum in the early 1990's when she was no longer able to care for it.         To Ms. Hoyte, the dolls were her ''babies,'' to be loved and shown off, whether they were the rarest antiques or battered castoffs.         In 1938, Ms. Hoyte and her husband bought the three-story brownstone at 6 Hamilton Terrace between Convent and St. Nicholas Avenues.         At one time the house was home to 6,000 dolls.         There were a dozen versions of  Shirley Temple; there was Barbie, and Betsy Wetsy, presidents and their wives, and refined French dolls with bodies and faces made of  bisque, the unglazed ceramic ware used to make fine dolls in the 19th century and before.         And always, her collection included black dolls, which are now highly sought by collectors, because so few were made before the 20th century.         One rarity, described in the sale catalogue as ''a black Bru pressed-bisque-head bebe doll,'' was valued at $18,000.         There were a pair of papier-mache dolls, named Lillian and Leo, made by Leo Moss, a black handyman who lived in Atlanta in the 19th century. Both Lillian and Leo have tears running down their cheeks.         The story has it that after the dollmaker parted from his wife and children he became so sad that he made only crying dolls.         The collection also included accessories like doll houses, doll clothing and costumes, tin toys and stuffed animals.         Visitors had to squeeze their way sideways or hunch down as they progressed through the narrow passageways of the public spaces on the ground floor and in the basement of the building.         The museum had a modest entrance fee, never exceeding $2 for adults and 50 cents for children.         Visitors would encounter all manner of mannequins, ranging from thumb-size to two or three feet tall.  Not all of the collectibles were old. One of Ms. Hoyte's favorites -- a baby doll with wide eyes and long eyelashes -- was carved in mahogany in 1977 by a California artist, Patty Hale.         In 1990, soon after Mayor Edward I. Koch presented Ms. Hoyte with the Mayoral Award of Honor for Art and Culture, her genteel house and museum was broken into by thieves.         At least nine dolls, including a two-foot-tall English king, considered priceless by knowledgeable collectors, were stolen.         Ms. Hoyte was disconsolate.         ''People any more don't let you live,'' she said then. ''You struggle to keep something up for joy and beauty, and you find yourself having to watch for thieves. It's not right.''         But soon after, four of the stolen dolls -- representing George and Martha Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin -- turned up, disjointed but repairable, in Ms. Hoyte's front room. ''I don't ask questions about how,'' she said. ''I'm just happy to have them back.''         In 1994, 700 of the finest antique dolls were auctioned at Sotheby's. Thousands more had been sold previously to dealers around the country.         Lenon Holder Hoyte was born in New York City on July 4, 1905, the first of five children of Moses and Rose Holder. She attended public school in New York City and studied art at the College of the City of New York, Columbia University and with private teachers.         She taught art at Junior High School 149 in the Bronx and retired after 41 years. ''When they started killing teachers, I got out,'' she said.         Her passion for collecting dolls dated to 1962, when she was asked to organize a doll show to raise money for Harlem Hospital. After that, she began acquiring dolls from flea markets, garage sales and antiques shops that she visited throughout the United States, Europe and the Caribbean. Her collection was officially opened as a museum in 1974.         Ms. Hoyte continued to produce  doll shows, and donated the proceeds to St. Philip's Episcopal Church, where she had been a lifelong member.         She spent many of her retirement years traveling to doll shows and picking up dolls and doll accouterments for her collection.         Ms. Hoyte's husband, Lewis Hoyte, died about 30 years ago. She is survived by her brother, Dr. Oliver Holder, of Sag Harbor, N.Y., two nieces and three nephews.       
         Birgit Cullberg, a pioneering experimental choreographer in Sweden who earned an international reputation through her intense dramatic ballets and vigorous social-protest pieces, died on Wednesday in Stockholm, where she lived. She was 91.         Although Miss Cullberg was a disciple of the German Expressionist choreographer Kurt Jooss, her own style fused modern dance and ballet. She was resident choreographer of the Royal Swedish Ballet from 1951 to 1957, and her most famous works were danced by ballet companies throughout the world.         Among these was her acknowledged masterpiece, ''Miss Julie,'' based on the August Strindberg play; it had its premiere in Sweden in 1950. Restaged to great acclaim in 1958 for American Ballet Theater, ''Miss Julie'' was a triumph for Violette Verdy in the title role, as the Swedish aristocrat who seduces a butler, and for Erik Bruhn as Jean, the butler. Mr. Bruhn virtually made the role his own for 20 years through his astonishingly powerful portrayal.         Ballet Theater staged three other Cullberg works, including the haunting Lapp tale ''Moon Reindeer.'' In 1958 the New York City Ballet presented Miss Cullberg's ''Medea'' with Melissa Hayden in the title role. In his review, John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, wrote, ''There is not a superfluous phrase, a meaningless gesture, an item of mere decoration in the choreography from end to end.''         Psychological insight was Miss Cullberg's strength, as she showed again in 1982 when the Cullberg Ballet, which she founded in 1967, made its belated United States debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with  Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in attendance.         Never shy about exploring the neurotic and the erotic, Miss Cullberg was represented by a duet, ''Adam and Eve,'' and an especially sensuous performance of ''Miss Julie,'' which nonetheless focused on the class differences between Julie and her servant. In ''Adam and Eve,'' Daniela Malusardi and Niklas Ek, Miss Cullberg's elder son, moved seamlessly from innocent playfulness to adult passion, a couple expelled from Eden but rejecting God as well.         Most of the other choreography was by Mats Ek, Miss Cullberg's other son, who cast her as a Mother Africa figure in his ''Soweto.'' Miss Cullberg, then 74, came out swinging, kicking, fiery-eyed and goading the oppressed onstage to resist until they collapsed to the sound of gunshots. In 1991, with her long white hair still flying, Miss Cullberg performed in Mats Ek's television dance production ''The Old Woman and the Door.''         She excelled in choreography for television. Her duet ''Red Wine in Green Glasses'' (1970) was shown on public television in the United States and was awarded the Prix Italia.         Miss Cullberg started life in a secure, wealthy home, but she had a volatile relationship with Anders Ek, one of Sweden's leading actors, whom she married in 1942. They had three children: Niklas, a brilliant dancer; Mats, 54, and his twin, the actress Malin Ek. They survive her, as do several grandchildren.         Miss Cullberg and her husband separated in 1949, and ''Medea,'' like many of her works, was interpreted by several Swedish critics as a piece that universalized her private emotions of the time.         Miss Cullberg and her husband reconciled in 1959 and both joined the new Stockholm City Theater, she as a stage director. (She directed him in ''Othello.'') The couple eventually divorced, but in the late 1970's, after Mr. Ek's death, Miss Cullberg choreographed a meditation on their life entitled ''Dreams of Love and Death.''         Born in Nykoping, Sweden, on Aug. 3, 1908, Miss Cullberg was the daughter of Ella W. Cullberg and Carl Cullberg, a bank director, and attended the University of Stockholm. After Jooss, the choreographer of the celebrated antiwar ballet ''The Green Table,'' appeared with his company in Stockholm, Miss Cullberg spent four years in England studying with him at Dartington Hall, an experimental arts center.         Returning to Sweden in 1939, she formed a small company and danced solos inspired by animal movements. In the early 1940's she studied ballet and wrote dance criticism. In 1946 she and the choreographer Ivo Cramer formed the Swedish Dance Theater, which disbanded in 1948. As the Royal Swedish Ballet's resident choreographer, she staged eight ballets.         In 1967 the Swedish Government established the current Cullberg Ballet. Writing in 1982 the Swedish critic Erik Naslund paid tribute to Miss Cullberg by declaring that it was her troupe, not the Royal Swedish Ballet, that was ''definitely the more prestigious company.''       
         Maria Ley Piscator, a theater arts teacher and director and the widow of the theatrical director Erwin Piscator, died on Oct. 14 at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan. She was 101.         Born in Vienna, Ms. Piscator began her theatrical career as a dancer in Berlin and Paris and later turned to choreography. She helped stage several productions with Max Reinhardt, including his renowned production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.''         She met Piscator, her third husband, in 1936 while studying for a doctorate in literature at the Sorbonne. The two immigrated to the United States and founded the Dramatic Workshop at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. Their students included Stella Adler, Harry Belafonte, Marlon Brando, Tony Randall and Anthony Franciosa.         Ms. Piscator also directed theatrical productions off Broadway and in Europe and was the director and founder of small theater programs in New York for the elderly, children and others. Her teaching also included work in the 1970's at the University of Southern Illinois at Carbondale and at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. She began working with the Elysium Theater Company of Munich in the 1980's and in 1993 became the honorary artistic director of Elysium -- Between Two Continents, a Munich-based organization devoted to cultural exchange between the United State and Europe, particularly Germany.         Ms. Piscator wrote books including ''The Piscator Experiment: The Political Theater,'' which was published by James H. Heineman in 1967, a year after her husband's death. Her autobiography, ''Mirror People,'' was published in 1989.       
         Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who sold her first book for $1 million when she was 98, died on Saturday in a hospital in Duluth, Minn., where she was vacationing with her daughter. She was 100.         Miss (her preference) Foveaux (pronounced FOH-voh), a snowy-haired great-great-grandmother, lived a literary fairy tale when she turned a memoir she wrote in a writing class for senior citizens in her hometown, Manhattan, Kan., into the book ''Any Given Day.''         In a 1997 auction Warner Books paid $1 million for the rights to publish the book.         In its 208 pages, she told of the quietly heroic struggle of a woman to win her independence while she was in a bitter marriage to an alcoholic. She worked in a laundry and as a nurse's aid to support her eight children before and after the divorce.         Her book, never intended for publication, ''just poured out,'' said Charley Kempthorne, a part-time farmer who taught a writing class at the Manhattan Adult Learning Center. ''She had bottled it up for many, many years.''         Miss Foveaux was an unschooled and unskilled writer, but she was clearly a born storyteller. Her words were straightforward. Of her decision to divorce, she wrote, ''I made up my mind to live my life so that I need not be ashamed to look at myself in a mirror.''         The book, which she began in 1977 and took several years to write, came to light only after an article about it appeared in 1997 on the front page of The Wall Street Journal to which Mr. Kempthorne had sent a copy. The article set off a frenzy to buy the book, leading to the auction.         The editor who acquired it, Claire Zion, called the writing ''very plain, very clear,'' and said that it would be altered only insignificantly for publication. ''We in New York try to sit here and think what the country is thinking,'' she said. ''This is Kansas talking.''         The book auction and the publicity visit to New York transported her to a new world. Miss Foveaux flew for the first time, took limousines, stayed at fancy hotels, appeared on talk shows and was written about in newspapers. She took it all with a big grain of salt.         ''I imagine I'll be like everyone else that ever got into a mess like this,'' she said.         The book was published in 1997 and remains in print but was not a best seller, despite the wide pre-publication publicity it received.         Miss Foveaux was born in Holden, Mo., in 1899, at a time when the world of Mark Twain was fading into memory. Her early childhood was spent on a small Missouri farm, but then her family moved frequently, to Arkansas and Washington State, among other places. As World War I started, she got her first job and fell in love with a young soldier. He vanished in the war, her beloved mother died, and the Depression wreaked hardship. She had eight children. As her book related, she struggled to maintain them in difficult circumstances.         She is survived by two daughters, Faye Marie Rutledge of Winder, Ga., and Aleda Torgerson of Silver Bay, Minn., and a son, Marion, of Manhattan, Kan., as well as 16 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.         In an interview after the $1 million auction, she was asked if she would buy cars and houses for her relatives. She shot back, ''They didn't help me, did they?'' The article describes family members bursting into nervous laughter.       
         Marilyn Silverstone, who left a career as a top photographer for the simple life of a Buddhist nun with the name Ngawang Chodron, died of cancer in a monastery near Katmandu last Tuesday, her sister Susan Darer said. She was 70.         She founded a nunnery several years ago near Katmandu, Nepal, one of the first Tibetan Buddhist nunneries outside of Tibet. It was a major step toward recapturing women's traditionally strong role in Tibetan Buddhism, said Gene Smith, a Boston-based publisher of Buddhist books. Ms. Silverstone worked for the photo agency Magnum -- photographing subjects from Albert Schweitzer to the coronation of the Shah of Iran -- but her last years were spent establishing the nunnery.         ''She was very interested in helping other women,'' said Jean Thies, a Buddhist living in Manhattan who has a business importing Tibetan Buddhist goods into the United States. Ms. Thies and others said this was a response to a diminished religious role for women in the Buddhist communities in exile from Tibet. Mr. Smith said, ''Women had come to be regarded as just handmaidens to the clergy.''         Ms. Silverstone's personal transformation, from a stylish photographer in Dior suits to a nun with a shaved head and running shoes dyed purple to go with her maroon robes, struck friends and colleagues as remarkable. As for herself, she saw the personal journey to her ultimate Buddhist identity, Ngawang Chodron, as essentially inevitable.         ''The only way to make my inside match my outside was to become a nun,'' she wrote.         Ms. Silverstone was born on March 9, 1929, in London, grew up in Scarsdale and graduated from Wellesley College in 1950. Her father was a movie executive who worked with Charlie Chaplin and other early movie stars; her mother, late in life, decided to get an education and graduated from college at 80.         Ms. Silverstone's first jobs were with art and design magazines, including Art News. In 1955, she became a freelance photographer. She went to India on an assignment to photograph Ravi Shankar in 1956 and fell in love with Frank Moraes, then editor of The Indian Express. They lived together until 1974, socializing in an elite set of politicians, journalists and intellectuals.         Her reputation as a photographer grew, and in 1967 she became a full member of Magnum, which is organized as a photographer-owned cooperative. She covered such big events as the arrival of the Dalai Lama in India, but it was the insights into Indian life, particularly in the villages, that she most cherished.         One famous image showed an Indian princess sitting shyly in sunglasses surrounded by 265 tigers her husband had shot. Ms. Silverstone avoided ''poverty pictures,'' calling them an Indian cliche.         Increasingly, she came to see taking pictures as predatory, once suggesting that subjects become ''like pieces of meat.'' But she readily admitted that she herself would often choose the most abject case in a line of poor children to make her journalistic point. ''You find you are getting glib with your hands,'' she said.         So she was ready to complete a journey that had begun when, as a child suffering from the mumps, she picked up ''Secret Tibet'' by Fosco Maraini. She said the book provided a key she long carried in her subconscious, the mysticism of Tibet. Mr. Moraes died in 1974 and she became a nun in 1977.         In 1987, she was fully ordained in a ceremony in Hong Kong.         Friends say she exhibited a hearty sense of humor, one laced with American Jewish expressions. She wrote several books, including several children's books published in the 1960's. In 1985, she published ''Ocean of Life: Visions of India and Himalayan Kingdoms.'' Just before her death, she finished translating a book by an 18th-century female lama into English.         Besides Ms. Darer, she is survived by another sister, Barbara S. Garrison.         Starting on Nov. 5, the work of five Magnum photojournalists, including Ms. Silverstone, will be exhibited at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. In a biography of her, one of the other photographers, Eva Arnold, quoted Ms. Silverstone summing up her life.         ''I can say that I did it all,'' Ms. Silverstone was quoted as saying. ''The secret though is just keep walking through life without analyzing it too much or clinging to it too much. Just walk on.''         Correction:  October 6, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary of the photographer and Buddhist nun Marilyn Silverstone on Monday misstated the given name of a photojournalist whose work, along with hers and others', will be exhibited at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh beginning Nov. 5. The photojournalist is Eve Arnold, not Eva.       
         Amalia Rodrigues, the Portuguese singer who was considered the queen of fado, died yesterday at her home in Lisbon. She was 79.         Her recording company, Valentim de Carvalho, said she was found dead in her bed by her secretary.         Fado, which means fate in Portuguese, is a passionate, volatile, haunted style that originated in the cafes and taverns of Lisbon. Played on the round, bright-toned 12-string Portuguese guitar, with Arabic elements that make it kin to Spanish flamenco, fado is filled with the quality called saudade in Portuguese: a mixture of sadness and nostalgia, longing and resignation. Its lyrics are bleak and fatalistic, with their suffering described in the first person. Ms. Rodrigues performed in the black clothes of mourning, with her head thrown back and her face like a mask of tragedy, singing in a voice that was at once tearful and fierce.         ''I have so much sadness in me, I am a pessimist, a nihilist, everything fado demands in a singer, I have in me,'' Ms. Rodrigues once said. ''When I am on my own, alone, tragedy comes, and solitude.''         During more than 50 years as a performer, Ms. Rodrigues was acclaimed as the definitive voice of fado, revered in Portugal and acclaimed as its musical representative around the world. When her death was announced, Portugal's radio stations dropped regular programming and began broadcasting tributes. The Prime Minister of Portugal, Antonio Guterres, ordered three days of national mourning. Reuters reported that Mr. Guterres said: ''It is a moment of great sadness. She was the voice of Portugal.''         Amalia Rodrigues was born in 1920 in the Alfama district of Lisbon, the cradle of fado. She was one of 10 children in a working-class family and was reared by her grandmother. She sold fruit in the streets and worked as a seamstress before she began to perform as a tango dancer.         As a teen-ager her renditions of tangos built a reputation, and she began singing professionally in 1939. At first her family did not approve of her singing tango and fado, songs associated with the lower classes and the underworld.         She made her first recordings in 1945 in Portugal and in Rio de Janeiro. In 1952 she signed to the Valentim de Carvalho label and began to reshape the tradition. She combined the urban and rural styles of Lisbon and Coimbra; she chose lyrics that reached beyond stories of heartbreak to muse on God and destiny.         Ms. Rodrigues began to tour beyond Portugal after World War II. She performed regularly in Brazil, Spain, France and Britain and eventually gave concerts in the United States, Japan, Mexico and the Soviet Union. She recorded more than 170 albums that were released in 30 countries, and appeared in a dozen films, notably ''Les Amants du  Tage'' (''Lovers of the Tagus''), by the French director Henri Verneuil.         Fado fell from its commercial peak during the 1960's, and after 1974, when a revolution removed the dictator Antonio Salazar, fado was associated by many Portuguese with the authoritarian regime. ''I always sang fado without thinking of politics,'' Ms. Rodrigues said. ''I never had the support of any government.''         By then, Ms. Rodrigues was known around the world. At her concerts, including her last New York City performance at Town Hall in 1990, rapt listeners sang along to her songs of love and death. In the 1990's she had heart surgery and retired from singing because of poor health. She made her last public appearance in 1998 in Lisbon, singing at the opening of Expo 1998.       
         Ella Mae Morse, the sultry, swinging pop-jazz singer whose 1942 hit, ''Cow-Cow Boogie,'' became the first million seller for the fledgling Capitol Records and helped establish the label, died on Saturday at the Western Arizona Regional Medical Center in Bullhead City. She was 75 and lived in Bullhead City.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her press agent, Alan Eichler.         A true original, Ms. Morse belted an exuberant mixture of boogie-woogie, blues, jazz, swing and country that transcended genres. Her 1946 recording of ''House of Blue Lights'' is considered influential in the evolution of rock-and-roll. Among her other hits were ''Shoo-Shoo Baby,'' ''Mister Five by Five,'' ''No Love, No  Nothin,' '' ''Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet,'' ''The Patty-Cake Man'' and her million-selling 1952 comeback hit, ''The Blacksmith Blues.''         Ms. Morse was born in 1924 in Mansfield, Tex. Her father, George Morse, a drummer from England, led a small dance band and her mother, Ann, a native Texan, played ragtime and Dixieland piano. By age 9, Ms. Morse was singing with her father's band in nightclubs. When the family moved to Paris, Tex., she befriended an elderly black guitar player who taught her the blues and became a major influence on her style.         At 13 (but claiming to be 19), Ms. Morse auditioned for Jimmy Dorsey's band in Dallas. She won the job, but had to quit when her charade was discovered. Moving to San Diego, she was reunited with Freddie Slack, Dorsey's pianist, who had quit the band to strike out on his own as a leader. He hired her to be his vocalist just as the band was signed by Johnny Mercer and Glenn Wallichs to be the first artists on their new label, Capitol Records. Their first recording, ''Cow-Cow Boogie,'' was a novelty song.         After the song leaped to the top of the pop charts, Ms. Morse was signed to Capitol as a soloist and remained there for the next 15 years. Many of her hits were even more in the rhythm-and-blues than in the pop market, and many fans didn't know whether she was black or white. (She was white.) In 1946 she reunited with Slack to record the seminal ''House of Blue Lights.''         After taking several years off to start a family, Ms. Morse returned to Capitol studios in 1952 to record ''The Blacksmith Blues.'' Although she stopped recording in 1957, she continued to make occasional appearances, including a 1970's tour with Mr. Carter's band and an annual engagement at Disneyland with Ray McKinley's band. In 1984 she made a series of club appearances in Los Angeles, and in 1987 she appeared at Michael's Pub in New York. Two years ago her complete body of work was released in a five-CD box set by Bear Family Records.         She is survived by Jack Bradford, her husband, their children, Dan and Laura, and four children from previous marriages: Richard, Marcia, Ann and Kenny, as well as eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Daisy Bates, a civil rights leader who in 1957 led the fight to admit nine black students to Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., died yesterday at a hospital there. She was 84.         In the integration struggle, rocks were thrown through her window, a burning cross was placed on her roof and the newspaper published by her and her husband, L. C. Bates, was ultimately destroyed financially. But she nurtured the nine black children who faced vicious insults and physical intimidation. She encouraged them to be courageous, while striving to guard them against howling white mobs.         The result was one of the early major victories in the civil rights movement. The desegregation of Central High School with the aid of federal troops signaled that Washington would enforce the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education, which declared school segregation unconstitutional.         Mrs. Bates, as Arkansas president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was a central figure in the litigation that led to the confrontation in front of Central High, as well as the snarling scenes that unfolded in front of it.         The success of the Little Rock campaign, she later said, ''had a lot to do with removing fear that people have for getting involved.''         In her forward to Mrs. Bates's 1962 book, ''The Long Shadow of Little Rock,'' Eleanor Roosevelt wrote, ''I have paid her homage in my thoughts many times and I want to tell her again how remarkable I think she was through these horrible years.''         President Clinton yesterday called her a dear friend and a heroine and said her death ''will leave a vacuum in the civil rights community, the State of Arkansas and our country.''         Daisy Bates was born in the little sawmill town of Huttig in southern Arkansas, growing up in a shotgun shack, so called because one could stand at the front door and fire a shotgun straight through the back door into the yard. She attended segregated schools that used out-of-date textbooks passed on from white schools, according to the African-American Almanac.         In her book, she told of the trauma of learning at 8 that her mother had been killed in a rape attempt by three white men. After she had heard rumors, her father told her the truth in simple and straightforward terms. ''So happy once,'' she wrote, ''now I was like a little sapling which, after a violent storm, puts out only gnarled and twisted branches.''         When she was about 15, an insurance agent came to visit her home. He was L. C. Bates, who had studied journalism and then worked for newspapers in Colorado and Kansas City. Newspapers were a shaky calling in the Depression, and he had turned to selling insurance.         After a courtship, the two married and settled in Little Rock. Together, they started a newspaper called The Arkansas State Press. It reported extensively on racially motivated violence and became known as a strong exponent of civil rights. After being elected state N.A.A.C.P. president in 1952, and as a result of the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Mrs. Bates became a particularly forceful advocate of desegregation. She began by taking black children to white schools to be registered. If the school refused, as they always did, she would report it in her paper.         In Arkansas, local and state officials initially tried to delay school desegregation, ostensibly to make the process more orderly. This resulted in a suit by the N.A.A.C.P. to force the issue. At Central High, 75 black students initially registered, a number that was ultimately reduced to 9 chosen by school authorities. They were deemed the most emotionally mature.         But Gov. Orval Faubus, responding to political urging from other Southern governors as well as polls showing that 85 percent of the state's residents opposed school desegregation, sent in the National Guard to stop blacks from attending. Governor Faubus said that ''blood would run in the streets'' if they tried. A forewarning of the escalating tension was a rock tossed through the Bateses' window. A note was tied to it, saying: ''Stone this time. Dynamite next.''         The first day of school, the black  students were turned away with bayonets at the schoolhouse door. Racial and sexual epithets were hurled at them. Mr. and Mrs. Bates were at the scene. The next day, the National Guard stepped in again.         Then President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent in the federal troops, rebuffing Governor Faubus's pleas for a one-year cooling-off period. In her book, Mrs. Bates tells of waiting for a call from the school superintendent telling her to bring the children the next day. She had told the parents that if they did not hear from her by 10 p.m. to take their phones off the hook and get some sleep. But the superintendent called after that and said that the next day, Sept. 24, the children should come to school.         Mr. and Mrs. Bates spent the next three hours visiting the parents. The next morning all the children showed up at the Bates home to be picked up by a military convoy.         ''My eyes none too dry, I saw the parents with tears of happiness in their eyes as they watched the group drive off,'' Mrs. Bates wrote.         Two years later, the Bateses'  newspaper closed as advertisements slowed to almost nothing. She served in various civil rights positions both locally and nationally and was the only woman who spoke at the March on Washington in 1963. In an interview in 1986, she said: ''I'm 75 and a half. But I'm not too tired to stand and do what I can for the cause I believe in. I would like to see before I die that blacks and whites and Christians can all get together.''         In recent years, Mrs. Bates suffered a series of strokes. ''She just wore out,'' her niece, Sharon T. Gatson, said.         She is survived by four brothers,  Leo Gatson of Strong, Ark., Kucas and Lowell Gatson of Spearville, La., and Emmitt Gatson of Detroit.         On Monday, her body will lie in state on the second-floor rotunda of the Arkansas Capitol. Just a few feet away is the office where Governor  Faubus orchestrated the 1957 confrontation.       
         Sufia Kamal, a Bangladeshi poet, political activist and feminist, died at age 88 on Nov. 20 and was buried four days later with full state honors, the first woman to receive that recognition from Bangladesh.         As the national flag was lowered and buglers saluted, about 10,000 people paid their respects to Ms. Kamal at her funeral on Wednesday in Dhaka.         Born into wealth, she had devoted her life to fighting for the rights of women and the poor and against the forces of religious fundamentalism.         ''This poet was the beacon for our great language movement and liberation war, and inspiration for all democratic movements of the nation,'' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh said at the ceremony. ''This poet was a vast source of inspiration for building up womenfolk as self-reliant.''         Sufia Kamal was born in 1911 in Barisal, the southern district of what is now Bangladesh, the only daughter of an eminent lawyer. As a woman, she did not have an opportunity to pursue an education, but she educated herself in her uncle's library with her mother's encouragement.         She was first married at the age of 11 to her cousin Syed Nehal Hossain, then a law student. They had a daughter, Amena Kahnar, and Mr. Hossain died in 1932. Five years later, Ms. Kamal married Kamaluddin Ahmed.         In addition to her first daughter, Ms. Kamal is survived by two other daughters, Sultana Kamal and Saida Kamal; two sons, Shahed Kamal and Sazid Kamal; three grandsons, and three great-granddaughters.         She published her first story at 14,  and her prose and poems drew favorable notice. Some works were aimed at children. Some were translated into English and Russian. Increasingly, she wrote against religious communalism, fundamentalism and superstitions. She promoted democracy and women's emancipation.         ''The culture was to keep the women at home, train them in household chores and make them perfect women: docile, ready to please everyone in the family,'' she said in an interview earlier this year. ''There was a strong anti-British movement, and my family also believed that women should stay out of it.         ''But I had an indomitable nature and I crossed my limits to get a taste of all there was. I was allowed to learn Arabic and a little Persian, but not Bengali. I made it a point to learn Bengali from people working in the house.'' That became the language she used for her writing.         Though she called herself a romantic poet, her work more and more reflected the struggles to preserve the Bengali language and culture and to fight Pakistani rulers. During Bangladesh's struggle for independence from Pakistan in the early 1970's she worked to help women hurt by the war. She also worked with an organization to try to bring to justice those Pakistani officials whom the Bangladeshis considered war criminals.         In later life, she made women's rights her top priority and headed Bangladesh's largest women's organization for many years. She did not see the oppression of women as mainly a class issue.         ''My own experience as a woman made me sensitive toward the condition of women of all classes,'' she said. ''Be poor or middle class or upper class, the violence against women in family, society and in public life was always there. Women were exploited and deprived of opportunities.''         In 1993, an Islamic fundamentalist group called for her execution as punishment for her denunciation of the fundamentalists' treatment of women. Her response was quiet resistance rather than the stronger advocacy of an earlier Bangladeshi poet, Taslima Nareen, who fled the country for fear of reprisals.         Ms. Kamal's strongest and most thoughtful sentiments may have appeared in her poems rather than her prose.         One poem, ''Our Language: The Language of Bengal,'' ends with the following lines:         For our language many have died,         drawn from the arms of our mother         but down the road, smeared with their blood         I hope freedom will come to this land:         the simple language of a simple people         Will meet the demands of this our land.         Before her death Ms. Kamal specified that she preferred to be buried in a simple private cemetery rather than in the national cemetery, where her nation's leaders had suggested she be buried. Her views on the country's leaders, expressed in the interview earlier this year, suggest why.         ''Our people are courageous; our leaders are not,'' she said. ''Today they recourse to bombastic rhetoric but never take bold decisions because they may be unpleasant. Why? Because they lack courage.''       
         Eve F. Kraft, a tennis teacher, coach, author and the founder and former executive director of the Education and Research Committee of the United States Tennis Association, died Thursday at Princeton Hospital.         She was 73 years old and lived in Princeton, N.J.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         Kraft began giving tennis lessons to her children and their friends on a court behind her house in 1955 and was soon teaching the fundamentals to thousands of amateur players through the Princeton Community Tennis Program.         Bill Talbert, the legendary doubles and singles champion, once described the program as ''a leader in the field in developing new materials and experimenting with new ways to teach tennis in group situations.''         Kraft, an enthusiast who kept the notes from her first tennis lesson at age 12, wrote ''The Tennis Workbook,'' a learning and practice guide for beginners, and ''The Tennis Teacher's Guide to Group Instruction and Community Tennis Programming.''         In 1971, when Princeton University first admitted women, Kraft became the women's varsity tennis coach, leading the team to an undefeated record for the three years of her tenure.         Kraft was the co-founder and director of the U.S.T.A. tennis teachers' conference held annually during the United States Open.         She was inducted into the U.S.T.A./ Middle States Tennis Hall of Fame in 1994 and into the International Tennis Association's Women's Collegiate Hall of Fame in 1996.         A native of Philadelphia, Kraft received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1947 from Antioch College.         She is survived by two sons, Kenneth of Haverford, Pa., and Robert of Los Angeles; four grandchildren; and her companion, G. Reginald Bishop Jr.       
         Georgia Hofmann, an owner and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses, including the Triple Tiara winner Sky Beauty, died Sunday at her home in Bal Harbour, Fla. She was 91.         The cause was complications from leukemia, which was diagnosed several months ago, said Lawrence G. Foster, a family spokesman.         Mrs. Hofmann learned to ride horses bareback and said that was when her love for them began. In 1962, she bought her first racehorse, a filly named Calabrea, who won her first race and paid $72 to win.         ''That horse was the real reason I am in the racing business today,'' she said years later. She did most of her own buying and selling, and bred or owned such outstanding horses as Gold Beauty, named the champion sprinter in 1982, Louis Quatorze, winner of the 1996 Preakness, Gold Stage, Maplejinsky, Dayjur, Royal Indy and Bankers Gold.         But the pride and prize of the lot was Sky Beauty, a daughter of the European champion Blushing Groom and a granddaughter of Nijinsky II. She came into prominence in 1992, when she won five starts. And, in 1993, she was only the eighth filly to win the Triple Tiara, the equivalent of the Triple Crown for fillies.         Mrs. Hofmann was the widow of Philip B. Hofmann, a retired chairman of Johnson & Johnson, the health care products company. Mr. Hofmann's lifelong interest in horses centered on jumpers, show horses and coach-and-four competitions. He left the thoroughbred racing to his wife, and when at the racetrack he often said: ''I'm just here to watch. She's the expert.''         Mrs. Hofmann's first marriage, to Fred R. Fehlhaber, ended in divorce.         Georgia Hofmann was born Georgia Ellis on a farm near Montgomery, Ala. She became a fashion model in New York and had a minor part in a musical production staged by Florenz Ziegfeld. But she seemed to have a sixth sense about a racehorse's breeding and racing potential. She spent long hours studying books and reports on bloodlines.         Mrs. Hofmann, who owned Wycombe House Stud, a 218-acre horse farm in Ocala, Fla., earned more than $12 million through the sale of 22 horses, including Sky Beauty.         Although she was ill, Mrs. Hofmann attended the Breeders' Cup races at Gulfstream Park in Florida on Nov. 6. The next day, she flew to Lexington, Ky., to preside over the sale of the last of her racehorses.         She is survived by a sister, Elizabeth St. Almond of Jacksonville, Fla.; two stepdaughters, Judy Hofmann Richter of Bedford, N.Y., and Carol Hofmann Thompson of Colts Neck, N.J.; a stepson, Robert F. Fehlhaber of Fort Lauderdale, Fla; and two stepdaughters, Chris Fehlhaber McGuire of Vero Beach, Fla., and Julie Fehlhaber Flavell of Fort Lauderdale.         Mrs. Hofmann, who never had children, often referred to her horses as ''my babies.''       
         Phoebe Snetsinger, who saw and recorded more birds than anybody else, died on Nov. 23 in a van accident on a birding expedition to Madagascar, shortly after viewing an exceptionally rare Helmet vanga. She was 68 and lived in Webster Groves, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis.         Birding went from a hobby to a passion for Mrs. Snetsinger on the day in 1981 that a doctor told her she had an incurable cancer, with less than a year to live. Rejecting therapy, she took off to Alaska on a scheduled trip, her first long-distance journey simply to see birds.         ''She came back and felt good,'' her husband, David, said. ''Things just started snowballing from there.''         Mrs. Snetsinger liked to say her avian ardor ''began with a death sentence,'' and her relentless energy reflected that level of urgency as her cancer went into the first of several remissions. Family members and friends could not imagine her without binoculars, floppy hat, sneakers, telescope and other field gear as she scurried around the globe on scores of bird tours, most costing more than $5,000. An inheritance paid the bills; she supplied the boundless energy. She said she spent more time in the world's jungles, mountains and other wild areas than at home.         There were setbacks, as the cancer, melanoma, recurred every five years or so, only to go into remission again. But her record, as verified by the American Birding Association, was sighting about 8,400 birds, or nearly 85 percent of the species now estimated to exist, more than 2,000 birds ahead of her nearest competitor.         ''She was a celebrity in our bunch,'' said Bret Whitney, a co-founder of Field Guides, a tour operator based in Austin, Tex. Mrs. Snetsinger was traveling on one of the group's tours when the van overturned. Mr. Whitney said she apparently died instantly.         ''She gave so much to the birding world and had so much more left to give,'' said G. Stuart Keith, the birding association's first president. At the highest tier of birding, it was a common joke to differentiate between Phoebe Snetsinger and the phoebe, a genus of flycatchers.         Genera, or large groups of species (as in the genus Homo of Homo sapiens), were of considerable importance to Mrs. Snetsinger, who kept a separate list of those that have only a single species, known as monotypic genera. Her list of more than 2,000 such genera far surpassed anyone else's, said Mr. Whitney, who also works as a research associate at Louisiana State University.         She also kept extensive notes on subspecies, using index cards as a catalog until switching in recent months to a computer from the Remington portable typewriter she had used since college.         Her subspecies notes, in whatever format, are important because many of the birds have now been reclassified as species. When she started, there were 8,500 officially named species, compared with about 10,000 now. A spokeswoman for the American Museum of Natural History said some scientists believed there could eventually be as many as 18,000 named separate bird species.         This means that her life list will almost certainly grow posthumously. ''She has birds in escrow,'' Mr. Whitney said.         Mrs. Snetsinger was born in Lake Zurich, Ill., where she attended a one-room elementary school with only two other students. At 11, she met her future husband, then 13, in 4-H clubs.         She graduated from Swarthmore College as a German major, and then taught science at the Baldwin School, a private girls school in Bryn Mawr, Pa. When Mr. Snetsinger returned from service in Korea, they both attended graduate school and she earned a master's degree in German literature.         They had four children, all of whom survive. They are Thomas, of Corvallis, Ore.; Penny, of Woodbridge, Conn.; Carol, of Missoula, Mont., and Susan, of Tempe, Ariz. All but Penny pursued careers relating to birds, Thomas as a researcher in endangered bird species for the Federal government, Carol as a bird researcher in Alaska and Montana, and Susan as a student of the spotted owl in the Northwest.         In 1965, a friend took Mrs. Snetsinger birding for the first time in Minnesota, and when her husband took a corporate job in Missouri she pursued her interest with a group of birders. (Birders adamantly spurn the term ''birdwatcher'' in the belief that it suggests a lack of gravity.) The group visited local woods and prairies each Thursday afternoon.         After birding came to represent a new lease on life to her, Mrs. Snetsinger began to take longer and longer trips. She was hooked when she visited Kenya and saw 500 different birds in three weeks. Her odyssey was aided by new technology for recording bird sounds, greater access to more and more remote habitats and the increasing numbers of tours being offered.         The depth of her enthusiasm is suggested by her response to a fall she took about six months ago while climbing a mountain in the Philippines: she stayed in the field for two additional weeks to see more birds.         The whole idea of listing birds, or at least the seriousness of the pursuit, is also sometimes criticized, or at least satirized. Indeed, it is called ''the game'' by birders themselves. ''It's like collecting stamps or baseball cards,'' said Paul J. Baicich, editor of Birding, the magazine of the American Birding Association.         Mr. Snetsinger said his wife's competitive spirit was kept hidden, though he did not deny it existed. In a 1996 interview, she insisted that she wanted to play down her quantitative quest. ''I'm going back to being a birder, not a lister,'' she said.         Ultimately, she felt very lucky, as she explained in an article to be published in next February's issue of Birding. ''Birding is the best and most exciting pursuit in the world, a glorified never-ending one,'' Mrs. Snetsinger wrote. ''And the whole experience of a foreign trip, whether you see 10 new birds or 500, is simply too good to miss.''       
         Gloria Caruso Murray, a visual artist who was the last surviving child of Enrico Caruso, died on Dec. 5 at St. Luke's Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 79 and had briefly tried to live up to the musical world's sentimental fantasy that she had inherited her father's vocal abilities.         She died of cancer, said Aldo Mancusi, curator of the Caruso Museum in Brooklyn.         Only hours after his daughter's birth on Dec. 18, 1919, at the Knickerbocker Hotel just a stone's throw from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York, Caruso, then the most famous operatic tenor in the world, exuberantly tossed the girl into the air, peered into her mouth and announced, ''Ah, she has the vocal cords, just like her daddy!''         A year and a half later, Caruso was dead at 48 -- a loss that nourished a popular fantasy that his child would also have an extraordinary voice.         At age 7, when she and her mother returned to New York from a vacation in Europe, a New York newspaper ran the headline ''Gloria Caruso, Here With a Voice'' and pronounced her ''a potential opera star of the first magnitude.''         The next year she made her first record. At 11, she made her first public appearance, delivering a radio address on behalf of a charity headed by President Herbert Hoover. Later that year she made a test recording for RCA Victor, and John McCormack, another renowned tenor, gave her singing lessons and announced that she had promise.         The press had an immense appetite for even the slightest tidbits of news about the great Caruso's daughter. But it gradually became apparent that she did not have the voice to follow her father.         In 1942, Ms. Murray told a reporter that she was studying art at the Art Students League in New York and that she had come to prefer the visual arts to music. ''I've always been torn between art and music,'' she said. ''Daddy drew and sculptured as a hobby. And Mommy draws. Art is as much in the family as singing.''         In marrying Caruso, her mother, an American named Dorothy Benjamin, created a tumult in 1918. Her father, Park Benjamin, a wealthy patent lawyer and New York society figure, fiercely opposed the match between his daughter, then 25, to Caruso, who was 45. After the couple eloped, Park Benjamin disowned her. When he died in 1925, he left her $1 from his substantial estate.         In 1943, Gloria Caruso married Ensign Michael Hunt Murray, who had left Harvard to become a naval aviator in World War II. The couple had two sons but later divorced.         Ms. Murray set up a studio in New York City where she painted both portraits and landscapes. Later she lived in Miami and, for the last 10 years, in Jacksonville.         Andrew Farkas, co-author with Enrico Caruso Jr. of ''Enrico Caruso: My Father and My Family'' (Amadeus Press, 1990), said that Ms. Murray's paintings were ''of good quality, although she sold very few.''         ''She became rather reclusive,'' Mr. Farkas said, adding, ''She had been answering questions about her father for a long time.'' Eric D. Murray, one of Ms. Murray's sons, said his mother had become occupied with managing the family estate after her mother died in 1957.         Matters were complicated because Caruso had left no will. In 1928, a court in Trenton had ruled that Gloria Caruso was entitled to two-thirds of the royalties on her father's phonograph records, sold by the Victor Talking Machine Company.         Gloria Caruso attended Miss Hewitt's Classes in New York City, the Ozanne School in Paris, the Bishop School in La Jolla, Calif., and Miss Nixon's School in Florence, Italy.         In addition to her son Eric, of Maryland, she is survived by her other son, Colin D. Murray of Jacksonville.         Mr. Farkas wrote that Enrico Caruso had four children from a relationship with Ada Giacchetti, a soprano who had left her husband to live with the tenor before his marriage to Miss Benjamin. Only one, Enrico Caruso Jr., sought a career as a singer. All are deceased.       
         Dorothy Allison, a self-proclaimed psychic with a knack for turning up at the scenes of notorious crimes, died on Dec. 1 at Clara Maass Medical Center in Belleville, N.J. She was 74 and lived in Nutley, N.J.         The cause was heart failure, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Allison, a small woman in thick, oversized glasses, materialized to offer to solve crimes including the Patricia Hearst kidnapping, the ''Son of Sam'' killings, the murders of children in Atlanta and the death of JonBenet Ramsey. She was not successful in those cases, but her supporters insist that she hit the mark on others.         Chief Robert DeLitta of the Nutley Police Department, which became something of a booking agent for Ms. Allison, said, ''The information she provided was very, very accurate -- right on the money.'' He said hundreds of police departments from all over the world called the Nutley police to reach her.         Her fame made her the emblem of a vigorous debate about the efficacy  and legitimacy of so-called psychic detectives. ''Dorothy couldn't locate Patty,'' Randolph Hearst, Patricia's father, said in a Newsweek interview. ''But she is honest and reputable. I wouldn't laugh at it.''         But skeptics, many armed with volumes of research, insist that psychics have never solved a single crime. Joe Nickell, a columnist for Skeptical Inquirer, the magazine of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, said in an interview that psychic detectives use a trick called ''retrofitting,'' which involves tossing out several clues, like a number or a mention of water, that are interpreted to fit the facts after they become known.         Police departments may waste valuable time and resources digging in specific spots and draining ponds on the erroneous advice of a psychic, he said. ''Certainly Dorothy Allison caused a great deal of -- I'm sure unintended -- mischief,'' he said.         Michael Shermer, the publisher of Skeptic magazine, said in an interview that psychic detectives commonly make logical predictions; for example, they suggest that a corpse will be found in a remote area.         ''If you have a body, are you going to dump it in a crowded city?'' he asked.         When Ms. Allison named names, they were not always the right ones. In the case of the murders of about a dozen black children in Atlanta in 1979-80, she gave the police 42 names of possible killers, and none of the names were Wayne or Williams. A man named Wayne B. Williams was eventually convicted of the crimes.         Ms. Allison became something of a cult figure after many newspaper articles and television shows depicted her as a great-grandmother sitting at her kitchen table, concentrating on astrological charts and gazing at gruesome photographs of crime scenes. Visitors to her house noticed many commendations from police departments, some of which officially say they do not use psychics.         She was born in Jersey City and grew up there. Her psychic sensations became public knowledge in 1968, when she told the Nutley police that they could find the body of a missing boy in a drainage pipe. Though it has been widely reported for three decades that they did, Mr. Nickell said that according to his research, the body was found floating in a pond by a man looking for a place to bury his dead cat.         In interviews over the years, Ms. Allison said she had worked on more than 5,000 cases, so many that she had trouble recalling the names of victims. She said she had led detectives to 250 bodies and had solved hundreds of murders. Among the police departments that consulted her was New York City's.         Chief DeLitta of the Nutley police said she had been helpful on many occasions, citing a 1993 bludgeoning murder. Among Ms. Allison's correct predictions were double letters in the names of the suspect and a street that figured in the case, the occupation of the suspect's father, and the facts that the suspect lived in a garden apartment next to a yellow house and that one of his car's headlights was out.         She also said the murder weapon would be found in a river. The weapon was never found, but the man convicted of the crime later admitted throwing it in the river, the chief said.         Ms. Allison refused payment for her work, saying it would be ''blood money.'' She did accept money for expenses and payments for appearances on talk shows and other forums. She also wrote articles and books, the most successful of which was ''A Psychic's Story,'' published in 1980.         She is survived by her husband, Bob; two sons, Alex Allison of Nutley and Robert McBride of Stone Ridge, N.Y.; a daughter, Dorothy McBride of Montville, N.J.; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.         ''If you asked me if I believe in psychics, I'd say no -- only very few,'' Ms. Allison said in a New York Times interview in 1996.         She had harsh words for psychics who advertise on television, a practice she shunned. ''Those 1-900 number people should be arrested,'' she said.       
         Rose E. Bird, who became the first woman on California's Supreme Court and whose resolute opposition to the death penalty later led voters to remove her as chief justice, died of complications from breast cancer on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 63.         Almost from the moment she was appointed to head the state's highest court by Gov. Jerry Brown in 1977, Ms. Bird, a pioneering liberal lawyer who had never been a judge, became one of the most controversial figures in California politics. She led a liberal majority that strengthened environmental laws and consumer rights. But in 1986, voters angry at her opposition to the death penalty removed her and two other Brown-appointed justices by refusing to extend their terms. They were the first such removals in California history.         Ms. Bird, who came of professional age at a time when major law firms still resisted hiring women, held a succession of path-breaking jobs. She was the first woman hired by the Santa Clara County public defender's office in Northern California, and she became the first woman to hold a cabinet-level post in state government when Mr. Brown named her his secretary of agriculture in 1975. Many of her detractors were forced to acknowledge her administrative skills, while even her admirers among judges and lawyers conceded the brittleness that made her a lighting rod for criticism.         Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who had known her for years, said Ms. Bird had ''a total passion for, and commitment to, justice.''         ''In some ways, she was just too good to be a judge, he said. ''She had a total passion and commitment, and that's not always the best way to function and get along in this world, in a political environment. From the day she got to the Supreme Court, she never really had a chance.''         After the death penalty was reinstated in California in the late 1970's, Judge Bird never upheld a death sentence, voting to vacate such sentences 61 times. She survived repeated efforts to recall her, but was ousted after Governor George Deukmejian, a Republican, led an aggressive campaign against her.         To this day, Ms. Bird's name remains a kind of reflexive shorthand in California for ''soft-on-crime liberal.'' In last year's election, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, sought to tar his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, by association, because Mr. Davis had been Governor Brown's chief of staff at the time of Ms. Bird's appointment.         ''I appreciate that some people within our state are impatient, impatient to see executions,'' Ms. Bird said after her removal. ''I don't think anybody in this state will sit easy if, in fact, this becomes a court that ensures nothing but executions to appease the overweening and insatiable attitude of ambitious politicians.''         Today, in part because of long-running arguments over capital punishment, California has the largest death row in the nation, with more than 500 inmates sentenced to die. But virtually the entire state political establishment, Democratic as well as Republican, now favors the death penalty, and the pace of executions is widely expected to increase.         Rose Elizabeth Bird was born on Nov. 2, 1936, in Tucson, the youngest of three children whose parents ran a chicken farm. Her parents separated in 1941, and her father died soon after. Ms. Bird's widowed mother, Anne, moved the family to New York, her home state.         Young Rose was a standout scholar in high school, earning a scholarship to Long Island University, where she majored in English in preparation for a career in journalism. She later enrolled as a graduate student in political science at the University of California at Berkeley, but an internship in the State Legislature in Sacramento persuaded her to switch to law school, because lawyers seemed to have the most influence on public policy.         After working as a public defender and teaching a seminar in criminal defense at Stanford University's law school, Ms. Bird became a volunteer in Mr. Brown's 1974 campaign for governor, serving as his frequent chauffeur on his trips to her area and later as a trusted adviser on his transition team. On taking office, Mr. Brown broke precedent by naming Ms. Bird secretary of agriculture, a post traditionally held by a grower. Ms. Bird emphasized consumer protection and worker health and safety, moving to ban the use of a short-handled hoe that forced farm laborers to spend hours stooped in the fields. She also drafted a landmark farm labor bill guaranteeing workers' rights to hold secret-ballot union elections and shepherded it through the legislature.         The controversy she generated in the agriculture post was nothing compared to the criticism that greeted her nomination as chief justice in 1977. Police groups and politicians around the state opposed her on the grounds that she would favor defendants, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, then a bishop and head of the state Agricultural Relations Board, questioned her ''emotional stability'' and her ''vindictive approach to dealing with all persons under her authority.''         Just a year later, conservatives outraged by her decisions on school busing, taxes and other issues began a campaign to remove her. Under California law, supreme court justices appointed by the governor must be approved by the electorate in the next gubernatorial election, and periodically thereafter.         She survived the opposition that year. But on the morning of election day, The Los Angeles Times published an article, citing anonymous sources, suggesting that the Supreme Court had deliberately delayed issuing a split decision overturning a law mandating prison sentences for those convicted of using a gun in certain crimes, so as not to hurt Judge Bird's chances at the polls.         That led to public hearings by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, which portrayed the court as riven by personal conflicts and political infighting. No formal charges of misconduct were brought against any justice, but the controversy generated by the investigation lingered on.         After her ouster in 1986, Ms. Bird, who never married, retreated into semi-seclusion. She cared for her aged mother in Palo Alto and surfaced occasionally as a television commentator or a public speaker, but dropped even some old friends and associates. She had battled breast cancer intermittently since 1976. Her mother died in 1991, and she is survived by two brothers, Philip, of Hawaii, and Jack, of Arizona.         ''If you have never experienced life under a microscope, you need to understand that those who live a public life are no longer seen as real persons -- human beings,'' Ms. Bird wrote in a 1996 newspaper column. ''Rather, they are objects to be examined, manipulated, ridiculed and sometimes even hated.''       
         Elizabeth Zimmermann, who brought a penetrating intellect and a sculptor's sensitivity to revolutionizing the ancient art of knitting, died Nov. 30 at a hospital in Marshfield, Wis., where she lived. She was 89.         Mrs. Zimmermann's best-known gift to knitting was a mathematical formula for figuring the proportions of sweaters and other garments, depending on how many stitches per inch the knitter wanted to use. But her passion, expressed in magazine columns, in four books and at her knitting camp, the nation's first, was creating beauty. She gently urged knitters to challenge the limits of their imaginations.         ''She allowed people to be intuitive about their knitting, rather than just being blind followers of the written word,'' said Nancy J. Thomas, editor of Knitter's Magazine. ''She had a way of being breezy and fun. She made everything seem easy.''         Linda Ligon, president of Interweave Press, which specializes in traditional textile crafts, said Mrs. Zimmermann ''brought intelligence and validity to a craft that had been trivialized as women's work.''         Elizabeth Lloyd-Jones was born near Devon, England, in 1910, the daughter of a naval officer and the woman who invented Meals by Motor, a British forerunner of Meals on Wheels. Her youthful memories, as recalled in ''Knitting Around'' (Schoolhouse Press, 1989), suggested a bucolic paradise, framed by plum trees and plum jam, governesses and private schools.         ''I had a wonderful hideyhole in a gone-to-seed cabbage patch,'' Mrs. Zimmermann said, ''and one day had the excitement and glory of falling through the roof of an abandoned chicken house, garnering the first permanent scar on my leg.''         The women of her mother's family knitted. One day, she asked her mother if she could try knitting, perhaps the most important words she ever uttered.         ''If you're good all day today, I'll teach you tomorrow,'' her mother answered.         Miss Lloyd-Jones attended art schools in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Munich, where she sold sweaters of her own design to a local shop for pocket money. She also met Arnold Zimmermann, a brewer. He had to flee Hitler's Germany because an SS agent overheard him making a snide remark about Hitler. They married in England, immigrated to New York and moved several times before settling in Wisconsin.         Mrs. Zimmermann began spending morning after morning with local knitters, exchanging tips. She became frustrated with many of her friends' lockstep reliance on precise instructions in printed patterns. So, in 1955, she submitted her designs for Norwegian-pattern sweaters to Woman's Day magazine, resolving to use clear language. Other magazines also accepted her designs, and in 1959, she started her own knitting publication.         About the same time, the family, with three children, moved into a derelict schoolhouse in the middle of the woods and remodeled it. She combined her newsletter with a mail-order business for knitting supplies, books and video productions under the name Schoolhouse Press.         She was hostess of a knitting program shown on many public television stations and in 1974 began a knitting camp under the auspices of the University of Wisconsin. The camp has continued every summer since. She also led workshops throughout the United States and in New Zealand.         Besides ''Knitting Around,'' her books included ''Knitting Without Tears'' (Scribner's/Macmillan, 1971), Knitter's Almanac (Scribner's/Dover, 1975) and ''Knitting Workshop'' (Schoolhouse Press, 1981).         She was a woman who held to strong principles about her work, like never using any thread but wool. But she never criticized another knitter's use of other materials, including the dreaded polyester. She developed a reputation for giving pithy advice.         ''A knitter's question which arises perennially,'' she wrote in Knitter's Almanac, ''is, 'How much wool should I buy?' ''         She said there was no blanket answer, but advised, ''If you are using very thick wool, buy more than you could possibly imagine; if you are using very thin wool, use surprisingly little.''         But Mrs. Zimmermann's larger influence was in design, making sweaters and other garments in round tubes, rather than in flat pieces to be joined together. The result was a sculptural quality, said her daughter Meg Swansen, who is also a noted knitter and will carry on her mother's business. By contrast, Kaffe Fassett, a knitter whose work is often exhibited in art galleries, is known for his painterly approach, she said.         But Ms. Ligon said sculptural effects were just the beginning. She said Mrs. Zimmermann's mathematical formula for constructing sweaters in the round freed knitters to concentrate on other creative concerns, like yarn and stitches.         ''She was more than a sculptor,'' Ms. Ligon said. ''She was an engineer.''         Many knitters said the system opened up new possibilities to them.  ''She made me a thinking knitter,'' said Joyce Williams of Sparta, Wis., who attended three knitting camps with Mrs. Zimmermann.         A woman from Reading, Mass., in an online customer review of ''Knitting Without Tears'' on Amazon.com, said: ''Elizabeth's wonderful instructions, comments and faith gave me the O.K. to go ahead and have fun. I made a patterned yoke sweater that not only looks great, but fits as well.''         In addition to Ms. Swansen, who lives in Pittsville, Wis., Mrs. Zimmermann is survived by her husband, Arnold; another daughter, Lloie, of Pittsville; a son, Thomas, of New Hope, Pa.; two grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.         Mrs. Zimmermann chose to play down her influence on knitting, coining the term ''unventions'' for her woolly inventions.         ''The products of science and technology may be new, and some of them are quite horrid, but knitting?'' she wrote in Knitter's Almanac. ''In knitting there are ancient possibilities; the earth is enriched with the dust of millions of knitters who have held wool and needles since the beginning of sheep.''       
         Jeanne S. Chall, a leading expert on how children learn to read and a vociferous antagonist in at least two of the major educational controversies of the last quarter-century, died on Nov. 27 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 78.         The cause was heart failure, said Ariadne Valsamis, a spokeswoman for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where Dr. Chall taught for 26 years, until retiring in 1991.         Dr. Chall championed both challenging reading material for children and the use of phonics in basic reading instruction, as against limited-vocabulary texts and the so-called whole-language approach.         With the argument that easy is not necessarily good, she was a rigorous opponent of the prevailing view of reading specialists in the mid-1970's that if assigned reading was too difficult, children would become frustrated and give up trying to master it.         That view, Dr. Chall said, was responsible for a rash of ''cute kiddie books'' with lavish four-color illustrations, limited vocabulary and rudimentary syntax that made few demands on early readers.         Dr. Chall (pronounced shawl) attacked that orthodoxy with scores of books and articles in which she called for challenging primers.         Dr. Chall pressed her beliefs in a 1977 study that was commissioned by the College Board as part of a project to learn the reasons for a sharp decline since 1962 in average scores on the reading-comprehension part of the SAT. Although her report pointed to a number of possible explanations, it found that the scores tended to rise with the level of difficulty of the material students had been given to read from their earliest days in school.         Dr. Chall engaged in renewed combat in 1983, when, in the spring issue of Contemporary Education Review, she wrote a blistering review of a scholarly book, ''On Learning to Read'' (Knopf, 1982), by the psychologists  Bruno Bettelheim and Karen Zelan.         The Bettelheim-Zelan book, which had been almost universally praised by other professional educators, argued that the ability to decode words need not be taught but instead was intuitive, resulting without effort from the reading of imaginative, interesting stories. Accordingly, the authors said, the cure for the decline in reading scores was more entertaining and engaging primers.         Dr. Chall scorned that argument, maintaining that ''comparisons of different beginning-reading methods over the past 70 years have found that methods that teach decoding earlier and more systematically produce better word recognition as well as better reading comprehension.''         Dr. Chall also vigorously supported phonics, the method of teaching beginners to read by having them associate certain letters with the sounds those letters represent.         Many experts have de-emphasized phonics over the last two decades and instead adopted the whole-language approach, in which reading is taught through context rather than recognition of the alphabet. But Dr. Chall said her research showed that knowledge of the alphabet and familiarity with the sounds that make up words were crucial.         She expressed her view in ''Learning to Read: The Great Debate'' (Harcourt Brace, 1967), recognized as a definitive analysis of reading research.         Jeanne Stemlicht Chall was born in Poland on Jan. 1, 1921, and moved with her family to New York City when she was 7. She became the first member of her family to go to college, graduating cum laude from City College in 1941. She earned both a master's degree (1947) and a Ph.D. (1952) from Ohio State University, and taught at Ohio State, Teachers College of Columbia University and City College before joining the Harvard faculty.         Dr. Chall is survived by three sisters, Sylvia Rauch of East Brunswick, N.J., and Miriam Warmbrand and Shirley Decker, both of Rego Park, Queens, and seven nieces and nephews.
