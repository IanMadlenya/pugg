         Jean MacArthur, the widow of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who remained at her husband's side through the darkest days of World War II and was often introduced by him as ''my finest soldier,'' died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 101.         Throughout their 27-year marriage, the couple, who met when she was 36 and he was nearly 20 years older than her and was the survivor of an earlier unhappy marriage, maintained an old-fashioned formality. Mrs. MacArthur addressed her husband in the presence of others as ''the general.'' He called her ''ma'am'' and in his later years, confided that she was his ''constant friend, sweetheart and devoted support.''         Mrs. MacArthur, whom William Manchester, the MacArthur biographer, described as ''a poem of womanhood,'' married General MacArthur in New York in 1937. They had met two years previously when he was a fellow passenger on the S.S. President Hoover, en route to the Philippines to assume his duties as military adviser to the government there. Later, he became the supreme allied commander in the Southwest Pacific, waged the campaign against Japan and accepted the surrender of Japanese forces in 1945 in Tokyo Bay aboard the U.S.S. Missouri.         When the war ended, he oversaw the occupation of Japan as supreme commander of allied forces in Japan. After North Korean forces invaded South Korea, he also became supreme commander of the United Nations forces in Korea until April 1951, when, in a dispute over the prosecution of the war, he was relieved of both commands by President Harry S. Truman. He returned to America and a hero's welcome and became chairman of Remington Rand and then of the Sperry Rand Corporation. He died in 1964.         Mrs. MacArthur displayed an indomitable spirit and determination in the face of wartime trials.         After the Japanese invaded the Philippines, it was decided to abandon Manila in 1942 and move the government to the island of Corregidor. Mrs. MacArthur packed a few necessities and, as she was leaving the apartment, she passed a cabinet containing the decorations awarded to her husband. She removed the medals from their cases, wrapped them in a towel and made room for them in her suitcase by discarding some of her own clothes.         Later, when the military situation on Corregidor rapidly deteriorated, the general informed her that President Manuel Quezon of the Philippines had offered her and their young son, Arthur, passage to Australia. ''We have drunk from the same cup; we three shall stay together,'' she replied. The MacArthurs and their 4-year-old son lived in an underground bunker during months of bombardment before agreeing to evacuation on President Franklin D. Roosevelt's orders.         Mrs. MacArthur, the former Jean Marie Faircloth, was born in Nashville on Dec. 28, 1898. Her father, Edward C. Faircloth, was a banker and businessman. She was 8 when her parents divorced and her mother, a native of Murfreesboro, Tenn., took her young daughter and her two sons, Cameron and Frederick, back to her birthplace.         The head of the Murfreesboro household was her grandfather, Capt. Richard Beard, a Confederate veteran, and Mrs. MacArthur was raised in a home where a Confederate uniform was a badge of honor.         Fellow members of the Daughters of the American Revolution recalled that ''every time Jean Faircloth heard a Fourth of July firecracker go off, she jumped to attention and saluted.'' Young men were advised that ''if you want to win Jean Marie, you better get a uniform.''         Mrs. Faircloth married again in 1907 and there were two children of that marriage to Frederick Smith -- Harvard Smith and Donna Angeline Smith.         Mrs. MacArthur was educated at Ward-Belmont College in Nashville and at Soule College in Murfreesboro, from which she graduated.         As a young girl, she had not been close to her father, but as he grew older and wealthier, he frequently took her on trips and cruises with him. When he died, he left her a substantial fortune, and she used it to travel extensively, visiting friends in Manila, cruising in Europe and taking her half-sister on a South American cruise and her half-brother on a three-month round-the-world cruise.         A vivacious woman with meticulous manners, Mrs. MacArthur took seriously the social duties connected with her husband's position, both in the military and later in private life. After his death, she refused to bask in reflected fame, leading a quiet social life within a select circle of well-known New Yorkers. She pursued her interests in fashion, theater and opera.         Friends recalled that on one occasion at the Metropolitan Opera, she paused as she walked down the aisle to make sure that the plaque bearing her name was still attached to an orchestra seat. ''I paid $1,000 for it,'' she said.         She also worked on behalf of several civic and philanthropic activities, and was honorary chairman of the board of the Gen. Douglas MacArthur Foundation in Norfolk, Va. In 1990, at age 91, with her friend Barbara Bush at her side, she cut the ribbon opening the research center of the MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk, where her husband is buried.         Mrs. MacArthur received the distinguished public service award from the Department of Defense in 1984, and in 1988, President Ronald Reagan presented her with the Medal of Freedom, the highest award given a civilian in peacetime, for her patriotic service to the nation. The government of the Philippines honored her in 1993 with its Legion of Merit medal. She was one of the few private citizens to receive a visit from the Emperor and Empress of Japan during their trip to the United States in 1994.         One of her favorite stories when she reached the last decade of her life was about her conversation with the driver as she was bouncing around in a New York City taxi. ''I'm 90 years old,'' she said. ''Can you go a bit slower please?''         ''I'm sorry, Mrs. MacArthur,'' the driver said. ''I remember you from the Philippines and how you bounced around in the jeeps there and it didn't bother you.''         Her intimate friends also recalled that although she would order a martini ''to be social'' when dining out, she had earlier briefed the waiters and bartenders in her favorite restaurants on what that really meant. A martini glass filled with water and decorated with a lemon twist would be brought to her, and she would smile appreciatively as she sipped.         She is survived by her son, Arthur, of New York City, and her half-sister, Angie McCarthy, of Murfreesboro, said Col. William J. Davis, executive director of the MacArthur Foundation in Norfolk.         Mrs. MacArthur will be buried beside her husband at the MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk after a private service for her on Wednesday, Colonel Davis said.       
         Hazel Wolf, an ardent environmentalist whose life spanned the 20th century and whose causes encompassed the era's social turmoil, died in Port Angeles, Wash., on Wednesday. She was 101 and lived in Seattle.         Since the early 1960's Ms. Wolf was a leader in the Audubon Society, serving as secretary of the Seattle chapter for 37 years and helping to establish 21 of the 26 Audubon chapters in Washington. She was also active in the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, as its one-time president and as editor of its newsletter until her death.         Born in the 19th century, Ms. Wolf had long spoken of wanting to witness the 21st. She told the oral historian Studs Terkel, who profiled her in his 1995 book ''Coming of Age,'' that she intended to live until the year 2000. ''Then I'm going,'' she said.         Especially in the Seattle region, but also beyond, she was elder stateswoman in a community of intersecting social causes, recognized by the Association of Biologists and Ecologists of Nicaragua for conservation work there, by the Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility with their Paul Beeson Peace Award, by the National Audubon Society with its medal of excellence and last year by Seattle with its Spirit of America Award.         But long before the environmental movement blossomed, providing a cause that made her celebrated in her later years, Ms. Wolf was steeped in struggles over human rights, communism, labor issues, peace, feminism and immigration.         Hazel Anna Cummings Anderson was born on March 10, 1898, in Victoria, British Columbia. Her father was Canadian and her mother was American. After separating from her first husband, Edward Dalziel, she moved to the United States in 1923 with her daughter, finding work as a legal secretary, her lifelong career.         She joined the Communist Party during the Depression, attracted by its support for social welfare programs like food subsidies, unemployment aid and social security.         Her first party meeting, she recalled in a speech years later, was at a home where the local sheriff was at that moment trying to evict a family. ''I joined in what was occurring,'' she said. ''As the sheriff's men brought the furniture out to pile it on the sidewalk, the rest of us picked it up and took it into the house by the back door. This went on for quite a while until the sheriff and his men, who were not very enthusiastic in the first place, left in despair and frustration.''         Ms. Wolf said she lost interest in the party during World War II, as the wartime boom made issues of economic security less compelling to her. But years after she left the party, the government tried to expel her, starting a personal and legal struggle that shaped her life. That fight lasted 15 years, as McCarthyism rose and fell. She once joked that a lawyer she worked for at the time spent so much effort on her case that it was not clear who was working for whom.         The experience led her into advocacy for the rights of immigrants, a cause she never gave up. ''The foreign born were the earliest victims of the McCarthy witch hunt,'' she said 10 years ago in a talk to a high school class. ''They still have a hard and uncertain life.''         In that lecture, as on many other occasions, Ms. Wolf recounted being thrown in jail briefly in 1958, charged with sedition though she had left the Communist Party 13 years before. She told the two other women in her jail cell that she had been accused of conspiring to overthrow the government by violent means. ''What a wonderful idea,'' one of her fellow prisoners said.         ''I never did try to overthrow the government, or if I did, I didn't do a very good job,'' Ms. Wolf said.         But her associates said she never gave up trying to overthrow whatever she saw as unjust, whether it was the behavior of big corporations or the policies of the United States in Nicaragua. Her reputation grew, and she became a frequent public speaker (many of her speeches can be found on the World Wide Web at members.tripod.com/HazelWolf). Only a broken hip prevented her from joining the protests by unions and environmentalists in Seattle during the recent meeting of the World Trade Organization, said Brock Evans, president of the Western Outdoor Clubs.         ''One of her major causes was always for labor to join with environmentalists,'' he said. Another was for environmentalists to include Native Americans, blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups in their movement.         ''People gang up to protect all kinds of things -- civil liberties, freedom of speech,'' Ms. Wolf once wrote. ''It's in our genes to gang up. Anytime we want anything, we gang up.''         Summing up her many causes, she told the American Immigration Lawyers Association last year, ''We lost most of the battles but we won the war in all of them.''         She told them insouciantly that when she finally became an American citizen in 1974, after taking the oath and forswearing allegiance to foreign potentates, she went to a bar to celebrate with friends. ''I proposed the following toast: 'To hell with Queen Elizabeth and to hell with Richard Nixon, too.' ''         She is survived by her daughter, Nydia Levick of Port Angeles, five grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and four great-great grandchildren. Her second marriage, to Herbert Wolf, also ended in divorce.         Ms. Wolf was already at most people's retirement age when a friend persuaded her to join the Audubon Society in the early 1960's. It was the era when Rachel Carson was warning that pesticides and the eradication of habitats were threatening the earth with a silent spring with no song birds, but more than that book or her friend's arm-twisting, it was bird-watching (specifically, observing a brown creeper grubbing in the woods) that sparked her deep involvement with Audubon. For decades more, she continued to go to the woods for inspiration and to urge others along the environmental path.         But she spiced her advocacy with a dollop of salt. In a speech last year on saving the endangered salmon of the Pacific Northwest, she reminded her Seattle University audience of the first reason to do so: the fish are ''good to eat.''         And in a speech on sustainable forestry practices in 1998, she said her goal was not, as she quoted the poet, to ''spare that tree, cut not a single bough,'' but rather to make sure there would always be forests for wild creatures and to provide homes, furniture, paper and ''probably even skateboards.''       
         Jane B. Davies, an independent architectural historian whose devotion took her from reference librarian at Columbia University to pre-eminent authority on the 19th-century American architect Alexander J. Davis, died on Feb. 9. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Although she never received a degree in art or architectural history, Ms. Davies was a constant presence  at universities, libraries and museums that harbored information on  her chosen subjects, A. J. Davis and the romantic movement in American 19th-century architecture.         With no more than her interest and a librarian's salary, she also became an important collector of Davis's prints, drawings and Gothic-style furniture. Some of the pieces are now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the rest of her collection will go to the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University.         ''She was the person who published the most articles on A. J. Davis,'' said Amelia Peck, an associated curator in the department of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''If anyone wanted to know about any facet of Davis's career, Jane was the authority to call.''         Ms. Davies was born in 1913 in Amboy, Ill. The daughter of a small-town banker, Ms. Davies told her niece that she had ''always felt a hankering to go to New York.''         After receiving her B.A. at Wellesley College in 1935 and teaching for several years at girls' preparatory schools in Illinois and Colorado, she earned degrees in German history and library science at Columbia University in 1942 and 1944. Ms. Davies became a reference librarian and rare books cataloguer at Columbia.         In 1942 she married a musician, Lyn Davies, against her father's wishes. Her brother, Warren H. Badger, a lawyer, gave the couple money that they quickly spent on acquiring an architectural print by Piranesi. Mr. Davies became an organist and choirmaster and in his free time a composer. He died in 1994.         Ms. Davies's interest in Davis began in the late 1950's. At the time, nobody else was studying Davis, a  prolific contributor to Victorian picturesque architecture and the designer of landmarks including the Wadsworth Atheneum (with Ithiel Town) in Hartford; Lyndhurst in Tarrytown, N.Y., and the United States Customs House in Manhattan (with Town and others).         Ms. Davies, who friends described as a tiny woman with a quiet but commanding presence, was soon a familiar figure poring over Davis documents at Avery Library, the New-York Historical Society, the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Museum.         When financial problems led the the New-York Historical Society to sell some Davis drawings, Ms. Davies bought several and donated them to Avery Library. She wrote frequently about Davis for scholarly journals and exhibition catalogs and contributed the article on Davis to the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects.         Her introduction to the 1980 reprint of Davis's Rural Residences, the first American pattern book of architectural house plans, was hailed by the Journal of Architectural Historians as ''a herculean task'' prepared by ''a scholar known to every historian of American architecture.''         The greatest recognition of her achievement came with the 1992-93 exhibition ''Alexander Jackson Davis, American Architect,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for which she was the consulting curator.         She is survived by her brother, of Dixon, Ill.         For more than 30 years, Ms. Davies worked on a critical biography of the architect, which she may not have completed; other architectural historians did not produce such a biography, leaving the field to her.         ''We were all rooting for her to get her book, the definitive study on Davis, done,'' said Richard Jenrette, the financier and collector of 19th-century American houses. ''I wouldn't be surprised if she had it hidden away somewhere.''       
         Anna Holbrook Clark, who transcended a secretarial job to become an influential policy adviser to Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and worked at five levels of government, died on Jan. 28 in a Manhattan nursing home. She was 95.         The era in which Ms. Clark served the dynamic mayor known as ''the Little Flower'' seems almost impossibly quaint: he had no telephone on his desk and wandered into her cubbyhole to take calls. But it was the Depression era, and as the country moved toward World War II she was at the center of events during a turbulent period at City Hall.         ''I do not think that anyone who stops to consider it can deny that we are in the midst of a social revolution,'' Ms. Clark said in a paper on economic strategies written for Mayor La Guardia in 1940. She saw the mayor's office as ''one of the nerve centers of the world,'' according to an oral history she prepared in the 1980's.         The pace of life -- eventually as secretary of the Board of Estimate, the panel of top elected officials that then ran city government -- was blistering: Mayor La Guardia resented staff members taking lunch, barely tolerated their vacations and routinely punished unproductive commissioners by making them wait five or six hours for appointments.         Ms. Clark was one of dozens of women promoted by Mayor La Guardia to positions of influence as part of his reformist philosophy. She eventually held jobs at the city, county, state, federal and international levels. Her approach to her often-chaotic working environment was steady, soft-spoken and utterly attentive.         ''You told her something once,'' said Susan Alt, former president of the Women's Civic Club, a policy analysis and advocacy organization of which Ms. Clark was a member throughout her adult life.         Ms. Clark possessed a steely determination learned from her grandmother Kate, a suffragist and prohibitionist who frequently campaigned on street corners.         Women won the right to vote when Ms. Clark was 16. Her mother took her along to the polling place even though she was too young to vote. Smiling broadly, the mother told officials that her daughter was 21 -- a bit of calculated revenge for centuries of female disenfranchisement.         Anna Clark was born in the Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights in 1904. She was the oldest of five children. One sister contracted polio and another died of influenza in 1918, leaving a long shadow over the family, said a niece, Cheryl Chalmers.         But spirited discussions of public affairs obscured the sadness. Talk often revolved around corruption cases that her father, John Kirkland Clark, investigated as a lawyer in the Manhattan district attorney's office.         Ms. Clark attended the Barnard School for Girls, but she later regretted that the school taught her little science. She graduated from Smith College, majoring in government. Her first job was with a magazine published for social workers.         She then received a one-year fellowship to Bryn Mawr College to study bias in the news. Her next job was as a writer for The American City, a technical journal for city government managers. She was laid off during the Depression.         ''I remember saying to my family that I thought if I were a man I might try for a job in city government,'' she said in her oral history. Her father suggested speaking to his secretary, who just happened to be Mayor La Guardia's sister. ''I'm not averse to using contacts,'' Ms. Clark said.         The result was an interview with the mayor at his temporary offices in the Empire State Building during a renovation of City Hall. In the middle of the session, an aide scurried in and whispered in the mayor's ear. The mayor jumped up. ''I have to go to a fire,'' he said. ''Come back on Monday.''         She was not sure she wanted the job, which involved reorganizing extensive files, supervising three secretaries and much more. But when it was offered, at a salary of $2,600 a year, she grabbed it. Eight months later she received a raise of $280 a year, according to a one-paragraph report in The New York Times.         She was meeting people like Robert Moses, the man behind the city and state's highways, bridges and parks. Introducing her, Mayor La Guardia said, ''She's a career woman.'' Mr. Moses looked at her and asked how long that would last.         She never married, perhaps because her social life was circumscribed by the mountains of work she habitually brought home. She was tall and slender, and had ''a sweet manner of speaking,'' said Edith Spivack, 89, a lawyer who worked in the La Guardia administration. Her voice was authoritative, and she squinted a bit when making an important point, said Richard K. Lieberman, director of the La Guardia and Wagner Archives.         Ms. Spivack said: ''She was neat and tidy. She was all the things a lady should be.''         As the war deepened, the Board of Estimate did less and less. So Ms. Clark went to Washington to work in the Pentagon, the State Department and the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency.         After the war she used a recommendation from Mr. Moses to get a job working on transportation issues in Nassau County. She then worked for the United Nations, raising money for Unicef and helping refugees in Bremen, Germany.         For years Ms. Clark continued to fight for civic improvements, as a member of her Upper East Side community board and in other forums. She led the successful fight to expand bus service on First Avenue to better serve the hospitals there. She lobbied to build four tracks rather than the planned two on the Second Avenue subway should that ill-starred line ever be built.         She is survived by a sister, Margaret Vander Veer of Charlotte, N. C.       
         Mae Faggs Starr, an Olympic champion sprinter and the first renowned athlete of the Tigerbelle women's track teams at Tennessee State University, died Jan. 27 at her home in Woodlawn, Ohio. She was 67.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Eddie Starr.         In the 1950's, when women's track and field began its emergence, the Tigerbelles became a national force. Tennessee State's most heralded sprinter would be Wilma Rudolph, who at the 1960 Games in Rome became the first American woman to capture three gold medals in a single Olympics. Faggs, known as ''the mother of the Tigerbelles,'' was the first American woman to compete in three Olympics and was a mentor to Rudolph.         At the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, she ran the first leg on the 4x100 relay that captured a gold medal in a world-record 45.9 seconds, teaming with Barbara Jones, who would go on to Tennessee State; Catherine Hardy; and Janet Moreau.         At the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, Faggs ran on an all-Tennessee State 4x100 relay squad -- with Rudolph, Margaret Matthews and Isabelle Daniels -- that won a bronze medal.         Faggs won 11 national Amateur Athletic Union titles and was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in Indianapolis in 1976.         Aeriwentha Mae Faggs was born in Mays Landing, N.J., but grew up in New York City. She was a student at Bayside High School in Queens when, at age 16, she competed in the 1948 Olympics in London, failing to qualify for the 200-meter finals.         In the fall of 1952, she left for Tennessee State, a historically black school in Nashville. She had never been in the South and was warned by her father about the segregation she would face. But she thrived at Tennessee State, having been the first athlete recruited by Ed Temple, who would build a national reputation as the Tennessee State women's track coach and an Olympic coach.         ''She had a lot of determination, a lot of drive,'' Temple recalled Tuesday from his home in Nashville. ''She didn't back off from anybody, and she was a good student.''         Faggs was tested early on by her teammates.         ''I was already a national outdoor champion, I was national indoor champion, I had been to the Olympics,'' she recalled in an interview with Runner's World magazine in 1993. ''My teammates, all they cared about in practice was running past Mae Faggs. You couldn't let your guard down at all because if one ran past you . . . hey. They turned around and gave you one of those looks that said, 'Uh-huh, I got you now.' ''         With the Melbourne Games coming up, Faggs was trying for her third Olympic berth while Rudolph was a teenager hoping for her first. At the United States trials, Faggs set out to steady Rudolph's nerves with the finals of the 200 meters in sight even though they would compete against each other.         ''I knew Wilma was nervous because she was only 16, and I knew how nervous I was at 16 trying to make the Olympic team,'' Faggs remembered. ''So I told her: 'You do everything I do.' And she says, 'O.K.'         ''In the 200, Wilma was on the inside lane, I was in the second lane, and I couldn't see her coming out of the corner of my eye. So I turned my head and said, 'Come on.' And she said, 'I'm coming.' And she was coming. I mean, she was blowing down that straightaway. I had to reach back and get some of those horses I didn't think I had to beat her.''         After graduating from Tennessee State, Faggs received a master's degree from the University of Cincinnati and then taught physical education at high schools in the Cincinnati area.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Eddie Starr II, of Phoenix, and a daughter, Evelyn Starr, of Pittsburgh; two brothers, Melvin Faggs, of New York City, and Steve Murray, of Huntsville, Ala.; and two grandchildren.       
         Jacqueline Auriol, the glamorous French flier who set several speed records as one of the world's leading military test pilots in the 1950's and 60's, died Saturday at her Paris home. She was 82.         Ms. Auriol was born to the world of fine boarding schools and country manors and married the son of the man who would become president of France. However, she would eventually transcend her role as the official tea pourer of Elysee Palace to succeed in a field that had been almost entirely masculine, except for Hanna Reitsch of Germany, a test pilot for the Third Reich.         Ms. Auriol's life was transformed when her face was crushed in a 1949 accident in a plane in which she was a passenger. She endured 33 plastic surgery operations over the next three years. (She did not see her two sons, Jean-Claude and Jean-Paul, until her face was as restored as possible. It seemed to work: a newspaper commented that her nose might now be American, but her smile remained unmistakably French.)  Rather than discouraging her, the experience turned her resolve to achieving greatness in the air.         Though she had learned stunt flying before her accident, her goal became nothing less than breaking the sound barrier. She watched the Vampire fighter being built in 1951 and eagerly volunteered to be one of the first to fly it.         ''That day I experienced a sense of completeness,'' she told Collier's magazine, ''an extraordinary sensation of power.''         But she had to settle for being the second woman to break the sound barrier, in 1953. The first was Jacqueline Cochran, an American, earlier that year. The two Jacquelines were to become famous rivals, as each in turn would edge beyond the other in speed.         Jacqueline Douet was born on Nov. 5, 1917, at Challans, a small town on the Bay of Biscay. Her father, Pierre Douet, was a wealthy shipbuilder. She spent most of her childhood at Nantes, then studied art in Paris at L'Ecole du Louvre. On weekends, she would ski in the French Alps.         In 1936, she meet her future husband, Paul Auriol, through a friend who was a ski champion. His father, Vincent, was a prominent leader of the Socialist Party. Both families opposed an alliance between Socialists and wealthy industrialists, so they insisted they were too young to marry. She was sent to Sweden, while Paul toured Italy.         However, two years after their original meeting, they married at a small mountain chapel. They divorced in 1967 and remarried in 1987. She was later widowed. Only her two sons survive her.         When World War II broke out, she refused to leave France while her husband was in the resistance movement. She lived in hiding under a false identity. ''I began to realize that I loved danger,'' she told The Washington Post in 1970.         After the war, her father-in-law became president and she, her husband and Jean-Paul, her older son, moved into Elysee Palace. She soon realized ''the parties and receptions were not enough to keep my interest.'' At dinner one night, she sat next to a flying ace and was so captivated by his stories that she asked if she and her husband could take flying lessons from him.         ''It was very difficult politically for my father-in-law because so few women flew at this time,'' she said.  ''I was pretty and I knew I was pretty. There was publicity and I began to be heavily criticized for my flying.''         The result was that her husband gave up flying, while she dropped out of the social and political life to devote herself to it. Then the accident happened. ''I was broken into a million pieces,'' she said. ''I had no face, no nose, nothing.'' She needed a new purpose in life. ''I had the chance of my life to really become a good pilot,'' she said. ''Now that my beauty was gone I would have to derive a reason for being from the plane which had taken it away.''         As an aviatrix, as Current Biography listed her in its 1950's coverage of her achievements, she succeeded greatly, flying more than 100 types of aircraft. She received aviation awards from Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. She was decorated with France's Legion d'Honneur and wrote an autobiography called ''Vivre pour Voler,'' meaning living for flying. At her death, Jacques Chirac, President of France, called her ''the incarnation of courage and modernity for the French people.''         Her conception of modernity did not include all of feminist philosophy. ''These very feminist women irritate me when they say, 'Men hold me back,' '' she said. ''It's not true.''         But she never undervalued the effect of luck. She had a narrow brush with death in 1956, for example, when her Mystere IV plane went into spin and she managed to bring it back under control only a few dozen yards from the ground.         It was all worth it. In the Colliers interview, she spoke of the rows of flowers on the grounds of Elysee Palace. ''Poor creatures,'' she said, ''guardians and ornaments of the Elysee. Once my life was like theirs.'' She then smiled broadly. ''Perhaps I should teach them to fly,'' she said.       
         Louisa Matthiasdottir, an exemplar of the strain of painterly representation that runs through the history of postwar American art, died Saturday at O'Connor Hospital in Delhi, N.Y. She was 83 and lived in New York from 1942 until late 1999, when she moved to Delhi to live with her daughter, Temma Bell, who is also painter.         Ms. Matthiasdottir, whose nickname was Ulla, was born in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1917. She came to New York in 1942 and had her first solo show at the Jane Street Gallery, New York's first artists' cooperative, in 1948. A laconic, independent woman, she gave few interviews and did not teach painting or write about her work. ''As to painting, I just start painting and that's about it,'' she once said.         Those few words summed up a style that was similarly cryptic and to the point, and that reduced the world to a series of simple, blocky shapes and angled planes of clear, ringing color, all dispatched with a crisp, unfettered directness that allowed no reworking.         It was a style that was at once cool and celebratory, and Ms. Matthiasdottir deployed it evenhandedly. Her work included portraits and self-portraits, still lifes, interiors and distilled, light-filled paintings of the coastal landscape of Iceland, which she depicted as sparsely populated by houses, horses or sheep. She maintained close ties to Iceland, where she came to be viewed as something of a national treasure. She visited almost annually and retained her Icelandic citizenship.         Although Ms. Matthiasdottir enjoyed both critical and financial success in New York, especially after 1970, official recognition proved elusive. She was, for example, included in only one Whitney Biennial, in 1973, and is not represented in any of the city's four major museums. She was one of several postwar artists who, despite Abstract Expressionism's unanimous success, persisted in the notion that abstraction and representation were not mutually exclusive states, that one could paint from reality in a way that gave form, color and paint a power all their own.         The artists who acted on this belief in the late 1940's and early 50's included Robert de Niro Sr. and his wife, Catherine Admiral, Nicholas Carone, Fairfield Porter, Alex Katz and later Nell Blaine, as well as San Franciscans like David Park. Yet Ms. Matthiasdottir's style took root in Iceland before the war.         She was born into a well-to-do family in Reykjavik, where her father was a prominent surgeon. Her parents encouraged her painting, she once said, because they never saw her do anything else. In 1934 she was sent to Copenhagen, where she enrolled in a three-year course at the School of Commercial Art, which encouraged her penchant for simplification and bright color. In 1938 her parents took her to Paris, where she studied with Marcel Gromaire and encountered the work of Matisse. She then returned to Reykjavik and worked for two years among the city's small, struggling avant-garde.         Ms. Matthiasdottir developed a style that merged the post-Impressionism of Edvard Munch with the palette of Fauvism, as well as the influences of less well-known Scandinavian modernists. When she came to New York she intended to study at the Art Students League, but ended up attending classes taught by Hans Hofmann, whose emphasis on structure and strong color she found compatible. Within a year of her arrival she met Leland Bell, a tall, handsome painter who was as voluble as she was aloof. Their marriage in 1944 marked the beginning of a partnership that included side-by-side studios in their house on 16th Street, occasional double exhibitions and a shared gallery, the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery on Madison Avenue, where Ms. Matthiasdottir had 17 solo shows between 1964 and 1991.         Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the Indiana Art Museum in Bloomington and the National Gallery of Iceland in Reykjavik.         Mr. Bell died in 1991. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Matthiasdottir is survived by four granddaughters.         Correction:  March 4, 2000, Saturday  An obituary of the artist Louisa Matthiasdottir on Thursday misstated the given name of a postwar artist with whom she shared the belief that abstraction and representationalism were not mutually exclusive approaches to painting. The artist was Virginia Admiral, not Catherine.       
         Christi Finch, whose catering shop, Word of Mouth, was among the first to produce luxury takeout food on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, died on Tuesday. She was 54.         Her death, at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, came after a prolonged gastrointestinal illness, her family said.         Ms. Finch's down-home charm made even the newest customers feel welcome when they shopped for  delicacies like brandied pate and a spiced pumpkin mousse or homespun offerings like meatloaf and giant chocolate chip cookies.         Ms. Finch and her partner, Eileen Weinberg, opened the first Word of Mouth on East 72nd Street near Lexington Avenue in 1976, at a time when most takeout food consisted of mundane fare. The partners had met at  Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital, where they both worked in administration. Discovering a shared love of food, the two self-taught cooks baked  cakes for doctors, some of whom became their backers.         Together Ms. Finch and Ms. Weinberg turned out their interpretations of ethnic foods, with a strong emphasis on Mediterranean cuisines, including Moroccan specialties, then rare in New York City. They offered copious portions of dishes that were at once lusty, yet subtly stylish, and their high prices rarely deterred affluent neighborhood customers.         Shortly after the shop moved to its present quarters at 1012 Lexington Avenue in 1979, Ms. Weinberg left to open a restaurant and her own takeout food shop, Good and Plenty to Go, in the Theater District.         Ms. Finch also opened Cafe Word of Mouth and began to work on a cookbook. The restaurant and cafe are still open.         Christi Kangas grew up in a food-oriented family in Cutler City, Ore.  Her father, George Kangas, was in the grocery business, and her mother, Janice, tested recipes at home for a local flour mill. Ms. Finch's lifelong appreciation of the freshest seasonal produce began in the vegetable garden of her grandmother.         As a young woman, Ms. Finch settled in New York, where she married Thomas Finch in 1967; they were divorced a few years later.         She is survived by her daughter, Pilar; her parents, of Lincoln City, Ore.; and her sisters, Kathryn Amrani, Sheila Coventry and Sharon Borgford, who all live in the Portland, Ore., area.       
         Margaret Rosezarian Harris, a musician and educator who was the first black woman to conduct the  symphony orchestras of Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Minnesota and 11 other American cities, died on March 7 in New York City. She was 56 and lived in Elmsford, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said Sandra G. Owen, a friend.         Ms. Harris was born in Chicago on Sept. 15, 1943, the only child of Dewey and Clara Townsend Harris. Before her fourth birthday, she played a public piano recital of 18 short pieces and three encores, all performed from memory. She was soon performing in halls as far from home as the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, earning as much as $2,000 a performance.         When she was 6, her parents ended the tours and placed her in school. At 10 she performed with the Chicago Symphony and won a scholarship to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.  Ms. Harris's mother moved with her to Philadelphia, working there as a dressmaker. Her father, a Pennsylvania Railroad mechanic, remained in Chicago, visiting his wife and daughter regularly until his death in 1967.         Ms. Harris later earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the Juilliard School. Her graduate work was supported by a grant from the Leopold Schepp Foundation. Ms. Harris would later become a trustee of the foundation.         Though piano was her first love and she played solo recitals in the United States and abroad, Ms. Harris gained the most prominence as a conductor. She worked on Broadway as well, notably as music director of the musical ''Hair,'' a position she took over in 1970. Her orchestra was made up of seven male musicians, all older than she.         ''They don't give me a bit of trouble personally or professionally,'' Ms. Harris was quoted as saying in a New York Times article about this pioneering engagement for a black woman. She added, ''It's like having an unlimited charge account at Saks Fifth Avenue.''         In 1995, she was invited by the United States Information Service of the United States Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to serve as an American cultural specialist for a production there of ''Porgy and Bess.''         Among her compositions are two ballets, an opera called ''King David'' and two piano concertos, the second of which was performed twice with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Zubin Mehta.         Last month Ms. Harris was appointed associate dean of the Pennsylvania Academy of Music in Lancaster, a position she was scheduled to assume in June.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Jean Howard, who rode the comet of her extraordinary beauty, ethereal glamour and insouciant intelligence to become a Ziegfeld girl, a Hollywood starlet, a legendary hostess and the house photographer of the film colony, died at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Monday. She was 89.         Ms. Howard's circle included Tyrone Power, Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Jennifer Jones, Merle Oberon, Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe -- impressive company for the daughter of a traveling salesman. She thrived in a seemingly ancient time when stars socialized for purposes other than publicity, including simply enjoying each other's company.         They played croquet in matches that lasted years (with timeouts for rest, refreshment and the occasional movie), played on California beaches and hung out in Palm Beach, Palm Springs and the south of France. They also mingled at Ms. Howard's Spanish-style home on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills; she and her first husband, Charles K. Feldman, who used his success as the first super-agent to become a producer, bought it for $18,000 in 1942.         Everywhere, Ms. Howard snapped pictures. One shows Gene Tierney, then a top star at 20th Century Fox, in pigtails, looking longingly into the handsome face of the mysterious millionaire Howard Hughes. Another shows a tipsy Richard Burton kissing everyone in sight, including a less-than-charmed Clifton Webb.         Still another shows Dietrich almost touching heads with Ann Warner, wife of Jack, the studio head, as they intensely discussed never-to-be-known secrets over a smoky table at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Linda Christian can be seen being fitted for her wedding gown to marry Tyrone Power.         Many of these photographs were stored in shoe boxes. Meanwhile, Ms. Howard studied photography and began to get assignments taking pictures for magazines like Life and Vogue. Years later, the idea coalesced to combine her snapshots and professional work in a picture book.         In 1989, Harry N. Abrams published ''Jean Howard's Hollywood: A Photo Memoir.'' James Watters wrote the text, which is delivered through Ms. Howard's first-person voice. The book evokes a lost world where stars lived lives that were breathtakingly glamorous, but still somehow life-sized.         In the pictures, everyone, it seems, is smoking. Everyone is holding a drink, everyone is dressed in black tie or cocktail dress. People gather around the piano and sing. Conga lines end up in swimming pools.         ''These photographs bring back memories of a time and a place that have long since faded,'' Ms. Howard wrote in the book's introduction. ''Hollywood has changed and things don't happen as they once did. Never mind. The people who crowd these pages are clear as snowcapped mountains on a bright sunny day.''         Ms. Howard was born Ernestine Hill in Longview, Tex., and grew up in Dallas. She became acquainted with a local photographer, who had discovered several child stars, including Ginger Rogers, and believed she had a bright future. So she changed her last name to that of the photographer, Mahoney, even though her father continued to foot the bills for her fashion shows and beauty contests.         Her father took her to Hollywood one summer in the late 1920's. ''I was his coverup while he was on a two-week toot with a girlfriend behind my stepmother's back,'' she said in the book.         She soon returned to Hollywood and checked into the all-girl Studio Club, founded by Mary Pickford to help young hopefuls working toward movie careers. In 1930 she landed a contract with Metro Goldwyn Mayer, appearing first as a chorus girl in ''Whoopee,'' Eddie Cantor's Broadway musical hit.         Florenz Ziegfeld, who had produced the Broadway show and was a partner in the film, asked her and three other showgirls to go to New York for his next musical, ''Smiles.'' Ziegfeld cast her under the name Jean Howard, which he deemed less cumbersome than Ernestine Mahoney. She got a part in the last ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' where one review cited her ''pulchritude, figure and charm.''         As an MGM contract player she had small roles in a number of movies in the 1930's and 1940's, including ''Broadway to Hollywood'' and ''The Prizefighter and the Lady.'' The studio chief Louis B. Mayer, passionately attracted to her, proposed marriage and promised to divorce his wife. She said later that when she rejected him he got drunk and tried to throw himself out of a window.         She became engaged to Feldman, a lawyer and film agent, who is credited with being the first to sell director, actors and other talent as a single package. According to The New York Times of Aug. 26, 1934, the two had attended a Friday night dinner party at the Colony restaurant in New York and decided to get married immediately.         Mayer's jealous threat to torpedo Feldman's career did not materialize, and the agent went on to play an increasingly prominent role in Hollywood, eventually producing ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' in 1951, among other films.         The couple had a famously tempestuous relationship, which resulted in a divorce in 1948. But they continued living in the same house, with its tortoise shell pedestals and Chinese porcelain lamps and a garden room where Judy Garland belted out songs on many occasions. They called it their ''can't live with you, can't live without you postmarital relationship.''         In a 1989 interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune, Ms. Howard said she ''wanted to be the other woman in his life.''         Ms. Howard traveled extensively, often with her friend Cole Porter. That resulted in another picture book, ''Travels With Cole Porter,'' published in 1991.         In 1964, she felt seasick on a Mediterranean cruise and got off the yacht in Capri. She went to a nightclub called Number Two, where a band called the Shakers was playing. She asked a band member, Tony Santoro, if he would play a song she had written. He did, though not necessarily because of its quality.         ''I was more interested in this beautiful woman than the music,'' he said in a telephone interview. They lived together for nine years, mainly in Capri and Rome, and were married in 1973. He is her only immediate survivor.         Ms. Howard once said that ''glamour is flimsy.'' She knew the stars as people, including one of her favorite subjects, Marilyn Monroe. ''She didn't know who she was or who she belonged to,'' Ms. Howard told the San Diego paper. ''The marriages never gave her anything to go on. There was the ballplayer (Joe DiMaggio) and Arthur Miller.         ''Miller was a very good writer and all of that, but I have never seen him in anybody's living room, and I have been in a few living rooms.''         Then there was the party she gave for Senator John F. Kennedy during the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, at which he won his party's nomination. After everyone had left and she was cleaning up, she heard someone scratching at the window screen, according to a 1993 article in Town & Country.         She looked out and saw Kennedy, who said, ''I'm starving and nothing's open at this hour.'' She led him to the kitchen and fed him scrambled eggs. She said the senator then pulled her to him and kissed her. She told the magazine that people would have to read her autobiography to find out what happened.         But she never published one.       
         Vivian Harris, a comedian and chorus girl and the performer with the most recorded appearances -- 10,000 -- at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, died Feb. 18 in Englewood, N.J. She was 97.         Ms. Harris, who died at the Nursing and Retirement Home of the Actors Fund of America, was one of the women hired by the manager of the Cotton Club for a new chorus line when Duke Ellington came to play for the white audience there. She was one of the first ever to dance the Charleston, in the 1923 Broadway  show ''Runnin' Wild.''         She performed with the top black comics Pigmeat Markham, Spider Bruce and Ralph Cooper during the  Depression years, when comedy kept the Apollo afloat.         Leonard Reed, a singer and dancer at the Apollo in 1935 and theater manager from 1950 to 1960, remembers her as ''one of the sweetest girls I ever met in my life.'' Indeed, the two were sweethearts from 1927 until 1929. Until the Apollo started using masters of ceremony in the mid-1950's, he said, it was her voice, clear and precise, that came from behind the curtain to announce the night's big attraction.         ''She would say, 'The Apollo Theater takes great pleasure in presenting Duke Ellington' or Cab Calloway, or whoever,'' he said.         William Miles, a filmmaker who made the 1981 documentary ''I Remember Harlem,'' said Ms. Harris was known as the Voice of the Apollo. In addition to her announcements, he said, she often sang ''I May Be Wrong, but I Think You're Wonderful.''         Ms. Harris was born on Dec. 23, 1902, in Harlem. She was the second of five daughters; the others were Lottie, Margie, Lorraine and Edna Mae, who became a star of the black cinema. Her father, Sam, gained some fame as a boxer and then became a customs inspector. Her mother, Mary, worked as a maid for the Gay 90's pin-up Lillian Russell, among others.         As blacks gradually moved uptown, the Harrises were among the first black families to migrate to Harlem. They wanted to be near the new home of their church. Their brownstone on 132nd Street was also near the Lafayette Theater, where stars like Ethel Waters, Maud Russell and Butterbeans and Susie would perform.         Her sister Lottie was something of a groupie; she would invite the performers to the house for dinner and often to stay for the night. Mr. Harris said, ''I might as well open a rooming house,'' and did.         This resulted in the stars' practicing routines in the house's big kitchen. They worked with the girls on their singing and dancing skills and  encouraged them to pursue show business careers. All but Margie did.         After graduating from Julia Richmond High School, Vivian joined ''Shuffle Along,'' the Broadway production put together in 1921 by the ragtime pianist Eubie Blake and the singer and lyricist Noble Sissle. The show ushered in a series of successful black musicals on Broadway.         Ms. Harris went on to be a chorus girl in ''Runnin' Wild,'' with music by James P. Johnson and lyrics by Cecil Mack, which added a new dance, the Charleston, to the national repertory. Mae Barnes introduced the dance in the first act, but Ms. Harris's spirited third-act version also drew enthusiastic attention.         A review in The New York Times of Oct. 31, 1923, said that in addition to its funny comedy, the show ''excels in eccentric dancing -- some of the most exciting steps of the season (though steps is not always the right word, for knees are used more often than ankles) are now on view at the Colonial.''         Ms. Harris performed in other productions on what came to be known as Black Broadway. She traveled to Paris, London and other European cities with Lew Leslie's ''Blackbirds,'' a theatrical revue. Working with Tim Moore, who became famous as Kingfish in the ''Amos 'n' Andy'' television series, she performed the burial scene from the play ''Porgy,'' the precursor to the same scene in Gershwin's opera ''Porgy and Bess.''         When Duke Ellington started at the Cotton Club in 1927, the manager hired a new chorus line, which included Ms. Harris. ''They had nothing but light girls, they didn't have any real dark girls there at the time,'' Ms. Harris said in the Harlem documentary. ''Only the two girls at the ends of the line were dark.'' She was considered light.         The women wore big, feathery costumes, and Ms. Harris's exotic tap dance caught the eye of one of Ellington's trumpet players, Louis Metcalf. The two were married, with cases of  Champagne to celebrate, despite Prohibition. Ms. Harris said the gangsters who controlled the Cotton Club were the benefactors.         In 1935 Frank Schiffman, the manager of the Lafayette Theater, bought a burlesque house on 125th Street that Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia had ordered closed. It became the Apollo.         Ms. Harris started there in 1935 as the voice behind the curtain, and over the years performed with almost all the popular black comedy acts. She played in the first rendition of Pigmeat Markham's ''Here comes  the judge'' skit, immortalized for a later generation by Flip Wilson.         In Dusty Fletcher's ''Open the door, Richard'' skit, another classic of the black comedic stage, she played the woman in the window  Dusty vainly tried to reach.         When Mr. Moore went out to California to play Kingfish on ''Amos 'n' Andy,'' he recommended Ms. Harris to play Kingfish's wife, Sapphire. She flunked the screen test.         ''I came out looking too white,'' Ms. Harris said. ''I was rejected and it broke my heart.''         But she stayed at the Apollo until 1970, working as cashier and in the wardrobe department when she was not onstage. Undoubtedly, some of her 10,000 appearances involved exchanging tickets for money in the box office.         Her sister Edna Mae, who left home to star in films, including ''The Green Pastures'' in 1936 and ''The Notorious Elinor Lee'' in 1940, always lamented that her sister did not aim higher.         ''She could have had a career like Ethel Waters or Alberta Hunter,'' Edna Mae said in the 1980's. ''I still don't know why she stayed.''         Vivian's marriage was brief, and she never remarried. There are no immediate survivors. But when she visited Harlem, as she did almost every day until recent years, everybody greeted her.         Mr. Reed, Ms. Harris's long-ago boyfriend, was known for his theme song, ''It's Over Because We're Through.'' But he says he cannot  remember why he and Ms. Harris broke up.         ''There wasn't a hate bone in Vivian's body,'' he said.       
         Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, Miss Sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.         She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein musical ''Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the actress Uta Hagen. Miss Sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' Miss Hagen said at a program at the Kaye Playhouse in honor of Miss Sokolow's 85th birthday.         Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''She has influenced us all.''         Miss Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience.         If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she  was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established National Council on the Arts.         Among her most famous pieces was ''Rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also titled ''Rooms''  (1966), which featured, among others, Martha Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''Bullfight'' and ''A Moment in Love.''         Miss Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. Her ''Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit.         In 1967 Miss Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''Street Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New York.         Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.''         Analyzing her outlook, Miss Sokolow once said: ''I don't have a dim view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''         Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents immigrated  from Russia, and she was born in Hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;  her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the Socialist Party.         The family lived in poverty on the Lower East Side. But like many immigrants, the Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. She continued her training at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years.         Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering humanity, Miss Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving Russians.         She played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940. Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young Mexican choreographers.         Miss Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ''Lyric Suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been danced by Miss Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and several ballet companies.         Miss Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in 1958. Miss Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and choreographer.         In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio.         Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.         Not all her dances were somber. ''Magritte, Magritte'' was based upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''Odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''Poem'' was lyrical. Nevertheless, ''Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode  that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers.         A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Miss Sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''September Sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. Miss Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award.         Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on you. But I love dance more than I love you.''         Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the choreographer Anna Sokolow on Thursday referred incorrectly to her departure from the 1967 rock musical ''Hair.'' She was dismissed before it opened; she did not withdraw.       
         Frances Gray Patton, a writer whose short stories appeared in The New Yorker through four decades and whose works included the popular 1954 novel ''Good Morning, Miss Dove,'' died Tuesday at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. She was 94 and lived in Durham.         Ms. Potter's finely crafted stories offered glimpses into Durham society in the mid-20th century, a world she knew well as a Duke faculty wife.         Her first published work, ''A Piece of Bread,'' the story of a Southern girl's encounter with a prison chain gang, won a Kenyon Review prize and was included among the 1945 ''O. Henry Memorial Award Prize Stories.''         After that, The New Yorker began publishing Ms. Patton's stories, 30 in the next 10 years. Others appeared in magazines like Colliers, Harper's, The Saturday Review of Literature and McCall's. Her first book, ''The Finer Things of Life'' (1951), a collection culled mostly from works that appeared in The New Yorker, earned praise from critics.         Three years later, Ms. Patton's first novel, ''Good Morning, Miss Dove,'' was published. Developed from her story ''The Terrible Miss Dove,'' first published in Ladies' Home Journal, the work chronicled the life of a strict but beloved geography teacher in a small American town whose sudden illness shocks the community.         Writing in The New York Times, Charles Poore described the work as ''ruthlessly sentimental'' and ''a cheerful mixture of 'Goodbye Mr. Chips' and 'Mary Poppins,' with touches of the rigorous way to salvation from 'Life With Father.' ''         The novel was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and the movie rights were sold to 20th Century Fox, which turned the story into a popular film starring Jennifer Jones.         In 1955, Ms. Patton published ''A Piece of Luck,'' a second collection of stories, set mostly in suburbia, that explored the private worlds of children and women. A third collection, ''28 Stories,'' was published in 1969.         Frances MacRae Gray was born in Raleigh, N.C., where her father was editor of The Raleigh Times. Her mother had been the first woman to enroll at the University of North Carolina.         Ms. Patton became a writer by way of the theater. After high school, she attended Trinity College, now Duke University, before enrolling at the University of North Carolina, where she held a fellowship as a playwright and was active in the Carolina Playmakers. Over the years, she taught creative writing at both universities.         She is survived by a son, Robert, of San Francisco; two daughters, Mary Bogdonoff of Manhattan and Susannah Patton of Bethesda, Md.; nine grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Sasha Von Scherler, an actress and comedian who appeared in more than 100 productions in New York City, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 65 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung disease, said her daughter, Ruth Mayer.         Miss Von Scherler followed her mother, an actress trained by the playwright and producer David Belasco, into a life in the theater. Her father, a Prussian baron named Walram-Voystingus Albert Alexander Von Schoeler, did not approve.         In a 1980 interview in The New York Times, Miss Von Scherler said her early life was marked by some radical peregrinations, from a convent school in Windsor, Ontario, to Tokyo, where she first set foot on stage in an amateur production.         After attending the Yale School of Drama -- she was expelled for staging a personal sit-in to show her opposition to building stage scenery -- Miss Von Scherler made her professional debut at the Cherry Lane Theater in 1956, in George Bernard Shaw's ''Admirable Bashville.'' It was the first in a nearly unbroken string of plays over the next 20 years.         Among her roles were Mrs. Brown in Eugene O'Neill's ''Great God Brown'' in 1959, Olivia in Joseph Papp's 1969 production of ''Twelfth Night'' in Central Park, and Avonia Bunn in three separate productions of ''Trelawney of the Wells.'' She helped support her acting habit by appearing in several soap operas.         More often than not Miss Von Scherler, a woman with large, twinkling eyes and a merry laugh, played supporting roles, often stealing scenes. In a 1971 review of ''Trelawney,'' Walter Kerr of The Times wrote that ''Miss Von Scherler was rather like a fine painting propped in one corner; the rest of the room might be filled with attractive objects and engaging people, but your eye kept wandering back to her.''         In the mid-1980's Miss Von Scherler earned a master's degree in social work and became a therapist and counselor; she worked for more than 10 years at an AIDS treatment center in Greenwich Village.         In 1995 she appeared in ''Party Girl,'' a film written and directed by her daughter, Daisy Von Scherler Mayer.         In addition to Daisy and Ruth Mayer, both of Brooklyn, she is survived by her husband, Paul Avila Mayer, and another daughter, Rachael, of Glen Ridge, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Alice Sheets Marriott, matriarch of the tight-knit family whose name stands on thousands of hotels worldwide, died on Monday in Washington. She was 92.         Beginning in 1927 with a single root beer stand, Mrs. Marriott and her husband, J. Willard Marriott Sr., built one of the world's leading hospitality companies. Today, Marriott International, which is still run by the Marriott family, has more than 140,000 workers and annual sales approaching $10 billion.         Along the way, Mrs. Marriott also raised a family that now numbers two children, eight grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren. She ''personified the American dream,'' Marriott International said in a statement.         Alice Sheets was born in Salt Lake City, on Oct. 19, 1907. In June 1927, while still a teenager, she graduated with honors from the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree in Spanish. Two days later, she married Mr. Marriott, another University of Utah graduate, and the couple set off in a Ford Model T to Washington, where Mr. Marriott had just opened a root beer stand. There she worked as the shop's bookkeeper, taking its hard-earned nickels to the bank each day.         As summer turned to fall, root beer sales slipped, leaving the Marriotts anxious to expand their menu. Mrs. Marriott spoke to the chef of the Mexican Embassy to learn the recipes for tamales and chili con carne. The Marriotts practiced the dishes in their apartment for two days, then added them to the menu at the stand, which they renamed The Hot Shoppe. The spicy dishes were a hit, and the Marriotts quickly opened more Hot Shoppes.         ''Almost from the start, my parents -- especially my father -- launched the process of figuring out how to do something right and then writing it down. From washing windows to burnishing silverware to arranging buffet tables and processing customers' checks, no aspect of the workplace went untouched,'' J. W. Marriott Jr., wrote in his 1997 memoir, ''The Spirit to Serve: Marriott's Way.''         A devotion to detail served the Marriotts well, as the chain thrived, eventually expanding to 65 sites. The Marriott family was also growing -- J. W. Jr. was born in 1932, and Richard followed in 1939.         Then, in 1957, the Marriotts moved into the hotel business, which was taking off in tandem with the interstate highways. Mrs. Marriott spent much of the night before the opening of the first Marriott hotel, the Twin Bridges Motor Hotel in Arlington, Va., helping hang pictures in each of its 365 rooms.         By offering travelers a consistent, dependable and safe night's rest, the Marriott chain quickly surpassed more established competitors. Today, many hotel operators consider Marriott the world's top hotel company, with a reputation for treating employees and customers fairly.         As Marriott grew, Mrs. Marriott spent more time on charity work in the Washington area, including serving two 10-year terms on the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. A conservative Republican, she was vice chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1965 to 1976, and honorary chairman of the 1973 Nixon inaugural committee.       
         Margaret E. B. Jones, a retired Army major who served with the only battalion of African-American women to serve overseas in World War II, died on April 11 at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington. She was 89.         Mrs. Jones spent most of her adult life in military service and had lived in Alexandria, Va., since 1980, said her husband, Everett Jones, a retired Army major.         In 1945, Mrs. Jones, then Second Lieutenant Barnes, was one of 31 officers who accompanied more than 700 enlisted members of the Women's Army Corps' 6888th Battalion when they were sent to England. The battalion had been formed after civil rights organizations and black newspapers complained that the military was not using African-American women in meaningful jobs.         When the battalion arrived in Britain, members were told to sort through piles of mail that filled two hangars in the countryside, said Charity Adams Earley, who was the battalion's commanding officer.         Mrs. Earley said that white women serving in Europe were working as drivers for officers or doing other tasks equivalent to their male counterparts, and the women of the 6888th had hoped for the same kinds of duties.         ''They told us that if we were going overseas, we would be given assignments men had,'' she recalled from her home in Dayton, Ohio. ''That was a fairy tale.''         Instead, in the sealed orders they received, which they were not permitted to open until the planes carrying them to Britain were in the air, they learned they would be assigned to the postal unit. But soon, Mrs. Earley said, the women realized how vital their new job was to troop morale in wartime Europe.         The women moved three million pieces of mail in three months, much of it letters sent to soldiers who had been transferred, had died, or been scattered after the D-Day assault in France.         ''To move the mail with them was a really tough job,'' said Judith Bellafaire, curator of the Women in Military Service for America Memorial in Washington. ''They worked in 24-hour shifts and they cleared that mail out and were credited with raising the morale of the troops. They have a lot to be proud of.''         Mrs. Jones was in charge of public relations for the battalion, which broke records for the amount of mail it distributed.         Some of the mail, which had been sitting in storage for months, contained spoiled cakes and cookies, and there was even a package of steaks a mother had sent to her son overseas, Mrs. Earley recalled.         Margaret Ellen Barnes was born on Jan. 7, 1911, in Oberlin, Ohio. Her mother, Margaret Sallee Barnes, was active in community and civil rights groups, and her father, James D. Barnes, worked as a chef. Her mother's parents had been slaves in Kentucky, and she reared her children to value education and to stand up for their rights.         After three years at Howard University, where she later received a bachelor's degree, Margaret Barnes joined the military in 1943, a time when it was racially segregated and there were few places for women. She signed up for the same reasons many men did at that time, said her husband: ''She wanted to do something for her country.''         Mrs. Jones became one of the first African-American women commissioned as an officer in the Women's Army Corps. At the time, African-Americans were limited to 10 percent of the overall troops, said the Army Center of Military History. When 400 women were accepted as officer candidates for the WAC's, the 40 black women became known as the Ten Percenters.         Ordered to Fort Breckenridge, Kan., after her basic training, she became the executive officer of a company that consisted of 175 black women. Even though many of the women had college educations, they were assigned to cleaning floors and latrines in the hospital and working in the post laundry.         Mrs. Jones complained to a superior officer, and persuaded him to reassign them to other duties, according to a book about the 6888th Battalion, ''To Serve My Country, To Serve My Race,'' (New York University Press, 1996) by Brenda L. Moore.         After the war, Major Barnes returned to Howard to complete her degree. She then did graduate work in American history at the University of Minnesota.         She was recalled to active duty in 1949, and placed in command of a training company at Fort Lee, Va. After her marriage in 1953, her husband was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and she to Fort Belvoir, Va. Later they were both sent, separately, to France, and then she was assigned as a special services officer in Kansas. She retired as chief of administration at Maison Fort in France and later accompanied her husband to a post in Germany.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Margo Kaufman, a humorist, writer and radio commentator with a keen instinct for the comedic possibilities in the mundane, died on Friday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 46.         The cause was breast cancer, her husband, Eric Mankin, said.         In her writings for such publications as The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and Cosmopolitan magazine, Ms. Kaufman established her gift for homing in on the hilarity -- and sometimes pathos -- in everyday life. She regaled readers with accounts of traveling with her family, tedious home renovations and her beloved pug dogs or, after her cancer was diagnosed in 1989, with details of her illness and its often painful treatment.         Piping and sardonic, her distinctive voice was familiar to radio listeners in Los Angeles, where she was a regular commentator on KABC, and nationally, with frequent appearances on National Public Radio's ''Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me.''         She eventually elaborated upon the essays in three books, ''1-800-Am-I-Nuts?,'' ''This Damn House!: My Subcontract with America'' and ''Clara, the Early Years: The Story of the Pug Who Ruled My Life.''         A graduate of Northwestern University, Ms. Kaufman began her career as a columnist for City Paper, an alternative weekly in her native Baltimore, and continued writing after she moved to Los Angeles, first at the LA Weekly and then for national publications.         An aficionado of pug dogs, which she regarded as ''living proof that God has a sense of humor,'' Ms. Kaufman proudly carried a business card identifying herself as a Hollywood correspondent for Pug Talk magazine.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her son, Nicholas; her father, Allan Pearlstein of Boca Raton, Fla.; her mother, Gloria Asnes of New York; a sister, Laurie Goldberg of Atlanta; a brother, Robert Pearlstein of Baltimore; and a grandmother, Flora Pearlstein of Baltimore.         ''You just can't get through life without a sense of humor these days,'' Ms. Kaufman told an audience in 1993, a year after learning that her cancer had spread. ''The most awful things can be really funny. You have to be able to laugh or it gets too depressing.''       
         Dina Abramowicz, the longtime librarian at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research whose firsthand and encyclopedic knowledge of the lost Yiddish world of Eastern Europe made her a treasured resource for hundreds of scholars and writers for more than half a century, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.         She was 90 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Abramowicz had a formidable memory, and not only for those who peopled her cherished birthplace, Vilna, Lithuania, the great center of Yiddish culture now known as Vilnius, where the YIVO collection originated.         Her mind was a mental card catalog for hundreds of rare and obscure books and historical materials in the dusty YIVO stacks. And she hunted them down for scholars like Irving Howe and novelists like Leon Uris as well as for thousands of ordinary people trying to research their family histories.         When George F. Kennan, the diplomat and historian, was looking for material one day on a 19th century convert to Christianity, she led him not only to the entry in the library's precious Russian-Jewish encyclopedia but also to a scarce book in Yiddish about Jewish apostates.         ''This is the sort of book that Dina knew off the top of her head,'' said Zachary Baker, who succeeded Ms. Abramowicz as YIVO's head librarian and now is curator of Judaica at Stanford University's library.         Her friend Esther Hautzig, a Manhattan book editor and writer who grew up in Vilna, said of her, ''No computer on earth can store the information she had in her brain because she lived through it.'' She remembers Ms. Abramowicz as the librarian who provided her with her first library card.         Almost daily, Ms. Abramowicz received inquiries from journalists and writers who liked to season their prose with a word or two of Yiddish. They relied on Ms. Abramowicz as their authority for the transliterated spelling of words like bobe (grandmother) and yichus (pedigree).         Though less than five feet tall and dainty in an Old World way, Ms. Abramowicz could be flintlike in her insistence upon historical and linguistic accuracy. When a letter to The New York Times stated that the word ''Holocaust'' was first used in the Dec. 24, 1942, daily bulletin of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, she made sure to write a corrective letter. The agency's bulletin, she pointed out, used a term translatable as atrocities, not Holocaust, and the probable first use of Holocaust to refer to the mass slaughter of Jews was from the May 14, 1943, Polish daily Nowy Dzien, which used the Polish word for holocaust, calopalenie, to describe the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto.         Her life, sorrowful as parts of it were, had a striking symmetry, from Vilna to the New York home of the archives rescued from Vilna.         Vilna was fiercely loved by its Jewish inhabitants as the ''Jerusalem of Lithuania,'' a city of writers like Chaim Grade and Abraham Sutzkever. Ms. Abramowicz was the librarian first of Vilna's Jewish children's library and then, after the Nazis herded Jews into ghettos, of the ghetto library. When she came to New York in 1946, she soon went to work for the transplanted version of one of Vilna's most important institutions, the YIVO library, many of whose thousands of books and artifacts had been smuggled out by a ragtag band of slave laborers and partisans known as the paper brigade.         She was YIVO's head librarian for 25 years, until 1987; then in her late 70's, she was eased off to work as research librarian, a position she held until her death.         The daughter of teachers, Ms. Abramowicz was born in 1909, when Vilna was part of the czar's empire; it was to live under Polish, Lithuanian, German and Soviet Russian governments before she left. She grew up speaking Russian, but when the Germans occupied Vilna during World War I, they allowed Jews to start their own schools, as part of a divide-and-conquer strategy, and Dina's parents sent her to Yiddish-language elementary and high schools.         After studying Polish literature in university, she went to work for her first library, the Kinderbibliotek. She also became a member of YIVO, the  acronym for the Yiddish name of the Yiddish Scientific Institute, an organization founded in 1925. It soon became a repository of manuscripts of Sholem Aleichem and Biaklik, records of Jewish communal governments and other historical documents as well as thousands of books.         When the Germans invaded in World War II and crammed Vilna's 56,000 Jews into neighborhood ghettos, Herman Kruk, a librarian, tried to maintain an oasis of normality in the madness by setting up a library, and he asked Ms. Abramowicz to staff it.         ''How can we think of a library under these conditions, and who will come to read books there?'' she remembered asking a fellow librarian.         ''Since there was nothing one could do about this absurd situation, what was the use of talking and wondering?'' was the answer she remembered getting.         In its first year, the library circulated 100,000 books to its starving, brutalized readers, mostly, it turned out, escapist fiction.         In September 1943, the ghetto was liquidated. Ms. Abramowicz's mother was dispatched to Treblinka, where she was killed; Ms. Abramowicz to a labor camp. By a stroke of fortune, the door on the cattle train opened on the Vilna platform and she simply walked off. She wound up in a less rigorous camp, one for workers who processed fur for the German army's winter coats. She escaped into the woods and joined Jewish resistance fighters as a nurse's helper.         After the war, she found her father in New York, where he had traveled just before the war broke out in September 1939. She soon met Max Weinreich, a surviving YIVO founder, and joined him in reconstituting the YIVO collection in New York.         Beyond helping scholars who visited the Vanderbilt mansion that for years housed YIVO and its new home on West 16th Street, Ms. Abramowicz seemed to take on the search for roots as a personal compulsion.         ''At certain periods of your life, you start to want to find out what happened to your parents,'' she said once. ''I think it is the survival instinct of a people trying to find out who they are.''         Other than two nephews and a niece, Ms. Abramowicz left no survivors. But her name endures in dozens of acknowledgments by the authors whose research she shepherded. In his tribute in ''The World of Our Fathers,'' the classic work about the immigrant Jews of New York,  Mr. Howe thanked YIVO for making the book possible, ''especially its indefatigable and splendid librarian, Dina Abramowicz.''       
         Claire Trevor, an Academy Award-winning actress who epitomized cynical but warm-hearted careerists -- reporters, gun molls, saloon entertainers and trollops -- died Saturday at a hospital near her home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 91 and had suffered from respiratory ailments in recent months, said Richard Elbaum, a spokesman for the family.         A Brooklyn native who became enamored of stage acting and found her way into the movies during Hollywood's golden age, Miss Trevor appeared in nearly 70 films, working under legendary directors like John Huston and John Ford and playing alongside such famous leading men as John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart.         She played the former girlfriend of a gangster (Humphrey Bogart) who becomes a burned-out streetwalker in ''Dead End'' (1937) and a freewheeling woman forced out of town by bluenoses in the classic version of ''Stagecoach'' (1939). She was the alcoholic mistress of a mobster played by Edward G. Robinson in ''Key Largo'' (1948) and a spunky jet passenger in ''The High and the Mighty'' (1954).         She may be best remembered for ''Key Largo,'' for which she won the Oscar for best supporting actress playing the part of Gaye Dawn, a has-been cabaret singer who, in one emotionally charged scene, is forced by her sadistic lover to sing ''Moanin' Low'' in return for a drink. Feebly, she manages to sob through the song, but Mr. Robinson's character denies her because, he says, her singing was ''rotten.''         Miss Trevor also received Academy Award nominations for ''The High and the Mighty'' and ''Dead End.''         The blond, smoky-voiced Miss Trevor was a dedicated performer who repeatedly breathed fresh life into her films, many of which sorely needed her grace and gumption. Early on she became a ''queen of the B's,'' the low-budget action movies that rounded off double bills. But she got plenty of ''A'' roles, making the most of them.         In other key roles, she was a faithless lover in ''The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse'' (1938), a conspiratorial killer in ''Murder, My Sweet'' (1945), a vitriolic Broadway actress in ''The Velvet Touch'' (1948), an overprotective mother in ''Marjorie Morningstar'' (1958) and a scornful shrew in two melodramas, ''Two Weeks in Another Town'' (1962) and ''How to Murder Your Wife'' (1965).         The modest Miss Trevor was one of the few actresses whose seemingly effortless talent made most viewers take her for granted, while film buffs cherished her. Looking back, she concluded that she never became a top star because she lacked the drive that energizes them. ''I didn't know,'' she said, ''that to make a real career in Hollywood you have to become a 'personality,' have to cultivate publicity departments and become known as 'The Ear' or even 'The Toe.' ''         On television, she won an Emmy award in an acclaimed 1956 revival of ''Dodsworth,'' with Fredric March in the title role. She artfully portrayed his vain wife, who consorts with shallow lovers in a futile battle against age. Miss Trevor said she enjoyed working for television because it provided her with a wider, more sympathetic range of roles. But she said she never wanted to sacrifice personal happiness for her career. ''As for a TV series, never,'' she said, ''Life's too short and, frankly, I'm not terribly ambitious.''         Claire Trevor was born Claire Wemlinger on March 8, 1909, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, the only child of Noel and Betty Wemlinger. (Mr. Elbaum said Miss Trevor's stepson, Donald Bren, said she was born in 1910; many reference works list her birth in 1909.) Her father was a Fifth Avenue merchant tailor who soon moved the family to Larchmont in Westchester County. After her graduation from high school, Miss Trevor took art courses for six months at Columbia University before studying for six more months at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She began honing her craft in repertory theater in Michigan, St. Louis and Long Island and through shorts filmed in Brooklyn.         These appearances led to starring roles in two Broadway plays, ''Whistling in the Dark,'' a hit, and ''The Party's Over,'' a flop. The Fox movie company had noticed her, however, and offered a five-year contract. Although she wanted to stay in the theater, she had no immediate stage prospects and accepted Fox's offer, arriving in Hollywood in 1933.         She then made 14 Fox quickies over four years. Most were action-adventure pictures dominated by the leading men, but she won wide praise for playing several hard-bitten newspaper reporters. ''I worked like a demon, and I knew it was a job,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1995. ''Saturday night, you never could plan on going out to dinner because we'd break for dinner for one hour and work till 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the morning.''         Spencer Tracy was the early co-star she admired most, and she said she quickly began imitating ''the clever way he throws away a line.'' Another favorite leading man was Mr. Robinson, with whom she appeared in ''Big Town,'' a popular radio series, from 1937 to 1940. He played Steve Wilson, editor of the mythical Illustrated Press, and she was Lorelei Kilbourne, his ace reporter and foil.         Her longtime wish to return to Broadway materialized in 1947, when she and Philip Dorn co-starred in a comedy, ''The Big Two.'' The consensus of critics was that they gave the play much more artistry and vitality than it deserved. It closed after 21 performances.         Her private life was far different from the lives of the sassy characters she played. She was married to Clark Andrews, director of her radio show, from 1938 to 1942, when they divorced. In 1943 she married Cylos Dunsmoore, a Navy lieutenant. The marriage produced a son, Charles, but ended in divorce in 1947.         Her third marriage, to Milton Bren, a film producer, lasted from 1948 until his death in 1979 of a brain tumor. Mr. Bren had two sons from a previous marriage, later prompting Miss Trevor to recall fondly that they had ''an instant family.'' In 1978 Miss Trevor lost her son, Charles, in an airliner disaster.         The losses of her son and husband in the span of a year left her devastated, and she moved to New York, settling into a Fifth Avenue apartment and embarking on a busy social schedule. She also occasionally returned to acting, in her last role playing an aging schoolteacher in the 1987 television movie ''Norman Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties.''         Miss Trevor would later return to California, where she was also known as a generous philanthropist.         She is survived by her stepsons, Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Company, a real estate investment firm in Newport Beach, and Peter Bren, president of Koll-Bren-Schreiber, a real estate investment firm in New York.       
         Barbara Cartland, whose outpouring of more than 700 romance novels during seven decades made her the undisputed queen of a genre for hundreds of millions of readers the world over, died yesterday at her home near Hatfield in Hertfordshire, England. She was 98.         Throughout her professional life, Dame Barbara possessed a most uncommon ability: she was able to turn out 50,000-word novels at the rate of two a month. During the 1980's, when she was hardly young, she routinely produced 23 titles a year. With all of it she still managed to live the good life in Camfield Place, her gracious 400-acre estate in Hertfordshire,  with Twi-Twi, her Pekingese, and with her white Rolls-Royce ever at the ready, a pink mohair rug neatly folded in the back seat, there to keep guests comfortable when they were driven to her home from the station.         And although her name may not have been taken seriously by the more serious students of comparative literature or by the subscribers to literary supplements, about one billion copies of her 723 books were printed and sold in 36 languages.  Bantam and Jove Publications were among her several American publishers.         She has appeared in The Guinness Book of Records as the world's best-selling author, breaking records for 18 years.         In a century in which so many writers struggled against censorship laws for the right to describe a variety of sexual activities in explicit terms, Dame Barbara's prose remained dedicated to an unlikely celebration of the adventures of passionate virgins.         ''People don't roll around naked in my books,'' she said in an interview in 1987. ''I do allow them to go to bed if they're married, but it's all very wonderful and the moon beams.''         It was the way to sustain an approach to fiction writing that remained essentially unchanged from the early 1920's to the end of her days. She was totally convinced of its appropriateness. When it was suggested that she could be a tad more risque, she replied, ''You can't get more naked than naked, can you, and then where do you go from there?''         Her virgin heroines were typically fresh as April's peach blossoms. They were always wide-eyed, idealistic and impecunious, as demure as they were determined to struggle against all manner of vicissitudes in their quest to find Mr. Right.         He, in turn, was invariably a dark, square-jawed chap, perhaps with bulging biceps, incessantly given to splendid thoughts despite his worldliness. He was furthermore possessed of that indefinable magnetism that seems to surround men who have an enormous bankroll, a title and all the connections needed to keep good women out of harm's way forever.         Dame Barbara never asked anything of her heroines that she didn't ask of herself. Although twice married and the mother of three, she did not really like being kissed or touched, wrote a biographer with whom she cooperated, Gwen Robyns. ''It was part of the strange complex which meant she was a virgin not only physically but also mentally and spiritually,'' Ms. Robyns wrote in 1985.         The process by which a man and a woman found each other usually occurred in Regency, Victorian or Georgian times, and before they got to live happily ever after, her characters said things like, ''Oh, Miss, there is evil in this house,'' or, ''My son will never marry; I am his life.''         Her narrative style provided ample cement for such dialogue.         ''All she knew was that she was close against him and he was kissing her wildly, passionately, demandingly and the world stood still,'' she wrote in ''Fire in the Blood,'' published in 1983. ''He kissed her until he carried her as he had before up the peak of Olympus, and they were no longer human but one with the gods.'' Even with stuff as racy as this, readers came away thinking that her heroines remained as untouched as they had been in Chapter 1.         ''My heroines are always virgins,'' the writer said in 1973. ''They never go to bed without a ring on their fingers; not until page 118 at least.'' She also asserted that her notion of a truly sexy man was one who was ''fully clothed and preferably in uniform.''         People who watched Dame Barbara in action were not sure how she produced so much work. She wrote so quickly that even her fans were not always in agreement as to how many titles she had produced at any given time. Since mere typewriters could never keep up with her, she neatly avoided them and dictated her fiction to awestruck assistants who wrote furiously, backed up by tape recorders.         She was frequently able to dictate 7,000 words in an afternoon session, which usually lasted a few hours. She held forth from a sofa, a hot water bottle at her feet, her dog cuddled next to her, asleep. Her secretaries were not permitted to sneeze or cough while she dictated.         Perhaps in part because of her approach to dictating, her prose offers a prodigious number of one-sentence paragraphs, closer in its look to wire-service journalism than to the pages of Faulkner or Fitzgerald. In addition to her books she wrote some 30 plays. Asked why she wrote so much, she replied, ''I wanted the money.'' On other occasions, however, she denounced society's materialism, if not her own.         Barbara Hamilton Cartland was born in Warwickshire County, England, on July 9, 1901, the daughter of Bertram Cartland and Nancy H. Scobell Cartland, who was better known as Polly. Mr. Cartland was handsome and charming and came from a prominent family. But he could never have been the prototype for the novels his daughter would write. He was not a very good provider, and when his father's fortune was lost, forcing the family members to sell their house, it was Polly Cartland who led them into a home far less commodious than the one they had lost. The new one she rented offered only six bedrooms, a tennis court, stables and a garden that nobody had tended lately.         ''Poor I may be, but common I am not,'' Polly said, sounding not unlike the heroines her daughter would later create. The Cartlands made do, and young Barbara and her two brothers spent their formative years this way, learning to play tiddlywinks and other games. By the time she was 19, Dame Barbara said, she had rejected four proposals of marriage.         After she completed finishing school, she turned to writing and produced her first novel, ''Jigsaw,'' in 1922 when she was 21. It did not get good reviews -- one critic called it a ''modern feverish novel of the amateur'' -- but it went into six editions and was translated into five languages.         She married Alexander McCorquodale in 1927. He was a rich Scotsman widely known as an accomplished salmon fisherman. They were divorced five years later, and although she said she did not like the McCorquodale family much, she married Hugh McCorquodale, Alexander's cousin, in 1936. This marriage lasted until Hugh's death in 1963.         In addition to her writing, Dame Barbara found time to support many charities, promote aviation and work to improve the plight of pensioners and the acceptance of Gypsies in England. She was also credited with popularizing a swimming pool on the roof of the Hotel Piccadilly in London. She tried her hand at designing wallpaper and lent her name to a perfume. The perfume venture was unsuccessful, she said, because the perfume was not expensive enough.         In 1950 she moved into Camfield Place, a palace built in 1867, in which Beatrix Potter wrote ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' at the turn of the century. In 1991 she was made a Dame of the British Empire. She said she was sure the honor was not for her contributions to literature but for her efforts of behalf of charities and the Gypsies.         Dame Barbara is survived by a daughter, Raine, Countess Spencer, who was the stepmother of Diana, Princess of Wales; and two sons, Ian and Hugh McCorquodale.         Dame Barbara was steadfast in her belief in vitamins -- at one point she took 78 a day -- and in yoga, clairvoyance, fruit sugar, ginseng, garlic and honey. She wrote so convincingly that honey was an aphrodisiac in ''The Magic of Honey,'' published in 1970, that a temporary shortage was created in Britain.         She had no use for smoking, white bread, white sugar and most forms of alcohol, but she drank brandy when she visited New York in 1981 because, she said, she could taste chlorine in the water.       
         Penelope Fitzgerald, who began a prize-winning literary career late in life with a series of understated novels written in lilting prose, died on Friday in Highgate, London. She was 83 and lived in London.         Ms. Fitzgerald was the author of the 1995 novel ''The Blue Flower'' about the German poet Novalis and his hapless love for a 12-year-old girl. The book won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1998, defeating works by authors Philip Roth and Don DeLillo.         The writer A. S. Byatt once called Ms. Fitzgerald ''Jane Austen's nearest heir, for precision and invention.'' Ms. Fitzgerald published her first novel, a mystery, ''The Golden Child,'' in 1977, when she was 60. The book was written to entertain her dying husband, Desmond Fitzgerald. But despite her late start, Ms. Fitzgerald wrote 13 books, including biographies. They were leavened with a forgiving humor and gentle flashes of illumination. She won England's  Booker Prize for ''Offshore'' in 1979.         Her books were short, usually around 200 pages, and comprised of brief, pointed scenes. For her early books, she drew on her own life. There was her experience working in a bookshop and living in an abandoned warehouse in Suffolk, recounted in ''The Bookshop'' in 1978. That novel was short-listed for the Booker Prize. Then came her story of trying to survive as a young mother on a houseboat on the Thames in ''Offshore.'' In ''Human Voices'' (1980) she used material from her job at the BBC during World War II. ''At Freddie's,'' 1982, was based on her job teaching child actors.         Ms. Fitzgerald's characters were people fallen into difficult circumstances, struggling to cope. She once called them ''exterminatees,'' which she defined as ''likely to be stamped out with other things unlikely to succeed.'' Yet there was a deep sympathy, an underlying moral vision in her work. She did not write religious books, but she once described herself as religious.         Everything in Ms. Fitzgerald's background ordained her for an intellectual career, and yet for much of her adult life she was beleaguered, coping with a husband who drank and had difficulty keeping a job, and raising three children. She was born in 1916. Both her grandfathers were Anglican bishops. Her father, Edmund Valpy Knox, was the editor of Punch. One uncle, Ronald, was a Catholic convert, a Monsignor and a  spokesman for the church. Another uncle, Dillwyn, was a Greek scholar and cryptographer who helped break German codes in World War I and II. A third uncle, Wilfred, became an Anglo-Catholic priest. It was a deeply competitive family, with Ms. Fitzgerald, her brother, Rawle, who became a foreign correspondent, and their uncles vying at the dinner table at literary games. She later wrote a biography of her father and his brothers, ''The Knox Brothers,'' published in 1977. Ms. Fitzgerald's mother, Christina, was one of the first female students at Somerville College, Oxford. Penelope was sent to boarding school at the age of 7, an experience that devastated her.  Then, when she was 18 and about to go to Somerville herself, her mother died.         At Somerville, she studied with J. R. R. Tolkien and graduated with honors in 1938. She married Desmond Fitzgerald, a major in the Irish Guards. He had been trained as a barrister, but became a travel agent.  Ms. Fitzgerald once told an interviewer that her husband ''didn't have much luck in life.'' She supplemented the family income by working at various jobs, including in the Ministry of Food. With her husband, she was editor of ''The World Review,'' a small literary journal. The family moved often and ended up living on a dilapidated houseboat in London. In 1963 it sank for the second time. ''A lot of people would have gone down, too,'' Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria told a writer for The New York Times magazine last year. ''My dad was drinking a lot then.  Somehow, my mum pulled herself together.'' The family moved to public housing and Ms. Fitzgerald became its main breadwinner. She is survived by Maria, of London; another daughter, Christina Dooley, of Cornwall; a son, Valpy Fitzgerald of Oxford, and nine grandchildren.         Ms. Fitzgerald published her first book, a biography of the Victorian artist Edward Burne-Jones, in 1975. Yet despite the difficulties of her life as a young married woman, she refused to blame the delay in her writing career on her obligations as a wife and mother. ''In all that time, I could have written books and I didn't,'' she told The Times Magazine. ''I think you can write at any time of  your life.'' She was also reticent about her marriage.         Indeed, there was a delicate, elusive quality about Ms. Fitzgerald.  She had an apologetic, modest manner that concealed an underlying strength. ''She's prepared to play the scatty old lady,'' A. S. Byatt told the Times. ''But there's a steely intelligence under that gentle scattiness.''         In her later works, Ms. Fitzgerald departed somewhat from the autobiographical mode of her earlier fiction. She wrote ''The Beginning of Spring'' (1988), set in pre-Revolutionary Russia. ''The Gate of Angels,'' was about Cambridge in 1912 and based loosely on her uncles' lives. She loved the research involved in historical fiction, she said, but found writing incurably painful.  ''I hate writing, ,'' she told Publisher's Weekly. ''You just welcome any interruption that comes.''         Her editor at HarperCollins in London, Stuart Proffitt, compared her recent books to Beethoven in his ''late period,'' he said, '''where everything is getting pared down but the content is more concentrated.''         Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria said that she worked until the week she died. Her final book, ''The Means of Escape,'' a story collection, is to be published next fall by Counterpoint.         ''I have remained true to my deepest convictions,'' Ms. Fitzgerald said in 1998. ''I mean to the courage of those who are born to be defeated, the weaknesses of the strong, and the tragedy of misunderstandings and missed opportunities, which I have done my best to treat as comedy, for otherwise how can we manage to bear it?''         Correction:  May 8, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the British novelist Penelope Fitzgerald on Wednesday misidentified the publisher of ''The Means of Escape,'' her story collection due this fall. It is Houghton Mifflin, not Counterpoint.       
         Helen Beardsley, a mother of 20 who recounted the story of her unusual family in a book that was later made into a popular movie, died  April 26 at a hospital in Healdsburg, Calif. She was 70 and lived in Santa Rosa, Calif.         The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, her family said.         In 1968, Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda starred in the film ''Yours, Mine and Ours,'' based on Mrs. Beardsley's 1964 book, ''Who Gets the Drumstick?'' (Random House), which recounted the logistical problems of raising 20 children in a modern middle-class American family.         Mrs. Beardsley's first husband, Lt. Richard Dale North, a Navy pilot, died in a fighter-jet crash in 1960, when she was six months pregnant with their eighth child. The next year, she married another naval officer, Chief Warrant Officer Francis L. Beardsley, whose wife had recently died of diabetes, leaving him with their 10 children. The 18 children ranged in age from 6 months to 15 years. By 1964, the Beardsleys had two additional children of their own.         ''I was the oldest of the North boys,'' said Nicholas North, who became a middle child. ''I had lost a father, but all of a sudden I had older brothers.''         Teresa Wyble, the youngest of the North children, said that when the families joined, it was as if she had gained a twin. ''There is only six months between my sister Joan and I, and there are several of us like that,'' Mrs. Wyble said. She said the household had at least one birthday in every month but May.         When the Beardleys were first married, they lived in a two-story, four-bedroom house in Carmel, Calif. Later, using proceeds from the book and movie, they added a floor, five bedrooms and five bathrooms.         A bread company used the children in its commercials in the 1960's and delivered 50 loaves to the Beardsleys every two weeks. The Navy commissary listed the family as a restaurant so that the Beardsleys could buy food at wholesale prices.         Helen Eileen Brandmeir was born April 5, 1930, in Seattle. She studied nursing at Seattle University. She was named Mother of the Year by the National Campfire Girls in 1963 and was a member of the California Advisory Commission on the Status of Women.         When Mr. Beardsley retired from the Navy in 1968, the couple opened three bakeries in Monterey, Calif. In 1973, Mrs. Beardsley went to work for the Carmel Community Hospital. She later worked as a cardiovascular technologist at a hospital in Fresno, Calif. The couple retired to Santa Rosa in 1986.         Mrs. Beardsley is survived by her husband; 20 children; 44 grandchildren; and 2 great-grandchildren.         Explaining once how she had managed to keep the house running smoothly, Mrs. Beardsley said, ''I think the military background helped.''       
         Ruth D. Turner, a Harvard professor, author, curator and diver who became one of the world's leading experts in the species of mollusks that devour wooden piers and sunken ships, died on April 30 at a nursing home in Waltham, Mass. She was 85.         Dr. Turner added volumes to the understanding of the creatures known as teredos, commonly called shipworms because of their resemblance to worms but actually a species of mollusk related to clams.         Sometimes called ''the mollusk with the million-dollar appetite,'' teredos were mentioned in Greek literature dating to 350 B.C. and were dreaded by early ocean explorers, including Columbus who lost all his vessels to the worms on his fourth voyage to the Americas. They have also been blamed for the deterioration of the Hudson River piers in New York City.         Dr. Turner even hypothesized that the pests caused the hole in the wooden dike that the Little Dutch Boy plugged with his finger. ''It may be the little Dutch boy put in more than his thumb,'' she said. ''He probably put his whole arm in there.''         Dr. Turner, who was affectionately called Lady Wormwood, wrote more than 100 publications, almost all on shipworms, covering everything from their means of reproduction to how they bore into wood and how they dispersed over wide distances. Her study of the worms took her around the world.         Working with Robert D. Ballard, who discovered the sunken liner Titanic in 1985, she identified mollusks as the reason so little wood remained in the wreck. She investigated dozens of other shipwrecks and appeared on National Geographic television specials to discuss deep-sea vent systems, the warm-water ecosystems caused by volcanic activity. She was named to the Women Divers Hall of Fame, sponsored by several organizations including the Women's Scuba Association and the Underwater Society of America.         In 1971, she was the first woman in the Alvin, the deep-sea submersible owned and operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod. She was comfortable in the male-dominated society of ocean research, often enjoying poker with her male colleagues.         Her passion was mentoring researchers in the manner in which William J. Clench, her predecessor as mollusk curator at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, had inspired her. She was always ready to provide free room and board at her Cambridge home to a needy student.         ''Do what sets you on fire,'' Dr. Turner urged her students. ''If you do what you love, you'll succeed.''         Ruth Dixon Turner was born on Dec. 7, 1914, in Melrose, Mass. Her father was cabinet maker; her mother was a dressmaker. She had seven brothers and sisters. Two sisters, Winifred Garrity of Sudbury, Mass., and Lina MacNeil of Wayland, Mass., survive her.         She worked her way through Bridgewater State Teachers College, then took a job in a one-room schoolhouse in Vermont, the first of several teaching posts in New England. She worked for a short period at the New England Museum of Natural History, now the Boston Museum of Science.         In 1944, she earned a master's degree in ornithology from Cornell University. She then taught at Vassar and worked as a biologist at the Clapp Laboratory in Duxbury, Mass. Her next stop was Harvard, where she worked as a research assistant as she earned a doctorate in biology from Radcliffe in 1954.         She remained at Harvard as a research assistant and biology lecturer. When Dr. Clench invited her to lunch, she quickly became intrigued by mollusks. ''Things were not going well in the bird department,'' she later explained.         From 1963 to 1975, she was the Alexander Agassiz Fellow at the zoology museum. Since 1976, she has been a professor of biology. She also served as co-editor of the scientific journal Johnsonia.         A tiny woman with a strong jaw and equally strong opinions, she brought an easy grace to scientific expeditions, teaching others how to tie seaman's knots and sometimes cutting hair. She scuba dived until she was well into her 70's and went on her last expedition just two years ago. She never married.         The love of her life were the students she helped to understand science. She said this devotion came from a promise she had made to Dr. Clench.         ''When I asked Bill how I could return the kindness he'd given me, he said, 'You can't,' '' she said. '' 'Just do it for the next generation.' ''       
         Elizabeth Dooley, who watched more than 4,000 consecutive Boston Red Sox home games over 55 seasons from her front-row box seat, died Monday in Boston, hours before her beloved Red Sox suffered a 22-1 beating from the Yankees. She was 87, a year younger than Fenway Park, the home of the Red Sox.         In 1996, Ted Williams, the greatest Red Sox player of them all, said of Ms. Dooley: ''Forever, she's the greatest Red Sox fan there'll ever be. Every time I get a chance to get around here I like to do it, because she's really a big league gal.''         Ms. Dooley shrugged off that accolade.         ''I do not consider myself a fan,'' she said. ''I am a friend of the Red Sox.''         Lib Dooley was a faithful friend. She called Williams Theodore and telephoned him on his every birthday. When Bobby Doerr retired, she started sending him clippings from Boston newspapers.         Dom DiMaggio was another of her Red Sox favorites. Upon learning of her death, he told The Boston Globe: ''She was a perfect lady. I remember so well when she presented us with our American League championship rings after we won in 1946. She was so thrilled. The Red Sox were practically her whole life, from what I could gather.''         They were indeed. From 1944 until 1998, she did not miss a home game and sometimes made road trips. Illness forced her to miss some games in 1998 and 1999. This year, she made only opening day and last month's Red Sox Hall of Fame dinner.         She would sit in Box 36-A in the front row behind the Red Sox on-deck circle, delivering Oreos and Starbursts to the players and then watching the game intently. Despite her close seat, she said only one foul ball came her way, by Carroll Hardy in the early 1960's. She caught it and broke two fingers.         She never married. She attended Boston College at night, and then, for 39 years, was a gym and health teacher in the Boston public school system. In 1956, she moved to an apartment in Kenmore Square. It was seven minutes from Fenway Park, she said, a little longer as age made walking more difficult.         She came by baseball naturally. In 1901, her father, John Stephen Dooley, helped the new Red Sox team get a home at the Huntington Avenue Grounds. According to her family, the father attended every season opener from 1894 until 1970, when he died at 97. ''I despise bridge and I hate gossip,'' Lib Dooley said. ''I wanted something where I could go by myself without anyone ruining it by saying, 'I can't do it this week.' Baseball gets you out in the fresh air and keeps you from talking about your neighbors.''         Her friendship with players did not alter her perspective.         ''The fans are really baseball, not the players,'' she said. ''You can always get someone to play ball. It doesn't have to be someone who gets $4 million to work two hours a day.''         David Leary, her 24-year-old grandnephew, sat in her seat at Monday night's game. Afterward, he got a game ball to place in her coffin.         Her survivors include four sisters, Winifred A. Dooley, Katherine M. Dooley and Anna Martin, all of Milton, Mass., and Mary Jane Boyd of Texas.       
         Mary Benson, an author, journalist and political campaigner who wrote passionately about the struggle for racial equality in her native South Africa,  died at home in London on Monday, her literary agent, Felicity Bryan, said. She was 80.         Miss Benson's books included a novel, ''At the Still Point,'' and biographies of Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela, his wife at the time, written while Mr. Mandela was still serving his long prison term and decades before he would become president of South Africa. In her memoir, ''A Far Cry: The Making of a South African,'' Miss Benson told how her early racial prejudice gave way to a wholehearted repudiation of white minority rule in South Africa.         Along the way, she grew close to many of the leading figures in the anti-apartheid movement, and her tiny apartment in St. John's Wood became an unofficial refuge for South Africans working for the cause in London.         It was Miss Benson whom Mr. Mandela sought out one evening in 1962 when, after slipping illegally out of South Africa to raise support in West and East Africa, he made a quick side trip to London. She had been expecting Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress; when she opened the door, Mr. Mandela was standing beside him.         ''I can't think what I gave them to eat, because I am a very indifferent cook, but it was quite an extraordinary evening,'' Miss Benson recalled in 1996, describing how Mr. Mandela paced up and down her apartment, brimming with ideas. ''He talked so excitedly and with such enthusiasm. It was unforgettable.''         Mary Benson was born into the privileged world of country clubs and servants in white South Africa in 1919. Passionate about films and bored by life at home, she traveled to Hollywood on a cargo ship as a teenager, using a mix of charm and determination to win interviews with Jimmy Stewart and other movie stars, about whom she then wrote.         Restless and daring, Miss Benson served as an aide to various British generals in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. She worked as a volunteer with displaced persons after the war, before becoming secretary to the director David Lean.         It was not until 1948, when she read Alan Paton's ''Cry, the Beloved Country'' that Miss Benson saw her country with new eyes and discovered the cause that was to be her life's passion. She began a correspondence with Mr. Paton (she was also to develop intense correspondences and lifelong friendships with Athol Fugard, among others) and campaigned in London for the rights of black Africans. She helped found the Africa Bureau with the Rev. Michael Scott, an Anglican priest who championed Namibian independence and with whom she fell in love.         Miss Benson returned to South Africa in 1957, becoming secretary of the defense fund for the 156 people, Mr. Mandela among them, who had been charged with treason for opposing the country's apartheid laws. Compelled to leave the post when she became ill with a debilitating form of arthritis that was to dog her throughout her life, Miss Benson turned her attention to writing. When the African National Congress was banned, she continued to support its leaders, visiting Mr. Mandela when he was forced underground and at least once accompanying him in a car in which he posed as her chauffeur.         Among Miss Benson's first books was a history of the outlawed African National Congress, published in the United States as ''South Africa: The Struggle for a Birthright.'' In 1964, after reporting on the political trials that resulted in long prison terms for the A.N.C.'s members, Miss Benson was placed under house arrest and her passport was confiscated. She left the country in 1966, returning only once in the next 24 years -- for a month in 1968, to be at her father's deathbed -- but continued to write about South Africa through the late 1990's. She never married.         Among other projects, Miss Benson also edited Athol Fugard's ''Notebooks'' and wrote a number of radio plays for the BBC. She was also the author of ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater.''         On the occasion of Miss Benson's 80th birthday in December, Mr. Mandela sent a message from South Africa. ''It reminds me of all the great help you gave to me and my family while I was in prison,'' he wrote. ''I send you all my thanks and appreciation of your generous friendship over half a lifetime.''         Correction:  June 23, 2000, Friday  An obituary yesterday about the South African writer Mary Benson misstated the title of one of her books. It is ''Athol Fugard and Barney Simon: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater,'' not ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith.''       
         Alice Lord Landon, a pioneer in women's swimming and diving who was a presence on the American Olympic scene for eight decades, died last Thursday at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 98.         At age 13, Alice Lord swam nine miles across Long Island Sound. At 18, she was a platform diver on the first United States women's swimming team in the Olympics.         At 82, she led the procession of American athletes at the Los Angeles Olympics, wearing a replica of her uniform from the 1920 Games at Antwerp, Belgium.         And at 94, she carried the torch for the Atlanta Games when it moved through Daytona Beach, Fla.         ''Alice was the grand dame of the Olympians,'' said Dorothy Franey Langkop, honorary executive director of United States Olympians, an association of former competitors that the diver and her husband, the Olympic high-jump champion Dick Landon, helped found in the mid-1940's.         Lord Landon was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1993.         She was evidently the oldest female American Olympian, according to the United States Olympic Committee. Hal Prieste, 103, who won a diving bronze medal for the United States in 1920, is listed as the oldest living American Olympian.         Growing up in Brooklyn and then Westchester County, Alice Lord was encouraged by her father to pursue physical fitness.         ''My brother and I walked 20 miles a day,'' she would recall. ''I swam distance, going a little further and faster every day, but not for competition. I wasn't working to make the Olympics, because I didn't know what the Olympics were.''         She began competing with the newly formed Women's Swimming Association of New York, which dominated the emerging sport. But diving conditions were primitive. The practice pools were often only 6 feet deep, forcing Lord Landon to snap forward quickly and cup her hands after entering the water to keep her head from hitting the bottom.         Competing at the 1920 Games, she was handicapped by the lack of a coach and failed to make the finals in platform diving. But her teammates from the swimming association were among the stars of the Games. Aileen Riggin Soule, now 94, won the gold medal in springboard diving, and Ethelda Bleibtrey captured three golds in swimming to lead an American women's sweep.         On the ship going to Antwerp, Alice Lord met Dick Landon, and the high-jumper and the diver were married two years later in a burst of publicity over their Olympic romance.         ''He got so tired of answering how we met,'' she remembered long afterward. ''Finally he answered that we met in midair: he was going up and I was going down.''         Lord Landon remained active in the Olympic movement. She was an official of United States Olympians, held the starter's gun for women's swimming in the Olympic trials during the 1920's and 1930's, helped choose team uniforms and raised money for the United States squads.         She is survived by a daughter, Bunny McMunn, of Ormond Beach; two grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandchild. Her husband died in 1971.         Although she promoted the Olympic movement, Lord Landon spoke out on its blemishes. She felt that the Olympic ideal of placing participation above winning was violated when winners were honored but losers were forgotten.         ''The creed is fine,'' she said. ''It hasn't always been lived up to.''       
         Neuma Goncalves da Silva, a central figure in the slums that served as the testing ground for the composers, seamstresses and fiercely talented layabouts who catapulted samba into an art form, died on Monday in Rio de Janeiro. She was 78.         A poor woman all her life, Ms. Goncalves da Silva rose to national prominence because of her role in the samba school of Mangueira, a sprawling favela in Rio de Janeiro. Her home became a meeting place for the creators of samba, the frenetic, drum-heavy music that accompanies the hip-gyrating dance of the same name.         She founded the women's wing, or ''feminine department,'' of the Mangueira samba school and was its president for several terms. She often sought out the carpenters and sculptors who built the floats, and the seamstresses and designers who created the costumes for the annual Carnival celebration. The school's official colors, pink and green, often show up among the victors in samba competitions.         Ms. Goncalves da Silva was a behind-the-scenes force in electing the male-dominated leadership of the school. Candidacies like that of the acting Mangueira president, Elmo Jose dos Santos, were often said to have been hatched from her modest home on Visconde de Niteroi street.         Ms. Goncalves da Silva also entertained celebrities like the composer Heitor Villa-Lobos and the musician Noel Rosa, as well as many politicians.         One governor recognized Ms. Goncalves da Silva's social role by giving her a telephone, the first in the favela.         The eldest daughter in her poor family, Ms. Goncalves da Silva was born in 1922 in Madureira, another Rio neighborhood, and moved to Mangueira as a child. At the time, samba was emerging as a type of lingua franca among the variants of African-inspired music and dance practiced in Rio.         In 1928, her father, Saturnino Goncalves, was a founder of the Mangueira Samba School and Recreational Society, together with Jose Gomes da Costa, also known as Ze Espinguela, a master of organization who arranged the first competitions among Rio's samba schools. Other founders were the legendary composers Angenor da Silva, or Cartola, and Carlos Moreira de Castro, better known as Carlos Cachaca.         Immersed as she was in music as a child, Ms. Goncalves da Silva, not surprisingly, made samba central to her life, which was always one of economic hardship. To make ends meet, according to one account, she took to washing clothes by hand after being denied a factory job because she was black.         ''Samba never leaves us sad,'' Ms. Goncalves da Silva, affectionately known as Dona Neuma, told one interviewer. ''It never leaves us with that disease which is nostalgia.''         When Maria Tereza Goulart, the wife of Brazil's former president, Joao Goulart, visited Ms. Goncalves da Silva to see the Mangueira school for herself, she was reported to have danced until the wee hours. A headline in a local newspaper read, ''The first lady of the country is received by the first lady of samba.''         Ms. Goncalves da Silva is survived by four children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.         As samba evolved over the years into a commercialized, multimillion-dollar industry, Ms. Goncalves da Silva wondered whether the musical form could still capture with frivolity the ferocity of existence, as it did when the Mangueira samba school was starting out.         ''These days samba is manufactured instead of delivered from within us,'' she said. ''But I think samba is on a slow voyage to victory.''         After Ms. Goncalves da Silva's burial on Tuesday, her friends and family members gathered to dance until 3 in the morning to some of the legendary sambas with which she was associated.       
         Dr. Josephine D. Martin, a psychiatrist who helped rootless children, troubled adolescents and terrified civil rights activists in a lifelong crusade to weld the healing of personal and social wounds, died on July 6 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         Dr. Martin, who lived in Manhattan and East Hampton, had long battled an autoimmune disorder, her family said.         She became known as the unofficial doctor to the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, or more personally, ''the little lady doctor from up North.'' She had gone to Mississippi to work with children under a precursor of the Head Start program and diagnosed their bloated stomachs as resulting from acute malnutrition. She soon found herself holding the hands of civil rights workers as they experienced daily intimidation and humiliation.         ''She was just something we had never seen before,'' said Unita Blackwell, one of the leaders in the fight to register black voters in Mississippi in the 1960's, and now the mayor of Mayersville, Miss. ''She was a white woman who was caring and loving.''         As Molotov cocktails exploded on Ms. Blackwell's lawn in the Freedom Summer of 1964, Dr. Martin sent Ms. Blackwell's traumatized 7-year-old son to Vermont to attend summer camp. An abandoned New York City child she took under her wing when he was 4 is now a lawyer who will help direct a foundation to be set up in her honor.         Josephine Diaz was born in Tampa, Fla., on Dec. 31, 1915. Her father was born in Spain, became a cigar-maker, then immigrated to Tampa. When Josephine was very young, her family moved to New York City, where she attended elementary and high school.         She contracted tuberculosis as a teenager and spent two years in a sanitarium. At 19, she married a  fellow patient, a social worker named Earl Martin. They worked together organizing people who had had tuberculosis to fight for better treatment.         Meanwhile, she attended several colleges. At the State University of New York in Buffalo, she was offered a scholarship to medical school, but the couple moved because of Mr. Martin's job. She eventually graduated from Hunter College.         She then worked at jobs in medical research and marine biology. Eventually, in her 30's, she entered medical school at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, borrowing and working to pay tuition.         After divorcing Mr. Martin, she married Cedric H. Belfrage, one of the founders of the leftist National Guardian. He was forced to leave the United States because of his political views, said Dr. Martin's third and last husband, Robert J. Schwartz. (Mr. Belfrage is deceased, as is Mr. Martin.)         Dr. Martin went with Mr. Belfrage to London, where she qualified to work for the National Health System; while there, she treated W.E.B. Du Bois, the sociologist and black protest leader, for a heart ailment.         Increasingly, she felt she needed to know more about patients' personal histories and living conditions. Psychiatry seemed a way to bridge the gap.         Back in New York, she entered a psychiatric residency at Bellevue Hospital and stayed on as a full-time psychiatrist working with children and adolescents. She started a day program for mentally ill youths, and, because public schools often refused to accept them, she also set up an educational program for them at Bellevue.         In 1967, after her divorce from Mr. Belfrage, she married Mr. Schwartz, a banker who had helped her with financial matters. Mr. Schwartz was also an economist who organized members of his profession to push for arms reductions. He became a leading advocate of investing in socially responsible enterprises.         ''All my husbands were wonderful men, each appropriate for his time,'' Dr. Martin liked to say.         On July 4, 1963, she and Mr. Schwartz went to Baltimore to participate in a demonstration against an amusement park that refused to admit blacks. They spent the night in jail. On July 8, the Baltimore City Council passed an emergency resolution to set up a human rights commission to mediate the park's racial problems.         ''What better way to spend the Fourth of July than to go to jail in the war for independence for millions of Americans whose freedom from tyranny did not come with the Declaration of Independence of 1776?'' she wrote in the National Guardian at the time.         In 1964, Dr. Martin took an extended vacation from Bellevue to go south, where she worked in the Mississippi Child Development Center, the forerunner of Head Start. Her interest in the South dated to 1950, when she became friends with Claude Williams, a white preacher working to integrate his church in Fungo Hollow, Ala.         She quickly became involved in the civil rights movement as tensions were escalating. She contributed her medical knowledge in teaching sessions and her psychiatric skills in individual sessions with frayed and frightened campaigners.         ''Some, more disturbed, under constant stress, decompensated or engaged in provocative behavior, putting themselves and others at risk,'' Dr. Martin wrote in an autobiographical essay. ''On occasion, hospitalization became necessary.''         She sent the troubled civil rights workers to Manhattan, to Gracie Square Hospital, where she had contacts, for fear of what might happen to them in Southern hospitals.         In his 1972 book, ''The Making of a Black Revolutionary,'' James Forman wrote a personal inscription in the copy he gave Dr. Martin. It said that she ''helped me to unravel many of the conflicting tendencies caused by a very active life, enabling me to bring focus and greater clarity to this head.''         Mr. Schwartz said that several times Mr. Forman, a leader in the Southern struggle, would arrive at their Manhattan apartment saying it was impossible to return to Mississippi. He would consult with Dr. Martin, and ''10 days later he was back again,'' Mr. Schwartz said.         Likening the situation to a M.A.S.H. unit, Ms. Blackwell said, ''She was the doctor who was on the battleground.''         Dr. Martin soon found other battlegrounds back home. Working for St. Luke's-Roosevelt, she set up an innovative home care psychiatric program for residents of welfare hotels. At the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, she worked with troubled adolescents, homeless families and others who needed help.         At the same time, she socialized in Mr. Schwartz's world of Wall Street financiers. During a pause in the conversation, she would say, ''How about giving some clothing to the poor kids at Bellevue?''         Boxes would soon arrive at the hospital's door.         Dr. Martin said her life added up to simply doing the next right thing. ''I had never had the notion that my role was to 'do good' or 'empower' anybody,'' she said, ''but to be able to offer my skills as needed, to live my life as seemed right to me.''       
         Ruth Werner, a colorful and successful Soviet spy whose exploits included radioing invaluable atomic bomb data to Moscow in the middle of World War II, died on July 7 in Berlin. She was 93.         In her 20 years as an intelligence operative in China, Poland, Switzerland and England, she had a number of close calls. But she always managed to extricate herself from the predicament -- unlike Klaus Fuchs, the agent who fed her the British atomic bomb secrets, who was imprisoned in Britain for nine and a half years, or Richard Sorge, the master spy who recruited her, who was executed in Japan in 1941.         Her espionage work was entwined with her romantic life, which included an affair with one of her spy chiefs; later she married a British Communist to become a British citizen and only later came to love him. She told some but not all of her story in a 1974 autobiography, still observing the iron rules of conspiracy by never mentioning Mr. Fuchs, who was still alive.         Ms. Werner was known by the code name Sonja, which was given to her by Mr. Sorge in 1933. Ruth Werner was her pen name. All of her identities had their roots in a prosperous Jewish household in Berlin, where she was born Ursula Ruth Kuczynski, one of six children of Robert Rene and Berta Kuczynski. Her father was a distinguished economist.         Ms. Werner was drawn early to the Communist movement and became a member of the German Communist Party at 19. She was immediately fired by the publishing house where she worked. Soon afterward she met and married Rolf Hamburger, an architect.         She started writing for the party newspaper, Rote Fahne. In 1930, having been told by the party that she would be contacted in Shanghai, she moved with her husband to China.         They began a pleasant bourgeois life, but she was waiting impatiently for the promised contact. It took four months and friendship with Agnes Smedley, an American leftist journalist, who introduced her to Mr. Sorge. Mr. Sorge, then 35, had been the Shanghai agent of the Soviet Army's intelligence service for a year. The service was known by its Russian initials, G.R.U.         Mr. Sorge asked whether she was ready to face danger. She nodded and agreed to make room available for his clandestine meetings with Chinese Communists, the chief interest of Moscow.         Ms. Werner joined the ring without her husband's knowledge, stored weapons and hid a Chinese comrade who was on the run. Two years later, when Mr. Sorge left Shanghai for Moscow, he recommended her to the G.R.U.         Though her marriage was deteriorating, she and her husband had had a son, Michael, while in Shanghai. When the G.R.U. asked her to go to Moscow for training, she left the boy with in-laws in Czechoslovakia.         In the G.R.U. school she learned Morse code, Russian and how to build radio transmitters and receivers. In February 1934 she was sent to turbulent Manchuria, which had been seized from China by the Japanese. Her boss was Ernst, a former sailor, with whom she became romantically involved.         ''Our transmitter was the link between the partisans and the Soviet Union,'' she wrote. She sent coded messages twice a week, and bought and transported chemicals for explosives for the Chinese Communist partisans.         In 1935, Moscow, fearing the two spies were about to be exposed, ordered Ms. Werner and Ernst to flee China. She accepted an assignment in Poland, this time with her husband, although she was pregnant with Ernst's child. Her daughter, Janina, was born in April 1936.         In late 1938 she was sent to Switzerland to set up a new spy ring, again with her husband, but he soon left her and went to the Far East. In February 1939 she met Len Beurton, an English Communist who had fought in Spain with the international brigades. For him, he once wrote, it was ''love at first sight; she had a very good figure.''         In 1940, the G.R.U. authorized a marriage of convenience by which Ms. Werner became British, but the love came to be mutual -- the marriage lasted until his death three years ago.         Ms. Werner had already begun clandestine transmissions from a radio set she had built in her rented house near Oxford when, in 1941, she met Mr. Fuchs, who was working at the British atomic research facility nearby.         The two spies would bicycle into the countryside for their meetings, and Mr. Fuchs would hand over written materials that, Ms. Werner once told an interviewer, were ''like hieroglyphics.''         Norman Moss, author of ''Klaus Fuchs: The Man Who Stole the Atomic Bomb'' (1987), said that Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin's chief aide, set up the Soviet atomic bomb project in 1942 as a result of the information transmitted by Mr. Fuchs and Ms. Werner, and that the information saved the Soviet researchers a great deal of time. The Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb in 1949.         Ms. Werner was also running other agents, including a Royal Air Force officer, a specialist in submarine radar and even her brother and father. She was once told that the chief of G.R.U. had said, ''If we had five Sonjas in England, the war would end sooner.''         In the early 1950's she and her family -- another son, Peter, had been born in 1943 -- left England for East Berlin. Her only connection with the G.R.U. after that was in 1969, when she was invited to a ceremony to receive her second Red Banner, the highest Soviet military decoration.         She turned to writing, producing some short stories; a biography of Olga Benario, a German Communist who was gassed by the Nazis in 1942; and her autobiography.         She is survived by her three children, five grandchildren and three sisters.       
         Nija Battle, who brought a swaggering sense of sophistication to the furs she designed for the music world's most tireless clotheshorses, died last Thursday while on a business trip in Montreal. She was 37.         The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her sister, Saddiya Battle.         For a designer who did not have a store, who often met her future clients at clubs or outside restaurants, and who, until the editor Andre Leon Talley wrote about her in Vogue last year, was almost unknown in the fashion world, Ms. Battle had a large following. Her custom-made furs were worn by entertainers like Whitney Houston, Lil' Kim, Kid Rock and Puff Daddy, who had her make trousers for him in black sheared mink.         And although much of the attention at the Costume Institute's ''Rock Style'' gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last December was focused on fashion nabobs like Tom Ford of Gucci and Donatella Versace, it was Ms. Battle of Brooklyn who designed the wraps worn by Naomi Campbell, Iman, Lynn Whitfield and Mary J. Blige, who had on a turquoise fur chubby.         Ms. Battle began making furs about 10 years ago, though in a sense, she started as a child when she and her sister would take skins given to them by their father, an avid hunter, and turn them into blankets and doll clothes. The family lived in Brooklyn but had relatives in North Carolina, and Ms. Battle, who was part Tuscarora Indian, often visited a grandmother there who raised minks.         After getting experience with Orchard Street furriers, Ms. Battle started her own business and gradually gained a following among rap and hip-hop stars who saw her out wearing her own designs.         ''When people like Puff Daddy were photographed for magazines, they'd say to the stylists, 'I'm wearing my own coat,' '' recalled her sister. They meant, of course, Ms. Battle's furs. She also created coats for a number of sports stars, and, on occasion, made identical styles for their wives and children.         Her custom-made designs, often dyed in colors like champagne, burgundy and green, projected a high urban style -- what Mr. Talley called ''a ghetto fabulousness'' -- that not only appealed to Ms. Battle's celebrated clientele but also evoked the 1970's in fashion. She was certainly among the first designers to recognize the appeal of reviving that era.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by her mother, Gladys, and her brother, Saleem Muhammad, both of Brooklyn.       
         Thea Dispeker, a molder of operatic talent from Lauritz Melchior to Richard Leech and boss of her own classical music artists agency for more than 50 years, died Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 97.         Laurence Wasserman, her successor at the New York-based management agency that still bears her name, said that she had relinquished control (she called retirement a dirty word) only reluctantly in late 1998, shortly after her 96th birthday. Until then, Ms. Dispeker, erudite, opinionated, acerbic, often presided at auditions in her penthouse apartment on East 79th Street after full days at the offices of Thea Dispeker Inc., (pronounced TAY-uh DIS-peck-uh) at 59 East 54th Street.         ''She was much more interested in developing talent than taking over the great names,'' said Mr. Wasserman, who had contracted with Ms. Dispeker in 1977, when she was almost 75, to succeed her as the company's president.         Yet her career was bound up with some of the 20th century's greatest musical names: Richard Tucker, Martina Arroyo, Judith Blegen, Roberta Peters, Jan Peerce, Hermann Prey, Pablo Casals and Wieland Wagner among many others. Indeed, as some associates saw it, Ms. Dispeker was the century.         Born Dorothea Schlesinger in Munich in 1902, she studied piano and was tutored by her father, a lawyer, author and violinist who had married the daughter of a wealthy banker. At 12, she briefly ran off with a passing circus before going on to study musicology at the University of Munich. After a visit to Tutankhamen's tomb in Egypt in 1924 she contracted polio. But she recovered and worked in Munich with the renowned musicologist Alfred Einstein, marrying and soon divorcing a man named Dispeker and finally fleeing Nazi Germany for the United States in 1938. Still she remained an ardent Germanophile all her life.         In New York, she gave piano lessons. She started a classical music section of the W. Colston Leigh speakers bureau, where she represented Melchior and other opera stars. When she went into business for herself in 1947, she won Tucker as a client, and later James King, Arlene Saunders, Maria Stader, Benita Valente, and other singers and instrumentalists.         In 1947 she helped found the Little Orchestra Society for children's concerts. In 1950, she organized the first Pablo Casals festival in the tiny village of Prades, France, where Casals was living in exile from Spain.         In 1950, she married a fellow refugee from Germany, Lawrence Grieg, known as Lolo. He died in 1986. They had no children.         Oblivious to advancing age, Ms. Dispeker sought out young singers and musicians to promote; she emerged with a portfolio of rising stars, including Mr. Leech, the tenor, and the Swedish baritone, Hakan Hagegard. ''She had a nose for talent,'' said Mr. Wasserman.         ''Thea has always been open to hearing anybody who calls the office for an audition,'' said Mr. Leech, who signed with the agency during his first season with the New York City Opera in 1984. ''She's been a beacon for opportunity for young singers.''         In 1997 the International Society for the Performing Arts Foundation gave her an award of merit timed to the 50th anniversary of her agency.         But she was almost as famous for her prickly interpersonal relations with staff and other associates, and her sparring with Mr. Wasserman was an open secret in the music management business. Although she continued until several years ago to drive, employees came to dread her friendly invitations for a lift home, finding the rides often terrifying.         ''I was always a very secure person,'' Ms. Dispeker told an interviewer three years ago, when she was 94. ''I always instinctively knew what was right and wrong and what was good and what was bad. That's mainly what people miss today.''       
         Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in the 1950's led to a movement that found American homes for thousands of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell, Ore., after a stroke on July 24. She was 96.         Mrs. Holt first attracted national attention when she and her husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were American soldiers.         In 1954, Mrs. Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore., to watch a film about Amerasian children in South Korean orphanages.         ''We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Mrs. Holt later wrote in ''The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on adoption. ''We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching for someone to care.''         At first, the Holts sent money to South Korean orphanages but soon decided that the children needed families. They were both about 50 years old, and had already reared six biological children. Each wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Mrs. Holt later recalled, but each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take so many.         At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more than two foreign-born children. But in 1955, Congress passed the Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from infancy to 3 1/2. Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the process easier.         At the Holt house, soon there were children lined up to get a daily dose of vitamins, and the washing machine ran day and night.         Mr. Holt returned to South Korea for more children, while Mrs. Holt found families in the United States willing to take them.         In 1956, they founded the agency that would become Holt International Children's Services. At the time, there was no system in place for international adoptions. The Korean-American children were the first such large group to be adopted.         The Holts, who were Baptist, believed with missionary fervor that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American families. Holt International now handles about 1,000 international adoptions each year from 12 countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year.         Until days before her death, Grandma Holt, as she came to be known, was active in the agency. One of her daughters, Molly Holt, works for the Holt agency in South Korea.         She is also survived by nine other children, Barbara Chambers, Suzanne Peterson, Linda Pack, Robert Holt, Mary Last, Christine Russell, Helen Stampe, Paul Holt and Betty Blankenship; three sisters, Beulah Stronczek, Katherine Stanger and Grace Fisher; a brother, William L. Holt; 19 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.         Though the poverty they had seen in the Korean film footage shocked them, the Holts had seen hard times themselves. Bertha Marian Holt was born on Feb. 5, 1904, in Des Moines. Her father was a schoolteacher and a mail carrier. She received a degree in nursing in 1926, and the next year married a cousin, Harry Holt. The couple moved to South Dakota, where they became ''custom farmers,'' working land owned by others until they had saved enough to buy their own.         In the face of drought and poor farming conditions, Mr. Holt also milled flour and mined lignite coal. But during the Depression, the Holts left their farm for taxes owed and moved to the Willamette Valley in Oregon.         There the Holts prospered, eventually owning a lumber mill, but in 1950 Mr. Holt suffered a heart attack. The Holts turned to prayer, asking God to give them a mission and allow Mr. Holt more time to live. The orphans, they believed, were that mission.         While in South Korea in 1964, Harry Holt suffered another heart attack and died. Many thought the agency would close, but Mrs. Holt took over, traveling endlessly. She also worked to improve conditions at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other countries to set up adoption programs.         ''She would say, 'You know, I'm just a grandma, but here's what I think,' '' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, who was adopted through the Holt agency and now works there as a vice president.         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson named Mrs. Holt the National Mother of the Year, and in 1995 she became the only non-Korean to receive the Korea National Merit Award. But, Ms. Cox said, Mrs. Holt liked to say that she preferred the  photographs that children sent from all over the world.         ''She championed the idea that love and a safe, permanent home could transcend differences of nationality, race and ethnic background,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after Mrs. Holt's death.         In letters to agency employees, adopted children and adoptive families, Mrs. Holt spoke frequently of the Lord and quoted the Bible, which she said she had read 40 times.         Those who knew her said she seemed to have enormous energy. In 1996, she set the world record for the 400 meter race in the over-90 age group at the Hayward Classic in Eugene.       
         Frieda Mae Hardin, who joined the Navy during World War I, when women were still denied the right to vote, and at a widely noted ceremony  79 years later symbolized the achievements of all the women in the armed forces, died last Wednesday in Livermore, Calif. She was 103.         Wearing a World War I ''yeomanette'' uniform and a wide-brimmed hat inscribed with ''U.S. Naval Reserve,'' Mrs. Hardin provided the emotional high point at the ceremony, held in October 1997 at Arlington National Cemetery to dedicate the Women in Military Service for America Memorial, honoring almost  two million women who had served.         Making her way to the speaker's stand before an audience estimated at 30,000, Mrs. Hardin was accompanied by her son Jerald Kirsten, a retired Navy captain.         ''Loud voice, mother,'' he said.         Mrs. Hardin's audience heard her loud and clear. ''In my 101 years of living, I have observed many wonderful achievements, but none as important or as meaningful as the progress of women taking their  rightful place in society,'' she said.         ''To those women now in military service, I say, 'Carry on.' To those  young women who may be thinking about a career in the military service, I say, 'Go for it.' ''         The 10-minute talk brought three standing ovations and left many in the crowd in tears.         When Frieda Mae Green was born on Sept. 22, 1896, in Eden Valley,  Minn., a formal role for women in the armed forces could hardly have been foreseen. Women had served in a quasi-military capacity, as nurses, but there were no women in the regular Navy or Army.         In March 1917, however, with America's entry into World War I imminent, Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels called on women to enlist in the Naval Reserve to free sailors for combat duty.         Frieda's father, a railroad worker, had moved the family to Kentucky and then Ohio, and she had taken a job at a department store in the town of Portsmouth. One day in 1918, she saw a notice that a Navy recruiter was arriving. ''I heard about the Navy taking women on a Saturday night, and I signed up first thing Monday morning,'' she would recall.         According to her son Jerald, when she phoned her mother to tell her what she had done, ''Her mother said, 'Frieda, you get home this instant!' '' Frieda's mother took her back to the recruiting station and told the Navy man that she could not sign up without her father's permission. But the next day, her father said, ''Let her go,'' and off she went.         She was among almost 12,000 women who served in the Navy during World War I as clerks, draftsmen, translators, camouflage designers and recruiters. They were  formally designated yeomen (f), for female, but were known as yeomanettes. She was on active duty from September 1918 to March 1919 at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Virginia, performing clerical duties and receiving an outstanding grade in reading proficiency and perfect marks in obedience and sobriety, the three areas in which the Navy graded women. (She would remain a teetotaler, even refusing a glass of celebratory champagne while flying to the 1997 memorial ceremony.)         By 1920, all the yeomanettes were released from duty, and women would not be permitted to serve in the Navy again until the Waves were established in World War II.         After leaving the Navy, Frieda Green married William Kirsten, a chef, and they settled in the Lodi-Stockton area of California. She remained in Northern California the rest of her life, and had been a resident of a Livermore nursing home for several years when she died there last week.         She is survived by four children from her marriage to Mr. Kirsten: Captain Kirsten, of Lodi, Roy Kirsten of Stockton and Warren Kirsten of Sacramento, all military veterans, and Mary Botto of Stockton; 12 grandchildren; 25 great-grandchildren; and 29 great-great-grandchildren. William Kirsten and three other husbands died before her, the last of them Robert Hardin.         In speaking at the memorial dedication, Mrs. Hardin said that ''a world of opportunity'' awaited women in the military.         ''For my part, I have always been very proud of my Navy service,'' she  told the audience. ''It is not likely that I will be meeting with you again,  so I bid each of you a fond farewell.''         Among those in the crowd was a woman named Ann Darr, who had served during World War II in the Women's Air Force Service Pilots, or Wasps. Reflecting on that moment at the memorial, she would write, ''When Frieda Mae Hardin spoke, reminding us she couldn't vote when she signed up, saying to the young people, 'Go for it!' we were almost ready to serve again.''       
         Joan Marsh, who made her film debut when she was 9 months old, played children's roles in silent films opposite Mary Pickford and returned to the screen in the 1930's and 40's as a glamorous blonde, died on Aug. 10 in Ojai, Calif. She was 85.         She was born Dorothy Rosher in Porterville, Calif., and grew up in Hollywood.         Her father was the cinematographer Charles Rosher Sr. She appeared in the Pickford films ''Daddy Long Legs'' (1919) and ''Pollyanna'' (1920). Her early films also included ''The King of Jazz'' and ''All Quiet on the Western Front.''         After signing a long-term contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, she appeared in films like ''Inspiration,'' ''Dance, Fools, Dance'' and ''A Tailor Made Man.''         Her credits also included ''You're Telling Me!'' with W. C. Fields (1934), ''Charlie Chan on Broadway'' (1937), ''Road to Zanzibar'' with Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour (1941) and ''Follow the Leader'' (1944), her last film.       
         Miki Denhof, one of the first women to be the art director of a magazine, and a noted mentor of fashion photographers, died on Wednesday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 88.         In 1945, when Ms. Denhof joined Conde Nast, its fashion and lifestyle magazines were widely influential for their use of elegant typography and conceptual photography, approaches in which she, too, excelled. The executive art director, Alexander Liberman, installed Ms. Denhof as promotion art director of Vogue. There, ''she was a creative force and arbiter of quality,'' said a friend and colleague, Estelle Ellis.         ''She also developed a keen ability to edit pictures into narrative sequences and was deft with type,'' Ms. Ellis continued. ''She transcended the conventions of advertising design at that time.''         Later named the editorial art director for House and Garden and Glamour magazines, Ms. Denhof collaborated with Mr. Liberman, refining the typographic and photographic styles that characterized those publications.         But she was not simply a stylist. ''Miki always had a sense of the big picture,'' said Don Wise, who was art director of the Glamour promotion art department in the 1950's. ''She designed in an intellectual way, using words as integral parts of her pictures. Now designers routinely integrate type and image, but she did it before most others.''         In the 60's, at Glamour, she nurtured and mentored many American and European-emigre photographers, including David Bailey, Frank Horvat, Jeanloup Sieff, Louis Faurer and Saul Leiter.         ''She was the only art director I wouldn't question,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''She could put 22 pictures on a spread and I wouldn't worry. She'd always do it right.''         Ms. Denhof was born in 1912 in Trieste, Italy, raised in Austria and educated in Vienna and Berlin. She left Germany for New York with her family in 1938.         One of her earliest design jobs was as an assistant to the Modernist designer Paul Rand at Esquire and Apparel Arts magazines. She was also art director of Conde Nast Books, responsible for such titles as ''Vanity Fair: Photographs of an Age 1914-1936'' with Diane Edkins, and ''The Successful Face'' with Amy Green.         After leaving Conde Nast in 1977 she designed exhibitions, catalogs and a documentary book for the Guild Hall in East Hampton, which also mounted an exhibition of her editorial layouts.         She spent the last few years archiving the photo albums and diaries of her father, Bernhard Bardach, a doctor in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. Recently she donated 900 of the photographs to the Leo Baeck Institute in New York. Some were used in the 1999 exhibition ''Fighting for the Fatherland: The Patriotism of Jews in World War I.''         Ms. Denhof was divorced from Hans Denhof, who is deceased. She has no immediate survivors.       
         Mary MacLeod Trump, a philanthropist who supported charities near her home in Jamaica, Queens, and elsewhere, died on Monday at 88 at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, her family said.         Mrs. Trump was born Mary MacLeod on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland on May 10, 1912. On a visit to New York City in the 1930's, she met Fred C. Trump. They married in 1936 and settled in Jamaica Estates, and Mr. Trump went on to become one of the city's biggest developers.         Mrs. Trump was the mainstay of the Women's Auxiliary of Jamaica Hospital and of the Jamaica Day Nursery. The Trumps were also active in the Salvation Army, the Boy Scouts of America and the Lighthouse for the Blind, among others. A pavilion at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center bears their name. They also gave buildings to the National Kidney Foundation of New York/ New Jersey and to Community Mainstreaming Associates of Great Neck, N.Y., which provides homes for the disabled.         Mr. Trump died last year. Mrs. Trump is survived by four children: Donald, the developer and casino operator; Robert, the president of his father's property management company; Maryanne, a federal judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; Elizabeth, an executive with Chase Manhattan Bank; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         Grace Halsell, a journalist whose curiosity about ''a wider world'' led her to experience life on society's fringes by disguising herself as women of different races, died on Aug. 16  in Washington, where she lived. She was 77.         Inspired by John Howard Griffin's 1961 book ''Black Like Me,'' in which the author darkened his skin to pass as black, Ms. Halsell took pills that were used to alleviate pigmentation problems, supplemented by extensive tanning sessions, to cross the color barrier. Further transformed by a wig and dark contact lenses, she moved in 1968 first to Harlem and then to the Deep South, where at the height of the civil rights movement she took a job as a cleaning woman.         She wrote about this in her 1969 book, ''Soul Sister,'' in which she described the anonymity and degradation of being a black domestic in a world of white employers, one of whom tried to rape her. The book sold more than one million paperback copies and was translated into six languages.         ''Soul Sister'' was followed in 1973 by ''Bessie Yellowhair,'' based on her life on a Navajo reservation and as a American Indian nanny for a Los Angeles family, and in 1978 by ''The Illegals,'' in which she wrote of crossing the border with a group of Mexican immigrants. In the 1980's she lived undercover with a group of Christian fundamentalists.         The daughter of a West Texas cattleman, she was reared on her father's tales of frontier life on the Great Plains. ''I never felt anything I did was anything at all compared to his stories,'' she wrote in her 1996 autobiography, ''In Their Shoes.''         After high school she accepted a job at The Avalanche-Journal, the only newspaper in Lubbock, Tex., where she attended a local college while working full time. She eventually studied anthropology at Columbia University and in 1945 became the first woman to cover the police beat at The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. While working as a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Houston Post in the mid-1960's she was recruited by President Lyndon B. Johnson for a secretarial position on his White House staff. When she told him she did not take dictation, she was assigned to write official statements and became the highest ranking woman on his staff during her three-year tenure.         She is survived by a brother and a sister, both of Texas.         Shortly after the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Ms. Halsell left the White House for the journey she described as ''embracing the Other.''         ''I wanted to strip myself to see who I was, to see if there was anything there,'' she said.       
         Sophie Davis, a successful businesswoman whose backing helped create the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education at the City College of New York, died on Saturday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 74.         The cause was breast cancer, her son Alan said.         Mrs. Davis helped her husband. Leonard, found the Colonial Penn Group of insurance companies, and they gave millions of dollars to art, dance, music and Jewish philanthropic causes, including the Holocaust Museum in Washington.         But one project in which she took the most pride was the medical program at City College, which helps place economically disadvantaged students into medicine with the understanding that they will practice for at least two years in low-income communities.         Students in the seven-year accelerated medical degree program take three years of undergraduate work at City College, two years of medical training at Sophie Davis and their final two years at one of six cooperating medical schools, including New York University and SUNY/Downstate. The graduates are known as ''Sophies.''         The Davises' first gift, $1.2 million, to the school, which began as an experimental program, was given anonymously in 1972. Five years later, Mrs. Davis agreed to have her name attached to the school.         When the school gave her an honorary degree at that time, she brought a phalanx of friends and relatives to the ceremony to see her in her academic cap and gown; she had dropped out of City College to get married.         Mrs. Davis was born in 1926 in the Bronx to Isadore and Esther Kesten, immigrants from Minsk, Russia. After skipping a grade in high school, she attended City College at night; there she studied accounting and met Leonard Davis, whom she married in 1945. He survives her.         In addition to her husband and her son Alan, of San Francisco, Mrs. Davis is survived by another son, Michael, of Belvedere, Calif., and four grandchildren.         While Mr. Davis worked as an accountant and later in the insurance business, Mrs. Davis worked at his side, organizing the office, handling the bookkeeping and serving as his sounding board. She was also a director of the Colonial Penn Group, which they founded in 1963, until they sold it in 1984.         ''I always discussed everything with her,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We made the decisions jointly, based on which one of us felt the strongest. Sometimes we had to figure out which of us that was.''         He said that the company avoided borrowing money, for example, because Mrs. Davis violently opposed it.         But he prevailed on the issue of buying a magazine that later merged with Modern Maturity, the magazine of the AARP, which he helped found. ''She was opposed, and she got the other senior members of my staff to oppose it, too,'' Mr. Davis recalled. ''But I felt very strongly about it, so we bought it.''         The Sophie Davis medical school was one of many projects the couple supported at City College. They also provided funds for a performing arts center, Aaron Davis Hall, named after Mr. Davis's father. Mrs. Davis helped choose some of the resident performers, and she and her husband often entertained them after performances.         As the Davises began to spend more and more time in Palm Beach (although they kept their Fifth Avenue apartment), they played a similar role as impresarios, establishing the Regional Arts Foundation, with Mrs. Davis as president, in the early 1970's. The foundation brought performers like Isaac Stern, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the New York City Ballet to southern Florida, then considered by some a cultural wasteland.         ''She felt a responsibility to bring music and dance to this area,'' said Judith Mitchell, chief executive of the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts in West Palm Beach, which took over the performance series in 1994.         The Davises also became involved with the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach. Mrs. Davis served as a trustee and spearheaded the drive to build a new wing.         But even from Florida, she kept in touch with the medical school named after her. She and her husband gave the school another $2 million for an endowed scholarship fund in their names. And last year, when she attended the graduation ceremony, the students stood up and started chanting her name: ''Sophie! Sophie! Sophie!''       
         Tatiana Riabouchinska, an international ballet star who was the model for the dancing hippopotamus in the 1940 film ''Fantasia'' and the oldest of the three ''baby ballerinas'' who brought fame to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the 1930's, died on Aug. 24 in Los Angeles. She was 83 and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Riabouchinska began her ballet career at 14 and continued performing into the early 1950's, dancing most notably with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1932 to 1942 in works by George Balanchine, Leonide Massine and David Lichine, whom she married in 1943. She was celebrated for the joyousness and warmth of her dancing and for her musicality and lightness. Her jumps were high and soft, her footwork quick and her arms exceptionally beautiful.         ''Because the impetus is exactly right, she strikes you as dancing her whole number on an impulse, spontaneously for the joy of it,'' the critic Edwin Denby wrote of her.         Born in Moscow, Ms. Riabouchinska was put under house arrest early in the Russian Revolution along with her father, who was a banker for the czar, and her mother and three siblings. But their servants helped the mother and four children escape and they fled to France, eventually settling in Paris. There Ms. Riabouchinska studied with Russian teachers, including Mathilde Kschessinska, who had been a prima ballerina at the Mariinsky Ballet and the mistress of the czar.         Ms. Riabouchinska was spotted by Balanchine while dancing in a Schiaparelli costume in the Chauve Souris, a fashionable Paris revue. He signed her to the Ballet Russe, which she joined at 15, becoming the oldest of the three dancers who were known as the baby ballerinas. The others, Tamara Toumanova and Irina Baronova, were 13.         At the Ballet Russe, Ms. Riabouchinska created roles in dances including ''Jeux d'Enfants'' and ''Les Presages,'' both by Massine; in ''La Concurrence'' and ''Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,'' by Balanchine; and in Lichine's charming ''Graduation Ball,'' in which she played a student identified as the Romantic Girl. Coached by the choreographer Michel Fokine, Ms. Riabouchinska was also known for her performances in two Fokine classics, ''Le Spectre de la Rose'' and ''Les Sylphides.''         Ms. Riabouchinska went on to dance with companies including Ballet Theater, Les Ballets des Champs-Elysees and the London Festival Ballet. Disney animators sketching rehearsals used her for the hippopotamus ballerina in Disney's 1940 movie ''Fantasia,'' with her husband the model for the alligator. The two were also seen dancing in silhouette in the 1946 cartoon ''Make Mine Music.''         The Lichines retired in Los Angeles in 1950, opening a school in Beverly Hills and forming the Ballet de la Ville des Anges and several other companies that failed to receive enough financial support to last long. After Lichine's death in 1972, Ms. Riabouchinska ran the school until 1998. She continued to teach ballet at another school up to her death.         She is survived by a daughter, Tania Lichine Crawford of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.         Ms. Riabouchinska, a trouper from an early age, was known for her equanimity. In comparing dancers of her day with those of today, she said,  ''We had fun, but they just have hard work.''       
         Lucy A. Wicks, a psychologist who worked with people infected with H.I.V. and the founder of the Manhattan School for Children, one of the most innovative and sought-after alternative public schools in Manhattan, died Saturday at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center. She was 49.         The cause of death was breast cancer, said her husband, Daniel N. Arshack.         Dr. Wicks was the organizer and chief proponent of the school, which grew out of playground chatter with other neighborhood mothers and now enrolls about 500 children in kindergarten through eighth grade on West 93rd Street.         While there has been a long history of alternative public schools in Manhattan, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the city, most were founded by groups of teachers, administrators or civic groups. The Manhattan School is one of a tiny group of schools founded by parents, and Dr.  Wicks was widely recognized as zealous, canny and willing to pull strings to make the school possible.         The school, founded in 1992, was born in part out of frustration. As Dr.  Wicks's children approached school age, she visited her neighborhood school, at the time suffering from low test scores, demoralized teachers and leaky walls. The principal told her that as a parent, she should not expect to play a role in improving the school, her husband recalled. ''To Lucy, that simply wasn't acceptable,'' Mr. Arshack said.         The school Dr. Wicks conceived was small and intimate, with only two classes per grade. It now attracts dozens of applicants for each vacancy. Unlike many other public and private schools, it invites parents to share in every aspect of the school day, from leading reading groups to cleaning up after lunch to  simply sitting and watching.         In 1996, Dr. Wicks won a seat on the local school board. She was director of the H.I.V. Mental Health Clinic of Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital.         Ms. Wicks was born in Manhattan and grew up in Franklin Lakes, N.J. She graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio. She worked as an artist, making tapestries, quilts and oil paintings, before earning her doctorate in clinical psychology at the New School in Manhattan. She was a student of the Sufi branch of Islam.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her children, Adam, 12, and Eliza, 10; her father, Zeno W. Wicks of Louisville, Ky.; three brothers, Zeno Wicks of Brookings, S.D., David Wicks of Louisville and Douglas Wicks of Pittsburgh; and two sisters, Kayo Wicks of Louisville and Robin Wicks of Mogadore, Ohio.       
         Mary Shepard, the modest illustrator whose line drawings of Mary Poppins brought to life the ultimate British nanny in a series of seven books by P. L. Travers published from 1933 to 1988, died in London on Sept. 4. She was 90.         Her father was E. H. Shepard, the illustrator of ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' and ''The Wind in the Willows.'' When ''Mary Poppins'' was being readied for publication, Pamela Travers wanted him to do the pictures.         He was too busy, but, as Miss Travers wrote almost a half-century later, on a friend's mantle she saw a Christmas card that had ''a happy imperfection, a sense of wonder.'' It was done by Mary Shepard, then 23 and just out of the Slade School of Art.         Travers's editor, Peter Llewelyn Davis (in the tight British literary world he was one of the Lost Boys befriended by J. M. Barrie, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks, the parents in ''Mary Poppins,'' bore more than a passing resemblance to the Darlings of ''Peter Pan''), worried about Miss Shepard's inexperience, but their collaboration had begun.         And it was a collaboration. In an attic, Travers said, she found a wooden peg Dutch doll with painted coal-black hair, a turned-up nose and small, bright blue eyes that became the model.         That doll was later sent to the Donnell Library in Manhattan. But Miss Shepard bought a similar one to use as she drew. She wanted the nanny to stand in the fifth ballet position, with feet turned out and nearly parallel, but Travers insisted on the more comfortable fourth position, with the feet at right angles. Travers died in 1996 at the age of 96.         In the 1964 Walt Disney movie starring Julie Andrews, the time period and decor were pushed back from the 1930's of the book illustrations to a plush Edwardian era, but Ms. Andrews's costume and bearing stayed true to Miss Shepard's drawings (with her feet back to the fifth position), and Miss Shepard received a payment from the filmmakers.         Mary Eleanor Jessie Shepard was born on Christmas Day 1909. She had an idyllic Edwardian childhood and an artistic education.         In 1937 she married E. V. Knox, a friend and colleague of her father's, and outside publishing was known as Mary Knox. Her husband, who had been a widower, was the editor of Punch, the humor magazine. She was only seven years older than Knox's daughter, Penelope, who as Penelope Fitzgerald began publishing novels in her late 50's and died last spring at the age of 83. Knox died in 1971.         As they grew older, the two women became more like sisters. They lived near each other, talked every day and took care of each other, especially after Knox's death.         Miss Shepard was Auntie Mary to Fitzgerald's three children and had only one other relative, Minette Hunt, the daughter of her brother, who was killed in World War II. Her last drawings were made for a Fitzgerald grandchild, shortly after she entered the nursing home where she spent her last years. She did not know that Penelope had died.         A family memorial service was held at the Hampstead Parish Church on Sept. 14, where Miss Shepard worshiped daily as long as she was able. She was so modest that she said she did not wish to be buried with her husband in the pretty Hampstead cemetery because her name would add clutter to his stone.         Instead, the Fitzgerald children, Maria Fitzgerald, Tina Dooley and Balphy Fitzgerald, have arranged that twin stones be placed next to Knox's. They will be side by side above the cremated remains of Penelope and Mary, one showing a hand with a pen, the other, a hand with a paintbrush.       
         Lady Sarah Consuelo Spencer-Churchill, a volunteer worker who was a cousin of Winston Churchill, died on Friday in Middletown, Conn. She was 78 and lived in Old Lyme, Conn. Her family said she died during surgery.         Lady Sarah was a sister of John George Vanderbilt Henry Spencer-Churchill, the 11th Duke of Marlborough. She was a granddaughter of the American heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt, whose marriage to the ninth Duke of Marlborough ended in divorce.         Lady Sarah raised funds for battered women and other charitable causes in Connecticut. She paid for a church and did volunteer hospital work in Jamaica. There, gunmen attacked and robbed her in 1977 in her home near Montego Bay.         During World War II, she did war work as a mechanic in a London factory. She came to the United States in 1945.         She was a volunteer for the Heart Fund, the Kidney Foundation, the Parkinson's Disease Foundation, Southampton Hospital on Long Island, and Just One Break, a nonprofit placement agency for the disabled.         Lady Sarah was born in Northamptonshire, England, and grew up partly in Blenheim Palace. Her father was the 10th Duke of Marlborough. Her mother was born Alexandra Mary Cadogan, a granddaughter of the fifth Earl Cadogan.         Her marriages to Edwin F. Russell in 1943, Guy Burgos in 1966 and Theodorous Roubanis in 1967 all ended in divorce.         Besides her brother the duke, she is survived by four daughters, Serena Balfour of London, Consuelo Russell and Jacqueline Williams, both of Manhattan, and Alexandra Birch of Pennsylvania; a sister, Lady Rosemary Muir of Berkshire, England; a brother, Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill of London; and 10 grandchildren.       
         Sophie Koulomzin, a leading Orthodox Christian educator whose life encompassed the history of 20th-century Russia and the experience of Russian emigres, died in Valley Cottage, N.Y., on Friday. She was 96.         A longtime seminary instructor in the United States, she wrote widely used textbooks and church histories for use by emigres and lived to see them published in Russia, where she visited and lectured in the last few years of her life.         She was born Sophie Schidlovsky  in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1903, the daughter of Sergei Schidlovsky, the last vice president of the Czar's Duma, or Parliament.         A life of privilege was replaced by one of poverty as the family endured the first years of Soviet rule, then fled, first to Estonia, where her father died, then Berlin, then Paris.         In Germany, she studied philosophy at the University of Berlin and took part in philosophical discussions led by Nikolai Berdyaev, the Rev. Sergius Bulgakov and Semyon Frank, leading Russian religious thinkers and former Marxists who became liberal Christians and were expelled from the Soviet Union by Lenin in 1922. They were formative in her development as a broad-minded Orthodox Christian activist.         In 1926, a scholarship from the John D. Rockefeller Fund took her to the United States, where she graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in religious education.         Returning to Paris, she became a leader of the Russian Christian Student Movement, taught emigre children and edited two volumes of church school lessons. The student organization was financed by the Young Men's Christian Association, which at the time actively supported the efforts of Russian emigres to establish their church in exile.         Mrs. Koulomzin also did social work among poor Russian emigres, working with Elizabeth Skobtsova, who became an Orthodox nun known as Mother Maria and died in the Ravensbruck concentration camp after trying to help save Jews during the German occupation.         Mrs. Koulomzin was married in 1932 to Nikita Koulomzin, an engineer who was also of aristocratic descent, who survives her. She is also survived by their daughters, Elizabeth Lopukhin, Olga Poloukhine and Xenia Kalinin; their son, George; 11 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.         Surviving the occupation, the family lived in Paris and then in the French provinces, where they helped Soviet prisoners of war taken by the Germans.         In 1948, the Koulomzins moved to Nyack, N.Y. Mrs. Koulomzin worked as a religious educator, creating an English-language education program and lecturing across the country. She founded the Orthodox Christian Education Commission to coordinate the work of the various Orthodox Christian ethnic groups in America.         Beginning in 1954, she taught for nearly 20 years at St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, N.Y.,         After her official retirement in 1974, she continued working. At the time of her death she was president of Religious Books for Russia, founded to send Bibles and religious literature to Russia; it has continued its work in Russia.         Mrs. Koulomzin's books, including ''God Is With Us,'' ''History of the Orthodox Church'' and 'Our Church and Our Children,'' have become classic texts in Orthodox religious education. In recent years her books were widely published in Russia. Her memoir, ''Many Worlds: A Russian Life,'' written when she was 77, ends with an account of her first visit back to her homeland, in 1970.         ''Now I had again come briefly in touch with life there and suddenly I realized that there was no absolute break, no complete separation,'' she wrote. ''My life, my own life, such as it was, came easily in touch with the flow of life that went on in Russia. I was together with Russia in the life of the Church, I was together with Russia in the search for spiritual values that is going on there.''       
         Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, the first woman in the world to serve as a prime minister, died yesterday shortly after voting in Sri Lanka's elections. She was 84.         Mrs. Bandaranaike's final act was to vote in a parliamentary election she hoped would return the family's party to power leading a governing coalition known as the People's Alliance. Her death from a heart attack on Election Day seemed poetically timed for a woman whose family business is politics and whose political career spanned four decades.         Mrs. Bandaranaike rose to power in 1960 as a bereaved wife and mother of three, just a year after her husband, Solomon, then prime minister, was assassinated by a Buddhist monk. She quickly established herself as the undisputed leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party -- founded by her husband -- and a formidable politician in her own right.         She also became the matriarch of a political dynasty. In the final years of her life, her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, succeeded her as the standard bearer of the family party and has served as president of the country since 1994. The father, mother and daughter have led Sri Lanka for 21 of the 52 years since it gained its independence from the British.         ''Mrs. Bandaranaike's legacy is this: After her husband died, there was so much confusion and the party was almost collapsing,'' said K. M. de Silva, a Sri Lankan historian. ''She was an untried leader. But she not only survived, she sustained the party and the family in politics.''         Her body was taken to her stately  home on Rosemead Place in the Cinnamon Gardens section of Colombo, the capital. State radio canceled regular programs to play elegiac music and state television looked back on her life.         She will be buried alongside her husband on Saturday in a state funeral at the family's ancestral home in Horagulla. Friday and Saturday have been declared days of national mourning. All liquor shops, bars, cinemas and slaughterhouses have been ordered to close.         ''She was a heroic mother of the nation,'' the Sri Lanka Freedom Party said in a statement.         But the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has come to stand for very different policies and values than it had in her day.         Mrs. Kumaratunga firmly repudiated her mother's brand of Sinhalese nationalism, which had inflamed ethnic tensions between the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese majority and the predominantly Hindu Tamil minority. The daughter's years in office have been dominated by her as-yet-fruitless efforts to end a 17-year-old war with separatist Tamil rebels. Mrs. Kumaratunga also steered the party toward a more open, market-oriented economy and away from the centralized, state-dominated socialism that had been her mother's trademark.         Mrs. Bandaranaike was born Sirimavo Ratwatte on April 17, 1916, into one of the island nation's wealthy feudal families, one that was at the pinnacle of Sri Lanka's social hierarchy. In 1940 -- 60 years ago today -- she married S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, the scion of an elite, feudal clan that had thrived for generations with the patronage of the British Empire.         Mr. Bandaranaike made the transition from his Anglicized, upper-class background to become a populist and a nationalist. And his wife carried forward his passions with even greater decisiveness and vigor,  historians say. She was a shrewd political leader with a wide base in the Sinhalese majority.         In a recent interview, Anura, the Bandaranaike's youngest child and only son, said their father had been the affectionate, demonstrative parent while their mother was aloof.         Mrs. Bandaranaike -- known simply as Mrs. B -- served twice as  head of state, from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1977. She nationalized many foreign and local enterprises and left Sri Lanka's economy into one that was heavily state dominated.         She also zealously pursued efforts to make Sinhalese the sole national language, a stance that deeply alienated the country's Tamil speakers. And she changed the university admissions policy to benefit the Sinhalese, disadvantaging the Tamils.         During five years of her daughter's presidency, Mrs. Bandaranaike served as prime minister, which had become a largely ceremonial role under the Constitution adopted in 1978. Increasingly feeble and unable to speak clearly, she resigned as prime minister in August, though she retained her seat in Parliament.         She lived on Rosemead Place with her elder daughter, Sunethra, a philanthropist who is 57 and never got involved in politics.         But the political family she had nurtured splintered in her later years. Her son, Anura, 51, who lives  next to his mother's home in the family compound, went over to the family's despised rival, the United National Party, after his sister, now 55, won the right to succeed their mother. But both the son, as a leader of the opposition, and the daughter, as president, have carried on the family's political tradition.       
         Janice Brustlein, whose painting career, pursued under the name Biala, spanned two art capitals and several generations, died on Sept. 24 at her home in Paris. She was 97 and had lived in Paris since 1958.         She was known for cryptic, lusciously painted interiors, still lifes, landscapes and street scenes that hovered between abstraction and representation. They belonged to a trans-Atlantic tradition that included French painters like Matisse, Bonnard and Marquet, as well as Milton Avery and Edward Hopper. She might also be grouped with artists like Loren MacIver, Fairfield Porter and Anne Poor, who borrowed from the abstract tendencies of the New York School while concentrating on their immediate surroundings.         Always carrying a sketchbook, Biala drew her subjects from her homes and studios, the cities she lived in and the places she visited, including Cape Cod, Venice, the French Riviera and Fire Island. Although she preferred to live in Paris, her career was based in New York, where she had regular gallery shows beginning in the 1940's.         Biala was described by her niece, the New York painter Hermine Ford,  as a ''uniquely wonderful, widely beloved character'' whose house in Paris ''would fill in the late afternoon with all kinds of people -- writers, artists, next-door neighbors.'' Her close friends included the photographer Cartier-Bresson, as well as the expatriate American painter Shirley Jaffe. She knew literary Paris as well, having lived there with the English novelist Ford Madox Ford from the late 1920's until his death in 1939, during which time she illustrated some of his novels.         Biala rarely revisited her complicated past -- refusing several offers from potential biographers -- and as a result its facts are not always clear. Neither Ms. Ford, or her sister Helen Tworkov, a founding editor of Tricycle magazine, remember the name their aunt was given at birth.  She was born in 1903, the daughter of a Jewish tailor named Tworkovsky in Biala, a village on the Russian-Polish border. Her father soon left for New York, where he set up a shop on Ludlow Street in the Lower East Side; Biala, her mother and her older brother Jacob, who would become the Abstract Expressionist painter Jack Tworkov, followed in 1913.         While both nieces contend that Biala knew she wanted to be a painter from a very early age (before her brother did, in fact), all they know of her artistic education is that at the age of 18 or 19, after a brief period of study at the National Academy of Design, she went to Provincetown, Mass., to study with the painter Edwin Dickinson, whose painterly representation was especially influential on her work. By then she was already living on her own, supporting herself with menial jobs and becoming familiar with Greenwich Village bohemia. Sometime in the mid-1920's she was briefly married to the painter Lee Gatch. After that, a wealthy couple interested in art paid her expenses on a trip to Paris, where she met Ford and became a Francophile.         In 1943, having returned to New York, Biala married Daniel Brustlein, an Alsatian-born painter who contributed cartoons to The New Yorker under the name Alain. Over the next 15 years the couple split their time between Paris and New York. (The McCarran Act did not permit naturalized citizens to live abroad for more than two years at a time.) Their New York circle included Jack and Wally Tworkov, Harold and May Rosenberg, Willem and Elaine de Kooning, Saul Steinberg and Hedda Sterne and Rudy Burckhardt. Mr. Brustlein died in 1996.         Biala's first exhibition was at the Passedoit Gallery in Manhattan in 1936, by which point, it is thought, she had already taken the name of her birthplace. She exhibited at the Stable Gallery, an important artists' cooperative, in 1954, 1956 and 1961. In the 1970's and 80's she was represented by the Gruenebaum Gallery in New York and in the 1990's by the Kouros Gallery, where she had her most recent show in 1999.         Despite her love of Paris, Biala never gave up her United States citizenship. She was at home everywhere. ''I never have the feeling of nationality or roots,'' she once said. ''I always had the feeling that I belong where my easel is.''       
         Sonja Bullaty, a photographer noted for lyrical composition and startling use of color and light in a vast body of work created during a five-decade collaboration with her husband, Angelo Lomeo, died on Oct. 5 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 76, and had homes in Manhattan and Bellmont, Vt.         The cause was cancer, Mr. Lomeo said.         Born in Prague into a Jewish banking family, Ms. Bullaty received her first camera at 14, a consolation gift from her father for having to abandon school and normal teenage activities as their world darkened with the approach of war.         ''I have loved the camera ever since, because it gave me joy and it gave me a life,'' she said. ''In the following difficult years I had no camera but often saw things indelibly etched on my mind. Perhaps to this day I search for some of those missing images.''         She was deported to Poland on her 18th birthday and spent the next four years in captivity, first in the Lodz Ghetto, then in the Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen concentration camps. Toward the end of the war, she escaped a death march near Dresden, which was then in flames, by hiding with a girlfriend in a haystack in the barn where the prisoners had been held for the night. Although Nazi soldiers, armed with pitchforks, were sent back to roust the women, they remained undetected, and Ms. Bullaty managed by stay alive until liberation allowed her to return to Prague.         There, she discovered that none of her family had survived.         Eventually, she sought out the well-known Czech photographer Josef Sudek and over time became what he called his ''apprentice-martyr,'' mixing chemicals for the darkroom, filing negatives and absorbing the unwritten rules of composition as she watched him print his dark, moody, almost abstract works. Master and pupil, they shared an affinity for the simplicity of windows and the mystery of reflections, and a fondness for patriotic kitsch and the seemingly banal. Ms. Bullaty wrote about her mentor in a 1978 book, ''Sudek.''         In 1947, she arrived in New York, her boat fare paid by distant relatives who found her name on a survivors' list and invited her to stay with them.         That same year, she met Mr. Lomeo when she inquired over an intercom about a darkroom in the building he managed and he went in search of the woman behind a voice he called ''the most beautiful I had ever heard.'' He offered her a gift of apples, and they became almost immediately inseparable. They married in 1951, and for five decades lived and worked together while managing to retain their individual visual perspectives. He is her only survivor.         During the next decade, the couple built a reputation photographing paintings and sculptures in museums and galleries.         They began shooting in black and white and were well into their joint career when they turned, in the early 1970's, to the vivid, saturated color now associated with them.         Critics often remarked on the painterly aspects of their compositions, on the evocations of Hopper and Magritte, of van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne and the Venetian colorists.         Together they made six books, ''Provence,'' ''Tuscany,'' ''Venice and the Veneto,'' ''Circle of Seasons: Central Park Celebrated,'' ''Vermont in All Weathers,'' and ''America America,'' published this year by Abbeville Press. Their photographs appeared in Life, Time and Audubon magazines and have been exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the International Center of Photography and George Eastman House in Rochester.         ''I want to express with it what I see, experience and feel, a world real or surreal, sad or funny, but a world uniquely my own,'' Ms. Bullaty said of the guiding force behind her work. ''Perhaps to live I needed to know there is beauty.''       
         Gwen Verdon, whose high-kicking artistry, flaming red hair and head-turning figure made her an unforgettable presence in musicals like ''Can-Can,'' ''Damn Yankees'' and ''Chicago,'' died yesterday in Woodstock, Vt. She was 75 and had homes in Bronxville, N.Y., and Quogue, N.Y.         She died at the home of her daughter, Nicole Fosse.         Widely regarded as the best dancer ever to brighten the Broadway stage, Ms. Verdon was also a performer who brought more than physical excitement to her roles. A highly capable actress as well as an exceptional dancer, she was adept at enriching the characters she played. Whether oozing seductive come-ons as the Devil's sexy troubleshooter in ''Damn Yankees'' or brooding over a whiskey as a disillusioned prostitute in a waterfront dive in ''New Girl in Town,'' a musical adaptation of  O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' she always reached for, and found, her character's heart.         The League of American Theaters and Producers said yesterday that the lights of Broadway's marquees would be dimmed in her memory at 8 p.m. last night.         Ms. Verdon's first Broadway success was explosive. In 1953 she auditioned for the Cole Porter musical ''Can-Can,'' and won a part as a featured dancer in the show, which was written and directed by Abe Burrows and had choreography by Michael Kidd. The show's star was the temperamental French actress and singer Lilo, who was not amused by the way audiences were applauding this redheaded newcomer during out-of-town tryouts and who saw to it that Ms. Verdon's part was cut back. Ms. Verdon, in turn, was disgusted enough to announce that she was quitting the show, and maybe even giving up dancing.         But on opening night on Broadway,  she delivered a fiery Apache dance that brought the audience to its feet -- and kept them there. She was already back in her dressing room for a costume change when one of the producers came pounding in to tell her that the audience was chanting her name and cheering and that she had to come back for a curtain call so that the show could continue. She took her bows, wearing a bathrobe, and knew she had arrived. Brooks Atkinson, in his review in The New York Times, cheered the ''impudence, recklessness and humor'' of her dancing and called her ''the practical star of the show.'' It was a late arrival for a dancer -- she was 28 and had been performing since the age of 3 -- but it was unforgettable.         ''Can-Can'' made Ms. Verdon a marquee name and brought her her first Tony Award. Nevertheless, she left the show before it ended its run and returned to working with the Hollywood choreographer Jack Cole, whose assistant she had been in the early 1950's. She was working on a film with Cole when she was approached by the producers of a new Broadway musical to be called ''Damn Yankees.'' Written by George Abbott and Douglass Wallop, the story centered on a Faustian deal made by a passionate baseball fan who agrees to sell his soul to the Devil for the chance to help his beloved Washington Senators beat the New York Yankees.         A Life and Career Linked to Fosse         The show had music and lyrics by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross and was to be directed by Abbott. Ms. Verdon was offered the part of Lola, the Devil's No. 1 helper. She wasn't eager to return to Broadway despite her success in ''Can-Can,'' but finally signed on. It would be her first experience with an up-and-coming choreographer named Bob Fosse, fresh from his first Broadway success with ''The Pajama Game.''         From that point on, Ms. Verdon's life and career were inextricably linked to Fosse. She was to become the living embodiment of his work on Broadway, and he in turn became her mentor, her lover and eventually her husband. Fosse soon found that working with Ms. Verdon was more of a collaboration than a tutorial. ''The happiest times I ever had with Gwen were when we were working together'' he said in an interview in 1971. ''They stimulated all sorts of things.''         For Ms. Verdon, working with Fosse provided ''direction like I've never had in my life.'' Years later, looking back on that experience, she recalled how ''Bob choreographs down to the second joint of your little finger.''         ''Damn Yankees'' opened to bravos in May 1955. Ms. Verdon's co-stars were Ray Walston as the Devil and Stephen Douglass as the hapless fan who is transformed into the home-run-hitting Joe Hardy. As Lola, Ms. Verdon brought the house down with her slinky rendition of ''Whatever Lola Wants,'' a locker-room seduction scene in which her sultry yet playful striptease for Shoeless Joe was hot enough to tempt the Devil himself. ''Damn Yankees'' racked up over a thousand performances and brought Ms. Verdon her second Tony. It was an impressive showing for a performer who spent her early childhood years laced into orthopedic boots to correct legs that had been weakened and deformed by a series of illnesses.         Gwyneth Evelyn Verdon was born on Jan. 16, 1925, in Culver City, Calif. Her parents were British expatriates. Her mother, Gertrude, had been a member of Denishawn, the influential modern dance troupe.Her father, Joseph, was an electrician at MGM. Show business was part of the household, and baby Gwyneth was pointed toward the stage from the time she could walk. When she wasn't wearing those knee-high corrective boots, she was being taught basic ballet, ballroom dancing and learning how to tap and do the old soft-shoe. At age 6, she was already performing in theaters where she was billed as ''the fastest little tapper in the world.'' By the time she graduated from high school, her career seemed well on its way.         But then, at 17, she eloped with a writer for The Hollywood Reporter, James Henaghan. The marriage lasted five years, until Mr. Henaghan's freewheeling lifestyle brought it to an end. The couple had a son, Jimmy, and after the divorce Ms. Verdon left him in the care of her parents and resumed her career.         She auditioned for Cole and was hired by the talented, ferociously  abrasive dance director. She became a member of Cole's troupe for five years and made her Broadway debut in his 1950 flop, ''Alive and Kicking.'' Cole's connections with Hollywood studios brought her work as a ''specialty dancer'' in several films, including ''On the Riviera.'' She also coached stars like Jane Russell in the art of moving sexily on screen.         When Mr. Kidd made his offer of a part in ''Can-Can,'' she was weary of anonymity, weary of Cole -- a perfectionist given to tantrums -- and ready to leave Hollywood for a second chance at success on Broadway. She wouldn't be seen on screen again until 1958, when she got star billing opposite Tab Hunter in the film adaptation of ''Damn Yankees.''         Ms. Verdon's fourth Broadway show was ''New Girl in Town,'' based on O'Neill's bleak tale about a waterfront prostitute's redemption through love. Directed by Abbott, with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill and choreography by Bob Fosse, ''New Girl in Town'' opened in May 1957 with Ms. Verdon in the title role. Brooks Atkinson called her performance ''sobering and admirable'' but found the show an uneasy blend of the antic and tragic. Nevertheless, Ms. Verdon came away with Tony No. 3, which she shared with her co-star, Thelma Ritter.         The musical that became the perfect showcase for Ms. Verdon's gifts as both dancer and actress was also the first of her shows to be both choreographed and directed by Fosse. The 1959 ''Redhead,'' which had music by Albert Hague and lyrics by Dorothy Fields had been written for the British music hall star Beatrice Lillie. But Ms. Lillie turned out to be otherwise engaged and Ms. Verdon agreed to star on the condition that Fosse be the director.         Ms. Verdon was cast as Essie Whimple, a shy worker in a London waxworks museum. It was a role in which she had ample opportunity to display her acting talent. And in the dances created for her by Fosse, she did everything from a tango to a ragtime strut, from Chaplinesque comedy to a brassy music-hall routine.She won another Tony Award, her fourth.         The following year, when ''Redhead'' was on tour in Chicago, Miss Verdon and Fosse were married, and by the time the tour reached Los Angeles she had decided to retire from show business with the intention of concentrating on family life. In 1963 their daughter, Nicole, was born. She is also survived by her son, Jimmy Henaghan of Los Angeles; four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.         Dance-Hall Hostess With Heart         It wasn't until 1966 that Ms. Verdon returned to the stage, in ''Sweet Charity.'' The musical had its unlikely roots in Fellini's film classic ''Nights of Cabiria.'' Once again, Fosse was director and choreographer. Ms. Verdon played the role immortalized by Giulietta Masina although the character had been changed from a Roman prostitute to a New York dance-hall hostess.         Even though the critics were less than ecstatic about ''Sweet Charity,'' Ms. Verdon was given numbers like ''Hey, Big Spender'' that added to her legend as a peerless performer on Broadway. The musical ran for more than 600 performances and became something of a cult favorite long after it closed. But increasing fatigue led Ms. Verdon to surrender the lead to Helen Gallagher before the show's run ended. When the 1968 Hollywood film version was being cast, Ms. Verdon lost out to the younger Shirley MacLaine.         Meanwhile, Fosse's open infidelities were disrupting their marriage, and by 1971 the couple were legally separated although they continued to work together on occasion and were never divorced.         A Chance To Play Roxie         In 1972, with her career as a dancer clearly drawing to a close, Ms. Verdon tried her hand at a thriller called ''Children! Children!'' which quickly flopped. But there was one more Broadway musical waiting in the wings and it would reunite Ms. Verdon and Fosse once again, onstage if not in marriage.         ''Chicago,'' which began life as a stage play in the 20's and then became a vehicle for Ginger Rogers in the 1942 film ''Roxie Hart,'' was a show Ms. Verdon had wanted to do for years. When Fosse decided to take it on as a musical, and John Kander and Fred Ebb signed on to write the score, Ms. Verdon at last got her chance to play Roxie, a woman jailed, tried and acquitted for shooting her lover.         When it opened in 1975, ''Chicago'' won applause for its three leads, Ms. Verdon, Chita Rivera and Jerry Orbach. Clive Barnes in The Times saluted ''three superlative, knock-em-in-the-aisles performances by three stars who glitter like gold dust all evening,'' but most of the critics found it too determinedly seedy and cynical for its own good. It proved to be Ms. Verdon's farewell to Broadway. Her successor in the role was Ann Reinking, Fosse's companion, who also restaged Fosse's choreography for the show's highly successful revival in 1996.         At Fosse's request, Ms. Verdon served as superviser of his 1978 musical, ''Dancin,' '' and also worked with him on his 1979 autobiographical film, ''All That Jazz.''         In 1983 Ms. Verdon appeared in a made-for-television movie, ''Legs,'' as the choreographer of the Rockettes. Her television appearances included ABC's daytime serial ''All My Children.''         The urge to perform also drew her back to Hollywood in the 1980's. She had a small role ''The Cotton Club'' (1984), and was part of a lauded acting ensemble in ''Cocoon'' (1985).         In 1999 she made an offstage return to Broadway as the artistic adviser for the musical ''Fosse,'' a compilation of highlights from his career. Ms. Verdon was with Fosse in 1987 when he died of a heart attack at age 60 on a Washington sidewalk, minutes after the opening of the revival of ''Sweet Charity,'' which she had helped him reconstruct. She attended to his funeral and, despite their many marital difficulties and years of separation, wholeheartedly assumed the duties of devoted widow, nourishing and helping to preserve his dance legacy, in which she had played such a vital role.         Their collaboration was relatively brief, but remarkably productive and intensely shared. Reflecting on their years together in an interview before Fosse's death, she said: ''I was a great dancer when he got hold of me, but he developed me, he created me.'' She made the most of it.         Correction:  October 24, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the Broadway dancer Gwen Verdon on Thursday misstated the title of a song in the 1966 musical ''Sweet Charity'' and misattributed the performance. The title was ''Big Spender,'' not ''Hey, Big Spender,'' and the performance was by a group of dancers, not by Ms. Verdon.       
         Luise Kraus Addiss, an art-loving New Yorker who was the first person to be a member of the Metropolitan Museum for 75 years, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 101.         Mrs. Addiss was 99 when she set that record in 1999, the museum said. She received flowers and an invitation to lunch and a tour of the museum from Philippe de Montebello, its director, on a Monday, when it is closed. She was still a member when she died.         She was born in Akron, Ohio, where her Austrian-born father ran a plumbing business. She became the first girl in her family to go to college, and she arrived in New York in 1922 to study for a master's degree in home economics at Columbia University. She joined the Metropolitan in 1924.         Mrs. Addiss became a home economist at what is now the Community Service Society of New York and retired from the society after 40 years, when she was 65. Then she studied painting, was a consultant to the Head Start program for 10 years and then worked for Unicef for 10 years on projects like advocating breast feeding in developing countries.         She married Edward F. Addiss, a Burlington Industries executive, when she was 29. He died in 1954.         She is survived by two sons, James, of Manhattan, and Stephen, of Richmond; a daughter, Penelope Yungblut of Round Hill, Va.; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Rosalind Baker Wilson, an editor and writer who published a memoir of her father, Edmund Wilson, one of America's foremost men of letters, died on Oct. 30 in Syracuse. She was 79 and lived in Talcottville, N.Y.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said Tim Page, a friend.         Ms. Wilson was the author of ''Near the Magician: A Memoir of My Father, Edmund Wilson'' (Weidenfeld, 1990). She also published short stories and served as an editor at The New Yorker and Houghton Mifflin, the publisher.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Wilson attended Bennington College and Columbia University and started her career in the 1940's. In the 1960's she moved to Talcottville, the Black River family seat Edmund Wilson memorialized in ''Upstate'' (1970).         She was Wilson's elder daughter, by the first of his four wives, Mary Blair.         She is survived by a stepbrother, Reuell Kimball Wilson of London, Ont.; and a stepsister, Helen Miranda Wilson of Wellfleet, Mass.         Correction:  November 11, 2000, Saturday  An obituary of the writer and editor Rosalind Baker Wilson on Thursday misstated her relationship to two survivors. Reuel Wilson of London, Ontario, was her half brother and Helen Miranda Wilson of Wellfleet, Mass., her half sister -- not stepbrother and stepsister.         Correction:  January 8, 2001, Monday  An obituary on Nov. 9 about Rosalind Baker Wilson, a writer and daughter of the critic Edmund Wilson, misstated her age. She was 77, not 79. This correction was delayed by an editing lapse.       
         Mary Hunter Wolf, one of the first female directors on Broadway, died Nov. 3 in Hamden, Conn. She was 95.         Born in Bakersfield, Calif., and orphaned as a teenager, Ms. Hunter (who took the name Wolf after marrying Herman Wolf in 1955) discovered her love of the theater while a student at the Hollywood School for Girls. There she formed a lifelong friendship with the choreographer Agnes de Mille, a classmate.         She spent the summer after graduation working as a script girl for de Mille's father, William, at Laske Studios before heading to Wellesley College. During her third year at Wellesley, she visited her aunt, the writer Mary Austin, in Santa Fe, N.M., where she was introduced into the circle of D. H. Lawrence, Lynn Riggs, Sinclair Lewis and Willa Cather, whom she chauffeured around while Cather wrote ''Death Comes for the Archbishop.''         She soon abandoned her studies to forge a directing career, beginning with a staging of a 17th-century Spanish verse play, ''Los Morros y los Cristianos,'' performed on horseback. In 1928, she moved to Chicago, where she enrolled at the University of Chicago and started working with the Cube Theater, the first interracial company in Chicago. Once again, she dropped out of college to take over the theater, directing such plays as ''The Dreamy Kid,'' ''The Man Who Died at 12:00'' and ''Plumes,'' in which Katherine Dunham made her dramatic debut.         In 1931, she won the part of Marge on the WGN radio comedy ''Easy Aces.'' Two years later, she moved with the show to New York, where it was broadcast on CBS until 1945, and resumed her college studies, earning a degree in anthropology from Columbia University.         In 1938, Ms. Hunter and a Stanislavsky student, Andrius Jilinsky, founded the American Actors Company, an early Off Broadway ensemble whose members included de Mille, Jerome Robbins, Mildred Dunnock, Horton Foote, Joseph Anthony, Perry Wilson and Jean Stapleton.         ''Mary was largely instrumental in getting me interested in playwriting and was kind of my mentor,'' Mr. Foote said Friday.         ''I was doing some improvisation about Texas, and she asked me if I had ever thought about writing, which I hadn't,'' he recalled. ''And so, at her urging, I put some things down on paper, and it sort of went from there.''         Ms. Hunter made her Broadway debut directing the 1944 production of Mr. Foote's ''Only the Heart.'' The next year, she directed ''Carib Song,'' the first black Broadway musical, starring Dunham. She went on to direct Riggs's ''Out of Dust,'' John LaTouche and Jerome Moross's ''Ballet Ballads'' and a successful run of Jean-Paul Sartre's ''Respectful Prostitute,'' both on Broadway and on tour. Alongside her close friend Robbins, she was associate director of ''Peter Pan,'' starring Mary Martin.         In 1947, Ms. Hunter was hired to direct a new Broadway musical, ''High Button Shoes,'' but the show's producers dismissed her before rehearsals began, replacing her with George Abbott. She sued, arguing that her contract had been canceled because she was a woman. Two years later the New York Supreme Court decided in her favor.         At the close of World War II, Ms. Hunter established the Professional Training Program of the American Theater Wing, under which 1,700 students studied under the G.I. Bill of Rights. In 1952 she helped Lawrence Langner found the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn., serving first as executive director and later as associate producer.         She and Mr. Wolf were divorced in 1965. He survives her, as do two stepsons, David Wolf of Ridgefield, Wash., and Bill Wolf of New Castle, Va.; a stepdaughter, Louise Chandler of Sweet Springs, W.Va.; six grandchildren; and a great-grandson.       
         Teresa Sterne, a pioneering producer of classical recordings, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said a friend, Norma Hurlburt, executive director of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.         As the director of Nonesuch Records from 1965 through 1979, Ms. Sterne turned a small budget label into one of the most adventurous companies in the recording business.  When she was invited to take charge of Nonesuch, the label was a subsidiary of the pop-oriented and profitable Elektra Records. Nonesuch's business had consisted mostly of acquiring the rights to existing recordings of Baroque music by European ensembles and reissuing them at budget prices in the United States.         Ms. Sterne, called Tracey by her friends and colleagues, brought a vision to the job born of her long experience in music. She had been a piano prodigy, and though she gave up public performance as an adult, she maintained close ties with the composers and performers of her day.         At Nonesuch she brought attention to areas of music neglected by the major labels, particularly contemporary music and American vernacular music. She championed American composers like George Crumb, Elliott Carter, Morton Subotnick, Charles Wuorinen and Donald Martino, not just recording their works but commissioning them, an unusual move for the leader of a record company. She also issued important recordings of lesser-known works by Schoenberg, Busoni, Stravinsky and other major figures.         She nurtured relationships with several excellent performers not widely known at the time, like the pianist Paul Jacobs, the mezzo-soprano Jan DeGaetani and the pianist Gilbert Kalish. Many of the artists she discovered were first recognized  for their work in contemporary music. Ms. Sterne encouraged them to  record past works that interested them as well, like Jacobs's critically hailed recording of the Debussy etudes and Mr. Kalish's engaging survey of the Haydn piano sonatas.         The mezzo-soprano Joan Morris and her husband and professional partner, the composer and pianist William Bolcom, made some popular Nonesuch recordings of vernacular American songs from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. And Ms. Sterne sparked a nationwide craze for ragtime with a series of Scott Joplin piano works played by Joshua Rifkin.         She was also in the forefront of the early instrument movement in Baroque and Renaissance repertory. And under her leadership, Nonesuch's Explorer series introduced music from Bali, India, Peru and other countries to a wider audience. Ms. Sterne believed that every record she produced should have a purpose, and she involved herself with everything, from the packaging to the liner notes.         But in late 1979 she was dismissed from Nonesuch. Early in her tenure the record label had been acquired by Warner Communications, and by the mid-1970's, it was grouped under a parent company, Elektra/Asylum/ Nonesuch, headed by Joe Smith. Warner officials asserted that Nonesuch was losing money. In an interview with The Boston Globe at the time, Mr. Smith said: ''Nonesuch is in business, and it is losing its credibility in its marketplace. We can't make records that sell only outside the Russian Tea Room.''         Ms. Sterne argued that the losses were mostly caused by the parent company's poor marketing and distribution. A letter condemning her dismissal, written by 10 Pulitzer Prize-winning composers, including Mr. Carter and Aaron Copland, was sent to the vice president of Warner Communications and widely circulated in the press, to no avail.         Ms. Sterne never anticipated becoming a record producer. She was born in Brooklyn on March 29, 1927, to a cultured family with a toehold on the middle class. Her mother was a cellist who gave up her career to nurture her musical daughter. Ms. Sterne's father, a violinist, deserted the family when she was 14. Her paternal uncle, Robert Sterne, a professional violinist, became an important mentor.         From the age of 10, she was educated at home by private tutors, living with her mother and a beloved aunt in ''a kind of aristocratic poverty,'' as she once told a friend. In 1939, when she was 12, she made her professional debut as a pianist playing Grieg's Piano Concerto with the NBC Symphony Orchestra at Madison Square Garden. The next year she played Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto with the New York Philharmonic at Lewisohn Stadium, winning cheers from the audience and glowing reviews from critics. Her career as a prodigy flourished.         But after such a rarefied and isolated upbringing, Ms. Sterne felt that she lacked the pragmatism and confidence to pursue a professional career. Wanting experience in the real world, she became a secretary, soon winding up in the offices of the powerful manager Sol Hurok, where she nurtured the careers of other young artists. A series of administrative jobs, including assistant to the director at Vanguard Records, led to her  hiring by Nonesuch.         Ms. Sterne, who never married, leaves no immediate survivors. After her dismissal from Nonesuch, the company went through many changes. Earlier this year, Robert Hurwitz, its director since 1984 and a great admirer of Ms. Sterne, issued a two-disc recording in tribute to her, containing highlights from favorite albums she had produced and live recordings of performances she gave in her early years as a piano prodigy.       
         Marie Windsor, who played sassy femmes fatales, cynical bawdyhouse matrons and two-timing crooks in 74 movies with enough verve to win the informal accolade ''Queen of the B's,'' died on Sunday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80.         Acting opposite male stars like Marlon Brando, George Raft, James Garner and John Wayne, she portrayed a succession of strong, but seldom admirable characters: she was the blunt, beautiful dame with the bedroom eyes who was rotten to the core and didn't care who knew it.         ''I know you like a book, ya little tramp,'' Sterling Hayden said to her in the 1956 film ''The Killing,'' directed by Stanley Kubrick.''You'd sell out your own mother for a piece of fudge.''         In ''The Narrow Margin'' (1952), she played a sexy gangster's widow who ends up riding across the country by rail with a police escort played by Charles McGraw. ''She's a dish,'' he tells his partner, ''a 60-cent special: cheap, flashy, strictly poison under the gravy.''         Later, he tells her, ''You make me sick to my stomach.''         ''Yeah?'' she snarls. ''Well, use your own sink.''         She also made guest appearances on more than 100 television shows, including ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' Her film career spanned five decades, and included film noir classics like ''Force of Evil'' (1948) and westerns like ''The Fighting Kentuckian'' (1949), with Mr. Wayne. But she also had no qualms about appearing in quickie efforts like ''Cat Women of the Moon'' (1954), ''Swamp Women'' (1955) and ''Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'' (1955). ''I think those films added to my luster,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. ''I think people said, 'She can even do that and survive.' ''         She came to take pride in the title Queen of the B's. As she said in several different interviews over the years, ''It's better to be queen of something than nothing at all.''         Emily Marie Bertelsen was born on Dec. 11, 1919, in Marysvale, Utah, a small farming community where her father was a mechanic. Her grandmother took her to see films with Clara Bow, the ''It Girl,'' as a child. By the time she was 11, her parents drove 30 miles over dirt roads to take her to acting lessons.         After she won two local beauty pageants and studied drama for two years at Brigham Young University, her parents drove her to Hollywood to study with Maria Ouspenskaya, the famed acting instructor. She stayed at the Hollywood Studio Club,  whose residents included Marilyn Monroe and Donna Reed. She worked as a cigarette girl at the Mocambo, a Sunset Strip nightclub.         In 1941 she made her movie debut in Paramount's ''All-American Coed,'' wearing a costume of velvet carrots. After appearing in some bit parts, she headed for New York, where she was cast in more than 400 radio shows, including a nine-month stint on the soap opera ''Our Gal Sunday,'' from 1943 to 1945. During her last year in New York, she played the femme heavy in the Broadway play ''Follow the Girls.''         MGM then signed her to a contract, though she did lesser roles for many other studios, including some very small ones, through the 1950's.         ''A lot of things hampered my career,'' she said in an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle in 1994. ''At 5 foot 9, I was too tall for most leading men. And I never had a classic face. One of my casting directors at Paramount said about me, before I'd even started my career, 'Her eyes are too big and she has a bad mouth.' ''         The Chronicle quoted Frances Bergen, the mother of Candice and a long-time friend, as suggesting that Ms. Windsor's striking resemblance to Joan Crawford might have obscured her during Crawford's heyday. But Ms. Windsor found a niche in film noir, a genre of mainly crime thrillers that captured a sense of postwar disillusionment. In ''Force of Evil,'' she played Roy Roberts's sultry, promiscuous wife in a tale about the numbers racket. For the first time, she received featured billing and was pictured in the advertising. She once said in an interview: ''I didn't know I was doing film noir, I thought they were detective stories with low lighting! Even Kubrick, in  'The Killing,' never used the term film noir to my knowledge.''         Perhaps her best remembered role was in the low-budget ''The Narrow Margin,'' in which she played a sexy gangster's wife with a heart of gravel. That role spurred Kubrick to cast her as an unfaithful wife in ''The Killing,'' for which she won the best supporting actress award from Look.         ''One of the reasons film noir is so popular today is that it left so much to the imagination, in contrast to today when everything is so explicit,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times last year. ''Film noir engaged the audience, let them use the gray matter between their ears.''         Ms. Windsor is survived by her husband, Jack Rodney Hupp; her son, Richard Hupp; a brother, Jerry Bertelsen; and a sister, Louise Atherley.         She was a director of the Screen Actors Guild for 25 years, and was aligned with the union's conservative wing, represented by Ronald Reagan and Charlton Heston. But many conservative movie viewers might be hard pressed to believe it. Her characters were just so radically evil.         She told Classic Images, a film magazine: ''Fans would send me Bibles with specific verses underscored and accompanied by handwritten warnings that 'the devil would get me and I'd go to hell,' if I didn't reform.''       
         Christabel Leighton-Porter, who became the sweetheart of British troops in World War II as the model for a comic strip heroine who was forever shedding her clothes, died Dec. 6 in Horsham, England. She was 87.         While American troops ogled pinups of Betty Grable and the Varga girls of Esquire magazine, British soldiers, sailors and airmen went to war inspired by The Daily Mirror's comic strip ''Jane.''         Six days a week, Jane, a curvaceous blonde secret agent -- Mrs. Leighton-Porter as drawn by Norman Pett -- found herself in madcap escapades. Jane tangled with Nazi spies, tumbled down cliffs and became caught in tree branches in episodes that invariably concluded with her stripped down to her underclothes.         When she was not posing as Jane, Mrs. Leighton-Porter traveled around England in a chorus-girl show, ''Jane in The Mirror,'' entertaining servicemen and bucking up home front morale.         ''Suddenly I became a sweetheart all over the world,'' she recalled. ''One admiral told me that there wasn't anybody on the ships, from the lowest rating to the highest in the fleet, who didn't have a drawing of Jane in his pocket or on his bunk.''         Christabel Jane Drewry was born on April 11, 1913, in Eastleigh, England; her father worked at the town carriage works. In her late teens, she became an artist's model, and in 1939 she was acclaimed Britain's Perfect Girl in a beauty pageant at the London Palladium.         She was discovered by Mr. Pett while modeling at an art school in Birmingham, where she also worked as a telephone operator. Mr. Pett had been drawing for The Daily Mirror since 1932, when he created ''Jane's Journal: The Diary of a Bright Young Thing,'' using his wife, Mary, as a model. But Mrs. Pett grew interested in golf as the years passed and the newspaper became interested in a Jane who revealed some flesh.         When Britain went to war in 1939, Mrs. Leighton-Porter's Jane began to lose her garments and the comic strip began to gain a huge audience on the fighting fronts. Bomber crews painted Jane on Lancaster fuselages, submarines went to war with weeks of her advance comic panels stored away, and tank crews plastered Jane's undraped likeness on their turrets. Churchill is said to have cited Jane's morale-boosting as Britain's secret weapon.         Jane finally shed every stitch of her clothing in a September 1944 episode. The Daily Mirror reported that a British infantry division was so inspired that it advanced six miles in France the very next day.         Notwithstanding her achievements in the war effort, Mrs. Leighton-Porter had to negotiate with the lord chamberlain, the court official responsible for censoring stage shows, when she made her stage appearances in scanty outfits. ''They were never offensive,'' she said of those shows. ''I was very modest.''         Jane received numerous marriage proposals, but the smitten soldiers  did not know that the real Jane was married, something Mrs. Leighton-Porter kept secret so as not to disappoint her fans. Her husband, Arthur, was a Royal Air Force pilot.         Mrs. Leighton-Porter continued modeling for ''Jane'' after the war, and when Mr. Pett left The Daily Mirror in 1948, the drawings were taken over by his assistant, Michael Hubbard. The next year, Mrs. Leighton-Porter appeared in the British movie ''The Adventures of Jane.''         The comic strip continued until 1959, when Jane sailed into the sunset with her boyfriend, Georgie Porgie. Mrs. Leighton-Porter settled into family life in Bermuda and in England, turning to more staid endeavors like sponsoring teas for a cricket team in Horsham.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Simon.         Neither Jane nor Mrs. Leighton-Porter was forgotten. The BBC developed a television show based on the ''Jane'' comic strip in the early 1980's, and Mrs. Leighton-Porter appeared at servicemen's reunions. In 1993, the Imperial War Museum displayed her 1940's frilly knickers in its exhibition ''Forces Sweethearts,'' the story of wartime romance from World War I to the gulf war. In June 1994, Mrs. Leighton-Porter attended ceremonies observing the 50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.         When she reflected on the comic strip's popularity, Mrs. Leighton-Porter chose not to dwell on the risque. ''I think it was because Jane was a bit girl-next-doorish, a bit of England for the boys,'' she said. ''Jane became a cult thing really, and I think wives and girlfriends were glad that their boys had something to get a kick out of.''       
         Florynce Kennedy, a lawyer and political activist whose flamboyant attire and sometimes outrageous comments drew attention to her fierce struggle for civil rights and feminism, died on Thursday in her Manhattan apartment. She was 84.         Known to everyone as Flo, recognizable everywhere in cowboy hat and pink sunglasses, she was one of the first black women to graduate from Columbia Law School, where she was admitted after threatening a discrimination suit. She fought in the courts and on the streets for abortion rights, represented Black Panthers, was a founding member of the National Women's Political Caucus and led a mass urination by women protesting a lack of women's restrooms at Harvard.         ''If you found a cause for the downtrodden of somebody being abused someplace, by God, Flo Kennedy would be there,'' former Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York said yesterday.         People magazine in 1974 called her ''the biggest, loudest and, indisputably, the rudest mouth on the battleground where feminist activists and radical politics join in mostly common cause.''         Justice Emily Jane Goodman of New York State Supreme Court said Ms. Kennedy gave women courage. ''She showed a whole generation of us the right way to live our lives,'' Justice Goodman said.         Friends like Gloria Steinem reveled in her razor-sharp wit. Ms. Steinem, who lectured with Ms. Kennedy in the 1970's, said a man in the audience would all too often stand up and demand, ''Are you lesbians?''         Ms. Kennedy would respond that it depended. ''Are you my alternative?'' she would ask.         Ms. Steinem said by phone from Hawaii yesterday, ''She understood what Emma Goldman understood: there has to be laughter and fun at the revolution, or it isn't a revolution.''         Marie Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation, yesterday called Ms. Kennedy ''one of the most wonderfully outrageous pioneers of feminism in America.''         Florynce Rae Kennedy, the second of five daughters, was born on Feb. 11, 1916, in Kansas City, Mo. Her father was a Pullman porter and later owned a taxi business. He once stood up with a shotgun to members of the Ku Klux Klan who wanted to drive him from a home he had bought in a mainly white neighborhood.         In her autobiography, ''Color Me Flo: My Hard Life and Good Times'' (1976), she said her parents almost never criticized their daughters. In fact, they could seemingly do almost no wrong. ''We were taught very early in the game that we didn't have to respect the teachers, and if they threatened to hit us, we could act as if they weren't anybody we had to pay any attention to,'' she wrote.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Kennedy opened a hat shop in Kansas City with her sisters. Within a few years, she was involved in her first political protest, helping organize a boycott when the local Coca-Cola bottler refused to hire black truck drivers.         After the death of her mother, Zella, from cancer, Ms. Kennedy and her sister Grayce moved to New York. Ignoring those who urged her to become a teacher, she enrolled in pre-law courses at Columbia University. ''I find that the higher you aim, the better you shoot,'' she wrote.         She applied to Columbia Law School, but was refused admission. She was told the reason was not that she was black, but that she was a woman. Justice Goodman said she answered, ''To my friends at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, it all sounds the same.''         After threatening a lawsuit, Ms. Kennedy was admitted. She was one of eight women and the only black in her class. She graduated in 1951 and worked briefly for a Manhattan law firm before opening her own law office in 1954. Business was not good, and she had to take a job at Bloomingdale's one Christmas to pay the rent.         One of her cases involved representing the estates of the jazz greats Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker to recover money owed them by record companies. Even though she won the cases, the experience soured her on the law.         ''Handling the Holiday and Parker estates taught me more than I was really ready for about government and business delinquency and the hostility and helplessness of the courts,'' she wrote. ''Not only was I not earning a decent living, there began to be a serious question in my mind whether practicing law could ever be an effective means of changing society or even of simple resistance to oppression.''         She turned to political activism, setting up an organization called the Media Workshop in 1966 to fight racism in journalism and advertising. Picketing an advertising agency led to the protesters' being invited upstairs to state their case. She said, ''Ever since I've been able to say, 'When you want to get to the suites, start in the streets.' ''         Her strategy became to go after the biggest targets possible. ''Grass-roots organizing is like climbing into bed with a malaria patient in order to show how much you love him or her, then catching malaria yourself,'' she wrote. ''I say if you want to kill poverty, go to Wall Street and kick -- or disrupt.''         Increasingly, her legal cases were almost always political. ''Sweetie,'' she said, ''if you're not living on the edge, then you're taking up space.''         In 1966, she represented H. Rap Brown, the civil rights leader. In 1968, she sued the Roman Catholic Church for what she viewed as interference with abortion. In 1969, she organized a group of feminist lawyers to challenge the constitutionality of New York State's abortion law, an action credited with helping influence the Legislature to liberalize abortion the next year.         In 1969, she helped represent 21 Black Panthers on trial in Manhattan for conspiracy to commit bombings, among other things. They were eventually acquitted, but during the trial she used them for another purpose.         She and Ms. Goodman, not then a judge, and others were renting a house on Fire Island. They decided to take the Panthers to a community on the island for a dinner at a restaurant that did not accept blacks or Jews. It created quite a commotion, the intended effect. But afterward, Ms. Goodman asked if it was all that important, compared with the life and death issues at stake in the trial.         Ms. Kennedy gave an emphatic yes. ''Her point was that you have to fight on all the fronts all the time,'' Justice Goodman said.         Other fronts included founding the Feminist Party in 1971. Its first act was to nominate Representative Shirley Chisholm, Democrat of New York, for president.         In 1967, Ms. Kennedy attended a rally against the Vietnam War in Montreal. Bobby Seale, the Black Panther, was not allowed to speak. ''I went berserk,'' she wrote. ''I took the platform and started yelling and hollering.'' An invitation for Ms. Kennedy to speak in Washington followed, and a 20-year lecturing career was born. She made $3,500 a lecture at her peak.         Ms. Steinem called her lectures with Ms. Kennedy on the college circuit ''the Thelma and Louise of the 70's.'' Ms. Steinem said, ''I definitely speak first because after Flo I would have been an anticlimax.''         In 1957, Ms. Kennedy married Charles Dye, a writer 10 years her junior. He died a few years later. ''Anyone who marries a drunk Welshman doesn't deserve sympathy,'' she once said.         Her views on the exclusivity of marriage were not much brighter. ''Why would you lock yourself in the bathroom just because you have to go three times a day,'' she wrote.         Ms. Kennedy is survived by three sisters, Joy Kennedy Banks of East Orange, N.J., Faye Kennedy Daly of Honolulu and Grayce Kennedy Bayles of Queens.         As her health failed, her spirit did not. In her autobiography, she wrote: ''I'm just a loud-mouthed, middle-aged colored lady with a fused spine and three feet of intestines missing, and a lot of people think I'm crazy. Maybe you do too, but I never stopped to wonder why I'm not like other people. The mystery to me is why more people aren't like me.''       
         Lily Carlson Schulte, one of the first models hired by the Ford agency and a favorite subject of photographers like Irving Penn and Richard Avedon, died on Dec. 14 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 85.         ''It's hard to explain to you what a star she was,'' said Eileen Ford, the agency's co-founder. ''Every great photographer wanted to work with her. In this business, there certainly has never been a bigger star. ''         Lily Carlson, as she was known professionally, stood 5 feet 11 inches tall. She stood out in a crowd, even of other models. She is the woman in the center of Irving Penn's famous photograph of the 12 most photographed women of the 1940's. She wears a white gown with a billowing skirt and gazes slightly upward.         Her face was more famous than her name, perhaps, but she was always famous to her photographers. George Hurrell, a distinguished fashion photographer, called her one of the three most beautiful women he ever photographed. The others were Joan Crawford and his wife, Phyllis Bounds, also a model. He called Miss Carlson ''perhaps the best fashion model in the entire country.''         In an interview in Cover Girl magazine, Mr. Hurrell said that some models are wooden and tend to simper, but that Miss Carlson was alive and vital. ''Equally good in sports clothes or evening gowns,'' he said.         She came along just as the whole business of modeling changed, Mrs. Ford said. In the immediate post-war years, models became the elegant emblems of a newly booming haute couture fashion business, perhaps epitomized by Christian Dior's romantic New Look of 1947. There was an explosion of photography, and models like Lisa Fonssagrives, famously photographed at the Eiffel Tower with her skirts billowing, elevated the model's role far beyond that of simple clothes hangers.         ''It was like a land rush,'' said Mrs. Ford, who with her husband, Jerry, opened Ford Models in 1946. They had hired only a couple of lesser-known models when Miss Carlson agreed to sign on. ''She was our seal of approval, the first really, really great star,'' said Mrs. Ford. (Her agency agreed this month to be bought by Magnum Sports Entertainment.)         Lily Viola Carlson was born in Sheridan, Iowa, on April 4, 1915, Easter Sunday. ''It was Bunny or Lily,'' said her daughter Christina Fleur, ''and they called her Lily. Thank goodness.''         Her father was a Lutheran minister who frequently conducted services in Swedish. Her son, William Dowell, said she hated both the plains and the plainness of the Midwest, greedily devouring The New Yorker magazine as if it were ''an escape manual.''         She attended the Art Institute of Chicago, specializing in watercolors and photography. She followed a fellow student, Julian C. Dowell, to New York and married him. Their honeymoon consisted of a nickel ride on the Fifth Avenue bus. They and their friends would hold spaghetti parties to which each person would bring a can of pasta to throw into the kettle.         With Mr. Dowell unemployed at the depths of the Depression, his wife looked in the mirror and saw what just might be a bankable asset. She flipped through a directory of fashion photographers and under the B's, spotted one named Erwin Blumenfeld. He shot some test pictures and sent them to Vogue, and Miss Carlson went to work.         ''It was so amazing,'' she later told Cover Girl. ''The first 28 days, I made $1,500,'' the equivalent of about $13,500 in today's money.         Mr. Blumenfeld said this was not all good news. He told her the pressures of the stratospheric career she could easily have might damage her marriage. Mr. Dowell, who envisioned her as a movie star, said she must do it, their son, William, said.         Soon they were living in different worlds. She was a regular at the Stork Club in a veiled hat and white gloves, while he found work as an art director. He moved to the suburbs, she stayed in Manhattan, and they were divorced.         She had not started modeling until her late 20's, but she quickly became a regular in both the fashion and general press. A picture in Life showed her striding down Park Avenue carrying a hatbox, then ''the symbol of the model's trade,'' as the caption read. An Avedon photograph in Vogue showed her ''wrapped in a cloud of red fox against black.''         She sometimes veered beyond fashion, once escorting a sheep around the country for a wool dealers' group. She was the Drene Girl, showing off her voluminous hair for Drene shampoo.         To enliven her expression, she always conversed with an imaginary friend as she was photographed. ''That way I just naturally warm up,'' she said.         Cover Girl reported, ''Photographers with whom Lily works tease her about this. 'Well, Lily,' they say, 'who will it be today . . . Julian, Joe or John?' '' Mrs. Ford said this is wrong. It was always John. She has no idea why.         In 1955, Miss Carlson married David A. Schulte, a financier who advised presidents on employment policy and still serves on the New York City Board of Corrections. Her new affluence allowed her to leave modeling and spend more time taking pictures herself. Her work appeared in Life, Look and other magazines.         The two would have been jet-setters had they not preferred the staterooms of luxury ocean liners. They spent almost half their lives in Europe, always staying at the Cipriani in Venice, the Ritz in Paris. At the Ritz several years ago, Mrs. Schulte spotted Richard Avedon and shyly approached to ask if he remembered her. He did.         But her son described a woman who furnished her elegant apartment with things she bought at flea markets.         In addition to her husband, her son and her daughter Christina, she is survived by another daughter, Holly Schulte Ellison, and four grandchildren, all of Manhattan.         At her funeral on Monday, there were mountains of white roses and white lilies. Ms. Fleur told of the time at age 8 or 9 that she was caught with her mother in a downpour. Yellow cabs were whizzing by, but you would have had a better chance of catching a snowball somewhere very hot. Suddenly, a cab screeched to a stop directly in front of Miss Carlson.         ''I saw you standing there,'' the driver said.       
         Libertad Lamarque Bouza, a singer and actress whose career ranged from the gritty days of early tango recordings in Argentina to the contemporary daily soap operas produced for mass audiences in the Spanish-speaking world, died on Dec. 12 in Mexico City. She was 92.         Ms. Lamarque gained renown after leaving Argentina for Mexico in 1946, following an incident on the Buenos Aires set of the 1944 movie ''The Circus Procession.'' She was said to have quarreled with a young actress named Eva Duarte.         The next year Duarte married Col. Juan Domingo Peron, and in 1946, Peron became president of Argentina. Exercising her power as first lady, Eva Duarte Peron effectively prevented any studio in Argentina from hiring Ms. Lamarque.         After she moved to Mexico City in the 1940's, during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, Ms. Lamarque's career blossomed. She acted in the first film that the Spanish director Luis Bunuel made in Mexico, ''The Great Casino,'' and appeared in some 60 other films.         ''Strangely, even with a strong Argentine accent that never quite went away, she became the darling of Mexican cinema,'' said Carl Mora, an expert on Latin American film at the University of New Mexico. ''Her magnetic presence made for quite a life trajectory.''         It was in Rosario, the provincial Argentine city where Ms. Lamarque was born, that she began her artistic career. Her father was Gaudencio Lamarque, a Uruguayan descendant of French immigrants and a militant anarchist. Because he was imprisoned at the time of her birth, his daughter was named Libertad, or Liberty. Together with six half-brothers and -sisters, she began acting as a child in plays inspired by anarchist ideas.         In 1926, when Ms. Lamarque turned 18, her family moved to Buenos Aires. She soon found work singing in comedy shows. Then a music studio hired her to record tango songs, and she began to attract attention. Ms. Lamarque also started acting, making her debut in the 1929 silent film ''Adios, Argentina,'' which was made by the Italian director Mario Parpagnoli in a single day. In 1932 she starred in ''Tango,'' Argentina's first sound film.         Ms. Lamarque's first marriage, to Emilio Romero, who worked as a prompter in the theater, turned sour shortly after they exchanged vows in 1928. Still, because divorce was illegal at the time in Argentina, it took Ms. Lamarque 12 years to become legally separated from him.         In 1935 she was reported to have attempted suicide while on tour in Chile. That same year her husband took their daughter, Mirtha, with him to live in neighboring Uruguay. After an effort involving a lawyer and several friends, including Hector Artola, her new romantic partner and future husband, Ms. Lamarque succeeded in gaining custody of her daughter.         While in Argentina, Ms. Lamarque acted in more than 20 movies, including ''Honeysuckle,'' ''When I Return to Your Side'' and ''In This Gray Afternoon.'' But it was in Mexico that she took her place as a leading figure in Latin American cinema, and later in the melodramatic world of daily telenovelas, or soap operas. In later years she divided her time between Mexico City and Miami, but refused to retire.         Earlier this year the Mexican Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences awarded her a lifetime achievement award. At the time of her death she was playing a Mother Superior in ''Angelface,'' a popular telenovela.         Ms. Lamarque is survived by her daughter, Mirtha Romero Lamarque, of Argentina.       
         Pat Kauffman, whose blindness inspired her to help thousands of other blind people attend theatrical performances at no cost and with no fuss, died on Nov. 24 in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 76.         Ms. Kauffman's sense of mission began with an embarrassing experience at the theater, her daughter Dorothy Kauffman said.         Ms. Kauffman told her daughter that she was walking into a Broadway theater in the early 60's with a group of blind people when one of the group's leaders called out for ''all the blind people to put their hands on the shoulder of the blind person in front of them'' as they moved to their seats. That occasion was the first time Ms. Kauffman had visited the theater since becoming permanently blind four or five years earlier.         The request made Ms. Kauffman  feel like a member of a chain gang, she recalled. ''I died a thousand deaths that night,'' she told Dorothy many times over the years, always in the exactly the same words. She thought it was wrong to even acknowledge someone's blindness, much less call attention to it.         Her first reaction to becoming irreversibly blind in her mid-30's had been to stop attending cultural events altogether. But her daughter said the unpleasant incident did not plunge her into further despair, but rather made her angry. The next day, she began her mission of creating a way for blind people to attend cultural events with greater dignity.         Eventually, she developed a way for them to go to a range of cultural events, from City Center Theater, the opera and ballet center that preceded Lincoln Center, to Carnegie Hall to small Off Broadway theaters.         The core of her program was to allow each blind person to invite a sighted companion free of charge, either someone of his choice or a volunteer from a list, so thatdescriptions could be shared discreetly.         Her organization, Entertainment for the Blind, began arranging tickets to cultural events in the early 1960's. It usually had several hundred members and a long waiting list, and depended on donations of tickets and money, as well as volunteer help in raising money and assisting blind people at shows.         Ms. Kauffman worked the phone relentlessly from her apartment in High Bridge, the Bronx, often sitting in a rocking chair for 12 hours. She memorized thousands of telephone numbers, developing a network of box offices, ticket agencies and theatrical agencies, always looking for tickets in groups of at least two.         She learned early to spot opportunities. If a show was in previews, had received poor notices or had been running for a while, she would offer to fill some seats. She also developed a side business of arranging tickets for corporations, then asking them for cash donationsto her organization or for products that she could give to box-office personnel as gifts.She also built up relationships with Broadway ticket sellers by giving them movie tickets and popcorn coupons and discussing their personal problems with them in the soft, soothing voice that was her most effective tool.         ''I felt like she was one of my closest friends,'' said Lynn Olcese, a treasurer in the Nederlander Organization, a prominent theater operator.''The weird part is that I don't even know what she looked like,'' said Ms. Olcese, who often spoke to Ms. Kauffman on the phone but never met her.         A tall, dark-haired woman always seen in dark glasses, Ms. Kauffman strove to convey an impressive presence, her daughter said. She never referred to herself as blind or disabled and refused to learn Braille.         She was born Pearl Frumkin in Manhattan on June 17, 1924. She never had a middle name and changed her first name to Pat, not Patricia, as a young woman.         She recognized that her eyesight was deteriorating when she thought light bulbs needed to be changed when they didn't. By her early teens, she was reading with a magnifying glass, but still managed thick books like ''Gone With the Wind.''         By her late 20's, cataracts and then detached retinas had taken all her sight. After her marriage to Alan Kauffman ended, she raised their three daughters by herself, putting bells on the slippers of the youngest, Dorothy, to keep track of her.         In addition to Dorothy of Manhattan, Ms. Kauffman is survived by her other daughters, Debra Conigliaro of Rockingham, N.C., and Sherry Holladay of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.         From Ms. Kauffman's perspective, one of the most rewarding aspects of her service was that the blind were able to experience the theater without being identified as blind. Recipients of tickets from Entertainment for the Blind picked them up at the box office under the name Pat Kauffman, and their sighted companions would take them directly to their seats. No one knew.         And no one knew about the energetic woman on the phone. Philip November, a lawyer who now does the organization's legal work, as his father also did, said some who attend Ms. Kauffman's memorial service on Monday at 6 p.m. at Riverside Memorial Chapel in Manhattan ''are going to be astonished Pat was blind.''
