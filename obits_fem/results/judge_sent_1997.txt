Judge Sylvester Ryan of Federal District Court in Manhattan warned her that she could be jailed for contempt of court.
In his opinion, Judge Potter Stewart, who later served on the United States Supreme Court, conceded that ''compulsory disclosure of a journalist's confidential sources of information may entail an abridgment of press freedom.

''She was a happy judge,'' he said.

        An obituary in some editions yesterday about Marie M. Lambert, a Surrogate Court judge in Manhattan, omitted a word and thus misstated her position in a case involving a bequest to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
''
        She was regarded as a judge who could compel rancorous cases to settle by sheer dint of her will.
''She was a happy judge,'' he said.
She served as chief yeoman in the Navy in World War I and as a judge advocate in the Army in World War II, taught school in Puerto Rico, ran a flying school, turned out columns for The New York World, wrote half a dozen books, founded The Murray Hills News, represented celebrated murder defendants, ran repeatedly for Congress, corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, feuded with Eleanor Roosevelt, hobnobbed with the King of Greece, turned down marriage proposals from Harry K. Thaw and Fiorello H. La Guardia, and so clouded the issue of her age that even her own family is not sure if she was 99 or 103.

        Florence M. Kelley, the first administrative judge of the modern Family Court in New York City and an advocate for the legal rights of the poor, died last Saturday at her home in Little Compton, R.I. She was 85.
Judge Kelley presided over the notoriously overworked court during an era of great reform.
In 1960, she became the first woman to be chief judge of what was then the Domestic Relations Court of New York City.
''
        In 1962, when the court was reconfigured as the new Family Court of the State of New York, within the City of New York, with jurisdiction over a range of social problems, she became administrative judge.
A slim, gracious woman, Judge Kelley was ladylike in her manner but decisive and stubborn in her role as a visionary administrator.
Judge Kelley pressed for more judges, psychiatric evaluations for clients and probation services for juveniles.
Her dedication to legal and social services for the poor was a family heritage: her grandmother, for whom she was named, was one of the first women lawyers in the country and the founder of the National Consumers League, an advocates' group for which Judge Kelley worked.
Born in Manhattan, Judge Kelley graduated from Smith College and Yale Law School.
In the 1930's and 40's, women prosecutors were a a rare sight in the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, where Judge Kelley worked under Thomas E. Dewey and Frank S. Hogan.
''
        In 1970, Judge Kelley became a trial judge of the Supreme Court of New York, serving until her retirement in 1980.

        Harriett R. Taylor, a senior judge of the District of Columbia Superior Court whose actions helped to ease conditions for Washington's poor and homeless, died on Monday at her home in Washington.
Judge Taylor, in a special weekend session in 1989, mandated thorough changes for Washington's homeless shelters, including the addition of 50 beds and an overhaul of safety and sanitation.
Judge Taylor found that while both parents ''clearly love their children very much'' the father was doing the better job of balancing career and family obligations.
She practiced family and labor law in New York and Washington before becoming the District's first administrative law judge in 1976, working in the newly formed Office of Consumer Protection.
With a strong interest in legal education, she took part in the Trial Advocacy Workshop at Harvard University and played the judge in many high school and college moot court competitions.
Judge Taylor is survived by her husband, William L., a civil rights lawyer; two daughters, Lauren Taylor of Silver Spring, Md., and Debbie Taylor of San Francisco; a son, David Van Taylor of Brooklyn; her mother, Alice Rosen, also of Brooklyn; a sister, Carole Lachman of Staten Island, and a granddaughter.
      
She was known as Judge Lucy, a sobriquet that stuck after she was appointed a United States Commissioner -- or magistrate -- for the Southern Judicial District of Mississippi in 1927.
''
        Back home, she earned her law degree with highest honors at the University of Mississippi in 1922 and practiced law until her appointment as Judge Lucy five years later.
The presiding judge, Maj. Gen. H. P. M. Berney-Ficklin, asked her to go to the center of the courtroom to get a better view of the accused, who were restless under the glare of floodlights.

        After Shira A. Scheindlin was appointed to the Federal District Court in Manhattan a few years ago, she told an interviewer for a legal newspaper that she expected to be more of a ''settling judge than a brilliant opinion writer.
''
        But in case after case these days, Judge Scheindlin seems to be making a name for herself through the incisive, often witty opinions she writes as well as the striking decisions they contain.
'' Judge Scheindlin wrote, going out of her way to cite Mr. Giuliani's daily presence in the local newspapers and his appearance in drag last month on ''Saturday Night Live.
Mr. Morgenthau's senior aides had asked Judge Scheindlin to block Ms. White's prosecutors from completing a plea agreement in a stock trading case that Mr. Morgenthau had initiated.
''This is a dispute between your bosses,'' the judge said, ruling against Mr. Morgenthau's prosecutors.
''
        The judge behind these rulings is a 51-year-old with a master's degree in Chinese history from Columbia University and a law degree from Cornell.
''The only answer I can say is that there have been wonderful issues that just begged to be addressed,'' said Judge Scheindlin (pronounced SHEND-lin) during an interview in her 10th-floor chambers in the Federal courthouse in lower Manhattan.
''
        Last January, after she suppressed evidence in a case and questioned a program in which the police stopped and searched taxicabs, Mr. Giuliani declared that Judge Scheindlin did not care as much for ''the rights of victims and potential victims as accused criminals.
''
        As for the taxicab search ruling, Matthew E. Fishbein, a senior Federal prosecutor at the time, said that although Judge Scheindlin rejected the Government's position in the case, ''the degree of criticism directed at her was in my view excessive and unfair.
''
        Judge Scheindlin will not discuss individual cases, but says she can live with the criticism.
''
        Judge Scheindlin, the daughter of a Russian immigrant and his American wife, was born in Washington.
After graduating, she was a clerk for Judge Charles L. Brieant in Federal District Court in Manhattan, who remembers her as someone who ''got to the point.
''
        ''Her logic and her thinking are just without parallel,'' Judge Brieant said.
In personal conversations, the judge laces her comments with a puckish humor and a bright laugh.
''I doubt that it is really going to take half a minute,'' Judge Scheindlin said.
Ronald L. Kuby, the criminal defense lawyer known for his passionate advocacy and, at times, his loquaciousness in the courtroom, said he had been chastised by Judge Scheindlin, but rightly so.
''
        The judge, in an interview, acknowledged that her style can be quite direct.
