         Bidu Sayao, a Brazilian soprano whose gossamer voice and vivacious personality made her one of the most popular stars of the Metropolitan Opera from the late 1930's through the 40's, died yesterday at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport, Me. She was 94 and lived in Lincolnville, Me.         The diminutive Miss Sayao, restricted by her small voice to the lyric and coloratura repertory, often expressed regret that she could not sing such heavier roles as Tosca and Butterfly. But her interpretations of Manon, Violetta in ''La Traviata,'' Mimi in ''La Boheme'' and Susanna in ''Le Nozze di Figaro,'' among other roles, received consistent praise, with critics stressing her expressiveness, sensibility, girlishness and excellence of phrasing.         Balduina de Oliveira Sayao was born on May 11, 1902, into a wealthy family in Rio de Janeiro. Although her childhood dramatizations in front of a mirror convinced her that she had a future as an actress, the family conviction that it was a metier for loose women dashed that hope. Piano lessons, too, were a decided failure, but when she was 13 a music-loving uncle helped arrange lessons with a celebrated former soprano, Elena Theodorini.         After several years of study and  appearances at the court of Romania, her teacher's native country, Miss Sayao studied recital repertory in France with the tenor Jean de Reszke. An eventual audition in Rome led to an engagement as Rosina in ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia,'' and by her late 20's she had sung at many opera houses in Europe and South America.         In a review of her first performance in the United States, a Town Hall recital on Dec. 30, 1935, Noel Strauss of The New York Times wrote that Miss Sayao's voice ''if light, was one of pronounced sweetness; silky and caressing when used at its best.''         Soon afterward, Arturo Toscanini, who was preparing an all-Debussy program for the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra -- precursor of the New York Philharmonic -- engaged the young soprano whose years in France had perfected her pronunciation, and gave her one week to learn ''La Demoiselle Elue.'' A short time later the Metropolitan Opera, which had recently lost Lucrezia Bori, a stalwart of French repertory, to retirement, invited Miss Sayao to sing the title role in ''Manon'' in February 1937.         In The Times, Olin Downes wrote of the debut, ''Miss Sayao triumphed as a Manon should, by manners, youth and charm, and secondly by the way in which the voice became the vehicle of dramatic expression.'' The singer never again left the Western Hemisphere. The Met was her base, the San Francisco Opera her alternate headquarters and South America the only foreign territory to hear her in live performance.         A month after her first Met ''Manon,'' Miss Sayao sang the lead role in ''La Traviata.'' Two weeks later she sang her first ''Boheme'' in the house, and Howard Taubman wrote in The Times that she sang with ''freshness and simplicity.''         In all, the soprano sang more than 200 performances of 12 different roles at the Metropolitan. She made several opera and song recordings and gave many recitals. In December 1943 she and the baritone Lawrence Tibbett were soloists with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Artur Rodzinski for the inaugural concert at the City Center of Music and Drama. The United States Government decorated her for her many performances in Army camps and hospitals during World War II.         Miss Sayao resigned from the Metropolitan Opera in April 1952, a month before her 50th birthday. ''I am proud, and I did not want to wait until I was asked to leave,'' she said in an interview in 1987. And in 1957 after a performance of ''La Demoiselle Elue,'' which seemed to bring her career full circle, she abruptly retired, canceling many engagements for subsequent seasons. She told an interviewer years later that it was hard to stop but that being able to smoke again was a pleasure.         The soprano's first marriage, to the Italian impresario Walter Mocchi, who headed the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires for a time, ended in divorce. She and the baritone Giuseppe Danise were married in 1947, and he gave up his career to manage hers.         After her husband's death in 1963, she divided her time between the Salisbury Hotel in Manhattan and her home in Lincolnville. She was  often seen at vocal events in New York City, a tiny woman in high heels, her reddish hair pulled back in the chignon familiar to several decades of opera fans.         On a Metropolitan Opera broadcast in December 1989, the soprano plaintively gave a personal summation of her career: ''I had something appealing, I don't know what. The sincerity of my singing. I give my heart. I give my soul. I give myself.''         Correction:  March 16, 1999, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary of the Brazilian soprano Bidu Sayao on Saturday misstated her age. She was 96, not 94. The obituary also omitted Ms. Sayao's most celebrated recording. The piece, ''Bachiana Brasileira No. 5,'' is a vocalise -- an aria without words -- transcribed for her by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos.       
         Lucienne Bloch, an acclaimed muralist whose most significant contribution to art may have been a series of surreptitious photographs she took in 1933, died on March 13 at her home in Gualala, Calif. She was 90.         She was the photographer whose sneak pictures taken behind enemy lines on May, 8, 1933, are the sole visual record of the great Diego Rivera's ill-fated Rockefeller Center fresco with its doomed depiction of Lenin.         At a time of economic distress, when capitalism itself seemed vulnerable to competing currents of social change, if anybody was going to pin Lenin on a capitalist wall it was Diego Rivera, the fiery Mexican muralist whose artistic acclaim was matched only by his reputation as a fiercely committed, if renegade, Communist.         If anybody was going to stop him it was John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s son, Nelson A. Rockefeller, who had commissioned Rivera to paint a 1,000-square-foot fresco, ''Man at the Crossroads,'' in the great hall of the new RCA Building, the soaring Rockefeller Center capstone now known as the G.E. Building and at the time an especially potent symbol of capitalism.         Sure enough, when it became apparent that Rivera was intent on portraying Lenin as a charismatic leader, Rockefeller asked him to substitute an anonymous figure, and Rivera refused.         Realizing his work was doomed, Rivera hired a photographer to take pictures of the mural, but Rockefeller, determined that there be no record of what the family regarded as desecration of their property, had guards at the building thwart the effort.         Aware that the mural would be sealed off the next day, the Rockefellers could be complacent, but only because they had not reckoned on  Miss Bloch, an unpaid Rivera assistant who seemed an unlikely foot soldier in his anti-capitalist cause.         A Geneva-born daughter of the celebrated Swiss composer, Ernst Bloch, she was a child of privilege who had come to the United States with her family in 1917 and lived in Cleveland until 1925, when her father became director of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and her mother, aware that the composer would be comforted by mistresses, took her children to Paris.         There, Miss Bloch studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and made a yearlong side trip to the Netherlands, studying at the Leerdam glass works and turning out such impressive glass sculptures that she had a one-woman show in New York in 1931 and was invited by Frank Lloyd Wright to teach at his Wisconsin school.         By then, however, she had become fascinated by another art. Shortly after her arrival in New York in 1931, she was invited to a banquet honoring Rivera in connection with his famous one-man show at the Museum of Modern Art. Largely because Rivera spoke little English and no one else spoke Spanish, the 22-year-old Miss Bloch, who spoke French, a language Rivera also knew, was seated next to the great man.         During their animated conversation, a dark-haired woman came up behind Miss Bloch and said, ''I hate you,'' a comment of such disarming candor that Miss Bloch burst out laughing. The woman was Rivera's wife, the tortured artist Frida Kahlo, whose husband's philandering gave her reason to fear the worst, but not, as it happened, from Miss Bloch.         As the the daughter of a womanizing father, Miss Bloch made clear, she had no designs on Kahlo's womanizing husband, a pledge that laid the groundwork for a remarkable friendship.         Over the next few years, Miss Bloch worked on Rivera's controversial mural at the Detroit Institute of Art and on the Rockefeller Center project, along the way falling in love with the artist's chief plasterer, Stephen P. Dimitroff, a young Bulgarian immigrant, and immortalizing their romance in lyrical passages in her diary, which a granddaughter, Lucienne Allen, plans to use as the basis for a book.         The couple, who eventually married, became an artistic team, he handling the plaster and she the painting for frescoes all over the country, including her most acclaimed work, ''The Evolution of Music,'' at George Washington High School in upper Manhattan.         They lived for a time in Flint, Mich., where he became a union organizer and she photographed strikes for Life and other publications, before eventually moving to Mill Valley, Calif., where Mr. Dimitroff, who died in 1996, operated a frame shop until the couple retired to Gualala in 1965.         After a lifetime devoted to art, including wide-ranging sculptures in glass, wood and terra cotta and a famous series of photographs of Kahlo, Miss Bloch is nevertheless largely recalled for her association with another artist's work, but, then, the artist was Rivera, widely regarded as a 20th century giant, and her photographs are all that remain of his most famous work.         For that, Miss Bloch, who is survived by two sons, George Ernst Dimitroff of Tumwater, Wash., and Pancho Dimitroff of Aurora, Colo; a daughter, Sita Milchev, of Gualala; a sister, Suzanne Bloch Smith of New York; 8 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren, had only herself to blame.         It was she, after all, on the night after Rivera's hired photographer had been thwarted, who slipped a camera under her blouse and walked boldly into the RCA building with Mr. Dimitroff and Kahlo, who distracted the guards while Miss Bloch climbed up on the scaffold and proceeded to photograph the mural.         The next day, in what has been likened to a military operation, the mural was shrouded from public view.         Nine months later, after the resulting furor had subsided, it was scraped into oblivion -- almost.         Rivera did a copy in Mexico City, complete with Lenin, but it is only Miss Bloch's photographs that show it as it was -- on a Rockefeller wall.         Correction:  April 6, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary of the muralist Lucienne Bloch on March 28 misspelled the given name of her father. He was Ernest Bloch, not Ernst.       
         Melba Liston, a trombonist and arranger who worked with some of the best bands in jazz, died on Friday after a series of strokes, said a friend, the pianist Randy Weston. She was 73 and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Liston is best known for her collaborations with Mr. Weston, including the ambitious African-influenced works ''High Life'' and ''Uhuru Afrika'' from the early 1960's. On those albums she created dense harmonies to place over the percussion that Mr. Weston was using. She made his pieces, often harmonically simple, thick with dissonances and meaning.         Ms. Liston stopped playing in 1985 after a stroke left her partially paralyzed, but she continued to arrange music with Mr. Weston. Their collaboration continued into the 1990's, and included work on Mr. Weston's ''Spirits of Our Ancestors'' (1992) and ''Volcano Blues'' (1993).         Ms. Liston came to prominence in jazz in 1943, when she joined the arranger and composer Gerald Wilson's band in Los Angeles. She recorded with the tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon in 1947 (he dedicated the tune ''Mischievous Lady'' to her) and a year later she began working with Dizzy Gillespie and his orchestra. In 1957 she took what might be her most famous improvisation on record, on Gillespie's ''Cool Breeze,'' from ''Dizzy Gillespie at Newport.''         A few years earlier she had dropped out of music, working in clerical jobs and as a film extra. She had small parts in ''The Prodigal''and ''The 10 Commandments.''         When she returned to music she worked with Gillespie and with Quincy Jones, who was the music director of the television show ''Free and Easy.'' In the 1960's she worked with Mr. Weston, and during the 1970's she taught in Jamaica at the University of the West Indies and the Jamaica Institute of Music. She returned to the United States in the early 1980's.         Her later work for Mr. Weston is as dramatic as her early pieces, and on ''Volcano Blues'' she produces some shocking orchestral colors. At one of Mr. Weston's concerts at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last year, her presence brought the audience to its feet.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Maria Stader, a soprano who was best known for the elegance of her Mozart performances, died on Tuesday in Zurich, The Associated Press reported. She was 87 and lived in Zurich.         Ms. Stader made several operatic appearances, most notably as the Queen of the Night in a Covent Garden staging of Mozart's ''Magic Flute,'' a work she also recorded with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Ernst Haefliger. She also made a highly praised recording of Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice.'' But she generally preferred the concert repertory.         Mozart's florid ''Exsultate, Jubilate'' was a particular specialty, and she performed it frequently in New York. It was the vehicle for her New York debut in 1954, as a soloist with the Little Orchestra Society, and she sang it with the New York Philharmonic (under George Szell) in 1964 and at the first Mostly Mozart Festival in 1966. Her performances of Mozart concert arias and her solos in the composer's Masses were also highly regarded. In addition to Mozart, Ms. Stader's repertory included works of Alessandro Scarlatti, Gluck, Bruckner and Mahler.         Ms. Stader was born in Budapest in 1911, but was reared in Switzerland by adoptive parents after she was orphaned during World War I. She began her musical studies in Zurich, and continued them with Hans Keller in Karlsruhe, Germany, and with teachers in Milan and New York. When she won the Geneva International Competition in 1939, the prize was to have included performances in Europe. The tour was canceled after the outbreak of World War II. Ms. Stader remained in Switzerland and finally began her international career in the late 1940's. In 1950 and 1965 she was awarded the Lilli Lehmann Medal for outstanding artistic achievement by the Salzburg Mozarteum.         When she retired from the concert stage in 1969 -- her farewell performance was as a soloist in the Mozart Requiem in New York -- she was still in superb vocal form, but told interviewers that she preferred to leave the stage before she began reading that her voice was not what it was. She was by then married to Hans Erismann, with whom she had two sons.         After she stopped singing, Ms. Stader devoted herself to teaching, principally in Zurich. She wrote a book on Bach arias and an autobiography, ''Nehmt Meinen Dank'' (''Accept My Thanks'').       
         Claudette Sorel, a pianist who was at her best in music that demanded delicacy and lyricism but who also gave highly regarded performances of difficult contemporary works and big Romantic showpieces, died on Friday at her home in Hampton Bays, N.Y. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for the J. Ronald Scott Funeral Home in Hampton Bays.         Ms. Sorel was born in Paris in 1932, and was already a promising pianist when her family fled France just before the German invasion in 1940. When her family settled in New York, Ms. Sorel became a student of the Hungarian concert pianist Sari Biro. In 1942 she received a scholarship to the Juilliard School, where she studied with Olga Samaroff.         After a year at Juilliard, Ms. Sorel made her recital debut at Town Hall at age 11. Noel Straus, reviewing the concert in The New York Times, wrote of her performance of a Mendelssohn Etude that ''a child capable of so polished and eloquent an example of pianism has a future worth watching.''         With Samaroff's encouragement she performed regularly in recitals and as an orchestral soloist. Once Samaroff arranged for her to play the Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 3, a work she had never studied, on a week's notice. She performed several times in the New York Philharmonic's youth concerts before making her formal debut with the orchestra, at age 17, with the MacDowell Piano Concerto No. 2.         As her career progressed, she continued her studies. After Samaroff's death in 1948 she enrolled at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she studied with Rudolf Serkin and Mieczyslaw Horszowski. She received an artist's diploma from Curtis in 1953 and a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Columbia University the same year.         During the 1940's and 50's Ms. Sorel toured as a soloist, often including on her programs works written for her by American composers, among them Lukas Foss, Howard Hanson, Paul Creston and Peter Mennin. Her last performance in New York was a 1973 recital at Alice Tully Hall devoted entirely to music by Rachmaninoff, in honor of the centenary of his birth. Included on the program were two previously unknown Nocturnes that Rachmaninoff composed when he was 14. Ms. Sorel had discovered them while researching the composer at the Moscow Conservatory. She edited the published versions of the works.         A fall on an icy sidewalk in 1974 ended her performing career. But Ms. Sorel, who had no immediate survivors, was established as a teacher by then. She taught at the  University of Kansas, Ohio State University and the State University of New York at Fredonia.         Besides the Rachmaninoff works, Ms. Sorel edited some of Arensky's piano works for publication. She also published several books for pianists, including ''A Compendium of Piano Technique,'' ''17 Little Piano Studies'' and ''Mind Your Musical Manners.'' Recently she edited ''From Madam: Selected Writings of Olga Samaroff Stokowski From Her Years at the Juilliard School.''       
         Irene Heskes, a historian and author who specialized in sacred and secular Jewish music, including music of the Yiddish theater, died on Thursday at Long Island Jewish Hospital. She was 76 and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         The cause was aplastic anemia, said Dr. Alan M. Kraut, her son-in-law.         Ms. Heskes was born in Brooklyn and studied music and history at New York University, voice and piano at the Juilliard School, music education at the Eastman School of Music and arts administration at Harvard. She completed her studies of Jewish music at the School of Sacred Music at Hebrew Union College and the Cantors Institute at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         Because she studied cantorial music in the 1950's, long before cantorial positions were available to women, Ms. Heskes worked as a researcher, writer and lecturer for the Theodor Herzl Institute of the Jewish Agency from 1964 to 1976. She was also the director of the National Jewish Music Council from 1968 to 1980 and a consultant to the American Jewish Historical Society and to libraries and academic institutions.         In 1980 Ms. Heskes founded the American Yiddish Theater Music Restoration and Revival Project. Under her direction the project assembled, catalogued and microfilmed a comprehensive collection of Yiddish theater music, which is now available for study at the Library of Congress. In 1992 the library published Ms. Heskes's annotated catalogue and resource book based on the collection.         Ms. Heskes also wrote extensively about Jewish music for academic publications and Jewish newspapers and magazines, and she wrote several books that covered the expanse of Jewish composition, including ''The Cantorial Art'' (1966); ''Ernest Bloch: Creative Spirit,'' with Suzanne Bloch, the composer's daughter (1976); ''The Resource Book of Jewish Music'' (1985); ''The Music of Abraham Goldfaden: Father of the Yiddish Theater'' (1990); ''Yiddish American Popular Songs, 1895 to 1950'' (1992), and ''Passport to Jewish Music: Its History, Traditions and Culture'' (1994). At the time of her death she was working on another book, ''Yiddish-American Music: Melodies of Immigration, Acculturation and Assimilation.''         Ms. Heskes is survived by her husband, Jacob Heskes; a daughter, Deborah Aviva Kraut of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Walter Morris Heskes of Edison, N.J., a granddaughter and two grandsons.         Correction:  October 20, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary yesterday about Irene Heskes, an author and music historian, omitted a survivor. He is her brother, Lawrence Newman of Niskayuna, N.Y.       
         Marie-Madeleine Durufle, an internationally renowned organist and teacher and the widow of the French composer and organist Maurice Durufle, died on Oct. 5 in Paris, where she lived. She was 78.         Mrs. Durufle, a technically formidable organist, was generally considered the last great exponent of the French Romantic school of organ playing, which valued elegant grandeur, textural clarity and rhythmic freedom. She gave incomparable performances of works by the French organ masters, including Charles-Marie Widor, Louis Vierne, Jean Langlais, Marcel Dupre and her husband, who died 13 years ago. She was a tireless champion of his organ works, which were harmonically conservative yet mystical, finely crafted and often brilliant.         She was born Marie-Madeleine Chevalier in Marseilles on May 8, 1921, and her prodigious gifts were soon apparent. At 11 she was named an organist of the Cathedral of St. Veran de Cavaillon, and at 12 she entered the conservatory at Avignon. Her desire to pursue advanced studies was delayed by the outbreak of World War II. Finally, in 1946, at 25, she became a pupil of Dupre at the Paris Conservatory, where she won the first prize in organ. In 1953 she was awarded the Gran Prix International Charles-Marie Widor for organ and improvisation.         She met her future husband at the conservatory when he substituted as a teacher one year for Dupre. The introverted and serious Maurice Durufle was drawn to the extroverted, bubbly Ms. Chevalier, who was nearly 20 years younger than he. They were married in 1953. Mrs. Durufle became the co-organist with her husband at St. Etienne-du-Mont in Paris, a post he had held himself since 1930. They gave joint concert tours frequently, their first visit to the United States coming in 1964.         In 1975, as they drove one evening in southeastern France in heavy rain, a speeding car traveling in the opposite direction crashed into their vehicle. Mrs. Durufle suffered severe pelvic and rib injuries and both of her husband's legs were broken. Years of surgery and physical therapy followed, but neither she nor her husband ever completely recovered.         Mrs. Durufle is survived by her sister, Elaine Chevalier, a solfege teacher and choral conductor in Paris.         In 1989, three years after her husband's death, not having performed in concert for 15 years, Mrs. Durufle agreed to participate in a Durufle Festival in New York organized by her former student, Dennis Keene, the organist, conductor and artistic director of Voices of Ascension.         ''All of the musicians and singers involved in the festival were overwhelmed by Madame's positive glow,'' Mr. Keene said, recalling that event. Her last public concert, he said, was in New York at the Church of the Ascension in 1993.         During her joint tours with her husband, before the accident, Mrs. Durufle tended to play the flashier pieces. In an interview with The New York Times in 1989 she conceded that this was intentional. ''My husband was a very great virtuoso at the organ,'' she said, ''but once he became my husband, I worked at it more than he did. Often he would say to me, 'You play the most difficult pieces, and I play the 'interpretation' pieces.' ''
