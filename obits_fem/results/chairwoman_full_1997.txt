         Herta Lande Seidman, who headed two philanthropic foundations and was a former senior trade official in the Carter Administration, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center of pancreatic cancer, her family said. She was 58.         Ms. Seidman, who had lived in Manhattan since 1960, was chairwoman of two philanthropies financed by the investor George Soros: the East-West Management Institute and Soros Management Training Programs. Both organizations teach modern business practices to entrepreneurs and government officials in 21 countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.         Born in 1939 in Cermauti, Romania, Ms. Seidman was one of the very few Romanian Jews who survived the Nazi occupation, escaping confinement in the death camps after her mother bribed a Nazi official, a cousin, Rabbi Moshe Handelsman of Brooklyn, said yesterday.         ''Her mother, Pepi Lande, was a very courageous lady who went up to the colonel of the Gestapo and asked him that he should give her a paper that she and her daughter and her parents should be able to stay and not go to the camps,'' Rabbi Handelsman said.         The colonel approved the request in the summer of 1941 after being given a fur coat and the equivalent of $80,000 in cash.         After the war, the family left Romania, going to Belgium, France and Canada before reaching the United States.         Ms. Seidman got a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Miami in 1959. The following year she earned a master's degree in economics at Cornell University.         She worked on Wall Street in mergers and international trade from 1963 to 1976, when Gov. Hugh Carey appointed her deputy commissioner of the State Department of Commerce and assigned her to attract foreign investment.         In early 1979, on a trip to Russia as a state trade official, family members and friends said, she visited Jewish refuseniks in Kiev and was detained for a day by the K.G.B. in an incident that received wide attention.         In 1980, President Carter appointed Ms. Seidman Assistant Secretary for Trade in the United States Commerce Department, a post she held until 1981.         She then returned to Wall Street, working on commodity and financial transactions, mostly in Eastern Europe and Russia, for Phibro and then Salomon Brothers, until 1986. That year, she became president of the Tradenet Corporation, developing computer finance and training systems.         She became Tradenet's chairwoman in 1990, a post she held while also working as an executive with several Soros foundations.         Ms. Seidman is survived by her husband, Samuel N. Seidman.       
         Ursula Niebuhr, the founder and longtime chairwoman of the department of religion at Barnard College, died on Friday at her home in Stockbridge, Mass. She was 89 and the widow of the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr.         Although she was clearly upstaged by her renowned husband, who taught at the Union Theological Seminary, Mrs. Niebuhr's own scholarship was so well regarded that in the 1940's she was asked by the president of Barnard to create a department of religion there. She accepted and remained as associate professor and department chairwoman until her retirement two decades later.         A native of Southampton, England, she was sent to Oxford to study at St. Hugh's College, then regarded as little more than a glorified finishing school. She enhanced its reputation considerably when she graduated with honors in history and theology and became the first woman to win a fellowship to the Union Theological Seminary in New York.         When a friend proposed to introduce her to Mr. Niebuhr, a faculty member, she was skeptical, her daughter, Elizabeth Sifton, recalled yesterday. ''Oh, no,'' the friend said, ''you'll love him,'' and she did.         They were married in 1931, embarking on an intellectual and emotional collaboration marked by animated debates that continued until her husband's death in 1971. By then, her daughter noted, their theological differences had dwindled to liturgical quibbles between Mrs. Niebuhr's Episcopalian ideas and her husband's Congregationalist notions.         In the introduction to his last book, Mr. Niebuhr said he could no longer tell where his ideas left off and hers began. After his death, Mrs. Niebuhr returned the favor, editing two collections of his writings.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, Mrs. Niebuhr is survived by a son, Richard, of Stockbridge; a sister, Barbara Moravec of Sutton, England, and three grandsons.         Correction:  January 13, 1997, Monday         An obituary in some editions yesterday about Ursula Niebuhr, the founder of Barnard College's religion department, misstated the given name of her surviving son. He is Christoper, not Richard.       
         Evelyn Payne Davis, a founder of the New York Coalition of 100 Black Women and a former vice president at the Children's Television Workshop, died on Friday at Beth Israel Medical Center. She was 75 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Davis had suffered from lung cancer for a year, said her son, David Payne.         As vice president of the Children's Television Workshop's Community Education Services, Mrs. Davis led efforts to make ''Sesame Street'' known to inner-city parents and children when the program began appearing in 1969.         At that time, before cable, ''Sesame Street'' and other public television shows were typically on hard-to-find UHF channels, Joan Ganz Cooney, a Children's Television Workshop founder, said yesterday.         Because these channels attracted few viewers in poor, urban and rural areas, Mrs. Davis oversaw employees who visited these communities and explained that ''Sesame Street'' was an innovative television experiment that would teach preschoolers about numbers and the alphabet, a sort of televised version of the Head Start program, Ms. Cooney said.         Three years after the program started, surveys showed that the efforts to reach these children had succeeded, Ms. Cooney added.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Davis also helped found the New York Coalition of 100 Black Women, which urged black women to become involved in politics and community affairs. In 1972, she served as its first president.         The coalition's projects included helping young black women establish personal networks and holding voter registration drives on 125th Street in Harlem, said Mary Burke Washington, a co-founder of the coalition and a former chairwoman of the city's Civilian Complaint Review Board.         Born in New Orleans on Dec. 27, 1921, the former Evelyn Aramburo and her family moved to New York when she was a child. She grew up in Harlem, graduated from Hunter High School and attended Hunter College. In the 1960's, she worked in antipoverty programs and also became involved in the New York Urban League.         She was married to Mynor Payne, an electrical engineer, for two decades. He died in 1968. Later, she married Charles Davis.         Working with the Children's Television Workshop, where she served as a consultant after retiring in 1992, Mrs. Davis also helped open scores of children's centers in prisons. The centers offered programs to help prison inmates form better relationships with their visiting children, in part through ''Sesame Street'' and educational games.         ''It's not fair to say to a child, 'Your mother can't hold you,' '' Mrs. Davis said in 1986. ''Kids deserve to see their parents in a setting that doesn't scare them.''         Mrs. Washington, who lived down the hall from Mrs. Davis in a Gramercy Park building for 26 years, said Mrs. Davis was also known to friends for her talents as an entertainer. She played the piano and sang, imitating Billie Holiday. Mrs. Davis could also  play an improvised bass fiddle -- a broom tied to an overturned old-fashioned washtub, Mrs. Washington recalled.         In addition to her son, who lives in New Town, Conn., she is survived by a stepdaughter, Liberty Davis Rashad of Cambridge, Mass., and two granddaughters.       
         Mildred Custin, who built Bonwit Teller into a leading fashion force in the late 1960's by introducing designers such as Pierre Cardin, Andre Courreges, Emanuel Ungaro and Calvin Klein to the American public, died Thursday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 91.         As president and then chairwoman of the 12-store Bonwit chain from 1965 to 1970, Ms. Custin used extensive retailing experience, superb taste and a sense of daring to impart a high-fashion image to what had been a traditional store selling the same clothing women could buy just about anywhere else. She gave some of the hottest names of the swinging 1960's boutiques in the store, and among the labels sold there were Norman Norell, James Galanos, Donald Brooks, Geoffrey Beene, Pauline Trigere and Rudi Gernreich.         Ms. Custin added masses of fresh flowers to Bonwit's flagship store at 721 Fifth Avenue, between 56th and 57th Streets, on the sites now occupied by Trump Tower and Niketown.  She filled the store with a series of boutiques, including the famous S'fari Room for trendy fashion, and turned the 57th Street side into a men's haberdashery.         It was a daring move at the time to try to sell men's wear in what had been strictly a women's specialty store. Ms. Custin offered her customers Cardin's neo-Edwardian silhouette, then considered radical, the first Bill Blass men's wear, Hermes ties from Paris and Turnbull & Asser shirts from London. At Christmas time, men were catered to with special shopping evenings.         Ms. Custin never lacked daring. She believed that women were better than men at the fashion business. ''We are more inclined than they are to take risks,'' she said in a New York Times interview in 1981. ''All women who have reached the top in fashion did it by risking their necks. If I saw something I liked, I'd fill the store with it. I trusted my judgment.''         Among the fortuitous decisions she made was to give Calvin Klein his first order, for $50,000, in 1968. ''I've told that story so many times,'' Mr. Klein recalled yesterday, ''of wheeling the rack of clothes up Fifth Avenue on a Saturday morning. It wasn't even a collection, it was just fall coats and dresses. She was so supportive to me in those early years with things stores don't do anymore, like free advertising.''         ''She was completely hands on,'' he added, ''totally involved in everything from the fresh flowers to the windows to the advertising. She had a little voice but was a very strong lady with a clear strategy and a vision that was very focused.''         She was also among the first merchants to give elaborate parties in the store, starting with a black-tie supper dance to introduce Norman Norell's first perfume in 1968.         Ms. Custin, a petite woman with silvery hair and a soft, little-girl voice, had a reputation for grace and charm, bulwarked by a capacity for working hard and inspiring others to do the same. In her first year at Bonwit's she noted that all the stores were closed on Washington's Birthday while the streets were crowded with pedestrians, all potential customers. So the next year, she convinced her employees to stay open on the holiday, and the people were in the store, not on the street.         She was born in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 25, 1906, and was reared in Boston, where she graduated from Simmons College. She spent 37 years honing her retailing skills before taking the reins at Bonwit's in New York. Her career began in 1928 in the controller's office at R. H. Macy & Company after she was rejected for the executive training program in retailing.         She returned to Boston and worked at Shepard's, a department store that no longer exists, and then at R. H. White's. In 1935, she went to John Wanamaker in Philadelphia, where she worked her way up from gift buyer to a vice presidency.         In 1958, she was named president of Bonwit Teller Philadelphia, a three-store chain that became part of Bonwit Teller New York in 1963. In Philadelphia she secured her reputation by transforming a drab, rundown store into a paragon of good taste by revamping window and interior displays, advertising and merchandising. It was there that she started sending chatty memos to charge customers along with their monthly bills, a practice she continued in New York.         Approaching Bonwit Teller's mandatory retirement age for executives of 65, Ms. Custin retired as chairwoman and started a new career as a consultant to retail and fashion businesses with her friend Jerrie Rosenberg, the former director of public relations for Bonwit's, as vice president.         It was Ms. Custin's involvement as consultant to the Esplanade, a shopping complex in Palm Beach, that led to her moving there in 1979. She ran her business until 1990.         Ms. Custin is survived by two nieces, Joan Custin of New York and Barbara Poverman of Chestnut Hill, Mass., a great-niece and two great-nephews.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice.         She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.         In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.         Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.         Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, ''Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer''.         While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.         During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.         An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.         A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled ''A World to Live In'' from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published ''Twice a Year,'' a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were ''The Selected Writings of John Marin'' (1949); ''Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend'' (1985) and ''Encounters: a Memoir'' (1987). In 1965 she published ''Nehru: The First Sixty Years,'' a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.         In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.         Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Nancy J. Woodhull, the first managing editor for news at USA Today and a champion of women and diversity in the newsroom and in news coverage, died yesterday at her home in Pittsford, N.Y., near Rochester. She was 52.         The cause of death was cancer, said Gene Policinski, a special assistant at the Freedom Forum, where Ms. Woodhull was senior vice president for communications. The Freedom Forum, a nonprofit organization established by the Gannett Company in Arlington, Va., addresses issues involving the First Amendment, free press and free speech.         Ms. Woodhull was also vice chairwoman of the International Women's Media Foundation and chairwoman of the Peabody Radio and Television Awards. She was a former president of the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y., and, with Betty Friedan, a founding chairwoman of Women, Men and Media, a national organization that monitors the coverage of women in the media.         ''A free press in a democracy should reflect all its voices,'' Ms. Woodhull said last year after a survey by Women, Men and Media concluded that although women made up 52 percent of the nation's population, they were the subject of only 15 percent of front-page newspaper articles. ''None should be invisible. The press needs to focus on this trend toward the invisibility of women and their concerns.''         Ms. Woodhull, who was born in Perth Amboy, N.J., attended Trenton State Teachers College before beginning her newspaper career as an editor with The News Tribune in Woodbridge, N.J., in 1964. Later, she was a reporter for The Detroit Free Press and then was managing editor of the Gannett papers in Rochester, The Times-Union and The Democrat and Chronicle.         After serving as managing editor for news when USA Today was started by Gannett in 1982, she became the newspaper's senior editor and then was the president of Gannett New Media and the Gannett News Service. She resigned in 1990 and became executive vice president and editor in chief of the Southern Progress Corporation, an arm of Time Warner, with responsibility for overseeing the editorial direction of the magazines Southern Living, Progressive Farmer, Southern Accents, Travel South and Cooking Light.         In 1992 Ms. Woodhull became a trustee of the Freedom Forum, and in 1996 she became a senior vice president and executive director of the Media Studies Center, a unit of the Freedom Forum that focuses on media issues and journalism research.         Ms. Woodhull is survived by her husband, William Watson, and a daughter, Tennessee Jane Watson, both of Pittsford, and her mother, May Cromwell, of Matawan, N.J.       
         Judy Flannery, a late-blooming athlete who became an unlikely triathlon champion, was killed on Wednesday when she was struck by an automobile while on a bicycle-training ride near Poolesville, Md. A resident of Chevy Chase, she was was 57 and had won six American and four world age-group championships in the sport, which combines running, swimming and cycling.         According to the Montgomery County police, Ms. Flannery, who was nearing the midpoint of a 55-mile training ride with two friends, was killed when a car driven by an unlicensed 16-year-old driver swerved across the center line of the country road. The youth and his 38-year-old father, who was in the front passenger seat, received minor injuries. The police said yesterday that the incident was still under investigation and that no charges had been filed.         A native of Wilmington, Del., who graduated from the College of New Rochelle and worked as a biochemist before starting a family, Ms. Flannery grew up with a trim, athletic build in an age when girls were generally not welcome in athletics.         By the time her own four daughters were growing up, things were changing, especially at the Flannery household. Indeed, Ms. Flannery, who also had a son, spent so much time ferrying her brood to and from one athletic field or another that a daughter described her yesterday as ''the original soccer mom.''         Still, it was not until she was about 38, as she later recalled, that Ms. Flannery decided to find out what she had been missing.         ''I ran around the block,'' she said, and, as it happened, more or less kept on going: within a few years she was running marathons.         She might have stuck with distance running if a friend had not taken her to a triathlon one day. Immediately intrigued, Ms. Flannery, who was particularly attracted to the cycling phase, began training for the triathlon.         She was 47, and many of the women in the sport had been competing for decades, but within four years Ms. Flannery had pulled ahead of those in her age group.         She won the first of her six consecutive national championships in 1991, captured the first of her four world titles in 1992 and was so dominant in the United States that when she placed second last weekend in a race in Birmingham, Ala., the 55-year-old woman who beat her was described as stunned. No wonder. It was Ms. Flannery's first loss in a national age-group competition in six years.         Her proficiency as well as her popularity helps explain why the sport's national governing body, USA Triathlon, named her last month as the Master Female Triathlete of the Year.         A powerful runner who held her own in swimming, Ms. Flannery proved especially adept at cycling, so much so that she won five national age-group titles in time trials.         Although triathlons are staged over a varied combination of distances -- a mile swim, a 25-mile bicycle race and a 6.2-mile run in championship events, for example -- Ms. Flannery did not abandon her old sport of marathoning altogether. She competed three times in the grueling Hawaiian Ironman triathlon, which includes a full, 26.2-mile marathon, once placing second in her age group.         As enthusiastic about her sport as she was proficient in it, Ms. Flannery, a bubbly woman with a perpetual smile, was an accomplished recruiter who charmed thousands of women into taking up the sport while serving as chairwoman of the women's commission of USA Triathlon.         She was also an athlete of such uncommon modesty that she was never known to mention her victories. Those she had befriended and brought into the sport were inevitably startled to learn that the woman who had recruited them was a perennial champion.         For all the time she spent training and competing, Ms. Flannery was a regular volunteer at a local soup kitchen, but when it came to charity she preferred something a bit more robust. At the time of her death, for example, she and three cycling teammates were preparing to raise money to combat domestic violence by taking part in this summer's 3,000-mile Ride Across America.         Ms. Flannery is survived by her husband, Dennis; a son, Dennis, of Washington; four daughters, Erin of Santa Monica, Calif., Kelly of Collegeville, Pa., and Shannon and Megan, both of Washington, and a brother, David Sysko, of Wilmington.       
         Marie Salant Neuberger, a New York foundation executive and philanthropist who was long active in civic affairs, died on Sunday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. She was 88 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and in Peekskill, N.Y.         She suffered a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Neuberger, who took a special interest in the public schools, served several terms as president of the Women's City Club, an organization concerned with urban problems. It studies the quality of government, and life in the city in general, and makes recommendations for improvements.         She was chairwoman of the board of the Ethical Culture Schools for 13 years, having herself graduated from Fieldston, the Ethical Culture Society's preparatory school. She also served as a trustee of Bryn Mawr, her alma mater.         Her husband, Roy R. Neuberger, is a recognized collector of contemporary American artists like Jackson Pollack and Willem de Kooning, and she was active with him in various art institutions. These included the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.         Another prominent beneficiary was the Neuberger Museum of Art, which they helped establish on the campus of the State University of New York at Purchase. Their art collection, deeded to that campus of the university, has been exhibited on loan at museums around this country and in Europe.         Born in Manhattan, Mrs. Neuberger majored in economics at Bryn Mawr on the advice of her father, Aaron B. Salant. After graduation in 1930, she went to work on Wall Street, where she met and married her husband, who became a successful investor and founded the investment management firm of Neuberger & Berman in 1939.         In addition to her husband of 65 years, Mrs. Neuberger is survived by their daughter, Ann N. Aceves of Santa Fe, N.M.; two sons, Roy S., of North Woodmere, N.Y., and James, of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Cardboard boxes clutter the floor of Dr. Mary Hibberd's office here, some filled with files to discard and others bulging with mementos to keep. Her desk is strewn with folders and a hammer and a screwdriver for removing photos from the wood-paneled wall.         Dr. Hibberd, the Suffolk County Health Commissioner, is making an abrupt and highly publicized career change in a life that has never worked out quite the way she planned.         Her pattern was set early, when hopes of becoming a naturalist were thwarted by a graduate program's males-only policy. Since then, her zigzag career as a scientist and pediatrician has taken her to a remote Montana Indian reservation, the squalor of Bangladesh and the poorest neighborhoods of Long Island.         None of it seemed to prepare Dr. Hibberd for the rough and tumble of politics in Suffolk County. She says she was ousted because she would not play patronage games; her detractors disputed her health policies and said she was a poor manager. In any case, by Friday, she will have vacated her office.         As Dr. Hibberd sorted through her things, she said, ''Look -- here's something.'' It was the plaque commemorating her induction in March into the Suffolk County Women's Hall of Fame. Etched at the bottom is the name of County Executive Robert J. Gaffney -- who two months later, without warning, created a committee to search for her successor.         Dr. Hibberd was in Virginia picking up her daughter from college, and found out when she called her answering machine from a pay phone in a Wendy's and heard urgent messages from reporters.         ''It was very painful,'' she recalled. ''I was crying and saying it's not fair -- I'm not there to defend myself. We drove back home in this big line of violent thunderstorms. It seemed like the perfect metaphor.''         Mr. Gaffney said his decision stemmed from a growing rift with Dr. Hibberd over health policies. He also questioned her management skills, saying that her agency had failed to get millions of dollars in state aid, that malpractice expenses were high and that its managed-care system was floundering.         Dr. Hibberd rebutted his complaints, saying, for example, that Suffolk would get all its state aid after the normal lags in claims, payments and budget cycles. But she also mounted a counterattack, saying that the real reason for her removal was that she blocked attempts at  interference by Mr. Gaffney, his top aides, two legislators and others.         Over the years, she said, those officials had tried to foist unqualified but politically connected job candidates on her agency. She said they also tried to force her agency to spend money advertising in a politically connected newspaper and tried to strong-arm her into backing off on smoking regulations to help their business friends.         Dr. Hibberd, 50, a divorced mother of two who is given to quoting Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said she would not give in. ''My duty is to protect the public health, not to engage in politics,'' she said.         Nor did she seem concerned about losing her job. ''I always think God has a plan, even though we don't know it,'' she said.         Dr. Hibberd has a legion of admirers who see her as a Mother Teresa who championed suburbia's invisible needy, and, in the process, cut Suffolk's infant mortality rate by more than 40 percent.         ''Mary is credible, and the rest of them aren't,'' said Maxine Postal, a Democrat and chairwoman of the County Legislature's Health Committee. ''That slim woman has a backbone made of tempered steel. From the person who does the maintenance work right up to the top, they say she's the very best we've ever had.''         Mr. Gaffney and the other officials denied the charges of interference. Mr. Gaffney declined to be interviewed for this article.         Although some people called for an investigation get to the bottom of the dispute, there appears little chance of that. Instead, Dr. Hibberd will start a new job Monday as a senior executive at Ipro, a health-care consulting firm in Lake Success.         Growing up in Upper Darby, Pa., Dr. Hibberd never envisioned that she would some day be at the helm of a $275 million-a-year health agency.         ''It was actually a fluky thing,'' Dr. Hibberd said of her career. Her own requirement was to find something ''that was work I wanted to do and that made a difference.'' After being shut out of the naturalists' program, she earned a master's degree in microbial genetics, then another in human genetics, which led her into medicine.         ''I liked surgery best, but women rarely went into that,'' she said, so she shifted to pediatrics. In nearly five years practicing at the Flathead Indian reservation, she realized the medical toll of social and economic ills. ''I saw a lot of unemployment, alcoholism, fetal alcohol syndrome.''         Her career was transformed again by 10 months as a volunteer in the Care Medico program in Bangladesh. ''People went blind from lack of vitamin A. There was scurvy, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, TB -- all preventable. You could save thousands.''         She earned a master's degree in public health and took a residency in community and preventive health at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. A stint at the Suffolk Health Department prompted a job offer, and she became director of reproductive care for six years. County Executive Patrick Halpin named her acting health commissioner in 1991, and Mr. Gaffney made the appointment permanent.         Many trace her undoing to a dispute four years ago with Suffolk's District Attorney, James Catterson Jr.         She accused Mr. Catterson of threatening to investigate her agency unless she overturned the failing results of a psychological exam given to a son of a longtime associate of his. The son, an investigator in Mr. Catterson's office, needed to pass for authorization to carry a gun.         Perhaps emboldened by Dr. Hibberd, other Republican officials also began to speak out, saying that Mr. Catterson had improperly pressured them on various issues. But he denied all the complaints, and a state inquiry ended with no action taken against him.         ''There's a pattern here of someone who sees things that other people don't,'' Mr. Catterson said in an interview. ''I've never understood her agenda.'' He said Dr. Hibberd had been ''canonized'' by the news media, but he conceded, ''She comes across in private as she does in public, as Mother Teresa, and it's very disarming.''         Her tenacity, however, hardly ingratiated her with Mr. Gaffney. This year she went over his head to the County Legislature to win more funds for her department.         About the last thing to come down from Dr. Hibberd's office wall was a display of 13 color snapshots of beaming mothers and their babies from Project Hope, in which health workers monitor infants through their critical first year.         ''This is one of the programs I started and one of the best things in the department,'' she said. ''So I am definitely taking these pictures. It just makes you feel good.''       
         Mumeo Oku, a pioneer in Japan's consumer movement and an early campaigner for women's rights, died on Monday at her Tokyo home. She was 101.         Mrs. Oku founded the Housewives' Association, one of Japan's first and best-known consumer groups, and remained its leader for decades. She also was one of the first women to serve in Parliament.         ''She opened the way for consumers' movements and consumers' rights in Japan after the war,'' said Teiko Kihara, chairwoman of the Japan League of Women Voters.         The Housewives' Association grew out of a protest over the shoddy quality of matches being rationed by the government in the impoverished days just after World War II. Only one match in 10 would light.         The association went on to protest other poor-quality goods such as clothing that shrank too much and cans labeled beef that were really filled with horse meat or whale. In protest marches, members wore aprons over their kimonos and carried large rice ladles as placards.         Consumer groups, however, never became very powerful in Japan, a nation that sacrificed its consumers' life style to build its industry. The Housewives' Association, which now has 391 local chapters, has sometimes taken positions that seem anti-consumer, such as opposing the import of inexpensive rice in order to protect Japan's farmers.         Mrs. Oku was born in Fukui Prefecture in western Japan in 1895, the eldest daughter of a blacksmith.         She graduated from Japan Women's University and became active in 1920 in the women's suffrage movement. She also worked at a spinning company to become involved in the labor movement and was appalled by the working conditions. And she ran a home to help poor women and children from 1923 until it was destroyed in an American air raid in 1944.         Japanese women gained the right to vote and hold office in 1946, when the country was under United States occupation in the years after World War II. Mrs. Oku won a seat the next year in the upper house of Parliament and served for three six-year terms.         Mrs. Oku always wore a traditional Japanese kimono, joking that she could not afford Western clothes.         ''She always wore a kimono beautifully but her mind was tougher than men's,'' said Ms. Kihara. ''She was very clear in expressing her opinion even in front of men of high status. Very few women could do that in Japan at that time.''         Mrs. Oku is survived by a daughter, Kii Nakamura, who also served as a chairman of the Housewives' Association, and a son, Kyoichi Oku, both of Tokyo.         A funeral is to be held Thursday in Tokyo.       
         Joanne Tree Winship, a former actress who played an active role in many New York City charity benefits, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 73 and lived in midtown Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, her husband, Frederick Winship, said.         Mrs. Winship served for some years in the 1970's as the American chairwoman of Girls Town of Italy, an international organization based in Rome that cared for children who had been abandoned.         The organization's annual fund-raiser, which included a fashion show, featured several European designers who later became well known in this country, including Gianni Versace and Valentino.         She also played a leading role in organizing dinner dance benefits for the New York City Opera and the School of American Ballet. Her fund-raising efforts for the Museum of the City of New York's theater collection included such events as ''A Celebration of Jule Styne on Broadway'' in 1987.         She appeared in a number of movies as a child, including ''Mad About Music'' in 1938 and ''Cheers for Miss Bishop'' in 1941, as well as the Nancy Drew mystery series. While in her teens, she began a stage career under contract to J. J. Shubert.         Her television credits included ''Robert Montgomery Presents,'' ''Studio One'' and ''Broadway TV Theater,'' as well as the serialization of ''Junior Miss.''         A native of New York City, she was the daughter of John and Anna Tree of Lawrence, N.Y. In 1956, she married Alexis Thompson. Mr. Thompson died the next year. She married Mr. Winship in 1967.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a brother, George Tannenbaum of Montgomery, Ala., and a sister, Ruth Deroux of San Diego.         Correction:  September 26, 1997, Friday         An obituary on Aug. 11 about Joanne Winship, who was active in many charity benefits in New York City, misstated the year of her marriage to Alexis Thompson. It was 1953, not 1956. The error was pointed out in a letter to The Times last week.       
         Jean Westwood, who was a leader of George McGovern's disastrous Democratic campaign for President in 1972 and was the first woman to be chairman of a major political party, died on Monday in American Fork Hospital in American Fork, Utah, where she had lived for the last two years. She was 73.         The cause was complications from a pituitary tumor, said her husband, Richard E. Westwood.         Mrs. Westwood was an enthusiastic supporter of Democratic candidates and Democratic causes. But her period of leadership came during a time of Republican victories. So the unenvious task of trying to put a brave face on the McGovern campaign fell to Mrs. Westwood, who became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee after Mr. McGovern won the Democratic nomination.         ''It is pompous nonsense for anyone to presume to predict the result of an election seven weeks hence,'' she said in September 1972 as Mr. McGovern badly trailed President Richard M. Nixon. ''And it is ridiculous for any observer to conclude now that the whole thing is decided and the campaign is all over.''         But the whole thing was decided and the campaign was all over. Mr. McGovern carried only the Democratic bastions of Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. He was not the only loser. Mrs. Westwood faced  her share of the blame for the rout and, three weeks after the election, found herself combating suggestions that she resign.         ''I will not quit,'' she declared. But by December, she was gone after just five months as party chairman, whose title she preferred over chairwoman (''It's not something I'm going to fret about,'' Mrs. Westwood said when she got the job.)         Mr. McGovern, reached today at his vacation home in Montana, remembered Mrs. Westwood as ''a person who combined a tough mind with a warm heart.'' As an example, he offered a description of how he reached the decision to drop Senator Thomas F. Eagleton as his Vice-Presidential running mate.         Mr. Eagleton had revealed that he was hospitalized for ''fatigue and nervous exhaustion'' three times and underwent electric shock treatments for depression, almost derailing an already stumbling Presidential campaign.         Mr. McGovern said: ''I was calling key people in the campaign to decide what to do, and I can remember almost her exact words. She said, 'It's painful for me to do anything that might hurt Senator Eagleton, but if his staying on the ticket endangers our election chances, that hurts all the millions of people we want to serve, so I think he should step down.' That showed her compassion and tough-mindedness.''         Mr. McGovern later settled on Sargent Shriver as a running mate.         In 1968, Mrs. Westwood worked for the Presidential campaign of Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York and, after his assassination, turned to Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, another loser to Mr. Nixon.         In 1975, she helped lead the Presidential campaign of Terry Sanford, then the president of Duke University, and in 1985 she played a similar role for Bruce Babbitt. She lived in Arizona from 1976 to 1995 and served as an adviser to Mr. Babbitt when he was the Governor.         The success that eluded Mrs. Westwood in politics came to her in business. In their home state, Utah, she and her husband simultaneously ran businesses that raised minks, built apartments and installed swimming pools.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Westwood is survived by a son, Richard E. Westwood Jr., of Highland, Utah; a daughter, Beth Davies of American Fork; two brothers, John K. Miles of Provo, Utah, and David H. Miles of Orem, Utah; 15 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren.       
         Geraldine Mindell, who led the campaign to create the Jefferson Market Garden, an oasis of more than 200 varieties of flowers, shrubs and trees in the heart of Greenwich Village, died on Monday. She was 84.         Mrs. Mindell, who lived in the Village for more than 50 years, died of lung cancer at Lenox Hill Hospital, according to a spokesman for her family.         The triangle-shaped garden was once the site of the New York City Women's House of Detention, a 12-story building that cast a grim shadow over the Jefferson Market Library, a former courthouse, until the prison was torn down in 1973.         Mrs. Mindell led the fight to get rid of the prison and the battle to replace it with a garden. The land is owned by the New York City Parks Department, but the garden is financed by Village residents and businesses and by grants from foundations.         Mrs. Mindell was a founder of the Association of Village Home Owners and the West Ninth Street Block Association and was chairwoman for 24 years of the Village Committee for the Jefferson Market Garden.         Mrs. Mindell, whose husband, Joseph, died last year, is survived by a sister, Sarah Weisman of Phoenix.       
         Mary Sears, a researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for more than 60 years and a guiding editorial force behind several top scientific publications devoted to marine studies, died on Sept. 2 at her home in Woods Hole, Mass. She was 92.         Early in Dr. Sears's career, societal conventions prevented women from going to sea on research voyages, so Dr. Sears focused her energies on editing publications devoted to oceanography. She was the founding editor of Deep-Sea Research, a journal she directed from 1953 to 1974. She was also editor of the book ''Oceanography,'' a compendium of marine science published in 1961 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.         From 1943 to 1946, Dr. Sears was a lieutenant junior grade in the Navy, assigned to naval intelligence in Washington. While there, she organized and headed the Oceanographic Unit of the Navy Hydrographic Office, which until World War II had been mainly engaged in making and printing navigational charts. Under her guidance, the hydrographic agency evolved into the Naval Oceanographic Office.         Her duties included coordinating naval oceanographic research at Woods Hole, where, as part of the war effort, scientists studied such matters as the behavior of smoke at sea and the use of the temperature and water-density characteristics of ocean layers to help submarines avoid detection.         Mary Sears was born on July 18, 1905, in Wayland, Mass. She attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass., from which she received a bachelor's degree in 1927, a master's degree in 1929 and a doctorate in zoology in 1933. As a graduate student, she worked at Harvard University with Henry Bigelow, the founder and first director of Woods Hole.         In 1932 she began working as a planktonologist at Woods Hole, and was one of the first 10 staff research assistants at the Cape Cod institution, which was then primarily a summer operation. She was a research assistant at Harvard from 1933 to 1949, and an instructor at Wellesley College from 1938 to 1943.         Dr. Sears was the staff planktonologist at Woods Hole from 1940 to 1963, when she became a senior scientist in the biology department, a post she held until her retirement in 1970. She was named scientist emeritus in 1978.         Dr. Sears was chairwoman of the First International Congress on Oceanography, which was held at the United Nations in 1959. She was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Society of Women Geographers and the American Geophysical Union.         She is survived by two sisters, Leila Sears of North Pomfret, Vt., and Elisabeth Laderoute of Princeton, N.J., and a brother, John, of Jamaica, West Indies.       
         Eleanor Pepper, a former chairwoman of Pratt Institute's department of interior design who was a longtime design consultant and decorated an early version of the United Nations Security Council meeting room, died on Sunday at her apartment in the Carnegie Hill section of Manhattan. She was 93.         Miss Pepper was a professor of interior design at Pratt Institute from 1950 to 1970 and headed the interior design department there from 1951 to 1959. She was concurrently a New York-based design consultant for more than two decades, beginning in 1950.         From 1945 to 1950, she was with the New York-based architectural firm of Voorhees, Walker, Foley, Smith doing interior design. It was in that capacity that, in 1946, she decorated the Security Council's new main meeting room. The space had formerly been a Hunter College gymnasium.         The Voorhees firm designed the new chamber, which was decorated in soothing shades of soft tan and buff, with off-color brown carpeting.         Miss Pepper was a Manhattan native and graduated in 1924 from Barnard College and received a B.S. in architecture in 1928 from Massachusetts Institute of Architecture and a Diplome des Etudes Superieures in 1933 from the Sorbonne.         Her work in the 1930's included collaborating on plans for new newsreel theaters in Paris and for remodeling brownstone houses on Manhattan's East Side.         Early in her career she was also an associate editor of House and Garden magazine, and for several years she headed the department of interior design at Stephens College in Missouri.         During World War II, Miss Pepper worked on the design of floating drydocks for Admiral Harris Engineers and then was on the architectural staff of the U.S.O.         She was a longtime associate member of the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. In 1948, while she was chairwoman of the chapter's subcommittee on exhibitions, she oversaw the installation of an exhibit titled ''Tomorrow's World,'' sponsored by the chapter, in the New York Museum of Science and Industry in Rockefeller Center.         The exhibit's main feature was a 30-foot-wide, three-dimensional panorama depicting an ideal, two-square-mile community for 20,000 people with such then-modern features as pedestrian overpasses at main thoroughfares, and garden apartment houses and office buildings, both built low to give residents a feeling of country living.         Miss Pepper also was a professor in the architecture department of the New York Institute of Technology, taught and lectured elsewhere and remained active as a teacher into her 80's.         She is survived by two nieces, Carol Cooper of Lyonsville, N.Y., and Alice Cooper of Jerusalem, and by three nephews, D. Stephen Pepper of Lynchburg, Va., and Rome, Michael Pepper of New Windsor, Md., and Sam Hellinger of Pacific Palisades, Calif.       
         Virginia A. Dwyer, a former senior vice president for finance at the AT&T Corporation and one of the first women to gain a top position at a major American company, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. Miss Dwyer, a resident of Manhattan, was 76.         The cause of death was cancer, her brother, Jack, said.         Miss Dwyer spent her entire 43-year career at AT&T, starting as a clerk and rising to vice president and treasurer in 1979. In that capacity, she directed the company's stock and bond financing, at the time second in size only to the Federal Government's money-raising operations. Miss Dwyer was also responsible for three of the largest corporate stock offerings -- each exceeding $1 billion. In 1984, she was named senior vice president for finance.         After the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, Miss Dwyer was also responsible for planning the stock distribution for the seven regional telephone companies that resulted. When she retired in 1986, Miss Dwyer was the highest-ranking woman ever at the company.         She was the first chairwoman of the board of trustees at the University of Rochester in New York.         In 1943, Miss Dwyer graduated from the University of Rochester with a bachelor's degree in economics and worked in New York City as a statistical clerk for Western Electric, an AT&T manufacturing subsidiary. In 1953 Miss Dwyer received a master's degree in economics at New York University and became  chief economist at Western Electric in 1972. She moved to the parent company as assistant treasurer three years later.         She is survived by a sister, Marie Buley of Seaford, N.Y.; her brother, of Naples, Fla.; 8 nieces and nephews, and 13 great-nieces and great-nephews.       
         Jane Warner Dick, an early social welfare advocate who later served on a United Nations panel, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Lake Forest, Ill. She was 91.         Mrs. Dick's social work began in 1926 with Hull House, founded by Jane Addams in 1889. A friend of Ms. Addams, Mrs. Dick volunteered in the Immigrants Protection League, an arm of Hull House that provided legal services and helped immigrants adjust to life in the United States.         She later served on the Illinois Social Welfare Foundation as well as the Illinois Board of Public Welfare, where she established volunteer services for the state's mentally ill.         Mrs. Dick was active in Democratic politics in Illinois, where she was an early supporter of Adlai Stevenson. She urged Mr. Stevenson to run for governor in 1948 and served as the state chairwoman of his successful gubernatorial campaign. She also worked on his Democratic Presidential campaigns in 1952 and 1956.         In 1961, Mrs. Dick was appointed as the United States representative to the Social Commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council by President John F. Kennedy, on the recommendation of Mr. Stevenson, then Ambassador to the United Nations.         In her time with the United Nations, Mrs. Dick played a pivotal role in a raucous debate over a proposed resolution condemning racial discrimination. The United States maintained that the resolution, which called on nations to outlaw any organization that promoted discrimination, was too sweeping.         ''The United States' legal system does not permit censorship or punishment for the expression of ideas, even ideas we loathe,'' she said at the United Nations in 1963. ''We do not believe it is necessary to restrict freedom of thought in order to overcome discrimination.''         A version of the resolution was eventually adopted, with the United States and several Western nations abstaining from the vote.         Mrs. Dick was the author of a book about Mr. Stevenson, ''Volunteers and the Making of Presidents,'' published by Dodd, Mead Inc. She was a trustee of the Menninger Foundation, an advocacy group for the mentally ill; the Children's Home and Aid Society of Illinois, and the Newberry Library in Chicago. She was also a governing member of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.         Her husband, the Chicago industrialist Edison Dick, died in 1994. She is survived by a daughter, Titia Dick Ellis of Santa Fe, N.M.; a son, Edison W., of Washington; a sister, Marion Hodgkins of Lake Forest, Ill.; 9 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Annie Dodge Wauneka, who broke custom and became the Navajo Nation's first female legislator and a health crusader, died on Monday at Flagstaff Medical Center in Arizona. She was 87 and lived in Klagetoh, in northeast Arizona.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said Ted Rushton, a spokesman in Window Rock, Ariz., the Navajo capital.         For many years starting in the 1950's, Mrs. Wauneka traveled to villages and clinics, covering the 24,000-square-mile territory of the Navajo to preach public health standards. She cut a striking figure, tall and always wearing traditional Navajo clothing, including a colorful shawl and silver jewelry.         Over the years, she urged the Navajo to adopt more modern dwellings,  and she worked to improve the quality of water on the reservation. She also helped many people obtain medical attention after generations of reliance solely on tradition. She received much of the credit for defeating tuberculosis among the Navajo beginning in the 1950's and received national recognition for her role.         Albert A. Hale, president of the Navajo Nation, called her ''our legendary mother'' and ''the most honored Navajo in our history.'' He directed all public offices to shut down for one day last week, except for emergency services.         Annie Dodge was born in Deer Springs, Ariz., and learned of public service from her father, Henry Chee Dodge, a chief and first president of the Navajo Nation's legislative Tribal Council. Its jurisdiction stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. She became the first woman on the council in 1951, winning an election over two rival candidates. One of those was her husband, George L. Wauneka, with whom she ran a ranch owned by her father in Arizona.         Mrs. Wauneka was in the council for nearly 30 years, serving as the chairwoman of the health committee. Her concern with public health could be traced to her grade-school days, when the influenza pandemic at the end of World War I killed many Navajos. She escaped with a mild attack and, even as an 8-year-old, helped the overworked nurse at her school in Fort Defiance, Ariz.         Her formal education ended in the 11th grade, when she began tending to the needs of her tribe at the side of her father, who had become head of the Tribal Council and her political mentor. ''From my childhood,'' she said later, ''I have been aware of the problems of my tribe and have wanted to help make our people aware of them.''         Among her frustrations were the objections of tribal medicine makers to new ways. She conceded that the medicine makers performed much good work among the people, especially in family matters. But she said: ''The Navajo is caught in between. I must convince them to accept a mixture.''         In 1963, Mrs. Wauneka and 30 diplomats, educators, musicians, authors and a former Supreme Court justice received the newly created Presidential Medal of Freedom for service to their country. President John F. Kennedy established the honor on July 4, 1963; after his assassination, the medals were presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson.         Mrs. Wauneka's husband died in 1994. Her survivors include four daughters, Irma Bluehouse, Laurencita Cohoe, Georgia Ann Plummer and Sally S. Wauneka; five sons, Franklin, George L. Jr., Henry Chee, Norman and Timothy; a sister, Ann Shirley, and three brothers, Bernard, Sam and Walter Shirley.       
         Rella MacDougall, a prominent decorator who was the longtime chairwoman of the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Show House, died on Wednesday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 91.         The cause was cancer, said Harry Hinson, the fabric designer, who was a longtime friend.         Mrs. MacDougall led the show house, which used annual interior design shows to raise money for the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club, as it changed from a fledgling organization 24 years ago into an institution in interior design and the largest show house in the country. In 1972, the first show house raised $53,000 for the club, which runs after-school recreation programs in the South Bronx. In recent years, the show house has raised more than $500,000 annually.         Mrs. MacDougall was widely admired for her diplomacy and popularity, according to an April 1996 article about her in The New York Times. ''In a world of whining and complaining, she has wonderful, old-fashioned standards, which have not been deconstructed for modern times,'' the designer Mark Hampton was quoted as saying.         Rella Gammon grew up on a high bluff in Keokuk, Iowa, overlooking the Des Moines and Mississippi Rivers. Her father was an engineer who worked on Route 66. In 1926, she graduated from Lindenwood College in St. Charles, Mo. ''I wanted to be an engineer, build bridges, but my father nixed that,'' she said.         She spent more than a decade as a businesswoman in Detroit that included working as assistant to the president of a manufacturer of cotton batting for auto upholstery. In 1941, she married Allan MacDougall, the president of the National Distillers' import division. She gave up salaried work and became a full-time hostess, traveler and stepmother, occasionally decorating friends' apartments as wedding presents.         In 1964, when a friend's husband died unexpectedly, Mr. MacDougall suggested that she and her friend form a decorating company. ''Allan, I'll sacrifice anything,'' she later recalled telling her husband, ''but I will not go into decorating.'' From 1965 until 1990, she ran MacDougall & Company and worked as a decorator in New York and abroad. Her husband died in 1971.         When she heard about the first  Kips Bay show house in 1972, ''I remember thinking it was the craziest idea I ever heard,'' she said. ''The New York I knew was too sophisticated for that.''         Mrs. MacDougall was best known for sitting by the show house's doorway, graciously greeting visitors with her needlepoint in hand. She summed up her philosophy thus: ''If you don't enjoy it more each year, you shouldn't be doing it.''       
         Louise Loewenstein Ottinger, a New York philanthropist who supported the arts, community development and family planning, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 98.         Mrs. Ottinger, a Chicago native and a graduate of Smith College, was the matriarch of a New York family prominent in business and politics. For many years, she headed the Ottinger Foundation, which her husband, Lawrence, established in 1945.         She also headed the Louise L. Ottinger Trust, which promoted social change, voter education and women's issues. She was chairwoman of Camp Rainbow for disadvantaged children and the Lexington School for the Deaf.         Among her other principal beneficiaries were Planned Parenthood of New York City, UJA-Federation of New York, the Coalition for the Homeless, Food for Survival, and Municipal Concerts, which supports free concerts in parks and centers for the elderly. She also was a volunteer for a United Nations language center, where she tutored children in French and Italian.         Mrs. Ottinger's husband, founder of the United States Plywood Corporation, died in 1955.         She is survived by her son, Richard L., of Mamaroneck, N.Y., dean of Pace Law School and a former United States Representative; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Dawn Steel, the first woman to head a major movie studio and who played a prominent role advancing other women to top jobs in Hollywood, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center here. She was 51 and lived in Los Angeles.         Charles Roven, Ms. Steel's husband, a film producer, said Ms. Steel had been suffering from a malignant brain tumor.         ''When I got the call 21 months ago from the doctor about Dawn's condition,'' said Mr. Roven, ''I was told that 97 percent of the people who had this die within the first six months. It goes to show what spirit she had.''         Ms. Steel, who came to Hollywood in the 1970's to take a merchandising job at Paramount, rose quickly to become president of production at that studio, where she oversaw development of such films as ''Flashdance,'' ''Footloose,'' ''Top Gun,'' ''The Untouchables,'' ''Fatal Attraction'' and ''The Accused.'' She became the first woman to head a major studio when she held the top job at Columbia Studios from October 1987 until January 1991. During her reign, the studio's films included ''Awakenings,'' ''Flatliners,'' ''Ghostbusters 2'' and ''Casualties of War.''         Ms. Steel produced several movies in recent years, among them ''Cool Runnings,'' a highly successful comedy about a Jamaican bobsled team. She and Mr. Roven have produced ''Fallen,'' starring Denzel Washington, and ''City of Angels,'' with Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage, both to be released next year.         Ms. Steel's career and life were marked by a powerful, even outsize, personality that helped her succeed in a business dominated by men.  ''She was highly opinionated, extremely self-confident, had a fantastic sense of humor and was someone of enormous style and taste,'' said Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the partners of Dreamworks SKG, and an early mentor of Ms. Steel's at Paramount, along with Michael Eisner and Barry Diller. He added, ''Maybe under the facade she was scared and intimidated by it all, but I didn't see a scintilla of that.''         Nora Ephron, the writer, who was given her first directorial job by Ms. Steel, said: ''Dawn certainly wasn't the first woman to become powerful in Hollywood, but she was the first woman to understand that part of her responsibility was to make sure that eventually there were lots of other powerful women. She hired women as executives, women as producers and directors, women as marketing people.         ''The situation we have today, with a huge number of women in powerful positions, is largely because of Dawn Steel,'' said Ms. Ephron.         Ms. Steel was one of President Clinton's earliest supporters in Hollywood. In the last year, Mr. Clinton had phoned her several times, and Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Ms. Steel at her home in the Coldwater Canyon area of Los Angeles.         Characteristically, Ms. Steel often laughed with friends when recalling her first meeting with Mr. Clinton.         ''You're not as bad as I thought you'd be,'' Mr. Clinton told her.         Ms. Steel's skill as an executive was sometimes overshadowed by a reputation for an abrasive, take-no-prisoners style. She was called Steel Dawn and the Tank. ''It hurt me deeply, this reputation as tough, hard, mean,'' she said in 1993, following the publication of her autobiography ''They Can Kill You, but They Can't Eat You: Lessons From the Front.'' She added: ''It was very painful, it came from guys who wanted to kill me. In some ways I was curt because there's an unbelievable amount to accomplish in a day.''         ''Look, I'm not Mary Poppins,'' she said at another point, ''but I think I functioned with integrity.''         The films that Ms. Steel most enjoyed seeing and making -- such as ''Flashdance,'' about a female welder who wants to dance, and ''Cool Runnings'' -- were personal to her. These are stories of outsiders with outlandish ambitions who overcome numerous obstacles to get what they want. ''She had a formula for many of her movies that carried a simple truth: You want something, you work incredibly hard, you get it,'' said Lucy Fisher, vice chairwoman of the Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group, and a close friends.         Although Ms. Steel often said that she was just ''an ordinary middle-class girl from New York,'' the story of her life was far from ordinary and, like those of many other wealthy and successful moguls in Hollywood, self-invented.         She was born in the Bronx on Aug. 19, 1946, and grew up in Manhattan and ''in a crummy neighborhood on the wrong side of the tracks'' in Great Neck, N.Y., according to her autobiography. Her father, Nat, was a zipper salesman to the military who had a nervous breakdown when she was a child; her mother, Lillian, was a formidable businesswoman compelled to work to support the family. (The family's name was originally Spielberg, but her father changed it to Steel to reflect his prowess as a semiprofessional weight lifter).         Ms. Steel ran out of money after a year at Boston University, and attended New York University's School of Commerce for two years, studying marketing. By 1968 Ms. Steel was working as a receptionist in the garment district and soon found a low-level marketing job at Penthouse magazine devising X-rated products. (She initially told her parents she was working at Mademoiselle.)         Answering phones at Penthouse, Ms. Steel noticed that amaryllis plants took on a phallic look just before blooming. As she recalled, she hired an artist to exaggerate the effect and wrote her own copy for the ad: ''Grow your own . . . All it takes is $6.98 and a lot of love.'' The plant was so popular that Penthouse could not keep it in stock.         Ms. Steel's tenacity, and flair for theatrics, was made evident in 1975 while she was traveling through Europe looking for gimmicky gift ideas. She came up with the notion of poking fun at the Gucci label by stamping it on toilet paper. She solicited orders from boutiques and formed her own company, Oh Dawn! Inc., she said, ''because when I said I was in the toilet-paper business, people would say, 'Oh Dawn!' ''         Soon enough, the Gucci family sued her for copyright infringement. Sid Davidoff, a lawyer and former administrative assistant to Mayor John V. Lindsay, agreed to take her case even though, he later recalled, she ''didn't have a dime, she was living by her wits.'' Mr. Davidoff, building a First Amendment defense, made sure the New York tabloids heard about the case, which was quickly headlined ''the toilet-paper caper'' and led to an editorial cartoon showing the Gucci family as Goliath and poor Dawn Steel as David. The case was settled out of court.         By 1978, Ms. Steel had ended a 10-month marriage, sold her business to her ex-husband and asked Mr. Davidoff to place a call to his friend Mr. Katzenberg about a marketing job for her at Paramount. She was hired and quickly impressed her bosses.         Asked in 1993 why men like Mr. Eisner and Mr. Katzenberg had rapidly advanced her career, Ms. Steel replied: ''One was that I was funny. I wasn't heavy furniture. I made them laugh and entertained them. And the other thing was that I could identify a good idea. Not a lot of people can do that. That was my gift.''         She was once compared to a tank by the producer Dan Melnick. ''She would just lower her head and charge through all the red tape and bureaucracy,'' he said. ''She's the most determined woman in the business.''         Her early advocacy of ''Flashdance'' (1983), an unlikely blue-collar musical that turned into a huge hit grossing $95 million in the United States, solidified her position at Paramount. ''Flashdance'' was followed by ''Footloose,'' another hit.         By 1985, Paramount's president, Ned Tanen, appointed Ms. Steel president of production, making her one of the highest-ranking female executives in Hollywood. She had already developed a celebrity persona that made photographers take as many pictures of her at a premiere as a movie actress. She prided herself on her crown of leonine hair -- Ms. Ephron once introduced ''Dawn Steel and her hair'' at an awards luncheon for women -- and her romantic relationships with such figures as the actor Richard Gere and Martin Scorsese, the director.         Ms. Steel's dismissal from Paramount remains one of the more unusual in recent Hollywood history. Having married Mr. Roven in 1985, she was in the hospital after the birth of her only child, Rebecca, in March 1987, when she learned that Frank Mancuso, chairman of Paramount, and Mr. Tanen, chairman of the Motion Picture Group, had ousted her. Exactly why they did was unclear.         As Ms. Steel told Playboy years later, her husband walked into the hospital room with a newspaper under his arm and said, ''I don't know how to tell you this, babe, but you got fired while you were in labor.'' Ms. Steel said. ''I remember thinking, 'I will not cry, I will not let them make me cry.' ''         In addition to her husband and daughter, she is survived by a brother, Larry, of Manhattan.         Within six months of her ouster at Paramount, Ms. Steel was offered the job of running Columbia Studios, which was owned by Coca-Cola. Lynda Obst, a producer who was given her early producing jobs by Ms. Steel, said that one of the personal high points of her tenure at Columbia was the decision to restore and reissue the David Lean classic ''Lawrence of Arabia.'' ''It was something that she was extraordinarily proud of,'' said Ms. Obst.         Ms. Steel left the job in 1991, following Sony's purchase of the studio. Her settlement was reportedly in excess of $6 million.         Ms. Steel, in reviewing her career a few years ago, recalled that her commitment to helping women in Hollywood was a slow one. ''I must tell you, I did feel threatened by other women in those early years,'' she said. ''I was so busy climbing up this ladder, staying above the water. If there was only room for one woman in a room, I wanted to be her. I'm not proud of it. I certainly don't feel that way now. It was an absolute evolution for me.''       
         Ruth G. Weintraub, an early advocate of graduate education for women and a former dean at Hunter College, died Wednesday at her home on Manhattan's Upper West Side. She was 92.         Dr. Weintraub, who also kept a home on Fire Island in Seaview, was a professor of political science at Hunter from 1951 to 1972. After retiring from academia, she had a second career with the Academy for Educational Development in Manhattan, starting as a consultant. The academy is a nonprofit organization that undertakes education projects.         She founded its Presidential Services Division in 1974 and was executive vice president of the academy from 1978 to 1988. Through the division, she helped recruit presidents for colleges around the country. She retired in 1988.         Born in New York and a lifelong resident, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Hunter College in 1929, and in 1931, she became one of the first women to finish New York University Law School with a J.D. She earned a Ph.D. in political science at Columbia University in 1939.         She joined the Hunter faculty as an instructor after her graduation in 1929 and advanced to full professor in 1951. In 1956, she became dean of graduate studies in the arts and sciences, and she held the post until 1968.         Dr. Weintraub was also chairwoman of the department of political science until 1960 and then associate dean of graduate studies at City University of New York until 1968. After that she was dean of social sciences for her four final years at Hunter.         She was president of Pi Sigma Alpha, the first woman to head that political science honor society, which has chapters at 107 institutions of higher education nationwide. She also was active as an officer in the American Society for Public Administration, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Jewish Welfare Board and the YM-YWHA of Greater New York.         Her husband, Dr. Solomon Weintraub, a pathologist, died in 1982 after 52 years of marriage. She is survived by a son, Jon, of Washington, and two grandchildren.
