Dr. Lauretta Bender, a child neuro-psychiatrist, researcher and educator, died Jan. 4 in a nursing home in Annapolis, Md. She was 88 years old and lived in Annapolis.         Dr. Bender was known for developing, in 1923, the Bender-Gestault Visual Motor Test, a neuropsychological examination that has become a worldwide standard. She spent many years researching the cause of childhood schizophrenia and was responsible for studies on child suicides and violence.         In 1955, Dr. Bender received the Adolf Meyer Memorial Award for her contributions to the understanding of schizophrenic children.         She became a staff member of Bellevue Hospital in 1930 and later was senior psychiatrist in charge of the Children's Service at the hospital, a post she held for 21 years. Consulant to Children's Guild         Also in 1955, Dr. Bender was appointed principal research scientist in child psychiatry, a new post in the State Mental Hygiene Department. She continued working with the state until 1973, when she moved to Annapolis. Dr. Bender taught at the University of Maryland and was a consultant to the Children's Guild Inc., a group that works with emotionally disturbed youngsters, and similar organizations.         She was born in Butte, Mont. Dr. Bender graduated with a B.S. from the University of Chicago in 1922 and an M.A. in pathology in 1923. She received a medical degree from the State University of Iowa in 1926.         After completing her internship and residency at Billings Hospital of the University of Chicago, she became a resident psychiatrist at Boston Psychopathic Hospital from 1928 to 1929. From 1929 to 1930, Dr. Bender was a research associate in psychiatry at the Phipps Clinic of Johns Hopkins Hospital.         Dr. Bender was a member of such organizations as the American Psychiatric Association; the American Neurological Association, the American Academy of Child Psychiatry and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She was also on the Citizen's Committee for Children of New York City Inc.         Dr. Bender had been married to Dr. Paul Schilder, a Viennese psychiatrist who was an associate of Freud. Dr. Schilder died in 1940. In 1968, Dr. Bender married Dr. Henry Banford Parks, a historian and professor at New York University. He died in 1973.         She is survived by a son, Dr. Peter Schilder of Annapolis; a daughter, Jane S. Knowles of Santa Fe, N.M.; three grandchildren, and a brother, Karl Bender of Milwaukee, Ore.       
        Helenka Adamowska Pantaleoni, who served for more than 25 years as president of the United States Committee for Unicef, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, died of cardiac arrest Monday at New York Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Helenka Adamowska Pantaleoni, who served for more than 25 years as president of the United States Committee for Unicef, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, died of cardiac arrest Monday at New York Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Pantaleoni was born into a family of prominent turn-of-the-century Polish musicians, the Adamowski Trio, which toured extensively in Europe and the United States before settling in Brookline, Mass., where she was born.         After serving in the fund-raising arm of Polish War Relief, she helped to found Unicef and in 1953 became head of its United States Committee, a post she held until her retirement in 1978. During her presidency the committee raised $113 million for the fund.         Mrs. Pantaleoni is survived by a brother, Tadeusz Adamowski of New York; by four sons, Michael and Anthony of New York, Guido 3d of Bronxville, N.Y., and Hewitt of Oneonta, N.Y.; a daughter, Nina Hillgarth of Toronto, and 14 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
        Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         She had been on the air with few interruptions from 1931 to 1975, and the programs led to books and records for children. Her 30 awards included a Peabody and an Emmy. On her radio show, heard in the early evening for decades, she told stories in which she acted each part - ranging from princesses and wicked stepmothers to dragons - with a piano accompaniment. For this she was known as the ''Lady With a Thousand Voices.''         In the late 1930's and early 40's, national polls of radio editors consistently placed her programs first in juvenile entertainment. More than 25 million children listened to her regularly.         She was born Irene Seaton in Quincy, Ill., in 1900 and educated at public schools there. She graduated from the University of Illinois, where she studied music and drama. She then studied at the Goodman School of the Theater in Chicago and appeared in professional roles at the Goodman Theater in 1929 and 1930. Letter Added for Luck         Early in her radio career, she changed the spelling of her first name to Ireene with three ''e's'' when she was told by a numerologist that one more letter would bring her great success.         With her first husband, Walter Charles Wicker, a radio writer, producer and actor, she performed in two early soap operas, ''Today's Children'' and ''Harold Teen.''         The Wickers had a son, Walter Charles Jr., who died in action as a fighter pilot in World War II, and a daughter, Nancy.         Her debut as a children's radio entertainer came as a direct result of the way she amused her own offspring, telling tales and singing songs. ''The Singing Lady'' began as a local radio program in Chicago. Her Routine Was Her Own         According to an account by Val Adams in The New York Times, the sponsoring Kellogg's cornflakes company handed her a list of nursery rhymes and told her to do a children's program. ''She developed the routine of dramatizing fairy tales and playing all the parts herself,'' Mr. Adams wrote in 1948.         When television came along, she adapted her ''Singing Lady'' format to the new medium, using marionettes to act out her stories while she supplied the voices.         During the 1950's, Red Channels, a private blacklisting publication, charged that the actress had sponsored a re-election committee for a Communist councilman in New York. She denied she had even heard of the man and the charges were later withdrawn with apologies.         After her program was discontinued on commercial radio, it was later resumed on the Public Broadcasting System, and she was also heard on network radio affiliates.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1938. In 1941 she married Victor J. Hammer, co-owner with his brother Armand of the Hammer Galleries in New York. He died in 1985.         Mrs. Hammer is survived by her daughter, Nancy Eilan of Stamford, Conn.

Marian Van Tuyl, a noted dance educator, writer and performer, died of cancer at her home in San Francisco on Nov. 10. She was 80 years old.         Miss Van Tuyl was the founder and director of the dance department at Mills College in Oakland, Calif. She was associated with the school from 1938 to 1970, and returned briefly last spring to direct a production of one of her dances. She edited and published Impulse, an Annual of Contemporary Dance, from 1951 to 1970, and edited two books, ''Modern Dance Forms in Relation to the Other Arts'' and ''An Anthology of Impulse.''         In the early 1940's, Miss Van Tuyl was the director and choreographer of the Marian Van Tuyl Dancers company, with which she also performed on their extensive and acclaimed tours of the Midwest. She also made two experimentalist dance films, ''Horror Dream,'' set to a score by John Cage, and ''Clinic of Stumble.''         An energetic exponent of dance, in the San Francisco area and across the nation, Miss Van Tuyl served on the California Arts Commission through the 1970's, compiling a modern dance directory for the organization that was published in 1972. She was a founder of the Congress on Research in Dance and its newsletter.         Miss Van Tuyl, born in Wascousta , Mich., was a graduate of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Her first teaching job was at the University of Chicago, where she was a dance instructor and choreographer from 1928 to 1938. She studied with Martha Graham, Hanya Holm, Doris Humphrey and Louis Horst, and also trained at the Bennington School of Dance. In 1938, Miss Van Tuyl was a fellow of the Bennington Dance Festival, the forerunner of the American Dance Festival.         Miss Van Tuyl's husband, Dr. Douglas Campbell, died in 1983. She is survived by her children, Bruce, Robert and Gail; a brother, Lawrence, and three sisters, Hilda Kahle, Ruth Semple and Anna Dudley.

Lee Nicholson Martin, a journalist who covered some of the pivotal events of her era in the United States, Europe and Asia, died Wednesday of cancer at her home in Washington. She was 71 years old.         Mrs. Martin was born in Kellogg, Idaho, and graduated cum laude from the University of Washington. She became a reporter for The Tacoma News-Tribune in Washington and, in 1939, joined The Associated Press in Copenhagen. She worked in Denmark until after the Nazi occupation the next year.         She then worked for Time and Newsweek magazines and for the Office of War Information.         In 1947, she settled in Japan, where she edited Far East Fanfare.

        Diana Sheean, an author and the widow of Vincent Sheean, died of a stroke complicated by pneumonia at St. Stephen's Hospital in London last Wednesday. She was 72 years old.         Diana Sheean, an author and the widow of Vincent Sheean, died of a stroke complicated by pneumonia at St. Stephen's Hospital in London last Wednesday. She was 72 years old.         The daughter of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson and Lady Gertrude Forbes-Robertson, a well-known actor and actress, Mrs. Sheean was born in London and spent most of her childhood in Kent, near the cliffs of Dover. ''There the great events of the village,'' she recalled, ''were the arrivals of Channel swimmers and German mines, which still washed up on the beach from time to time.''         Mrs. Sheean, whose nickname was Dinah, wrote several books, including ''The Battle of Waterloo Road'' (1941), illustrated by Robert Capa's photographs, about the people in Britain during the war; ''War Letters From Britain'' (1941), edited with Roger W. Straus Jr.; ''A Cat and a King'' (1949), a novel about the theater, and ''My Aunt Maxine'' (1964), a biography of her aunt, Maxine Elliott, the American actress. #3 Plays 'Fizzed Out'         She was educated at boarding schools and at a French school in London, and she lived for several months with a family in Vienna. Her only connection with the theater, aside from the involvement of her parents, was writing three plays that, in her words, ''fizzed out.''         In 1935 she married Vincent Sheean, the noted American foreign correspondent, whose book ''Personal History'' was published to great success that year. They traveled widely in Spain, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in Europe before settling in the United States.         During those travels Mrs. Sheean wrote dispatches to The New York Herald Tribune, and before and during World War II she was active in committees raising money and distributing food for Spanish refugee children and victims of Nazism.         The Sheeans were divorced in 1946 and remarried in 1949.         Mrs. Sheean is survived by two daughters, Linda, of New York City, and Ellen, of London.

Lynn Caine, a former publicity agent for a publishing house who became a best-selling author, died of cancer Wednesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Caine wrote four nonfiction books, ''Widow'' (1974), ''What Did I Do Wrong? Mothers, Children, Guilt'' (1977), ''Lifelines'' (1978) and her last book, tentatively titled ''Lynn Caine's Book for Widows,'' which is to be published next fall.         ''Widow,'' which was adapted for television in 1976, came out of Mrs. Caine's experiences after the death of her husband, Martin., in 1971. The book reflected her life as the surviving parent of a son and daughter, ages 9 and 5.         Mrs. Caine worked for the Little, Brown publishing house from 1967 to 1976. Since then she worked on her books and lectured.         Mrs. Caine is survived by her son, Jonathan Saul, and her daughter, Elizabeth.

Mrs. Lewis was director of the nursery school from 1968 until her retirement in 1975. She played a major role in developing the school's preschool education program, which emphasized Jewish culture.         Before becoming director of the school, Mrs. Lewis had taught there for more than 10 years.         ''She was unbelievably gifted in every way,'' said Emily Rosenthal, who directed the school from 1946 to 1966, ''The children loved her.''         Born in Manhattan in 1906, Mrs. Lewis married Kassel Lewis in 1925. She was graduated in 1927 from Barnard College, where she studied English.

        Hebe Dorsey, the fashion editor of The International Herald Tribune and a major figure in the fashion world, died of cancer yesterday morning at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. She was 62 years old and had been working for the paper for about 40 years.         Hebe Dorsey, the fashion editor of The International Herald Tribune and a major figure in the fashion world, died of cancer yesterday morning at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. She was 62 years old and had been working for the paper for about 40 years.         Known for her irreverence and for fascination with society, Mrs. Dorsey frequently combined fashion and social reporting, and was in fact a member of the international social set herself.         A witty and somewhat acerbic commentator, Mrs. Dorsey was a force in fashion circles in New York and Tokyo as well as Paris.         ''She had the courage to report fashion critically,'' said Bill Blass, the designer, who remembered meeting her soon after World War II in Paris with Art Buchwald and other Tribune contributors. She was somewhat blase in those days, and she never really changed her attitude, he said. ''She liked the social aspects of fashion and she drew the connection between the two worlds,'' he added.         Hebe (pronounced ay-bay) Dorsey was born March 5, 1925, in Sousse, Tunisia, one of five children of Mary and Clement Halfon. After attending a French high school, she went on to study English and French at the Sorbonne. She became a contributor to The Herald Tribune when it was the European edition of The New York Herald Tribune. At about the same time, she married Frank Dorsey, a copy editor there, according to her brother, Leon Halfon. They were divorced some years ago. Award From Fashion Group         Earlier this fall she was one of five nominees for the journalism award given by the French Federation of Couture Ready to Wear and Creators of Fashion, an organization of trade groups. On Jan. 11, she was to receive an award for international journalism from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in New York.         ''She had an appointment next week to be fitted for the dress she was planning to wear,'' Mr. Blass said. ''It was a simple little short red satin strapless dress trimmed in fake leopard.''         Christian Lacroix said he would miss ''her sharpness, her acute sense of analysis and her style.'' She had ''helped launch us,'' France's newest couturier said, and he was happy that she was in New York in October when the first showing of his fashions was held in this country. Mrs. Dorsey was one of the first women to be seen in a Lacroix design, turning up at parties in his strapless red pouf-skirt dress. 'The Girl From Tunis'         ''I think of her as the girl from Tunis who was so involved with her family,'' Mr. Lacroix said, ''not of the dragon-like editor who was so intimidating at the fashion shows.''         He had lunch with her 10 days ago at the Ritz in Paris. ''She was wearing a Valentino suit with a fox collar and all her diamonds - she was in great spirits.''         Mrs. Dorsey generally wore clothes from such French couture houses as Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Lacroix, but would occasionally turn up in, say, a blue denim suit by an unknown tailor. She was also interested in jewelry and decorating.         ''Hebe revolutionized fashion writing,'' said John Fairchild, chairman of Fairchild Publications. ''She invented the idea of reviewing fashion like a play and she always did it with a razor, not a knife.''         John Vinocur, executive editor of The Herald Tribune, called her ''loyal, fierce, enormously generous and wildly funny.'' He said she could be ''enormously entertaining in two languages,'' switching from French to English ''without losing an ounce of wit.'' Streak of Irreverence         Her irreverence is illustrated by the article she wrote a few years ago after being bannned from a Christian Dior fashion show for an unfavorable review of the house's previous collection. Instead of lamenting the ban, she described using the free time to have her hair done, go shopping and take care of other chores she would not otherwise have had time for.         She entertained lavishly, both in her large apartment on the Boulevard Malesherbes in Paris and her pied-a-terre on the East Side of Manhattan.         ''She helped put fashion in the public eye,'' said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times and co-chairman of The Herald Tribune. ''She had a good time with her life,'' added his wife, Carol Sulzberger, a friend of Mrs. Dorsey.         Walter N. Thayer, chairman of Whitney Communications and president of The Herald Tribune, commented, ''She was a great lady and a wonderful person who had friends in all walks of life.'' An 'Excellent' Reporter         ''I met her 30 years ago when she was a young fashion writer and I was a fashion writer on the 'Today' show,'' Barbara Walters said. ''She never took herself too seriously, though she knew fashion was a serious business.''         Her book, ''La Belle Epoque,'' a compilation of pieces from The Herald Tribune recalling Paris in its heyday, was published there last year. She also wrote a monthly column for French Vogue and contributed articles on fashion and decorating to other publications such as The New York Times.         She is survived by three sisters, Zilia Sfez of Tunisia, Yvonne Brami of Nice and Nelly Cohen of Versailles, in addition to her brother. Her son, Joseph, is a photographer in Paris, and her daughter, Monika, lives in New York City.         The family requests that instead of flowers contributions be made to the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation, 1150 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10128.         Burial will be tomorrow at 10:30 A.M. at the Pantin cemetery outside Paris.         A memorial service in New York is being planned by Miss Walters, Marilyn Evins, the fashion publicist, and other friends.

        Inna Kitrosskaya Meiman, the wife of a Soviet dissident, died yesterday at the Lombardi Cancer Research Center of Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, three weeks after she was allowed to go abroad for treatment of an inoperable tumor on her neck. She was 53 years old and had been waiting years for permission to travel.         Inna Kitrosskaya Meiman, the wife of a Soviet dissident, died yesterday at the Lombardi Cancer Research Center of Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, three weeks after she was allowed to go abroad for treatment of an inoperable tumor on her neck. She was 53 years old and had been waiting years for permission to travel.         Gerald Strober, a spokesman for the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, which helped to plead her case, said Mrs. Meiman was admitted to the center on Jan. 20. In asking to go abroad, Mrs. Meiman said she wanted to undergo specialized radiation treatment, her only remaining hope for survival. Complications Reported         According to Mr. Strober, she had various tests complicated by low blood pressure, drug-induced diabetes and infection.         ''Basically she was still being evaluated for the start of chemotherapy,'' Mr. Strober said.  She was the wife of Prof. Naum Meiman, a mathematician who himself had long been denied an exit visa on the ground that he did secret work 30 years ago. Professor Meiman, 76 years of age, was a member of a now-disbanded group that monitored Soviet compliance with the Helsinki accords of 1975.         Professor Meiman said last month that he did not think officials might relent and let him follow his wife now that her health had become precarious. He said that his wife had undergone chemotherapy and four operations and that her only chance lay in American experimental treatment.         Mrs. Meiman, a teacher of English, was married to Professor Meiman in 1981.         Word that she might be able to leave first came from Senator Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat and possible Democratic Presidential candidate, while he was on a visit to Moscow in December. He said he had made a special plea for her to Mikhael S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.         Later, in a meeting, with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Senator Hart was informed of that the case was being ''reconsidered.'' Another Soviet cancer patient, Rimma Bravve, left Moscow on Dec. 18 in Senator Hart's company to receive treatment in New York. Left With Mixed Feelings         At the time of her own departure, Mrs. Meiman said she was leaving with ''mixed feelings'' since her husband had to stay behind. She said she had been feeling weak for some weeks and was eager to enter the Georgetown center.         Donna Hartman, the wife of Ambassador Arthur A. Hartman, accompanied Mrs. Meiman through routine customs and passport controls.         Mrs. Meiman is survived by a son from a previous marriage, Leo Kitrossky, a scientist in Moscow with three children. Also surviving is a daughter of Professor Meiman by a previous marriage, Olga Plam of Boulder, Colo.         INNA MEIMAN, EMIGRE, DIES AT 53

Mrs. Hoppin was director of the Professional Children's School from 1949 until she retired in 1962. From 1938 to 1949, she was academic dean of the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va. Earlier, she had taught at the women's division of Roberts College in Constantinople, now Istanbul, and in Florence and Albuquerque, N.M.         Her husband, Frederick, a New York publisher, died in 1946.       
        Anne Gilbreth Barney, the oldest child in the ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' family that was the subject of best-selling books and movies in the late 1940's and early 1950's, died here Feb. 16. She was 81 years old.         Anne Gilbreth Barney, the oldest child in the ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' family that was the subject of best-selling books and movies in the late 1940's and early 1950's, died here Feb. 16. She was 81 years old.         Mrs. Barney died at home after a long illness.         Her parents, Frank and Lillian M. Gilbreth, were pioneers in time-motion studies. The books and films offered amusing accounts about the father's attempts to use modern management techniques on the 12 children.         The books ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' and ''Belles on their Toes'' were written by Mrs. Barney's sister, Ernestine G. Carey, who lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., and brother, Frank Jr., who lives in Charleston, S.C.         Nine siblings survive Mrs. Barney. She is also survived by three sons and five grandchildren.

        Maria Augusta von Trapp, the guiding force behind a family of singers who won world reknown when their story was portrayed in the play and film ''The Sound of Music,'' died of heart failure yesterday in Morrisville, Vt., three days after undergoing surgery.

She was 82 years old, and had lived in Stowe, Vt., for more than 40 years.         The story of the von Trapp family, which fled Austria to avoid complicity with Nazi rule and toured the United States as the Trapp Family Choir, was transformed into one of the movie industry's greatest financial successes, with the release of ''The Sound of Music'' starring Julie Andrews in 1965.         Baroness von Trapp, who had studied to become a nun before marrying an Austrian war hero, Baron Georg von Trapp, in 1927, said she and the rest of the family received little of the $180 million in revenues from the film. However, she praised it for honestly depicting her life story and for bringing joy and hope to millions of people. In interviews, she repeatedly asserted her faith in God and devotion to the Roman Catholic Church. Praised Film's Influence         ''The great good the film and the play are doing to individual lives is far beyond money,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times shortly after the film's release. ''There seems to be so much despair in the world. But so many people write about how much the film has helped them in restoring their confidence in God.''         Born on a train speeding from her parent's Tyrol village to a hospital in Vienna in 1905, Maria Augusta Kutschera was an orphan by her seventh birthday. She was raised by a court-appointed guardian, whom she described as a passionate socialist and extremely anti-Catholic.         After she graduated from the State Teachers College for Progressive Education in Vienna at age 18, she became a candidate for the novitiate at a Benedictine convent in Salzberg. Choice of Church or Family         The abbess of the convent sent her to become a governess at the villa outside Salzberg of Baron Georg von Trapp, a highly decorated submarine commander during World War I, who had retired with his seven children after his first wife's death. The young woman quickly won the affection of the children and, when the Baron proposed marriage, she was torn between her devotion to the church and the family.         She married the Baron in November 1927. The couple later had three children.         The family often sang together, particularly during religious observances. In 1935, a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Franz Waner, came to live with the family and began to tutor the children in Renaissance and Baroque music.         In August 1936, the family's informal singing became a professional enterprise when they won a choral competition at the Salzberg Festival. The Trapp Family Choir conducted a full tour of Europe the next year.         When Austria fell under Nazi rule in March 1938, the family realized that its performances could only continue if it cooperated with the Government. They fled with only a few possessions to Italy, then sailed on to New York, arriving penniliess. Concert at Town Hall         Their first major concert, which brought the Trapp Family Choir national attention, took place in New York in Town Hall on Dec. 10, 1938. In a review of their opening performance, The New York Times commented:         ''There was something unusually lovable and appealing about the modest, serious singers of this little family aggregation as they formed a close semicircle about their self-effacing director for their initial offering, the handsome Mme. von Trapp in simple black, and the youthful sisters garbed in black and white Austrain folk costumes enlivened with red ribbons. It was only natural to expect work of exceeding refinement from them, and one was not disappointed in this.''         The von Trapps toured Europe and the United States the next year, gaining an international reputation for the seven daughters and three sons who sang madrigals and old carols, played ancient instruments and re-enacted family customs on stage. For 15 years, their Christmas concerts at Town Hall were a tradition of the New York Yuletide season.         The family bought a 660-acre farm in Stowe in 1942, which later became a lodge and summer music camp.         The Baron died in 1947 at the age of 57. She Lectured Extensively         The family continued to perform around the world until 1955, and the Baroness lectured and wrote extensively on the family's hardships, faith in God and unity. Her book, ''The Story of the Trapp Family Singers,'' was published in 1949. After her husband's death, she also became heavily involved in Catholic missionary work.         The play, ''The Sound of Music,'' with music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, opened on Broadway in the fall of 1959, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel. It was a tremendous success, running for more than three years. The film version set box office records around the world, but the Baroness von Trapp said she received only about $500,000 in royalties.         The Baroness received the Honorary Cross First Class from the Austrian Government for improving cultural ties between her native country and the United States, and numerous awards from the Roman Catholic church.         She is survived by a son, Johannes, of Stowe; two daughters, Eleonore Campbell of Waitsfield, Vt., and Rosmarie Trapp of Pittsburgh; two stepsons, Rupert, of Stowe, and Werner, of Waitsfield; three stepdaughters, Agathe von Trapp of Glyndon, Md., Maria F. Trapp of Papua, New Guinea, and Johanna von Trapp of San Diego, and by 29 grandchildren.

        Cathryn Damon, a stage and television actress who won an Emmy for her role on the popular television spoof ''Soap,'' died of cancer Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was 56 years old.         Cathryn Damon, a stage and television actress who won an Emmy for her role on the popular television spoof ''Soap,'' died of cancer Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was 56 years old.         Miss Damon was best known to millions of fans as Mary Campbell, the loyal wife of Burt Campbell, on the zany satire of daytime soap operas that ran on ABC from 1977-81.         The series had a loosely structured plot line that sometimes startled viewers with references to incest, adultery and homosexuality.         Miss Damon's character had to deal with a television husband who once was cloned by aliens from outer space. Both Miss Damon and Richard Mulligan, who played Burt, won Emmys in 1980 for their performances in the show. The problem-plagued television family also consisted of a son who became involved in organized crime and another son who was bisexual.         The series was so controversial that it brought 32,000 letters of protest even before ABC put it on the air. But ''Soap'' attracted a large and loyal following and ABC contended the program represented a major revolution in television comedy.         Miss Damon worked until shortly before her illness incapacitated her. Acted on Broadway         On television she was seen in the ''Matlock,'' ''Mike Hammer'' and ''Murder, She Wrote'' series. Earlier she was a neighbor on ''Webster'' and was featured in a television movie ''Not in Front of the Children.''         On Broadway and Off Broadway Miss Damon appeared in ''Flora, the Red Menace,'' ''Prisoner of Second Avenue,'' ''The Last of the Red Hot Lovers,'' ''Sweet Bird of Youth,'' ''The Boys From Syracuse'' and ''Passion.''         Survivors include her mother, M. Cathryn Springer, and a sister, June Ferol Damon.         CATHRYN DAMON DEAD AT 56       
        Cynthia Auerbach, an opera director who was associated with the New York City Opera for 15 years, died Thursday night at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She was 44 years old and had been suffering from lung cancer.         Cynthia Auerbach, an opera director who was associated with the New York City Opera for 15 years, died Thursday night at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She was 44 years old and had been suffering from lung cancer.         Educated as a pianist and music theorist, Ms. Auerbach began her stage career at the Manhattan School of Music, where she at first taught music theory and then founded the school's children's opera program in 1969. She had a free-lance career as a director but also held permanent posts at the Chautauqua Opera as artistic director and at the City Opera, where she had been a full member of the directing staff since 1975.         Ms. Auerbach's last directing job was at the American Opera Center at the Juilliard School last February - in a production of Britten's ''Albert Herring.'' At the time, Donal Henahan wrote in The New York Times of Ms. Auerbach's ''tightly coordinated'' staging and congratulated her for ''shrewdly resisting temptations to let low comedy take over.''         At the City Opera, Ms. Auerbach presided over such revivals as ''Carmen,'' ''The Daughter of the Regiment'' and ''L'Heure Espagnol.'' She also directed the company's new production of ''Les Pecheurs de Perles'' in 1980, which was revived last season. 'American-Made Talent'         Beverly Sills, general director of the City Opera, yesterday described Ms. Auerbach as ''typical of young American-made talent - the kind which has made this country's artists the most versatile in the world. She was feisty and imaginative and so part of our family that she represents a terrible loss.''         Elizabeth Crittenden, her manager at Columbia Artists, remembers Ms. Auerbach as a champion of developing American artists and composers, citing especially her work with young singers at the Texas Opera and at Juilliard and her productions of Carlisle Floyd's ''Of Mice and Men'' and Marc Blitzstein's ''Regina'' at Chautauqua. Ms. Auerbach also directed opera at a score of regional companies in North America, many of them in the American South.         She was born in New York City and received her education at the Juilliard School, the State University of New York at Potsdam and the Manhattan School.         Ms. Auerbach is survived by her father, Percy, now living in Florida, and by two sisters, Ronnie and Lynn, of the New York area. There will be a 2 P.M. service on Sunday at the Plaza Memorial Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Avenue, at 91st Street, in Manhattan.       
        Vera Caspary, a novelist, playwright and screenwriter best known for her films ''Laura,'' ''Letter to Three Wives'' and ''Les Girls,'' died of a stroke Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Greenwich Village.         Vera Caspary, a novelist, playwright and screenwriter best known for her films ''Laura,'' ''Letter to Three Wives'' and ''Les Girls,'' died of a stroke Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Greenwich Village.         In her 18 published novels, 10 screen plays and 4 stage plays, Miss Caspary's main theme, whether in a murder mystery, drama or musical comedy, was the working woman and her right to lead her own life, to be independent.         In her autobiography, ''The Secrets of Grown-Ups,'' published in 1979 by McGraw Hill, Miss Caspary wrote, ''This has been the century of the woman, and I know myself to have been a part of the revolution.''         ''In another generation, perhaps the next, equality will be taken for granted,'' she said. ''Those who come after us may find it easier to assert independence, but will miss the grand adventure of having been born in this century of change.''         Miss Caspary, the youngest of three children, was born and raised in Chicago, where her father was a buyer in a department store. After she left school at 18, she wrote advertising copy for a mail-order concern.         ''I gave that up when I realized that one wrote the same thing over and over again whether it was for cold cream or plumbing fixtures,'' she once said.         ''I've always enjoyed making up stories,'' she said. ''I like to get my hands onto all sorts of ideas.'' 'The White Girl'         Her first novel, ''The White Girl,'' published in 1929, was about a black woman who leaves the South for Chicago and poses as a white. Her second and perhaps her favorite novel, ''Thicker Than Water,'' was a study of Portuguese-Jewish family life in Chicago.         Her most famous work was ''Laura,'' her first mystery story, published in 1943 by Houghton Mifflin, followed by ''Bedelia'' and ''Murder at the Stork Club.''         She rewrote ''Laura'' for the now-classic 1944 movie, which starred Gene Tierney as an enigmatic and ambitious career girl and Clifton Webb as Waldo Lydecker, her malicious mentor.         In 1946, with the help of George Sklar, ''Laura'' was adapted to the stage.         Another mystery story, ''The Weeping and the Laughter,'' published in 1950 by Little Brown, became a national best seller.         In 1958, ''Les Girls'' was chosen as best-written American musical by the screen writers branch of the Writers Guild of America.         Miss Caspary was married to I. G. Goldsmith, who produced such films as ''The Stars Look Down.'' He died in 1964.       
        A woman accused of throwing six of her seven children into a bayou, where two of them drowned, was sentenced to probation today after pleading no contest to murder and attempted capital murder.         A woman accused of throwing six of her seven children into a bayou, where two of them drowned, was sentenced to probation today after pleading no contest to murder and attempted capital murder.         The woman, Juana Leija, entered the pleas as part of an agreement in which three charges of attempted capital murder were dismissed, her lawyer said.         The lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, said Mrs. Leija's 10-year probation called for her to remain under the care of Harris County Mental Health and Mental Retardation officials.         ''They agreed that she was mentally ill at the time that it happened,'' he said. ''She knows that at the time it happened she thought what she was doing was right.''         Mrs. Leija, 30 years old, said at the time the world was a terrible place, and that her children would be better off dead.         The prosecutor, Carol Davies, said probation was too light a sentence.         ''There are a lot of women out there in difficult circumstances with children, and I would hate to think that anyone would think that this is an appropriate way to solve your problems,'' Ms. Davies said. Two of Mrs. Leija's children, 5-year-old Juana and 6-year-old Judas Dimas, drowned in the muddy waters of the bayou on April 18, 1986, but nearby workers heard the childrens' screams and rescued the other four.       
        Sister Mary Theresa Brentano, a Benedictine nun who was a pioneer in the use of electronics in the classroom, died of a stroke Sunday at the Mount St. Scholastica Convent, Atchison, Kan. She was 84 years old. In 1957, while she was principal of St. Scholastica Academy in Covington, La., she designed and put to use an electronic system for teaching children through tape recordings.         Sister Mary Theresa Brentano, a Benedictine nun who was a pioneer in the use of electronics in the classroom, died of a stroke Sunday at the Mount St. Scholastica Convent, Atchison, Kan. She was 84 years old. In 1957, while she was principal of St. Scholastica Academy in Covington, La., she designed and put to use an electronic system for teaching children through tape recordings.         Children in the same class could listen to one of four taped lessons made by the teacher. If a student wanted help, pressing a button would get the teacher's attention. The teacher in turn could communicate with any one student.         Sister Mary Theresa told an interviewer at the time that she considered the system means of tailoring instruction to be closer to individuals' needs and farther from mass education.         She was born on a farm in Kansas and took her vows in 1927. She was a graduate of Catholic University and the University of Kansas, where she received a doctorate in English.       
        Rachel Eytan Fishman, a novelist and professor of Israeli and Yiddish literature at Hofstra University, died of a stroke Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 55 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Rachel Eytan Fishman, a novelist and professor of Israeli and Yiddish literature at Hofstra University, died of a stroke Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 55 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fishman was born in Palestine. She spent part of her childhood in orphanages and on a kibbutz. She taught school for four years, working closely with the children of new immigrants.         In 1962, Mrs. Fishman wrote ''The Fifth Heaven,'' a novel based on her childhood. It became a best seller in Israel and earned her the Brenner Prize, the highest literary prize in Israel. The book is now included in high school curriculums in Israel.         In 1968, she married Jerry Fishman, a chemist for the Rockefeller Institute, and moved to New York. Two years later, she became an adjunct professor at Hofstra University.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, Yonatan, of Manhattan and Omri Eytan, of Tel Aviv, and a daughter, Tula, also of Tel Aviv.         A service is scheduled for 10 A.M. today at Riverside Memorial Chapel at Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street. Burial will be in Israel.

        Geraldine Page, dedicated to acting for more than four decades and long identified with the work of Tennessee Williams, died of a heart attack Saturday at her home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Both a Broadway star and an Academy Award winner, she was 62 years old.         Geraldine Page, dedicated to acting for more than four decades and long identified with the work of Tennessee Williams, died of a heart attack Saturday at her home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Both a Broadway star and an Academy Award winner, she was 62 years old.         Miss Page, who had been performing in ''Blithe Spirit'' on Broadway since spring, did not arrive for Saturday's two performances. At the end of the evening show, the play's producer, Karl Allison, announced that she had died. Her role in ''Blithe Spirit'' was assumed by her understudy, Patricia Conolly.         Mr. Allison described the other members of the cast as devastated by the news. ''She was such a wonderfully sweet person, on top of being such an extraordinary actress,'' he said.         Born in Kirksville, Mo., on Nov. 22, 1924, Miss Page grew up in Chicago and later traced her love of acting to plays that she had done with a church youth group. 'To Be Good at Something'         ''I always wanted to be good at something, to be somebody,'' she once wrote in a sketch of herself for The New Yorker. ''The minute I got into my first play, which was called ''Excuse My Dust'' - I was 17 at the time - I knew that this was what I'd been looking for.''         After graduating from high school in 1942, Miss Page spent three years studying at the Goodman Theater School in Chicago. With 11 other students - they each chipped in $35 - she formed a stock theater company that operated for four seasons from a playhouse outside the city.         In the late 1940's, Miss Page moved to New York, where she worked as a hat-check girl, a spool winder in a thread factory and a negligee model while stalking the theater district for work.         ''The first rule of survival was to stretch every penny,'' she once said. ''I'd eat in a restaurant that featured soup and free rolls for 15 cents and I'd stuff my pockets with rolls. Fortunately, food didn't mean much to me.'' First Big Break in '52         Her first big acting break came in 1952, when the director Jose Quintero cast her as the lovelorn Alma Winemiller in his production of Williams's ''Summer and Smoke,'' which played Off Broadway at the Circle in the Square.         In that role, she attracted such praise that the next year she made her Broadway debut, in ''Midsummer'' by Vina Delmar. Though the show received mediocre reviews, the critics once again raved about Miss Page, and the producers raised her to star billing.         On Broadway, she went on to star in ''The Immoralist'' in 1954, an adaption of the Gide novel; in N. Richard Nash's ''Rainmaker,'' also in 1954, and in Williams's ''Sweet Bird of Youth'' in 1959.         More recently, she appeared in John Pielmeier's ''Agnes of God'' in 1982, and Off Broadway in Sam Shepard's ''Lie of the Mind'' in 1985.         Miss Page was perhaps best known for her interpretations of Williams's obsessive heroines. In 1980 she played Zelda Fitzgerald in the Williams drama ''Clothes for a Summer Hotel.'' 'Disciplined and Dedicated'         The playwright once described her as ''the most disciplined and dedicated of actresses.''         She rejected another characterization of her - as an actress best suited to the roles of neurotic women. ''It's a myth based on nothing,'' she said.         ''A lot of people say I always play neurotic women,'' she said. ''Well, who doesn't play neurotic women?''         The career of Miss Page, who shunned many of the trappings of stardom, was marked by periods of relative obscurity broken by sudden rediscovery. In 1962, with the release of the film versions of ''Summer and Smoke'' and ''Sweet Bird of Youth,'' she found herself, after 10 years on the stage, being hailed as an ''overnight success.''         ''That's the longest night I've ever seen,'' she said at the time.         Miss Page's film credits included ''Hondo,'' in which she played opposite John Wayne, in 1954; ''The Happiest Millionaire'' in 1967, and ''The Day of the Locust'' in 1975. In recent years, she appeared in ''The Pope of Greenwich Village'' in 1984 and ''The Trip to Bountiful'' in 1985. A Belated Oscar         Nominated for an Oscar eight times without winning, Miss Page finally received the award for best actress for her performance in ''The Trip to Bountiful.'' In the movie, she played Carrie Watts, an old woman who finally fulfills her long desire to return to her childhood home of Bountiful, a Texas town that has by then disappeared. Of her performance, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, ''As Mrs. Watts, Geraldine Page has never been in better form or in more control of that complex, delicate mechanism that makes her one of our finest actresses.''         ''She was not a gal who worried about the fashion of the times,'' said the playwright, Horton Foote, a longtime friend of the actress and the author of the screenplay for ''The Trip to Bountiful.'' ''She had enormous individuality. She just wasn't a theater provincial and her work reflected that.''         In the New Yorker sketch, Miss Page gave her own views on what makes a successful actor: ''The main thing is the ability to control your instrument, which in the actor, is yourself. Look the way you want the character to look. Sound the way you want the character to sound. Once you've trained the instrument to do what you want, you're in control and you're free.''         Despite her successful Hollywood career, Miss Page remained a strong supporter of repertory theater throughout her life, often acting in them at a low salary and in supporting roles. Recently, as a member of the Mirror Repertory Company, she appeared in ''The Madwoman of Chaillot.''         Miss Page won two Emmy awards for her television performances, both in the late 1960's for roles in adaptations of Truman Capote stories, ''A Christmas Memory'' and ''The Thanksgiving Visitor.''         Miss Page is survived by her third husband, the actor Rip Torn; their three children, Jonathan, Anthony and Angelica Torn-Burkhardt; a grandchild, Elija Burkhardt, and a brother, Donald.         A memorial service will be held at the Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52d Street, at 11 A.M. on Wednesday.

        Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Judge Polier retired from the bench in 1973 after 38 years in the Family Court, which was known as Domestic Relations Court when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia appointed her to it in 1935.         The daughter of a civil libertarian, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, she was the first woman to hold a judicial office above magistrate in the state.         As a judge, she fought strenuously for an improved Family Court and for better care for the children, especially from poor families, who came before it. She also helped establish a mental-health unit in the court. Children's Rights Advocate         After retiring, she continued her battle for children's rights as a leader of several organizations. She was the director of the juvenile justice division of the Children's Defense Fund, the president of the Marion E. Kenworthy-Sarah H. Swift Foundation and a director of the Tappanz Foundation.         Judge Polier's counsel was sought by other cities and states in developing court services for children and families and she provided similar help to other countries.         She wrote numerous articles and books about the legal and psychiatric problems of dealing with children and families.         During World War II, Judge Polier served as counsel to Eleanor Roosevelt in the Office of Civil Defense in Washington. With Mrs. Roosevelt and others, she helped found the nonsectarian Wiltwyck School for disturbed delinquent children in New York City. Fired for 'Agitating' Workers         Judge Polier was born in Portland, Ore., and her desire to correct social ills showed up early in life. While a sophomore at Radcliffe College, she lived at a settlement house in Boston for underprivileged children. She had also attended Bryn Mawr College.         After transferring to and graduating from Barnard College, she got a job with a woolens mill in Passaic, N.J., from which she was fired for what she later described as ''agitating'' workers who had been forbidden by management to organize.         She studied labor relations in Geneva for a year, then decided to become a lawyer on the advice of her father. He persuaded her to study law, she said years later, ''because I had good intentions but no skills.''         In 1928, she graduated from Yale Law School, where she had married Leon A. Tulin, a professor. He died in 1932. Active in Adoption Issues         After Yale, she served on a state committee to study workers' compensation laws and was an assistant corporation counsel of New York City before she was named a judge.         She was for many years the president of Louise Wise Services, an adoption and child-care agency founded by her mother in 1916.         Judge Polier headed an unofficial citizens commission that in 1974 looked into the alleged paddling of students, at the Jordan L. Mott Junior High School in the Bronx, by two deans. The commission called for an ombudsman, among other measures, to protect pupils against corporal punishment.         Judge Polier was a vice president of the American Jewish Congress and a member of the board, and former president, of the Field Foundation.         Her second husband, Shad Polier, died in 1976. She is survived by two sons, Stephen Wise Tulin of Larchmont, N.Y., and Jonathon Wise Polier of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Trudy Festinger of Manhattan; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

        Beatrice Joy Chute, a novelist and short-story writer who was also a past president of the PEN American Center and taught for many years at Barnard College, died of a heart attack Sept. 6 at Bellevue Hospital Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Beatrice Joy Chute, a novelist and short-story writer who was also a past president of the PEN American Center and taught for many years at Barnard College, died of a heart attack Sept. 6 at Bellevue Hospital Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Chute, who was born in Minneapolis in 1913, published her first story in 1931. She wrote many stories for and about adolescent boys for Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and other magazines during the 1930's, and her first book, ''Blocking Back,'' was published in 1938. Many of her early works, such as ''Shattuck Cadet'' (1940) and ''Camp Hero'' (1942), were realistic tales of sports and camp life that captured the relationships and slang of her primarily male teen-age heroes.         Although she continued to write short stories for children and adolescents in the 1940's, Miss Chute began to concentrate on adult fiction with ''The Fields Are White,'' a 1950 book about marriage and manners.         Her best-known novel, ''Greenwillow'' (1956), was described by a critic as ''a deeply moving, gently humorous and serenely wise'' story of young love and self-discovery. It was made into a Broadway musical in 1960. Subsequent works included a 1957 anthology called ''The Blue Cup and Other Stories,'' ''The Story of a Small Life'' (1971) and ''Katie: An Impertinent Fairy Tale'' (1978). Taught at Barnard         Her most recent novel, ''The Good Woman'' (1986), was a parable about a lonely woman who abandons her home for a journey of spiritual awakening while living on the streets.         Miss Chute - who preferred to be called Joy and signed her books B. J. Chute - moved to New York in the early 1940's with her mother and two sisters. Over the years, she did volunteer work with poor children and the Police Athletic League. She became an adjunct professor of English at Barnard College in 1964, and taught creative writing there until her death.         She was also director of Books Across the Sea, a division of the English-Speaking Union that promoted American books overseas, and was an active member and one-time president of the American chapter of PEN, the writer's association.         Miss Chute is survived by two sisters, Marchette Chute, an author, of Manhattan, and Mary Chute Smith, of Morristown, N.J.         A memorial service will be held at St. Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue and 53d Street, on Oct. 8 at 5:15 P.M.

        Eleanor M. Johnson, founder of The Weekly Reader, which has brought the news of the world to schoolchildren for nearly six decades, died of cancer Thursday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. She was 94 years old.         Eleanor M. Johnson, founder of The Weekly Reader, which has brought the news of the world to schoolchildren for nearly six decades, died of cancer Thursday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. She was 94 years old.         Miss Johnson, a dedicated and energetic educator for half a century, produced the first issue of the newspaper on Sept. 21, 1928, and remained active in planning its contents until 1978, when she was 85.         Originally called My Weekly Reader, the slim periodical, typically four or eight pages an issue, was read by two-thirds of today's American adults when they were in elementary school, according to the publisher, Fields Publications of Middletown, Conn.         With its clear, straightforward prose, The Weekly Reader has explained to generations of American children the compelling events of the day: the Depression, World War II, assassinations, the Vietnam War, civil rights struggles and the Iran hostage crisis. 'They Were Missing Knowledge'         ''Part of Eleanor's genius was she knew how to connect kids to the world,'' said Terry Borton, The Weekly Reader's editor in chief for the last 10 years.         Miss Johnson conceived the idea of a newspaper for elementary school pupils in 1927, when she was an administrator overseeing curriculum in the public schools of York, Pa.         ''In her work with kids,'' Mr. Borton said, ''she noticed most of the reading they did was fairy tales and fantasy, which she felt was fine, but she felt they were missing a knowledge and understanding of the real world, which she thought they would like.''         She proposed the idea to William Blakey, president of American Education Publications, which already published a newspaper for high school students. He agreed. Hoover vs. Smith         The cover article of the first Weekly Reader profiled the two principal candidates in the 1928 Presidential election, Herbert Hoover and Alfred E. Smith, focusing on their childhood. Its headline said, ''Two Poor Boys Who Made Good Are Now Running for the Highest Office in the World.'' The leading articles in two of the most recent Weekly Readers discussed a controversy over cigarette advertisements and the growing concern about air travel.         Circulation reached 100,000 the first year and grew to a high of 13 million in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when The Weekly Reader expanded to seven editions, one for each grade level from preschool to sixth grade. Nine million schoolchildren subscribe today, at a cost of about $2 for the 27 issues of the school year.         All the while, according to the newspaper's publisher, The Weekly Reader has retained its original aim: ''to present selected, well-written news of interest and value to children with accuracy and fairness, colorful but uncolored.'' A Farmer's Daughter         Eleanor Murdock Johnson was born Dec. 10, 1892, in Washington County, Md., a daughter of a farming couple.         Miss Johnson, a fragile-looking woman who stood about 4 feet 10 inches, began her career in education as a first-grade teacher in Oklahoma. She worked as a consultant to The Weekly Reader during its early years while continuing to hold administrative jobs in York and then in the Lakewood, Ohio, school system.         In 1935, she left public schools to preside over the magazine full time as editor in chief, a job she held until 1961. Then, after retirement, she continued to serve the paper as a consultant until 1978.         Miss Johnson, who held master's degrees in education from the University of Chicago and Columbia University, was also a co-author of several children's books, including the Child Story Readers and the Treasury of Literature Readers, and wrote more than 50 elementary school workbooks that offered exercises in reading, arithmetic and geography. She also wrote numerous articles in education journals and was an active public speaker.         Miss Johnson, whose cancer was diagnosed about a month ago, is survived by a sister, Maria Johnson, with whom she lived at the Herman M. Wilson Health Care Center of the Asbury Methodist Retirement Center in Gaithersburg.         A memorial service will be held Monday afternoon at St. Marks Lutheran Church in Wolfsville, Md.
