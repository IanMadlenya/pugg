         Marie Collins McGuire Thompson, who worked to improve the design of public housing for the elderly and low-income people as the Public Housing Administrator in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, died last Monday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. Mrs. Thompson was 92 and lived in Kensington, Md.         Marie McGuire, as she was known, came to public housing with an aversion to ''bare, stark shelter'' that, she said, ''has brought no happiness to us.'' Instead, she espoused programs to create homes of which their occupants could be proud. Her advocacy drew criticism from legislators and defenders of traditional approaches, but architectural organizations backed her. Housing projects begun under her leadership won unaccustomed design awards.         She came to national attention as executive director of the San Antonio Housing Authority, where she championed amenities like balconies for every apartment. Studying the special needs of the elderly with limited means, she insisted on features like weatherproof ramps, handrails in all rooms and corridors and emergency bells in the bathrooms.         Her crowning achievement was the Golden Age Center, with 185 low-rent apartments designed for the elderly, that opened in 1960 in San Antonio. The next year, President John F. Kennedy recruited her as the first woman to become Public Housing Administrator. She held the post until 1966, when her office was merged into the new Department of Housing and Urban Development. There she became special assistant to the Secretary, working on housing and problems that affect the disabled and the elderly.         She left the Government in 1972. Until 1982, she was the housing specialist at the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, now the Center for Social Gerontology in Ann Arbor, Mich.         Mrs. Thompson was born in the Georgetown area of Washington. She studied journalism at George Washington University and, years later, studied architecture and real estate management at the University of Houston.         She wrote four books, ''Housing for the Elderly'' (1957), ''Housing and the Disabled'' (1976), ''Housing for the Handicapped'' (1977) and ''Housing for Rural Elderly'' (1982).         Her first marriage, to John McGuire, a Government geologist, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Thomas B. Thompson of San Antonio, an architect, died in 1983. She is survived by a sister, Margaret C. Schweinhaut, also of Kensington.       
         Alice Huei-Zu Yang, an art historian and curator, died early Saturday morning after a hit-and-run accident at Canal and Varick Streets in Manhattan. She was 35 and lived in TriBeCa.         Ms. Yang's husband, Gerald Szeto, an architect with the firm of Calvin Tsai, was injured in the accident and was in stable condition yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital.         Ms. Yang was born in 1961 in Taipei and came to the United States when she was 15. She studied art history at Yale University, graduating cum laude in 1984. After completing internships in several Manhattan  museums, Ms. Yang worked for five years as an assistant curator at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, organizing several exhibitions, including a survey of the work of Alfredo Jaar in 1992 and a group show titled ''The Final Frontier'' in 1993. That year, she left the museum to work as a critic and independent curator while earning her master's degree at the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University.         Ms. Yang had recently passed her oral examinations for a Ph.D. at the institute and last week began working as the Robert Lehman curator at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, L.I. She was also organizing an exhibition of drawings by emerging Taiwanese artists at the Drawing Center in SoHo.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Yang is survived by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Yang, of Taipei, and two brothers, James, of Hong Kong, and Andrew, also of Taipei.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice.         She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.         In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.         Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.         Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, ''Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer''.         While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.         During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.         An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.         A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled ''A World to Live In'' from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published ''Twice a Year,'' a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were ''The Selected Writings of John Marin'' (1949); ''Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend'' (1985) and ''Encounters: a Memoir'' (1987). In 1965 she published ''Nehru: The First Sixty Years,'' a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.         In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.         Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Frooks, who stumped for women's suffrage as a child, recruited thousands of men to World War I service as a teen-ager, and then spent most of the century as a lawyer and political gadfly, died on Sunday at Veterans Hospital in Manhattan. She was about 100 and lived in Manhattan and Peekskill, N.Y.         Among her many achievements were laying the groundwork for aid to dependent children and for small claims courts.         She served as chief yeoman in the Navy in World War I and as a judge advocate in the Army in World War II, taught school in Puerto Rico, ran a flying school, turned out columns for The New York World, wrote half a dozen books, founded The Murray Hills News, represented celebrated murder defendants, ran repeatedly for Congress, corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, feuded with Eleanor Roosevelt, hobnobbed with the King of Greece, turned down marriage proposals from Harry K. Thaw and Fiorello H. La Guardia, and so clouded the issue of her age that even her own family is not sure if she was 99 or 103.         But whether she was ''almost 17,'' in January 1918, as she put it in her her book ''Lady Lawyer,'' or 20, as a contemporaneous newspaper article reported, Miss Frooks, who received a gold medal from President Woodrow Wilson that month, was surely one of the last living Americans to have had a formal audience with Wilson in his White House office (and seen the evangelist Billy Sunday clap him on the back with such gusto that the President's top hat went flying.)         Whatever her age, by then she had a national reputation as ''the infant prodigy,'' ''the baby orator,'' and the girl who had made speeches for women's suffrage from Union Square to Hyde Park before turning her attention to military recruitment and Liberty Bonds.         The daughter of a prosperous businessman and an international society figure, Miss Frooks was born on a 400-acre Hudson Valley farm near Saugerties, N.Y., and grew up there and at the family's winter residence at the Waldorf Hotel.         As the seventh of nine highly articulate children, five of whom became lawyers, Miss Frooks recalled that she was holding her own in animated dinner table conversations on international affairs by the time she was 8 -- two years after she had decided on a legal career.         It was one of her mother's London society friends who spotted her talent for oratory and recruited her for the suffrage movement. Miss Frooks, who recalled making her first street-corner speech when she was 11, cut such a winsome figure in her little girl's bows and frills and spoke with such startling eloquence that she was always the first speaker at curbside rallies. The speakers who followed had learned they were less likely to be stoned or pelted with tomatoes when Miss Frooks led off.         She was even more impressive as an unofficial military recruiter, and after she had talked an estimated 30,000 men into signing up, primarily for the Navy, President Wilson not only presented her with a medal but recruited her for the Navy. As the highest-ranking woman in the service, Miss Frooks continued and expanded her recruitment activities and later organized a women's veterans organization.         Miss Frooks, who received a degree from the old Hamilton Law School in Chicago and then a master's from New York University, was a lawyer at 21, by her account.         By the early 1920's, at least, she was well known in New York as the first full-time lawyer for the Salvation Army. After setting up free legal clinics and discovering that poor people were often frustrated by their inability to collect small debts, she conceived the idea of a small claims court and lobbied hard until the first was signed into law by her old friend and suitor, Mayor La Guardia.         Thaw, the man who had killed the celebrated architect Stanford White 20 years earlier, hired Miss Frooks in 1926 to defend a 16-year-old girl who had killed the man who raped her when she was 12.         Miss Frooks, who eventually won a suspended sentence for her client,  became so incensed that the girl's widowed mother had been forced to neglect her children while struggling to eke out a living that she helped prod the legislature into establishing aid to dependent children.         The case also led to a ''My Day,'' column in The World, which lasted until 1932, when she was told that she was being replaced by Mrs. Roosevelt, a circumstance that may have contributed to her animosity toward the First Lady.         For all her childhood support of women's suffrage and her own legal career, Miss Frooks was no ordinary feminist. She made fiery speeches against the proposed equal rights amendment in 1975. As she had put it in 1922, ''Women should be in the home, have adorable husbands, and be the only wife.''         Miss Frooks, who was married in 1986, is survived by her husband, Jay P. Vanderbilt.       
         Evelyn Fortune Bartlett, an art patron who was a major benefactor of the Art Institute of Chicago, died on Tuesday at her home in Beverly, Mass. She was 109.         Alert until a few weeks ago, Mrs. Bartlett was also an ardent gardener and farmer, something of an eccentric and a master of detail. In the lush gardens she cultivated at Bonnet House, a 35-acre estate in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., she could recount how and where every plant, ornament and tile was bought and installed. She grew many varieties of orchids, put black and white swans in the estate's ponds and bought 30 to 40 monkeys for its trees.         Mrs. Bartlett was equally particular with her farm in Essex, Mass., which was called Bothways. Besides the usual cows, sheep and chickens, it was also home to two llamas and an emu. For visitors, she would recite various species she raised. But she would also serve many of them, along with the vegetables she grew, for lunch. Asked if eating the animals bothered her, she replied, ''I run a farm, not a zoo.''         Described as a small, dainty woman with a stern face, she was said to be private but invariably gracious. ''She was completely representative of another age, the age of manners,'' said Courtney Graham Donnell, an associate curator at the Art Institute. ''I had lunch with her three times at her house in Beverly, and we never ate off the same china.'' Before each lunch, there would be sherry by the fire.         Mrs. Bartlett was the daughter of William Fortune, who for many years was president of the Indianapolis Telephone Company as well as other telephone companies and a director of Eli Lilly and Company. Her first marriage was to Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical concern's founder, from whom she was divorced around 1927.         She married Frederick Clay Bartlett, a Chicago-born artist, architect and patron of the arts, in 1931. Shortly thereafter she took up painting, moving quickly from watercolors to oils and developing her own style. Her pictures -- vividly colored portraits, still lifes and flower paintings, bore little resemblance to her husband's murals, landscapes and figurative works, executed in muted tones.         Mr. Bartlett and his previous wife, Helen Birch, had been among the first Americans to collect Post-Impressionist works, assembling a priceless collection of paintings by Cezanne, Picasso, van Gogh, Matisse and Seurat that went to the Art Institute upon Helen Birch Bartlett's death in 1925.         The collection included Seurat's legendary ''Sunday Afternoon on La Grand Jatte.'' After Mr. Bartlett died in 1956, Evelyn Bartlett donated money to construct a gallery named after him and to provide for the presentation and preservation of those paintings, known as the Helen Birch Bartlett collection.         A later marriage to Daniel Huger ended in divorce in 1969.         Mrs. Bartlett donated many paintings and sculptures to the Art Institute. Although she did not live for very long in Chicago, her interest in the city's art scene continued. When works in the galleries she supported were rehung six years ago, she traveled to Chicago to see them. At her death, she was an honorary governing member, life trustee, sustaining fellow and member of the Old Masters Society of the Art Institute.         No immediate family members survive, a spokesman for the Art Institute said. Mrs. Bartlett bequeathed Bothways, the farm in Essex, to the Massachusetts Trustees of Reservations, a preservation organization, and Whitehall, her home in Beverly, to the Beverly Hospital. Bonnet House was turned into a museum in Fort Lauderdale several years ago, but she retained the right to live there and spent each winter on the estate.         In 1982, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington organized a retrospective exhibition of her work and Mr. Bartlett's that also traveled to the Art Institute. Feted among friends at a gala dinner in the gallery in Chicago, Mrs. Bartlett seemed delighted but made no speech. ''She was,'' Ms. Donnell said, ''much too shy for that.''         Correction:  July 4, 1997, Friday         An obituary of the art patron Evelyn Fortune Bartlett yesterday misidentified her first husband, Eli Lilly. He was the grandson and namesake of the founder of Eli Lilly & Company, not the founder.       
         Eleanor Doermann Larrabee, an architect who specialized in the construction and layout of libraries, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications from injuries suffered when struck by a car two weeks ago, her family said.         A Radcliffe College graduate, she received a master's degree in architecture from Columbia University. In 1955, she joined the architecture practice of Charles H. Warner Jr. of New York, and in 1963, she became an associate in WBTL Architects in Manhattan. She retired in 1992.         Her husband, Eric Larrabee, an author and educator, died in 1990. She is survived by two brothers, John H. Doermann of Salem, Mass., and Humphrey Doermann of St. Paul.       
         Corinne Roosevelt Alsop Chubb, who helped guide the Victoria Foundation, a family trust that fosters social services, education and the arts in Newark, since its inception in 1934, died on Dec. 9 at her farm in Chester, N.J. She was 85.         The Victoria Foundation was established by her father-in-law, Hendon Chubb, who named it in honor of his English-born mother. It has donated more than a billion dollars to individual charities and nonprofit organizations in Essex County.         Mrs. Chubb married into the family in 1932, when she became the wife of Percy Chubb 2d, a former chairman of the Chubb insurance underwriters group. She became active in the foundation's work in 1934, the year of its incorporation.         Mrs. Chubb was elected to the board in 1955 and was a trustee at her death. For more than six decades, she worked closely with the individuals, organizations and institutions whose programs the foundation helped finance.         She visited beneficiaries to evaluate their work as she carried out the foundation's oversight responsibilities. When the foundation began to focus on Newark's urban troubles at the end of the 1950's, she became a principal architect of its evolving programs in education.         Under her guidance, the foundation supported many classroom and scholarship programs in private and public schools, which offered opportunities to the children of the poor. In 1992, the foundation gave $2.5 million for the construction of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, which opened in the fall.         Other recent recipients include conservation projects as well as Emergency Services for Families, the Youth Development Clinic, the Kids Corporation, and the Chad School Foundation, all based in Newark.         Percy Chubb 2d died in 1982. Mrs. Chubb is survived by five sons, Hendon, of Cornwall, Conn.; Percy 3d, of Bernardsville, N.J., the president of the Victoria Foundation; Joseph, of Lechlade, Gloustershire, England; James, of Ketchum, Idaho, and Caldecot, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a daughter, Corinne Zimmermann, of Great Falls, Va.; 12 grandchildren, and 5 great-grandchildren.         Also surviving is a brother, John Alsop, of Old Lyme, Conn.
