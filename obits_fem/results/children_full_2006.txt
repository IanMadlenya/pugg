         Nellie Y. McKay, a distinguished scholar and critic who helped secure a place for African-American women in the modern literary canon, died last Sunday at a hospice in Fitchburg, Wis. She was a resident of Madison, Wis., and was believed to have been in her mid-70's.         The cause was cancer, said Craig Werner, chairman of the Afro-American studies department at the University of Wisconsin, where Ms. McKay was Evjue professor of American and African-American literature.         An authority on black American literature of the 19th and 20th centuries, Professor McKay specialized in the study of fiction, autobiography and, especially, women's writing. She was known in particular for the Norton Anthology of African American Literature, of which she was a general editor with Henry Louis Gates Jr.         ''She was the central figure in the establishing of black women's studies as a presence in academic and intellectual life,'' Professor Werner said in a telephone interview yesterday.         The anthology, published in 1997, was widely credited with codifying the black American literary canon for the first time. The book, which generated considerable attention in the news media, was assigned in college courses worldwide and also proved popular with a general readership. Nearly 200,000 copies are currently in print, the publisher said yesterday.         At more than 2,600 pages, the anthology spans black literature from the earliest Negro spirituals to late-20th-century writers like Gloria Naylor, Terry McMillan and Walter Mosley. It was published in a second edition in 2004, adding the work of younger writers like Edwidge Danticat and Colson Whitehead.         ''It's very necessary that we do this to establish the centrality of the African-American experience,'' Professor McKay told The New York Times in 1996. ''There needed to be a book that gave a coherent text of African-American literature.''         Nellie Yvonne Reynolds was born in Queens to parents who had come from Jamaica in the West Indies. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Queens College in 1969, a master's in English and American literature from Harvard in 1971 and a Ph.D. in the same field from Harvard in 1977. She joined the Wisconsin faculty the next year; at her death, she held a joint appointment in the English and Afro-American studies departments, and also taught in the women's studies department.         As she and her contemporaries discovered during their student years, it was nearly impossible to study literature by black writers, male or female, in a university classroom in the late 1960's. Students interested in the subject, as she often said afterward, had to learn from one another.         ''Today, no self-respecting English department would dare not teach African-American literature,'' Mr. Gates, the W. E. B. Du Bois professor of the humanities at Harvard, said in an interview. ''But when Nellie was a student, that wasn't the case. Black literature courses were few and far between.''         If black male writers were largely absent from the curriculum, black female writers were even more so. Professor Werner, of Wisconsin, recalled trying to assign Zora Neale Hurston's novel ''Their Eyes Were Watching God'' in the late 1970's, only to discover it was out of print.         That college students today routinely encounter Hurston, along with Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Rita Dove and many others, is due in no small part to Professor McKay's work, several of her colleagues said.         Among Professor McKay's other books are ''Jean Toomer, Artist: A Study of His Literary Life and Work, 1894-1936'' (University of North Carolina, 1984); ''Critical Essays on Toni Morrison'' (G. K. Hall, 1988), a collection she edited; and the Norton Critical Edition, published in 2001, of Harriet Jacobs's ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,'' which she edited with Frances Smith Foster.         Throughout her life, Professor McKay was circumspect about the date of her birth; accounts of her age in obituaries this week ranged from 59 to 75. In interviews yesterday, several colleagues said she had most likely been in her mid-70's.         Professor McKay, who was divorced as a young woman, is survived by a sister, Constance Prout of Hollywood, Fla.; two children, Patricia Watson of St. Louis and Harry McKay of New York; one grandchild; and one great-grandchild.       
         Wendy Wasserstein, who spoke for a generation of smart, driven but sometimes unsatisfied women in a series of popular plays that included the long-running Pulitzer Prize winner ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 55 and lived in New York.         The cause was complications of lymphoma, said Andr√© Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater.         Starting in 1977 with her breakthrough work, ''Uncommon Women and Others,'' Ms. Wasserstein's plays struck a profound chord with women struggling to reconcile a desire for romance and companionship, drummed into baby boomers by the seductive fantasies of Hollywood movies, with the need for intellectual independence and achievement separate from the personal sphere.         ''She was known for being a popular, funny playwright, but she was also a woman and a writer of deep conviction and political activism,'' Mr. Bishop said. ''In Wendy's plays women saw themselves portrayed in a way they hadn't been onstage before -- wittily, intelligently and seriously at the same time. We take that for granted now, but it was not the case 25 years ago. She was a real pioneer.''         The lights on Broadway are to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Her heroines -- intelligent and successful but also riddled with self-doubt -- sought enduring love a little ambivalently, but they didn't always find it, and their hard-earned sense of self-worth was often shadowed by the frustrating knowledge that American women's lives continued to be measured by their success at capturing the right man. Ms. Wasserstein drew on her own experience as a smart, well-educated, funny Manhattanite who wasn't particularly lucky in romance to create heroines in a similar mold, women who embraced the essential tenets of the feminist movement but didn't have the stomach for stridency.         For Ms. Wasserstein, as for many of her characters and fans, humor was a necessary bulwark against the disappointments of life, and a useful release valve for anger at cultural and social inequities. Her work, which included three books of nonfiction and a forthcoming novel as well as about a dozen plays, had a significant influence on depictions of American women in the media landscape over the years: Heidi Holland, the steadily single, uncompromising heroine of ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' can be seen as the cultural progenitor of ''Sex and the City's'' Carrie Bradshaw. (Coincidentally, Sarah Jessica Parker, who starred in that HBO series, played a series of small roles in the original production of ''The Heidi Chronicles.'')         Ms. Wasserstein, who grew up in New York, recalled attending Broadway plays as a young woman and being struck by the absence of people like herself onstage: ''I remember going to them and thinking, I really like this, but where are the girls?'' she once said. Ms. Wasserstein would fill the stage with ''girls'' -- a term she used with a wink despite taking flak for it -- in a series of plays that pleased loyal audiences even when the critics did not always embrace them.         ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' her most celebrated and popular play, opened on Broadway in 1989 after receiving critical acclaim Off Broadway. It ran for 622 performances and collected the Tony and New York Drama Critics Circle awards for best play as well as the Pulitzer Prize. Joan Allen created the title role in the play, which toured nationally and was later filmed for television with Jamie Lee Curtis.         Reviewing the play in Newsday, Linda Winer called it ''a wonderful and important play.'' She continued, ''Smart, compassionate, witty, courageous, this one not only dares to ask the hard questions  but asks them with humor, exquisite clarity and great fullness of heart.''         Ranging across more than two decades, ''The Heidi Chronicles'' was an episodic, seriocomic biography of an art historian seeking to establish a fixed and fulfilling sense of identity amid the social convolutions of the 1960's and 70's, a period when the rulebook on relationships between men and women was being rewritten. Heidi's allegiance to her ideals and her unwillingness to compromise them for the sake of winning a man's attentions caused conflict with friends who chose easier or different paths. Looking around at her materialistic, married, self-obsessed peers two decades after the exhilarating birth of feminism, Heidi observes: ''We're all concerned, intelligent, good women. It's just that I feel stranded. And I thought the whole point was that we wouldn't feel stranded. I thought the point was that we were all in this together.''         In the play's bittersweet final scene, Heidi has become a single mother to a new infant -- a path Ms. Wasserstein would herself pursue many years later, ultimately at great physical cost, when she gave birth, at age 48, to her daughter, Lucy Jane, in 1999.         Her next play, ''The Sisters Rosensweig,'' brought the issues of ethnicity and religion into her continuing conversation about the making and remaking of women's identities as it focused on three sisters with different relationships to their Jewish roots. It opened on Broadway in 1993, ran for 556 performances and was nominated for a Tony Award for best play. Less successful was her 1997 play, ''An American Daughter,'' inspired by the harsh attacks on women in politics, which lasted only 89 performances on Broadway, though Ms. Wasserstein later adapted it for television.         Ms. Wasserstein's other plays were produced Off Broadway, and included ''Isn't It Romantic'' (originally produced, to mixed notices, in 1981 and revised in 1983, when it was largely acclaimed) and ''Old Money'' (2000), a time-traveling comedy about the well heeled. Her most recent play, ''Third,'' about a female professor who is forced to question her staunchly held ideas about politics and ethics, opened in the fall at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center.         Ms. Wasserstein's abundant gift for comedy and her plays' popularity disguised the more serious ambitions underpinning her writing. ''My work is often thought of as lightweight commercial comedy,'' she told The Paris Review in 1997, ''and I have always thought, No, you don't understand: this is in fact a political act. 'The Sisters Rosensweig' had the largest advance in Broadway history,'' for a play (not a musical). Therefore, she continued, ''nobody is going to turn down a play on Broadway because a woman wrote it or because it's about women.'' When Ms. Wasserstein won the best-play Tony for ''Heidi Chronicles,'' it was the first time a woman had won the prize solo.         Ms. Wasserstein was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 18, 1950, the youngest of five siblings. Her father was a textile manufacturer, her mother an amateur dancer. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Wasserstein is survived by her mother, Lola Wasserstein; her brothers, Abner and Bruce, the chairman of the investment banking giant Lazard and the owner of New York magazine; and her sister Georgette Levis of Vermont. The family moved to Manhattan when Ms. Wasserstein was 12. After earning her undergraduate degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1971, she studied creative writing at City College with Joseph Heller and Israel Horovitz. Her first play, ''Any Woman Can't,'' found its way to Playwrights Horizons, then a small Off Broadway company, and was produced in 1973, shortly before she began to study playwriting in earnest at the Yale University School of Drama. (''My parents only let me go to drama school because it was Yale,'' she said in an interview for the magazine Bomb. ''They thought I'd marry a lawyer.'')         Ms. Wasserstein's career would be closely linked both with Playwrights Horizons, which under its artistic director, Mr. Bishop, would first produce ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' and with many of the artists she met at Yale, including the designer Heidi Ettinger and the director James Lapine, who remained lifelong friends. (Mr. Bishop left Playwrights Horizons to move to Lincoln Center Theater, which has produced all her subsequent plays.) Ms. Wasserstein's classmate, the playwright Christopher Durang, was a particular friend; she used his introductory icebreaker -- ''You look so bored, you must be very bright'' -- directly in ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' and they collaborated on a revue for the school's cabaret group.         After receiving a master's degree in fine arts in 1976, Ms. Wasserstein returned to Manhattan, and essentially never left. Her first major success came quickly, with ''Uncommon Women'' in 1977, produced by the Phoenix Theater. Depicting an informal reunion of a group of Mount Holyoke graduates that dissolves into scenes of their college days, it was described as ''funny, ironic and affectionate'' by Edith Oliver in The New Yorker, who added, ''Under the laughter there is  a feeling of bewilderment and disappointment over the world outside college, which promised so much, and with their own dreams, which seem to have stalled.'' The play, which was filmed and telecast on PBS's ''Great Performances,'' was also an important breakthrough in the careers of the actresses Glenn Close, Swoosie Kurtz and Meryl Streep, who played Ms. Close's role in the television version.         Ms. Wasserstein's other writing included a spoof of self-help literature, ''Sloth'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), and two books of essays, ''Bachelor Girls'' (Knopf, 1990) and ''Shiksa Goddess'' (Knopf, 2001), eclectic collections that embraced such disparate topics as Chekhov, her sister's battle with breast cancer, and the life and career of Mrs. Entenmann, creator of a bakery empire and fosterer of much guilt. Included in ''Shiksa Goddess'' was an essay Ms. Wasserstein wrote for The New Yorker, as poignant as it was hilarious, in which she discussed the medical complications of her late-life pregnancy and her newborn daughter's early struggles. ''Although I remain a religious skeptic,'' she wrote, referring to the disorienting days following Lucy Jane's premature birth, ''I had a kind of blind faith. I believed in the collaboration between the firm will of my one-pound-twelve-ounce daughter and the expertise of modern medicine. Of course, there was more than a bit of random luck involved, too.''         Lucy Jane will live with Ms. Wasserstein's brother Bruce.         Ms. Wasserstein also wrote a children's book, ''Pamela's First Musical,'' which she adapted for the stage in collaboration with Cy Coleman and David Zippel, and wrote the libretto for ''The Festival of Regrets,'' one of three one-act operas presented under the collective title ''Central Park'' at the New York City Opera. She had also completed a libretto for another opera with music by Deborah Drattell.         Ms. Wasserstein worked intermittently for Hollywood, although her sole produced screenplay credit was for ''The Object of My Affection,'' a 1998 romantic comedy that starred Jennifer Aniston. Her first novel, ''Elements of Style,'' is to be published by Knopf in April.         But the object of Ms. Wasserstein's deepest affection was always the stage, and her relationship with the theater permeated all aspects of her life. Her friendships in the theatrical community (and out of it) were wide and deep, and she generously gave of her time and resources to benefits of all kinds. A recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, she later served on the Guggenheim Foundation board, and she also taught playwriting at several universities.         In 1998, seeking to help instill her love for theater in a new generation of New Yorkers, she personally instigated a program to bring smart, underprivileged students from New York's public high schools to the theater. In an essay about the program for The New York Times, she wrote: ''As far as I'm concerned, every New Yorker is born with the inalienable right to ride the D train, shout 'Hey, lady!' with indignation and grow up going regularly to the theater. After all, if a city is fortunate enough to house an entire theater district, shouldn't access to the stage life within it be what makes coming of age in New York different from any other American city?''         The program, administered by the Theater Development Fund, has steadily expanded since Ms. Wasserstein first held a pizza party for eight students from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx after a matinee of ''On the Town.'' Now officially called Open Doors, it consists of 17 groups (more than 100 students), chaperoned to a season's worth of theater offerings by interested mentors.         Of course Ms. Wasserstein's devotion to theater took its purest and most enduring form in her writing for the stage, which allowed her the freedom to explore the evolving lives of American women with a fluidity and frankness that befitted the complex experience she was writing about. Although it was always laced with comedy, her work was also imbued with an abiding sadness, a cleareyed understanding that independence can beget loneliness, that rigorous ideals and raised consciousnesses are not always good company at the dinner table. But she shared her compassion among a wide array of characters, those who settled and those who continued to search.         ''No matter how lonely you get or how many birth announcements you receive,'' a character says in ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''the trick is not to get frightened. There's nothing wrong with being alone.'' The popularity of her work speaks for her ability to salve a little of that feeling of aloneness in her audiences with her deeply felt portraits of women -- and occasionally men -- seeking solidarity in their individuality, finding comfort in the knowledge that everybody else is sometimes uncomfortable with the choices they've made, too.       
         Joan Maynard, who shepherded the preservation of the remnants of Weeksville, a once-thriving 19th-century community of free blacks in Brooklyn that had faded from maps and memory, died on Sunday at her home in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. She was 77.         Her death was confirmed by Pamela Green, her successor as executive director of the Society for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford-Stuyvesant History.         The story of Weeksville's discovery and preservation sounds like a fairy tale with Ms. Maynard as its guardian angel. The settlement began in the 1830's when escaped slaves and free blacks bought property there. It quickly became a thriving community with schools, churches, an orphanage and one of the nation's first black newspapers, The Freedman's Torchlight.         Among the 19th-century residents of Weeksville was Susan McKinney Steward, who in 1870 became the first female African-American physician in New York State.         But by 1968, few remembered Weeksville, much less where it had been. A historian leading a workshop at Pratt Institute, James Hurley, had seen references to the community in archives, but in many walks he had found no sign of it.         Then, Joe Haynes, a volunteer pilot, took Mr. Hurley up in his plane to make an aerial photograph. It showed four wood-frame cottages hidden in an alley once called Hunterfly Road.         The same year, Ms. Maynard became a founding member of the Weeksville Society and served as president from 1972 until 1974, when she became executive director.         In 1969, college students and students from a nearby public school did an archaeological dig nearby and found artifacts that included a slave's shackles. The following year, a busload of schoolchildren, accompanied by experts, went to the city Landmarks Preservation Commission to ask that Weeksville be given landmark status.         That was granted. Weeksville was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.         The challenges to restoring Weeksville were numerous. A car crashed into one house, another had to be completely rebuilt, and vandals gutted another.         Ms. Maynard persisted, taking slides to scores of schools and community groups to win support. She pieced together financing from governments, corporations and children collecting pennies. She donated all her personal savings.         Decades of her hard work were rewarded in June 2005 when the houses of Weeksville were opened to the public after a $3 million renovation. At that time, the society changed its name to the Weeksville Heritage Center.         ''They look just like what they were meant to be,'' Charles Hill, who lived in the Kingsborough Houses across the street for many years said of the houses in an interview with The Daily News.         Such expressions of pride mattered to Ms. Maynard, whose oft-stated mission was nurturing a sense of identity among black children by concretely linking them to their history.         ''The kids have to learn they're not trash,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1991.         In a neighborhood that had seen its share of troubles, she pulled no punches: a tree she planted behind one of the cottages commemorated a murdered young man who was involved in Weeksville programs as a boy.         When some suggested that many more people could view the cottages if they were moved from the edge of Crown Heights, just south of Bedford-Stuyvesant, she refused.         ''It needs to be here, where many of the people have no knowledge of their own history,'' she told The Times in 1996.         Joan Cooper was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 29, 1928. Her father, John Cooper, a ventriloquist, and mother, the former Julia St. Bernard, told her stories about the oppression of blacks. In an interview with The Times in 1991, she recalled them discussing a newspaper story about the lynching of a pregnant black woman.         She graduated from Empire State College of the State University of New York and worked as a commercial artist for McGraw-Hill and other companies. She drew covers for Crisis, the publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, as well as comic book treatments of black history.         Among the many awards she received was the Louise DuPont Crowninshield Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, of which she had been a trustee. She retired in 1999, but continued to promote Weeksville.         Ms. Maynard was married twice, once to a man named Bacchus and once to one named Maynard, and divorced twice. Her son, Jerome, died before her, and she leaves no immediate survivors.         One of the items found in the archaeological digs at Weeksville was a tintype of a dignified woman, elegantly dressed in tidy hat, fitted bodice and spectacles. Ms. Maynard chose the image as the symbol of Weeksville.         ''When I look at her eyes, she talks to me,'' Ms. Maynard said. ''She says, 'I existed. I care.' ''       
         Andrea M. Bronfman, an internationally noted philanthropist, died on Monday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital in Manhattan. She was 60 and had homes in Manhattan; Palm Beach, Fla.; and Jerusalem.         The police said that Mrs. Bronfman died of injuries she sustained after she was struck by a livery cab early Monday morning while walking her dog on East 65th Street.         The wife of Charles R. Bronfman, of the Seagram empire, Mrs. Bronfman was a co-chairman of the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies. She was known in particular for her involvement with Jewish causes in the United States, Canada and Israel.         Mrs. Bronfman was also a founder of the Gift of New York, which through the spring of 2003 provided free tickets to cultural and sporting events to the families of Sept. 11 victims.         Andrea Brett Morrison, known as Andy, was born in London on May 30, 1945, the daughter of an American mother, Doris, and a Scottish father, Hyam, who ran a women's clothing business. Both were deeply involved in Jewish and Zionist affairs; frequent visitors to the family home included David Ben-Gurion, Shimon Peres and Golda Meir.         After working briefly as a secretary in London, Andrea married David Cohen, and moved with him to Canada. The marriage ended in divorce. She married Mr. Bronfman in 1982.         Mrs. Bronfman was a trustee of many organizations, among them the Jewish Museum and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. Her other work included founding the Association of Israel's Decorative Arts and creating a traveling exhibition, ''A Coat of Many Colours: Two Centuries of Jewish Life in Canada,'' which was shown in New York at the Jewish Museum in 1993.         Besides her husband, a retired co-chairman of the Seagram Company, Mrs. Bronfman is survived by a sister, Marcia Flanders, of Montreal; three children from her first marriage, Jeremy Cohen of Manhattan, Pippa Cohen of Manhattan and Tony Cohen of Toronto; two stepchildren, Stephen Bronfman of Montreal and Ellen Hauptman of Los Angeles; and six grandchildren.       
         Coretta Scott King, known first as the wife of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., then as his widow, then as an avid proselytizer for his vision of racial peace and nonviolent social change, died Monday at a hospital in Mexico. She was 78.         The primary cause of death was ''insufficient cardio-respiratory,'' which simply means her heart and breathing stopped, said Dr. Carlos Guerrero Tejada, who certified her death. The underlying causes were cerebral vascular disease and ovarian cancer, according to the death certificate.         Mrs. King died at Hospital Santa M√≥nica in Rosarito, Mexico, about 16 miles south of San Diego. She was admitted to the hospital last Thursday, said her sister, Edythe Scott Bagley. Mrs. Bagley said Mrs. King's body would be returned to her home, Atlanta, for entombment next to her husband, whose crypt is at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center there.         Mrs. King had been in failing health after a stroke and a heart attack last August. She appeared at a dinner honoring her husband on Jan. 14 but did not speak.         Andrew Young, a former United Nations ambassador and longtime family friend, said at a news conference yesterday morning that Mrs. King died in her sleep.         ''She was a woman born to struggle,'' Mr. Young said, ''and she has struggled and she has overcome.'' Mrs. King rose from rural poverty in Heiberger, Ala., and became an international symbol of the civil rights movement of the 1960's. She was an advocate for women's rights, the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, and other social and political issues.         In 1952, she was studying music at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston when she met a young graduate student in philosophy, who, on their first date, told her: ''The four things that I look for in a wife are character, personality, intelligence and beauty. And you have them all.'' A year later she and Dr. King, then a young minister from a prominent Atlanta family, were married, beginning a remarkable partnership that ended with Dr. King's assassination in Memphis on April 4, 1968.         Mrs. King did not hesitate to pick up his mantle, marching before her husband was even buried at the head of the striking garbage workers he had gone to Memphis to champion. She went on to lead the effort for a national holiday in his honor and to found the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social Change in Atlanta, dedicated both to scholarship and to activism.         In addition to dealing with her husband's death, which left her with four young children, Mrs. King faced other trials and controversies. She was at times viewed as chilly and aloof by others in the civil rights movement. The King Center was criticized as competing for funds and siphoning energy from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Dr. King had helped found. In recent years, the center had been widely viewed as adrift, characterized by squabbling within the family and a focus more on Dr. King's legacy than on continuing his work. Many allies were baffled and hurt by her campaign to exonerate James Earl Ray, who in 1969 pleaded guilty to her husband's murder, and her contention that Ray did not commit the crime.         More often, however, Mrs. King has been seen as an inspirational figure, a woman of enormous spiritual depth who came to personify the ideals Dr. King fought for.         ''She'll be remembered as a strong woman whose grace and dignity held up the image of her husband as a man of peace, of racial justice, of fairness,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, who helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with Dr. King and then served as its president for 20 years. ''I don't know that she was a civil rights leader in the truest sense, but she became a civil rights figure and a civil rights icon because of what she came to represent.''         Coretta Scott was born April 27, 1927, the second of three children born to Obadiah and Bernice Scott. She grew up in a two-room house that her father had built on land that had been owned by the family for three generations.         The family was poor, and she grew up picking cotton in the hot fields of the segregated South or doing housework. But Mr. Scott hauled timber, owned a country store and worked as a barber. His wife drove a school bus, and the whole family helped raise hogs, cows, chickens and vegetables. So, by the standards of blacks in Alabama at the time, the family had both resources and ambitions beyond the reach of most others.         Some of Coretta Scott's earliest insights into the injustice of segregation came as she walked to her one-room schoolhouse each day, watching buses of white children stir up dust as they passed. She got her first sense of the world beyond rural Alabama when she attended the Lincoln School, a private missionary institution in nearby Marion, where she studied piano and voice and had her first encounters with college-educated teachers, and where she resolved to flee to a world far beyond rural, segregated Alabama.         She graduated first in her high school class of 17 in 1945 and attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where, two years earlier, her older sister, Edythe, had been the first black to enroll. She studied education and music, and went on to the New England Conservatory of Music, hoping to become a classical singer. She worked as a mail order clerk and cleaned houses to augment a fellowship that barely paid her tuition.         A First Encounter         Her first encounter with the man who would become her husband did not begin auspiciously, as recounted in ''Parting the Waters,'' by Taylor Branch. Dr. King, in the market for a wife, called her after getting her name from a friend and announced: ''You know every Napoleon has his Waterloo. I'm like Napoleon. I'm at my Waterloo, and I'm on my knees.''         Ms. Scott, two years his elder, replied: ''That's absurd. You don't even know me.''         Still, she agreed to meet for lunch the next day, only to be put off initially that he was not taller. But she was impressed by his erudition and confidence, and he saw in her the refined, intelligent woman he was looking for to be the wife of a preacher from one of Atlanta's most prominent ministerial families.         When he proposed, she deliberated for six months before saying yes, and they were married in the garden of her parents' house on June 18, 1953. The 350 guests, big-city folks from Atlanta and rural neighbors from Alabama, made it the biggest wedding, white or black, the area had ever seen.         Even before the wedding she made it clear she intended to remain her own woman. She stunned Dr. King's father, who presided over the wedding, by demanding that the promise to obey her husband be removed from the wedding vows. Reluctantly, he went along. After the wedding, the bridegroom fell asleep in the car while the new Mrs. King drove back to Atlanta.         Mrs. King thought she was signing on for the ministry, not ground zero in the seismic cultural struggle that would soon shake the South. Her husband became minister of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery in 1954, but about a year later, the Montgomery Bus Boycott brought Dr. King to national attention. Then, like riders on a runaway freight train, the minister and his young wife found themselves in the middle of a movement that would transform the South and ripple through the nation.         In 1960, the family moved back to Atlanta, where Dr. King shared the pulpit of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church with his father.         With four young children to raise -- Yolanda, born in 1955; Martin III, in 1957; Dexter, in 1961; and Bernice, in 1963 -- and a movement dominated by men, Mrs. King mostly remained away from the front lines of the movement. But the danger was always there, including a brush with death when Dr. King was stabbed while autographing books in Harlem in 1958.         An Active Role         What role Mrs. King would play was a source of some tension. Wanting to be there for their children, she also wanted to be active in the movement. Dr. King was, she had said, traditional in his view of women and balked at the notion that she should be more conspicuous.         ''Martin was a very strong person, and in many ways had very traditional ideas about women,'' she told The New York Times Magazine in 1972.         She added: ''He'd say, 'I have no choice, I have to do this, but you haven't been called.' And I said, 'Can't you understand? You know I have an urge to serve just like you have.' ''         Still, he always described her as a partner in his mission, not just a supportive spouse. ''I wish I could say, to satisfy my masculine ego, that I led her down this path,'' he said in a 1967 interview. ''But I must say we went down together, because she was as actively involved and concerned when we met as she is now.''         She largely carved out her own niche, most prominently through more than 30 Freedom Concerts, at which she lectured, read poetry and sang to raise awareness of and money for the civil rights movement.         The division disappeared with Dr. King's assassination. Suddenly, she was not just a symbol of the nation's grief, but a woman devoted to carrying on her husband's work. How to do that was something that evolved over time.         Marching in Memphis was a dramatic statement, but Ralph Abernathy, one of Dr. King's lieutenants, was chosen to take over.         In stepping in for her husband after his death, Mrs. King at first used his own words as much as possible, as if her goal were simply to maintain his presence. But soon she developed her own language and her own causes. So, when she stood in for her husband at the Poor People's Campaign at the Lincoln Memorial on June 19, 1968, she spoke not just of his vision, but of hers, of gender as well as race. She called upon American women ''to unite and form a solid block of women power to fight the three great evils of racism, poverty and war.''         She joined the board of directors of the National Organization for Women and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and she became widely identified with a broad array of international human rights issues, rather than focusing primarily on race.         That broad view, she would argue, was completely in keeping with Dr. King's vision. To carry on that legacy, she focused on two tasks. The first was to have a national holiday established in Dr. King's honor, and the second was to build the center in Atlanta to honor his memory, continue his work and provide a research facility for scholars of his work and the civil rights era.         The first goal was achieved, despite much opposition, in 1983, when Congress approved a measure designating the third Monday in January as a federal holiday in honor of Dr. King, who was born in Atlanta on Jan. 15, 1929. President Ronald Reagan, who had long opposed the King Holiday as too expensive and inappropriate, signed the bill, but pointedly refrained from criticizing fellow Republicans like Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who had opposed Dr. King, saying he had consorted with Communists.         The holiday was first observed on Jan. 20, 1986.         The second goal, much more expensive, time consuming and elusive, remains a work in progress -- and a troubled one at that. When Mrs. King announced plans for a memorial in 1969, she envisioned a Lincolnesque tomb, an exhibition hall, the restoration of her husband's childhood home, institutes on nonviolent social change and Afro-American studies, a library building, an archives building and a museum of African-American life and culture. She envisioned a center that would be a haven for scholars and a training ground for advocates of nonviolent social change.         An Ambitious Struggle         Even friends say it may have been too ambitious a goal. Building the center was a major achievement, but many of Dr. King's allies, particularly the leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said it was draining scarce resources.         The center also struggled to find its mission. Critics worried that it had become a family enterprise, Dexter and Martin III vying for leadership. The problems became particularly acute after Mrs. King suffered a stroke and heart attack in August 2005. The brothers struggled for control over the center while she was recuperating.         Many supporters were saddened and baffled by the family's campaign on behalf of Mr. Ray, who confessed to killing Dr. King and then recanted. Mr. Ray was seeking a new trial when he died in 1998.         After Mr. Ray's death, Mrs. King issued a statement calling his death a tragedy for his family and for the nation and saying that a trial would have ''produced new revelations about the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. as well as establish the facts concerning Mr. Ray's innocence.''         Besides her four children and her sister, Edythe, of Cheyney, Pa., survivors include her brother, Obie Leonard Scott of Greensboro, Ala.         Mrs. King remained a beloved figure, often compared to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as a woman who overcame tragedy, held her family together and became an inspirational presence around the world.         Admirers said she bore her special burden -- being expected to carry on her husband's work and teachings -- with a sense of spirit and purpose that made her more than a symbol.         If picking up Dr. King's mantle was an impossible task, the relationship she shared with him was truly a partnership. ''I think on many points she educated me,'' Dr. King once said, and she never veered from the conviction, expressed throughout her life, that his dream was also hers.         ''I didn't learn my commitment from Martin,'' she told an interviewer. ''We just converged at a certain time.''         Correction:  February 17, 2006, Friday  An obituary of Coretta Scott King on Feb. 1 misstated the precedent set by her older sister, Edythe, at Antioch College, from which Mrs. King graduated. Her sister was the first to receive a scholarship under a program set up in 1945 to recruit minority students, not the first black to enroll.       
         Edna Lewis, the granddaughter of a former slave whose cookbooks revived the nearly forgotten genre of refined Southern cooking while offering a glimpse into African-American farm life in the early 20th century, died yesterday. She was 89.         Miss Lewis, as she was always called, died in her sleep in her home in Decatur, Ga., said Scott Peacock, her friend and caretaker. Mr. Peacock, a chef, had lived with Miss Lewis for more than six years, taking care of her as she grew frail.         Despite a quiet demeanor, Miss Lewis had a reach that extended from her family farm in Virginia, to left-wing politics in Manhattan to the birthplace of California cuisine.         Edna Lewis was born in a small settlement called Freetown in 1916, one of eight children. The farm had been granted to her grandfather, a freed slave. Growing, gathering and preparing food was more than just sustenance for the family; it was a form of entertainment. Without fancy cooking equipment, the family improvised, measuring baking powder on coins and cooking everything over wood.         In 1976, Miss Lewis turned the focused, close-to-nature cooking of her childhood into the first of her four books, ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' (Knopf). The book, considered a classic study of Southern cooking and one that sits on the shelves of America's best chefs, helped put an end to the knee-slapping, cornpone image of Southern food among many American cooks.         John T. Edge, the author and director of the Southern Foodways Alliance, said that because of her devotion to educating a nation about the nuances of Southern cooking, there was no question that the group's first lifetime achievement award, in 1999, would go to Miss Lewis.         He pointed to her recipe for shrimp and grits, a Southern classic. ''It's just butter and shrimp, but it requires great butter and great shrimp, and a puddle of that over stone-ground grits,'' he said. ''This pays homage to the frugal South, but it's also worthy of damask dinner cloth.''         Throughout her life, the politics of race and the swirl of New York drew Miss Lewis with a pull as strong as her Southern roots. She took a bus to New York when she was in her early 30's, eager for work but restricted by the racial attitudes of the times. An acquaintance found her a job in a laundry in Brooklyn, where she was assigned to an ironing board. She had never ironed and lasted three hours before a manager showed her to the door.         She sewed better than she ironed and was soon copying Dior dresses for Dorcas Avedon, then the wife of Richard Avedon. She made a dress for Marilyn Monroe, Mr. Peacock said, as well as the African-inspired dresses that became her signature.         In New York, she married Steve Kingston, a retired merchant seaman and a Communist. Shortly afterward, she became acquainted with John Nicholson, an antiques dealer who in 1949 decided to open a restaurant on the East Side of Manhattan. She became the cook, preparing cheese souffl√©s and roast chicken. Caf√© Nicholson became an instant success among fashionistas, bohemians and artists.         She remained at the restaurant until the late 1950's, during which she and her husband would argue over its bourgeois character.         ''He used to always say, 'This restaurant should be for ordinary people on the street. You're catering to capitalists,' '' Mr. Nicholson said in an interview with The New York Times in 2004. ''It was such a bore.'' Miss Lewis left Caf√© Nicolson in 1954, and the couple tried a number of ventures, including running a pheasant farm.         In the mid-1970's, while sidelined by a broken leg, Miss Lewis began writing a cookbook. With encouragement from Judith Jones, the cookbook editor at Knopf who also edited Julia Childs, Miss Lewis turned her handwritten pages into ''The Taste of Country Cooking.'' In 1979, Craig Claiborne of The Times said the book ''may well be the most entertaining regional cookbook in America.''         In a 1989 interview with The Times, Miss Lewis said: ''As a child in Virginia, I thought all food tasted delicious. After growing up, I didn't think food tasted the same, so it has been my lifelong effort to try and recapture those good flavors of the past.''         That dedication to purity of ingredients, taste and authenticity endeared her to Alice Waters and many other chefs. Ms. Waters, whose restaurant, Chez Panisse, in Berkeley defined California cuisine in the 1980's, said Miss Lewis was uncompromising but subtle in her approach to food and politics alike.         ''She just had a very quiet way of speaking, and it really engaged you because she was so soft-spoken; you have to listen carefully,'' Ms. Waters said. ''There was a kind of intimacy that you immediately had.''         Ms. Jones, who edited three books by Miss Lewis, recalled her yesterday as a lover of Jack Daniel's, Bessie Smith and understated conversation. ''She had a tremendous sense of dignity in the face of often difficult treatment,'' Ms. Jones said.         After ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' raised her profile, Miss Lewis returned to restaurants, most notably to Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn. She remained there for almost 20 years, retiring in 1995. Her husband had died as she completed her first book, Ms. Jones said.         Along with friends, she founded the Society for the Revival and Preservation of Southern Food, dedicated in part to seeing that people did not forget how to cook with lard.         One member of the group was Mr. Peacock, whom Miss Lewis met in 1990 while he was cooking at the Georgia governor's mansion. The two developed a deep friendship, collaborating on the book ''The Gift of Southern Cooking'' (Knopf) and teaching cooking classes. Their long association -- between a young, white, gay Southern chef and a widowed African-American doyenne -- earned them the nickname The Odd Couple of Southern Cooking.         As Miss Lewis aged, Mr. Peacock became her caretaker, causing a split with her surviving brothers and sisters, who waged an unsuccessful legal battle to move her to the family home in Unionville, Va., a town about 70 miles southwest of Washington.         Miss Lewis's dispute with her siblings became well known in the food world, most of whose members supported her and Mr. Peacock, seeing him as an eager student to a master of Southern cooking.         ''One of the biggest goals they had was that they didn't want to lose the classic Southern dishes, and this was the binding factor,'' Marion Cunningham, the grande dame of home cooking, said in an interview with The Times in 2004. ''They preached about it, and they wanted to let the country know what the South stood for.''         One sister, Ruth Lewis Smith, and a brother, George Lewis, both of Unionville, survive Miss Lewis, as does a stepsister, Bessie Jones of Philadelphia. She is also survived by Dr. Afeworki Paulos, a lecturer at the University of Michigan, whom she adopted as a young adult in 1986 shortly after he had arrived from Eritrea to study in the United States.         Dr. Paulos said his mother possessed a clear-headed sense of equality and fairness. ''I always say, yeah, the cooking is there,'' he said yesterday, ''but the way I remember her is as a woman who was very deeply involved in social issues.''         Mr. Peacock plans to hold a private memorial service for Miss Lewis in the Atlanta area. She will be buried in a family plot in Unionville.         Correction:  February 16, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about Edna Lewis, the chef and author who wrote about refined Southern cuisine, misstated the order of her cookbooks. Her most famous one, ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' (Knopf, 1976), was her second, not her first. ''The Edna Lewis Cookbook'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1972) was her first.         Because of an editing error, the obituary misstated Miss Lewis's tenure as chef at Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn. It was 5 years, not 20. In some copies, also because of an editing error, the obituary misstated the surname of the cookbook author who, like Miss Lewis, had been edited by Judith Jones at Knopf. She was Julia Child, not Childs.       
         Peggy Appiah, who as a daughter of a British chancellor of the exchequer defied the conventions of her time by marrying an Ashanti political leader and who went on to become an author and a revered figure in her adopted homeland, Ghana, died Saturday in Kumasi, Ghana. She was 84.         The cause was a heart attack at Akomfo Anokye Hospital, according to her son, the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah.         Reared in upper-crust Britain, the youngest of four children of Sir Stafford Cripps, a Labor party leader and cabinet officer in the Clement Attlee government (1945-51), Peggy Cripps caused an international sensation when she announced plans to marry in July 1953. Her fianc√© was Joseph Emmanuel Appiah, who was in London as a law student and representative of Kwame Nkrumah, prime minister of the Gold Coast, the British colony that became Ghana in 1957.         Nkrumah was Ghana's first president, and Mr. Appiah was a close associate and his choice for vice president, until political differences led Nkrumah to imprison him several times.         The Appiahs are said to have been the inspiration, along with another African-British couple, Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams, for the 1967 film ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' which dealt with a California couple's reaction to their daughter's engagement to a black doctor.         That view was lent support by Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the department of African and African-American studies at Harvard, and a friend of Mr. Appiah's since their student days, who noted that it was a marriage of equals at the highest levels of their societies.         ''She was to the manner born and he was an aristocrat related to the king of the Ashanti,'' Mr. Gates said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ''He was the John Adams of his country; its founding father with Kwame Nkrumah.''         The couple met at a gathering of the West African Students Union, of which Mr. Appiah was president. From the start, Miss Cripps made it clear that she would not be intimidated by the firestorm of criticism the couple endured.         ''If we experience any difficulties in mixing with Europeans, I shall throw in my lot with the colored people,'' she told The Sunday Express of London.         The marriage came to symbolize far more than the union of two individuals. Richard Weight, a British historian who is making a documentary about interracial marriage, said: ''For a lot of people, it drew the line between those who thought Britain had an integrated postcolonial future and those who didn't. And it became an international story with particular resonance because it involved the daughter of a former chancellor.''         Born in 1921, Enid Margaret Cripps, who used the name Peggy, was the youngest of four children of Sir Stafford and Lady Isobel Swithenbank Cripps. On her father's side she could trace her lineage back to William the Conqueror. She was reared at a rambling country house, Goodfellows, and spent much of World War II in Moscow, where her father served as ambassador. After the war, she went to Iran, where she worked for the British Army, which ran the railways.         She is survived by her son, the Laurance Rockefeller professor of philosophy at Princeton, who lives in Manhattan and Princeton, N.J., and three daughters, Isabel Endresen, an economist, of Windhoek, Namibia, Adwo Edun, a landscape gardener, of Lagos, Nigeria, and Abena Appiah of Kumasi; and eight grandchildren. Settling in Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti people, shortly after her wedding, she shunned the traditional British -- and Ghanaian-- role of homemaker, even as she reared her children, served as helpmate to her husband, kept the family going when he was in prison and established several philanthropies.         ''At one time there was an effort to deport her,'' said Henry Finder, editorial director of The New Yorker, who is Professor Appiah's companion. ''She said the airport was a long way away and she would kick and scream every inch of the way. Fearful of the publicity that would engender, they backed down.''         Known to many in Ghana as Auntie Peggy, Mrs. Appiah was a prolific writer of children's books, many of them based on the Ghanaian folk tales her husband told their children, as well as of novels, poetry and most recently a collection of 7,000 Ashanti proverbs, on which she collaborated with her son.         The book, published in English and Ashanti, had its origins in her collection of gold weights.         ''She collected weights used for weighing gold but made of brass,'' Professor Appiah said. ''Many of them had figurative art that came from proverbs. When a dealer came to the house, she would ask, 'What is the proverb?' and if he didn't know, she would eventually travel to the village to find out.''         Though she had a house in Brighton, England, Mrs. Appiah considered Ghana her home.         ''When my father died 15 years ago, people asked her, 'When are you going home?' '' her son said. ''She kept saying, 'I am home.' Finally she bought herself a plot of ground to be buried in, so when people said, 'When are you going home?,' she could answer: 'I am not going home. I have my burial plot here.' ''       
         Emilie Neumann Muse, who as a young woman exemplified the crazy, flamboyant competitiveness of the 20's and 30's by swimming in treacherous waters, wrestling alligators, jumping out of airplanes and being buried alive, died on Jan. 23 in East Patchogue, N.Y. She was 98.         The cause was complications of a stroke, her granddaughter Loretta Muse Dill said.         In later decades, Mrs. Muse was a dedicated homemaker whose interests included beekeeping and gardening. Her husband, Fred, did not want their children to know of her daredevil past for fear it might prove overly inspirational, and she herself did not share her stories until they were adults.         But the young Miss Neumann (pronounced NOY-man) exuberantly followed in the footsteps of Gertrude Ederle, also a longtime Bronx resident with a German background, who in 1926 became the first woman to swim the English Channel. In an epoch when breaking records and stretching human achievement were national passions, Miss Neumann in 1929 swam across the East River at the treacherous stretch known as Hell Gate and two weeks later swam for 24 hours straight in tidal waters.         Why?         ''For no reason at all, except that she wanted to be able to say that she had accomplished such a difficult feat,'' The New York Daily News said in the caption to a picture on Aug. 12, 1929.         Things quickly got more interesting, pretty much from the moment Miss Neumann met a man who called himself Alligator Jim because of his vocation of wrestling alligators for money.         Ms. Dill said no one in the family knows -- if anyone was ever told -- how her grandmother met the man. Alligator Jim soon taught Miss Neumann how to fly a plane, to parachute and land on a tiny target, and to wrestle alligators (as proved by a picture in The Albany Times Union on June 13, 1932). He then hit on the idea of burying her alive.         On Nov. 9, 1932, a Wednesday evening, Miss Neumann was buried at a marathon dance contest at the Casino ballroom in Reading, Pa. She weighed 125 pounds; when she was excavated 97 hours later, at 10 p.m. on Nov. 13, she weighed 114 and was very, very hungry.         She was also buried at air shows and other entertainment venues, as attested to by the many clippings in her scrapbook. At these times, she lay in a coffin with a glass window so people could gaze down at her.         Ms. Dill said she believed her grandmother followed Alligator Jim for a few action-packed years. She thinks he was in love with her, but is pretty sure the feeling was not reciprocated.         Romance came a few years later when Miss Neumann met Friedrich Wilhelm Muse, a ship's electrician who, while in port, happened by a bakery owned by family members. She was not initially enamored of Mr. Muse, but her competitive juices surged when her best friend, an attractive Frenchwoman, fell for him.         Mrs. Muse and the man who legally changed his name to Fred had four children and owned four homes when he died in 1975. Mrs. Muse is survived by two daughters, Juanita Fenninger and Diane Tax, both of Mahopac, N.Y.; a son, Robert Muse; eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. Her son, Richard, died in 2002.         Emilie Neumann Muse was born on Jan. 14, 1908, in Bremen, Germany, and grew up in the Bronx when horses and buggies were a common sight. ''I'll try anything once,'' she liked to say. ''I'll taste it, I'll try it, I'll do it once.''         Correction:  March 8, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Feb. 26 about Emilie Neumann Muse, an adventurer and stuntwoman, misstated the date of her death and her husband's occupation. She died on Jan. 30, not Jan. 23, and her husband, the late Fred Muse, was a mechanical engineer, not a ship's electrician. The obituary also omitted the residence of her son, Robert. He lives in Mastic Beach, N.Y.       
         Moira Shearer, a luminous star in the galaxy of British ballerinas who brought the Royal Ballet to international attention and whose dramatic portrayal as the doomed heroine of the 1948 film ''The Red Shoes'' was searingly impressed on generations of moviegoers, died in Oxford, England, on Tuesday. She was 80.         Her death was announced by her husband, the writer and broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy. He said Ms. Shearer had been weak since her birthday last month and died in John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, The Associated Press reported.         ''The Red Shoes,'' often called the most popular film about ballet, threatened to overshadow Ms. Shearer's reputation as a classical dancer. A Scottish beauty with flaming red hair, she created a sensation with her performance as a London debutante who aspires to be a ballerina but is driven to suicide by leaping in front of a train in Monte Carlo.         As Ms. Shearer said in later years, ''The Red Shoes'' was very different from the world of ballet that she knew. The image created by the film's directors, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, was of a Russian √©migr√© ballet troupe filled with clashing temperaments. Dominated by a tyrannical impresario inspired in part by Serge Diaghilev, the troupe's backstage life had the ring of overwrought truth. But unlike the film's heroine, Victoria Page, Ms. Shearer did not face a seemingly impossible choice between a career and a marriage. During her dancing career, she acted in films and on the stage. In later years, she wrote two books, including ''Balletmaster: A Dancer's View of George Balanchine'' (1986), and wrote a column for The Daily Telegraph.         She also had four children, who, with her husband, survive her. They include a son, Alastair, and three daughters, Ailsa, Rachel and Fiona.         The recently established British ballet groups that Ms. Shearer joined in the 1940's were identified with hard work and struggle, devoid of the surface glamour of the √©migr√© companies that succeeded Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. After dancing with Mona Inglesby's Ballet International in 1941, Ms. Shearer joined Sadler's Wells Ballet, which changed its name to the Royal Ballet in 1956. Rising from the ranks to ballerina from 1942 to 1952, Ms. Shearer was identified both with leading roles in the 19th-century classics and works created by the great British choreographer Frederick Ashton. She danced the title role in the premiere of his ''Cinderella'' in 1948 and along with Margot Fonteyn and Pamela May, led his seminal neoclassical ballet ''Symphonic Variations'' in 1946.         Ms. Shearer, however, was never considered the reigning ballerina in Sadler's Wells. That position was clearly held by Ms. Fonteyn, who was promoted from the start by Ninette de Valois, the company's founder. At least two generations of stellar dancers, including Ms. May, Ms. Shearer, Beryl Grey, Violetta Elvin and Nadia Nerina all shared roles with Ms. Fonteyn but not her status in the company.         Born Moira Shearer King on Jan. 17, 1926, in Dumferline, Scotland, she trained with the Russian teacher Nicholas Legat and at the Sadler's Wells School. Ashton brought her to the public's attention with a major role as Pride in his ballet ''The Quest'' in 1943. She was reluctant to appear in ''The Red Shoes'' but did so at de Valois's prodding. When the Sadler's Wells Ballet made its sensational United States debut at the Metropolitan Opera House in September 1949, ticket buyers knew Ms. Shearer from ''The Red Shoes'' and thought she would be seen in ''The Sleeping Beauty'' on opening night. De Valois, however, cast her in the fourth act in the ''Bluebird'' pas de deux.         Shortly afterward (1950) she appeared in a film version of ''The Tales of Hoffmann,'' making several other films later with and without dancing. She also appeared as a guest artist with Sadler's Wells and with Roland Petit's company. In 1954, she toured the United States as Titania in the Old Vic stage production of ''A Midsummer's Night's Dream.'' Among her other films were ''Peeping Tom,'' ''The Man Who Loved Redheads,'' ''The Story of Three Loves'' and ''Black Tights.''         Multitalented, she was seen by John Martin of The New York Times in Ashton's ''Wedding Bouquet'' in 1949 as exhibiting ''her roguish gift for comedy in a brilliant performance.''         Correction:  March 23, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Feb. 2 about the ballerina and movie actress Moira Shearer misspelled the name of the city where she was born. As a reader pointed out to The Times this week, it is Dunfermline, Scotland, not Dumferline.       
         Jill Chaifetz, a lawyer who as the executive director of the nonprofit legal group Advocates for Children of New York turned it into a force for reform in the nation's largest school system, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 41.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her brother, Lawrence Chaifetz, said.         In 1998, Ms. Chaifetz joined Advocates for Children, which defends the legal rights of students in public education, and in her time there she quadrupled its staff and budget. One of its goals was the enforcement of standards for the city school system, with 1.1 million students, most of them living in poverty. She sought to empower families who were otherwise without legal resources.         Advocates for Children, which is based in Manhattan, produced many policy papers and reports under Ms. Chaifetz's direction and provided free legal help to students who claimed they were being denied proper educations and services.         In 2003, in one of their most important cases, Ms. Chaifetz and Advocates for Children filed lawsuits against three city high schools, charging that they illegally discharged or turned away students because of their ages, poor grades, poor attendance or pregnancy. Ms. Chaifetz said that the schools had been pushing out many struggling students in reaction to new state standards that judged schools on what percentage of students passed state exams needed to graduate.         After months of skirmishing, the city settled the suits in 2004 and agreed to take back students who had been discharged.         In a memorandum about the settlement, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court said the principles involved, accepted by the city, ''set an important standard for the entire system.'' The cases, he said, ''exposed a lesion -- the alleged 'pushing out' of difficult-to-educate students -- that has been festering for many years.''         Joel I. Klein, the city schools chancellor, whose administration was almost always on the other side of Ms. Chaifetz's recent arguments, said yesterday: ''Jill was an extraordinarily dedicated and effective children's advocate who worked tirelessly to ensure that school reform reached every child. She had a special affinity for the most vulnerable and those who most need a voice, especially children with special needs and English-language learners.''         Ms. Chaifetz worked to help change what she saw as an ingrained culture of discrimination against poor youth.         ''I think kids are one of the last groups of people to be recognized as having fully developed rights,'' she said in an interview in the alumni bulletin of her undergraduate school, Swarthmore College, in September.         Ms. Chaifetz was also an adjunct professor at Fordham University School of Law.         Ms. Chaifetz was born in New York City on July 24, 1964. She received her undergraduate degree with honors in political science from Swarthmore in 1986 and a law degree from New York University School of Law in 1989.         Before leading Advocates for Children, Ms. Chaifetz established the legal department at the Door, a youth development agency in Manhattan, where she worked from 1992 to 1998. She had previously worked as the legislative attorney for the New York City Council and as program director of a project that helped match law students to needy causes.         Besides her brother, her survivors include her husband, Daniel Seltzer, and their 10-year-old triplets, a daughter, Leila, and two sons, Isaac and Milo, who all have the last name Selchaif; and her parents, Marilyn and Malcolm Chaifetz.       
         Tana Hoban, an accomplished photographer of children who turned her photography into an innovative kind of illustration for books for the youngest audiences, died on Jan. 27 at a hospice in suburban Paris. She was 88 and had been living in Paris for the last 23 years.         Her death was announced by her husband, Robert G. Morris, a photo editor, who said it followed a long illness.         Beginning in 1970, Ms. Hoban wrote, designed, illustrated and published 110 or more titles, a score of them in print, which won dozens of awards. Most were issued by Greenwillow Books, an imprint of the HarperCollins Children's Book Group.         They ranged from alphabet books, like ''A, B, See!'' (1982), to primers for life beyond the nursery, like ''26 Letters and 99 Cents'' (1986); from ''Circles, Colors and Squares'' (1974) to ''Is It Larger? Is It Smaller?'' (1985); ''More Than One'' (1981) to ''I Read Symbols'' (1984).         ''So Many Circles, So Many Squares'' (1998), illustrated with her photographs, educated children to simple geometric shapes. Other recent books, in print, were ''Let's Count'' (1999) and ''Cubes, Cones, Cylinders and Spheres'' (2000).         She offered young readers photo images of things they would encounter as they ventured forth, as in ''Animal, Vegetable or Mineral?'' (1995), with her text and photos. She did the same in telling about demolition and construction machinery in ''Construction Zone'' (1997).         Among Ms. Hoban's early works was an illustrated do-it-yourselfer, ''How to Photograph Your Child'' (Crown, 1953). She contributed to the Greystone Encyclopedia of Photography (1963), and her pictures appeared in books by other authors as well.         Tana Hoban was born in Philadelphia and graduated in 1938 from the School of Design for Women, which is now Moore College of Art and Design. She won a scholarship that took her to England and the Netherlands, and soon turned to magazine illustration and photography.         Her photographs of children prompted Edward Steichen to display them at the Museum of Modern Art for the first of various exhibitions mounted in Philadelphia, New York, Paris and Berlin. In 1970 she progressed from photographs of children to photographs for children.         Ms. Hoban's first marriage, to Edward E. Gallob, a photographer, ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Morris, whom she married 23 years ago, she is survived by a daughter from the earlier marriage, Miela Ford of Rochester; a brother, the writer Russell Hoban, of London; a granddaughter; and one great-granddaughter.         ''My books are about everyday things that are so ordinary that one tends to overlook them,'' Ms. Hoban once wrote about her work. ''I try to rediscover these things and share them with children. But there is more to each picture than a first look reveals. I always try to include something new, something to reach for.''         Correction:  February 6, 2006, Monday  An obituary on Saturday about Tana Hoban, a photographer and an illustrator of children's books, misstated the given name of her husband. He is John G. Morris, not Robert Morris.       
         Betty Friedan, the feminist crusader and author whose searing first book, ''The Feminine Mystique,'' ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963 and as a result permanently transformed the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world, died yesterday, her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Emily Bazelon, a family spokeswoman.         With its impassioned yet clear-eyed analysis of the issues that affected women's lives in the decades after World War II -- including enforced domesticity, limited career prospects and, as chronicled in later editions, the campaign for legalized abortion -- ''The Feminine Mystique'' is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century. Published by W. W. Norton & Company, the book had sold more than three million copies by the year 2000 and has been translated into many languages.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' made Ms. Friedan world famous. It also made her one of the chief architects of the women's liberation movement of the late 1960's and afterward, a sweeping social upheaval that harked back to the suffrage campaigns of the turn of the century and would be called feminism's second wave.         In 1966, Ms. Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women, serving as its first president. In 1969, she was a founder of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, now known as Naral Pro-Choice America. With Gloria Steinem, Bella Abzug and others, she founded the National Women's Political Caucus in 1971.         Though in later years, some feminists dismissed Ms. Friedan's work as outmoded, a great many aspects of modern life that seem routine today -- from unisex Help Wanted ads to women in politics, medicine, the clergy and the military -- are the direct result of the hard-won advances she helped women attain.         For decades a familiar presence on television and the lecture circuit, Ms. Friedan, with her short stature and deeply hooded eyes, looked for much of her adult life like a ''combination of Hermione Gingold and Bette Davis,'' as Judy Klemesrud wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1970.         A brilliant student who graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1942, Ms. Friedan trained as a psychologist but never pursued a career in the field. When she wrote ''The Feminine Mystique,'' she was a suburban housewife and mother who supplemented her husband's income by writing freelance articles for women's magazines.         Though Ms. Friedan was not generally considered a lyrical stylist, ''The Feminine Mystique,'' read today, is as mesmerizing as it was more than four decades ago:         ''Gradually, without seeing it clearly for quite a while, I came to realize that something is very wrong with the way American women are trying to live their lives today,'' Ms. Friedan wrote in the opening line of the preface. ''I sensed it first as a question mark in my own life, as a wife and mother of three small children, half-guiltily, and therefore half-heartedly, almost in spite of myself, using my abilities and education in work that took me away from home.''         The words have the hypnotic pull of a fairy tale, and for the next 400 pages, Ms. Friedan identifies, dissects and damningly indicts one of the most pervasive folk beliefs of postwar American life: the myth of suburban women's domestic fulfillment she came to call the feminine mystique.         Drawing on history, psychology, sociology and economics, as well as on interviews she conducted with women across the country, Ms. Friedan charted a gradual metamorphosis of the American woman from the independent, career-minded New Woman of the 1920's and 30's into the vacant, aproned housewife of the postwar years.         The portrait she painted was chilling. For a typical woman of the 1950's, even a college-educated one, life centered almost exclusively on chores and children. She cooked and baked and bandaged and chauffeured and laundered and sewed. She did the mopping and the marketing and took her husband's gray flannel suit to the cleaners. She was happy to keep his dinner warm till he came wearily home from downtown.         The life she led, if educators, psychologists and the mass media were to be believed, was the fulfillment of every women's most ardent dream. Yet she was unaccountably tired, impatient with the children, craving something that neither marital sex nor extramarital affairs could satisfy. Her thoughts sometimes turned to suicide. She consulted a spate of doctors and psychiatrists, who prescribed charity work, bowling and bridge. If those failed, there were always tranquilizers to get her through her busy day.         A Nebraska housewife with a Ph.D. in anthropology whom Ms. Friedan interviewed told her:         ''A film made of any typical morning in my house would look like an old Marx Brothers comedy. I wash the dishes, rush the older children off to school, dash out in the yard to cultivate the chrysanthemums, run back in to make a phone call about a committee meeting, help the youngest child build a blockhouse, spend fifteen minutes skimming the newspapers so I can be well-informed, then scamper down to the washing machines where my thrice-weekly laundry includes enough clothes to keep a primitive village going for an entire year. By noon I'm ready for a padded cell. Very little of what I've done has been really necessary or important. Outside pressures lash me though the day. Yet I look upon myself as one of the more relaxed housewives in the neighborhood.''         ''The Feminine Mystique'' began as a survey Ms. Friedan conducted in 1957 for the 15th reunion of her graduating class at Smith. It was intended to refute a prevailing postwar myth: that higher education kept women from adapting to their roles as wives and mothers. Judging from her own capable life, Ms. Friedan expected her classmates to describe theirs as similarly well adjusted. But what she discovered in the women's responses was something far more complex, and more troubling -- a ''nameless, aching dissatisfaction'' that she would famously call ''the problem that has no name.''         When Ms. Friedan sent the same questionnaire to graduates of Radcliffe and other colleges, and later interviewed scores of women personally, the results were the same. The women's answers gave her the seeds of her book. They also forced her to confront the painful limitations of her own suburban idyll.         Bettye Naomi Goldstein was born on Feb. 4, 1921, in Peoria, Ill. Her father, Harry, was an immigrant from Russia who parlayed a street-corner collar-button business into a prosperous downtown jewelry store. Her gifted, imperious mother, Miriam, had been the editor of the women's page of the local newspaper before giving up her job for marriage and children. Only years later, when she was writing ''The Feminine Mystique,'' did Ms. Friedan come to see her mother's cold, critical demeanor as masking a deep bitterness at giving up the work she loved.         Growing up brainy, Jewish, outspoken and, by the standards of the time, unlovely, Bettye was ostracized. She was barred from the fashionable sororities at her Peoria high school and rarely asked on dates. It was an experience, she would later say, that made her identify with people on the margins of society.         At Smith, she blossomed. For the first time, she could be as smart as she wanted, as impassioned as she wanted and as loud as she wanted, and for four happy years she was all those things. Betty received her bachelor's degree in 1942 -- by that timeshe had dropped the final ''e,'' which she considered an affectation of her mother's -- and accepted a fellowship to the University of California, Berkeley, for graduate work in psychology.         At Berkeley, she studied with the renowned psychologist Erik Erikson, among others. She won a second fellowship, even more prestigious than the first, that would allow her to continue for a doctorate. But she was dating a young physicist who felt threatened by her success. He pressured her to turn down the fellowship, and she did, an experience she would later recount frequently in interviews. She also turned down the physicist, returning home to Peoria before moving to Greenwich Village in New York.         There, Ms. Friedan worked as an editor at The Federated Press, a small news service that provided stories to labor newspapers nationwide. In 1946, she took a job as a reporter with U. E. News, the weekly publication of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America.         In 1947, she married Carl Friedan, a theater director who later became an advertising executive. They started a family and moved to a rambling Victorian house in suburban Rockland County, N.Y.         Ms. Friedan, whose marriage would end in divorce in 1969, is survived by their three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton, N.J.; Emily Friedan of Buffalo; and Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia; a brother, Harry Goldstein, of Palm Springs, Calif., and Purchase, N.Y.; a sister, Amy Adams, of New York City; and nine grandchildren.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' had the misfortune to appear during a newspaper printers' strike. The reviews that appeared afterward ran the gamut from bewildered to outraged to cautiously laudatory. Some critics also felt that Ms. Friedan had insufficiently acknowledged her debt to Simone de Beauvoir, whose 1949 book, ''The Second Sex,'' dealt with many of the same issues.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review in April 1963, Lucy Freeman called ''The Feminine Mystique'' a ''highly readable, provocative book,'' but went on to question its basic premise, writing, of Ms. Friedan:         ''Sweeping generalities, in which this book necessarily abounds, may hold a certain amount of truth but often obscure the deeper issues. It is superficial to blame the 'culture' and its handmaidens, the women's magazines, as she does. What is to stop a woman who is interested in national and international affairs from reading magazines that deal with those subjects? To paraphrase a famous line, 'The fault, dear Mrs. Friedan, is not in our culture, but in ourselves.' ''         Among readers, however, the response to the book was so overwhelming that Ms. Friedan realized she needed more than words to address the condition of women's lives. After moving back to Manhattan with her family, she determined to start a progressive organization that would be the equivalent, as she often said, of an N.A.A.C.P. for women.         In 1966, Ms. Friedan and a group of colleagues founded the National Organization for Women. She was its president until 1970.         One of NOW's most visible public actions was the Women's Strike for Equality, held on Aug. 26, 1970, in New York and in cities around the country. In New York, tens of thousands of woman marched down Fifth Avenue, with Ms. Friedan in the lead. (Before the march, she made a point of lunching at Whyte's, a downtown restaurant formerly open to men only.)         Carrying signs and banners (''Don't Cook Dinner -- Starve a Rat Tonight!'' ''Don't Iron While the Strike Is Hot''), women of all ages, along with a number of sympathetic men, marched joyfully down the street to cheering crowds. The march ended with a rally in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, with passionate speeches by Ms. Friedan, Ms. Steinem, Ms. Abzug and Kate Millett.         Not all of Ms. Friedan's ventures were as successful. The First Women's Bank and Trust Company, which she helped found in 1973, is no longer in business. Nor were even her indomitable presence and relentless energy enough to secure passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.         Though widely respected as a modern-day heroine, Ms. Friedan was by no means universally beloved, even -- or perhaps especially -- by members of the women's movement. She was famously abrasive. She could be thin-skinned and imperious, subject to screaming fits of temperament.         In the 1970's and afterward, some feminists criticized Ms. Friedan for focusing almost exclusively on the concerns of middle-class married white women and ignoring those of minorities, lesbians and the poor. Some called her retrograde for insisting that women could, and should, live in collaborative partnership with men.         Ms. Friedan's private life was also famously stormy. In her recent memoir, ''Life So Far'' (Simon & Schuster, 2000), she accused her husband of being physically abusive during their marriage, writing that he sometimes gave her black eyes, which she concealed with make-up at public events and on television.         Mr. Friedan, who died in December, repeatedly denied the accusations. In an interview with Time magazine in 2000, shortly after the memoir's publication, he called Ms. Friedan's account a ''complete fabrication.'' He added: ''I am the innocent victim of a drive-by shooting by a reckless driver savagely aiming at the whole male gender.''         Ms. Friedan's other books include ''It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement'' (Random House, 1976); ''The Second Stage'' (Summit, 1981); and ''The Fountain of Age'' (Simon & Schuster, 1993).         The recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, she was a visiting professor at universities around the country, among them Columbia, Temple and the University of Southern California. In recent years, Ms. Friedan was associated with the Institute for Women and Work at Cornell University.         Despite all of her later achievements, Ms. Friedan would be forever known as the suburban housewife who started a revolution with ''The Feminine Mystique.'' Rarely has a single book been responsible for such sweeping, tumultuous and continuing social transformation.         The new society Ms. Friedan proposed, founded on the notion that men and women were created equal, represented such a drastic upending of the prevailing social norms that over the years to come, she would be forced to explain her position again and again.         ''Some people think I'm saying, 'Women of the world unite -- you have nothing to lose but your men,' '' she told Life magazine in 1963. ''It's not true. You have nothing to lose but your vacuum cleaners.''         Correction:  February 8, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Monday and in some copies on Sunday about Betty Friedan, the pioneering feminist who wrote ''The Feminine Mystique,'' misstated the residence of her sister, Amy Adams. It is Chapel Hill, N.C., not New York City.

In her recent memoir, ''Life So Far'' (Simon & Schuster, 2000), she accused her husband of being physically abusive during their marriage, writing that he sometimes gave her black eyes, which she concealed with make-up at public events and on television.         Mr. Friedan, who died in December, repeatedly denied the accusations. In an interview with Time magazine in 2000, shortly after the memoir's publication, he called Ms. Friedan's account a ''complete fabrication.'' He added: ''I am the innocent victim of a drive-by shooting by a reckless driver savagely aiming at the whole male gender.''         Ms. Friedan's other books include ''It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement'' (Random House, 1976); ''The Second Stage'' (Summit, 1981); and ''The Fountain of Age'' (Simon & Schuster, 1993).         The recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, she was a visiting professor at universities around the country, among them Columbia, Temple and the University of Southern California. In recent years, Ms. Friedan was associated with the Institute for Women and Work at Cornell University.         Despite all of her later achievements, Ms. Friedan would be forever known as the suburban housewife who started a revolution with ''The Feminine Mystique.'' Rarely has a single book been responsible for such sweeping, tumultuous and continuing social transformation.         The new society Ms. Friedan proposed, founded on the notion that men and women were created equal, represented such a drastic upending of the prevailing social norms that over the years to come, she would be forced to explain her position again and again.         ''Some people think I'm saying, 'Women of the world unite -- you have nothing to lose but your men,' '' she told Life magazine in 1963. ''It's not true. You have nothing to lose but your vacuum cleaners.''         'The Problem That Has No Name'         Following is an excerpt from ''The Feminine Mystique,'' by Betty Friedan.         The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the United States. Each suburban wife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night -- she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question -- ''Is this all?''         For over fifteen years there was no word of this yearning in the millions of words written about women, for women, in all the columns, books and articles by experts telling women their role was to seek fulfillment as wives and mothers. Over and over women heard in voices of tradition and of Freudian sophistication that they could desire no greater destiny than to glory in their own femininity. Experts told them how to catch a man and keep him, how to breastfeed children and handle their toilet training, how to cope with sibling rivalry and adolescent rebellion; how to buy a dishwasher, bake bread, cook gourmet snails, and build a swimming pool with their own hands; how to dress, look, and act more feminineand make marriage more exciting; how to keep their husbands from dying young and their sons from growing into delinquents.         In the fifteen years after World War II, this mystique of feminine fulfillment became the cherished and self-perpetuating core of contemporary American culture. Millions of women lived their lives in the image of those pretty pictures of the American suburban housewife, kissing their husbands goodbye in front of the picture window, depositing their stationwagonsful of children at school, and smiling as they ran the new electric waxer over the spotless kitchen floor. They baked their own bread, sewed their own and their children's clothes, kept their new washing machines and dryers running all day. They changed the sheets on the beds twice a week instead of once, took the rug-hooking class in adult education, and pitied their poor frustrated mothers, who had dreamed of having a career. Their only dream was to be perfect wives and mothers; their highest ambition to have five children and a beautiful house, their only fight to get and keep their husbands. They had no thought for the unfeminine problems of the world outside the home; they wanted the men to make the major decisions. They gloried in their role as women, and wrote proudly on the census blank: ''Occupation: housewife.''         Reprinted from yesterday's late editions.         Correction:  February 8, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Monday and in some copies on Sunday about Betty Friedan, the pioneering feminist who wrote ''The Feminine Mystique,'' misstated the residence of her sister, Amy Adams. It is Chapel Hill, N.C., not New York City.       
         Doris Muscatine, a pioneering chronicler of California's wine and food culture, died Saturday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 80.         Her family said she died as a result of injuries suffered in a fall this month.         Mrs. Muscatine began writing about food and wine in the 1960's, before anyone knew a pinot noir from a merlot or had ever heard of Alice Waters, Chez Panisse and the new American cooking. Her writing helped introduce California cooking, with its emphasis on fresh, locally grown ingredients, to the rest of the country.         ''Doris was a good kind of critic, looking for the positive things,'' said Ms. Waters, the executive chef and owner of Chez Panisse, in Berkeley. ''She was able to sort them out. She was never into the kind of superficial things about food and wine. She wanted to know about the person who ran the restaurant, its history, not just recipes. And that connects to her interest in history.''         As a friend of Ms. Waters, she peeled garlic every year for Chez Panisse's annual garlic festival.         She was an accomplished cook who thought that good ingredients could speak for themselves.         ''Food for her was really a form of cultural and aesthetic expression, one that gave comfort and meaning to peoples' daily lives,'' said her daughter, Lissa Muscatine.         Her food and wine books, which won many awards, include ''A Cook's Tour of Rome,'' ''A Cook's Tour of San Francisco'' and ''The University of California/Sotheby Book of California Wine.''         Mrs. Muscatine was also co-author, with the East Bay restaurateur Narsai David, of ''Monday Night at Narsai's.'' Narsai's was one of the area's most popular restaurants in the 1970's and early 80's.         Until a few weeks ago, Mrs. Muscatine was appearing at book signings to promote her new book, ''The Vinegar of Spilamberto and Other Italian Adventures with Food, Places and People,'' which was published last year by Shoemaker & Hoard.         The book recounts her many visits to Italy, the first in 1958, when her husband, Charles, began studying there on a Fulbright scholarship. With their young children, they explored the country and began a lifelong love of Italian culture, especially its food.         As a historian, Mrs. Muscatine wrote ''Old San Francisco: the Biography of a City From Early Days to the Earthquake'' and was a consultant for the PBS series ''California Dream,'' a history of the state first broadcast in 1981.         She recently completed a culinary oral history and film for the Bancroft Library at the University of California.         Born Doris Corn in New York City, she was reared in Trenton and graduated from Bennington College in Vermont. She studied cooking at the Cordon Bleu in Paris in 1962. She moved to the Bay Area in 1948, when her husband joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley.         In addition to her husband and daughter, of Bethesda, Md., she is survived by a son, Jeff, of Palo Alto, Calif., and six grandchildren.       
         Dana Reeve, who devoted herself to the care of her paralyzed husband, the actor Christopher Reeve, and became a forceful advocate for research into spinal cord injuries, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 44 and lived in Pound Ridge, N.Y., in Westchester County.         The hospital said Ms. Reeve died of lung cancer, which was discovered last year, 10 months after Christopher Reeve's death.         Ms. Reeve, a singer and an actress, won international admiration for her devotion to Mr. Reeve's care and for her involvement in the Christopher Reeve Foundation, which seeks a cure for spinal cord paralysis. She succeeded her husband as chairman of the foundation and established the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Resource Center, an information clearinghouse.         Mr. Reeve, whose most celebrated role was as the title hero in the ''Superman'' movie franchise, was paralyzed after a 1995 horseback riding accident in Virginia. He died on Oct. 10, 2004, in New York at age 52.         Ms. Reeve, who had never smoked, expressed optimism about overcoming her cancer. ''I'm beating the odds and defying every statistic the doctors can throw at me,'' she said four months ago in one of her few public statements about her condition. ''My prognosis looks better all the time.''         Ms. Reeve was born in 1961 in Teaneck, N.J., one of three daughters of Dr. Charles Morosini and Helen Morosini, who died of ovarian cancer early last year. She grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., graduated cum laude from Middlebury College in Vermont in 1984 and studied at the California Institute of the Arts.         The couple met in 1987 in Williamstown, Mass., where Christopher saw Dana performing in a cabaret act at the Williamstown Theater Festival. They were married on April 11, 1992, in an outdoor ceremony at a farm in South Williamstown. They had a son, Will, now 13.         In addition to her son and her father, Ms. Reeve is survived by her sisters, Deborah Morosini and Adrienne Morosini Heilman, and two stepchildren, Matthew and Alexandra.         She appeared both on Broadway and Off Broadway at the Public Theater, the Manhattan Theater Club and the Ensemble Studio Theater. She also acted at such regional theaters as the Yale Repertory Theater and the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival. On television she appeared in shows including ''Law and Order,'' ''Oz'' and ''All My Children,'' and was a co-host for ''Lifetime Live,'' a program on the Lifetime network.         Ms. Reeve essentially suspended her career after her husband's accident, choosing to oversee his care and campaign for spinal cord research, but she did make several appearances after his death. On Jan. 12, wearing what she described as her ''Barbarella wig,'' she sang ''Now and Forever'' to a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden on behalf of a friend, the former Rangers hockey captain Mark Messier, who was honored in a retirement ceremony.         Ms. Reeve will be seen on March 29 in a PBS program, ''The New Medicine,'' which was taped in November. In its introduction, she says, ''It has become clear to me that high-tech medicine, with all its wonders, often leaves out that all-important human touch.''         Her interest in preserving humane approaches to life in the face of disability was reflected in her work at the Christopher Reeve Foundation.         ''She navigated the difficulties in their lives, so she decided she wanted to do something to help people living with paralysis and established the Quality of Life grants program,'' said Maggie Goldberg, spokeswoman for the foundation. The program has awarded $8 million to nonprofit organizations that help people with disabilities, Ms. Goldberg said.         ''Chris was all about research, research, cure and treatment,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ''Dana said, 'We need to worry about the here and now.' ''       
         Anna Moffo, an American soprano who was beloved for her rosy voice, dramatic vulnerability and exceptional beauty, died on Thursday night at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a stroke after grappling with complications of breast cancer for 10 years, said a stepdaughter, Rosita Sarnoff.         Though Ms. Moffo's career began splendidly, her voice had declined by her late 30's. With her radiant appearance, she was drawn early on into television and film, playing host of her own variety show on Italian television for many years.         She might not have fulfilled her promise, but for a good dozen years Ms. Moffo enjoyed enormous success and won a devoted following at a time when her competition for roles like Verdi's Violetta, Puccini's Mimi and Donizetti's Lucia included Maria Callas, Renata Tebaldi and Joan Sutherland.         Though Ms. Moffo's voice was not large, it was warm and rich, with soft pastel colorings and a velvety lower range. Agile coloratura technique allowed her to sing high soprano bel canto repertory impressively, especially ''Lucia di Lammermoor.'' She was a thoroughly trained musician, having studied the piano and viola when she was a voice major on scholarship at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.         As Susanna on the classic 1959 EMI recording of Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' Ms. Moffo holds her own and then some in scenes with the intimidating soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who sings the Countess. Her RCA recording of ''La Traviata,'' with Richard Tucker and Robert Merrill, is still prized for the subtlety and pathos she brings to her portrayal of Violetta. Still, her career could be seen as a cautionary tale about doing too much too soon.         Anna Moffo was born in Wayne, Pa., to an Italian-American shoemaker and his wife on June 27, 1932. In high school she was popular, proud of her hook shot on the basketball court and captain of the field hockey team. After graduation, Hollywood beckoned, but her parents, as Ms. Moffo told it, wanted her to be a nun. Instead, in 1954 she entered and won the Philadelphia Orchestra Young Artists Auditions. Awarded a Fulbright fellowship, she went to Rome to study voice, master the Italian language and train for opera.         Ms. Moffo made her stage opera debut in 1955 as Norina in Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' in Spoleto. Her big breakthrough came the next year, when she starred in a television production of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' directed by Mario Lanfranchi, a producer for RCA Victor and RAI. She and Mr. Lanfranchi married in 1957. Sensing her star potential, he pushed her too hard. Recalling this period in a 1977 interview, Ms. Moffo lamented that she sang an average of 12 new roles a year for the first four years of her career, all star parts.         ''I was working too hard and traveling too much,'' she said. ''I got mixed up in TV, films, things like that. Psychologically, I was miserable, always away, always alone.''         Her Met debut in 1959 was as Violetta in ''La Traviata.'' The reviews, though encouraging, were cautious. The New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote that her singing needed ''a little more personality.''         ''She has the brains, ability, voice and looks,'' he added, ''and if she develops the musical temperament to go along with it, there will be no stopping her.''         Ms. Moffo soon became a favorite at the Met, and remained so well into the 1960's. She appeared some 200 times with the company, including her portrayal of Li√π in the legendary production of Puccini's ''Turandot'' in 1961 that starred Birgit Nilsson and Franco Corelli, available today on a limited edition live recording produced by the Met.         By the late 1960's, her voice was often unreliable. In his book ''The American Opera Singer,'' the critic Peter G. Davis writes of a now infamous 1969 Saturday afternoon broadcast performance of ''Lucia'' at the Met. Rudolf Bing, the general manager, was so dismayed by her singing that he considered stopping the performance before Lucia's daunting ''mad scene'' was broadcast to millions.         That same year, Ms. Moffo caused a scandal in Italy when she appeared to be nude in a scene in the film ''Una Storia d'Amore.'' In later years she insisted that she had not been totally unclothed.         In 1972 she and Mr. Lanfranchi divorced. Two years later she married Robert W. Sarnoff, the chairman of RCA, who was enthralled with his glamorous wife. Under Mr. Sarnoff, RCA built a promotional campaign around her, including an ill-advised recording of Massenet's ''Tha√Øs,'' with Ms. Moffo in the title role. The reviews, predictably, were very poor.         Besides her stepdaughter Rosita, Ms. Moffo is survived by a brother, Nicholas Moffo Jr., of Berwyn, Pa., and two other stepdaughters: Serena Benenson of New Canaan, Conn., and Claudia Sarnoff of Middleburg, Va. She and Mr. Sarnoff, who died in 1997, had no children.         In the late 1970's, Ms. Moffo went to a respected voice teacher, Beverley Johnson, to get her singing back in shape. The work paid off somewhat: her career continued. But her best years were long behind her.         For a brief time, though, Ms. Moffo was a lovely singer and appealing artist who broke out of the traditional career mode to reach the larger public. ''You may not like what I do,'' she said in a 1972 interview, ''but you can't say I'm dull.''       
         Edythe Gaines, a prominent educator who in the 1960's and 70's was one of the highest ranking black officials in the New York City public school system, died on March 23 in Hartford. She was 83.         Ms. Gaines died of natural causes, said her son Richard.         From 1973 to 1975, Ms. Gaines was the executive director of the New York City Board of Education's Office of Educational Planning and Support. The position was one of three senior administrative posts newly created by the board and all carried the title executive director, ranking just below the deputy schools chancellor.         Ms. Gaines left the department in 1975 to become the superintendent of schools in Hartford. She was the first woman, and the first African-American, to hold that post.         Ms. Gaines began her career in 1945 as a teacher in New York City public schools. In 1964, she became the first African-American to serve as principal of a secondary school in the city when she was appointed to lead what was then Junior High School 118, on West 93rd Street in Manhattan. She had taught at the school, which was also called the Joan of Arc School, since the late 1940's.         In 1967, Ms. Gaines was appointed assistant superintendent in charge of School District 12 in the Bronx, where she was responsible for the day-to-day operation of 22 schools serving more than 40,000 students.         Edythe Pauline Jones was born on Sept. 6, 1922, in Asheville, N.C., one of seven children of Jacob Jones, an Episcopal minister, and the former Jennie Dillard, who taught high school English and Latin. Her father died when she was an adolescent, and afterward the family moved to New York.         Ms. Gaines earned a bachelor's degree in history and political science from Hunter College in 1944, a master's from New York University in 1947 and a doctorate in education from Harvard in 1969.         From 1971 to 1973, she directed the Learning Cooperative, an agency of the New York City school system designed to develop educational programs. Ms. Gaines, who left the superintendent's post in Hartford in 1978, was named a commissioner of the Connecticut Public Utilities Control Authority the next year.         Ms. Gaines's husband, Albert Denis Gaines, whom she married in 1941, died in 1995. Besides her son Richard, of Greentown, Pa., she is survived by another son, Mallory, of Newark; five grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Jane Jacobs, the writer and thinker who brought penetrating eyes and ingenious insight to the sidewalk ballet of her own Greenwich Village street and came up with a book that challenged and changed the way people view cities, died yesterday in Toronto, where she moved in 1968. She was 89.         She died at a Toronto hospital, said a distant cousin, Lucia Jacobs, who gave no specific cause of death.         In her book ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' written in 1961, Ms. Jacobs's enormous achievement was to transcend her own withering critique of 20th-century urban planning and propose radically new principles for rebuilding cities.         At a time when both common and inspired wisdom called for bulldozing slums and opening up city space, Ms. Jacobs's prescription was ever more diversity, density and dynamism -- in effect, to crowd people and activities together in a joyous urban jumble.         Her critique of the nation's cities is often grouped with the work of writers who in the 1960's shook the foundations of American society: Paul Goodman's attack on schooling; Michael Harrington's stark portrait of poverty; Ralph Nader's barrage against the auto industry; and Malcolm X's grim tour of America's racial divide, among others. And it continues to influence a third generation of students.         ''Death and Life'' made four basic recommendations for creating municipal diversity: 1. A street or district must serve several primary functions. 2. Blocks must be short. 3. Buildings must vary in age, condition and use. 4. Population must be dense.         Ms. Jacobs's thesis was enlarged by her deep, eclectic reading. But most compelling was her description of the everyday life she witnessed from her home above a candy store at 555 Hudson Street, near 11th Street.         In that description, she puts out her garbage, children go to school, the dry cleaner and the barber open their shops, women come out to chat, longshoremen visit the local bar, teenagers return from school and change to go out on dates, and another day is played out. Sometimes, odd things happen: a bagpiper shows up on a February night, and delighted listeners gather around. Whether neighbors or strangers, people are safer because they are almost never alone.         ''People who know well such animated city streets will know how it is,'' Ms. Jacobs wrote. ''I am afraid people who do not will always have it a little wrong in their heads, like the old prints of rhinoceroses made from travelers' descriptions of rhinoceroses.''         Robert Caro, the historian, said in an interview yesterday that Ms. Jacobs was far from the first urban theorist to stress the importance of neighborhood and community. ''But no one had ever said it so brilliantly before,'' he said. ''She gave voice to something that needed a voice.''         Some critics used adjectives like ''triumphant'' and ''seminal'' to describe ''Death and Life.'' Others, not a few of whom with an ax to grind, were less kind. Lewis Mumford, the critic and social historian whom Ms. Jacobs eviscerated in the book, suggested in a review in The New Yorker that she had displayed ''aesthetic philistinism with a vengeance.''         The battles she ignited are still being fought, and the criticism was perhaps inevitable, given that such an ambitious work was produced by somebody who had not finished college, much less become an established professional in the field.         Indisputably, the book was as radically challenging to conventional thinking as Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring,'' which helped engender the environmental movement, would be the next year, and Betty Friedan's ''The Feminine Mystique,'' which deeply affected perceptions of relations between the sexes, would be in 1963.         Like those two writers, Ms. Jacobs was able to summon a freshness of perspective. Some dismissed it as amateurism, but to many others it was a point of view that made new ideas not only thinkable but suddenly and eminently reasonable.         ''When an entire field is headed in the wrong direction, when the routine application of mainstream thinking has produced disastrous results as I think was true of planning and urban policy in the 1950's, then it probably took someone from outside to point out the obvious,'' Alan Ehrenhalt wrote in 2001 in Planning, the magazine of the American Planning Association.         ''That is what Jane Jacobs did 40 years ago,'' he said.         Action, Not Just Words         Ms. Jacobs did not limit her impact to words. In 1961, she and other protestors were removed from a City Planning Commission hearing on an urban renewal plan for Greenwich Village that they opposed, after they leapt from their seats and rushed the podium.         In 1968, she was arrested on riot and criminal mischief charges for disrupting a public meeting on the construction of an expressway that would have sliced across Lower Manhattan and displaced hundreds of families and businesses. The police said she had tried to tear up the stenographer's transcript tape.         The battle against that highway pitted Ms. Jacobs in an uphill fight against Robert Moses, the autocratic and immensely powerful master builder of that era. The expressway's opponents won.         Ms. Jacobs moved to Toronto in 1968 out of opposition to the Vietnam War and to shield her two draft-age sons from military duty, and quickly enlisted in Toronto's urban battles. No sooner had she arrived than she led a battle to stop a freeway there.         She became a beloved intellectual pioneer characterized by a dumpling face, an impish smile, sneakers, bangs and owlish glasses. But Roger Starr, a former New York City housing administrator and sometime opponent of Ms. Jacobs, keenly noted the steel just beneath her folksiness.         ''What a dear, sweet character she isn't,'' he said.         After she was removed from the Planning Commission hearing in 1961, her own words underlined her feistiness. ''We had been ladies and gentlemen and only got pushed around,'' she said.         But fighting with government, even being arrested with Susan Sontag and Allen Ginsberg in an antidraft protest, was something she said she had repeatedly been forced into by ''outrageous'' governmental actions.         What she hated most about those actions was that they took time away from her writing, which she said was her way of thinking. And in at least five fields of inquiry, she thought deeply and innovatively: urban design, urban history, regional economics, the morality of the economy and the nature of economic growth.         Each of her major books led naturally to the next. From writing about how people functioned within cities, she analyzed how cities function within nations, how nations function with one another, how everyone functions in a world of conflicting moral principles and, finally, how economies grow like biological organisms.         A small book in 1980 arguing for Quebec separatism created a stir in Canada, while a 1996 memoir of her great-aunt's experience as a schoolteacher in rural Alaska, which she edited, impressed reviewers with its homespun wisdom.         But it is ''Death and Life,'' published by Random House, that rocked the planning and architectural establishment.         On one level, it represented the first liberal attack on the liberal idea of urban renewal. At the same time, the New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson saw an old-fashioned vision of community that he compared to Thornton Wilder's fictional Grover's Corners. Ms. Jacobs herself thought the book's continuing appeal was that it plumbed the depths of human nature like a good novel.         In 2003, Herbert Muschamp, the Times's chief architecture critic, wrote that Ms. Jacobs's book was ''one of 20th-century architecture's most traumatic events,'' in part because Ms. Jacobs was dismissive about the importance of design.         In recent years, she became an inspiration to architects and planners who espouse what they call the New Urbanism, an effort to promote social interaction by incorporating such Jacobean features as ground-floor stores in suburban developments.         Patrick Pinnell, an architect associated with this school, said ''Death and Life'' represented almost the last expression of optimism about American cities. As early as 1974, John E. Zuccotti, then chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, called Ms. Jacobs a prophet and himself a ''neo-Jacobean'' when he announced a smaller-scale, more sensitive urban planning approach. Ms. Jacobs was born Jane Butzner on May 4, 1916, in Scranton, Pa. Her father was a physician and her mother a schoolteacher. She remembered being something of a troublemaker in school, engaging in pranks like exploding inflated paper bags in the lunchroom. She preferred reading books surreptitiously to listening to the teacher.         In an interview in Azure magazine in 1997, Ms. Jacobs recounted her habit of carrying on imaginary conversations with Thomas Jefferson while running errands. When she could think of nothing more to tell Jefferson, she replaced him with Benjamin Franklin.         ''Like Jefferson, he was interested in lofty things, but also in nitty-gritty, down-to-earth details,'' she said, ''such as why the alley we were walking through wasn't paved, and who would pave it if it were paved. He was interested in everything, so he was a very satisfying companion.''         Years later, she realized that she had developed her talent of working through difficult ideas in simple terms by practicing them on her imaginary Franklin. She also acquired another inner companion through Alfred Duggan, an English historical novelist. He was Cerdic, a Saxon chieftain. Years later, she continued to chat with him while doing housework.         ''There were only two things in the entire house that were familiar to him,'' she wrote; ''the fire (although he didn't understand the chimney) and the sword,'' a Civil War souvenir. ''Everything else had to be explained to him.''         Not wanting to go to college, she took an unpaid position as assistant to the women's editor at The Scranton Tribune. In 1934, she moved to New York to join her sister, who was six years older and had a job in the home furnishings department of Abraham & Straus, the Brooklyn department store. The sisters lived on the top floor of a six-story walkup in Brooklyn Heights.         Subways Lead to Jobs         Each day, Ms. Jacobs got on the subway and arbitrarily chose a stop at which to get off and look for a job. Because she liked the sound of Christopher Street, she got off there and found an apartment in Greenwich Village and soon after, a job as a secretary in a candy manufacturing company.         She worked as a secretary for five years. The sisters did not have much money and sometimes lived on Pablum and bananas, Ms. Jacobs said in an interview with Metropolis Magazine in 2001.         She began writing articles then, first for a metals-trade paper. She sold a series of articles about different areas of the city, like the fur district, to Vogue, earning $40 for each at a time when she was making $12 a week as a secretary. She wrote Sunday features for The New York Herald Tribune and articles for Q Magazine on manhole covers, among other things.         While working full time, she attended Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years and took courses in geology, zoology, law, political science and economics. In 1944, Ms. Jacobs, who was then working for the Office of War Information, and her two roommates had a party in their apartment. One guest was Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., an architect who specialized in hospital design. They met in April and married in May.         Ms. Jacobs told Azure that she would not have written any books without her husband's encouragement. It was he who decided that the family should move to Toronto in 1968 after their sons said they would go to jail rather than serve in Vietnam. Mr. Jacobs died in 1996. Ms. Jacobs is survived by her sons, James, of Toronto, and Ned, of Vancouver; her daughter, Burgin Jacobs, of New Denver, British Columbia, and one granddaughter.         Suspicions Aroused         In 1952, Ms. Jacobs got a job as an editor at Architectural Forum, where she stayed for 10 years. That gave her a perch from which to observe urban renewal projects. On a visit to Philadelphia, she noticed that the streets of a project were deserted while an older, nearby street was crowded.         ''So, I got very suspicious of this whole thing,'' she told The Toronto Star in 1997. ''I pointed that out to the designer, but it was absolutely uninteresting to him. How things worked didn't interest him.         ''He wasn't concerned about its attractiveness to people. His notion was totally aesthetic, divorced from everything else.''         Her doubts increased after William Kirk, the director of the Union Settlement in East Harlem, taught her new ways of seeing neighborhoods. She came to see the prevalent planning notions, which involved bulldozing low-rise housing in poor neighborhoods and replacing it with tall apartment buildings surrounded by open space, as a superstition akin to early 19th-century physicians' belief in bloodletting.         ''There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder,'' she wrote in ''Death and Life,'' ''and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be served.''         William H. Whyte, the editor of Fortune magazine and the author of books about urban life as well as his celebrated ''Organization Man,'' asked Ms. Jacobs to write an article for Fortune on urban downtowns in 1958. Her essay, which was reprinted in ''The Exploding Metropolis'' (Doubleday, 1958), turned out to be a trial run for her book.         ''Designing a dream city is easy,'' she concluded. ''Rebuilding a living one takes imagination.''         The Fortune article caught the attention of the Rockefeller Foundation, which offered her a grant in 1958 to write about cities. Two grants and three years later, she produced her manuscript for ''Death and Life'' on the Remington typewriter that she used until her death.         Her seemingly simple prescriptions for neighborhood diversity, short blocks, dense populations and a mix of buildings represented a major rethinking of modern planning. They were coupled with fierce condemnations of the writings of the planners Sir Patrick Geddes and Ebenezer Howard, as well as those of the architect Le Corbusier and Lewis Mumford, who championed the ideal of graceful towers rising over exquisite open spaces. Mr. Mumford held his fire for a year before replying in a New Yorker article, sardonically titled ''Home Remedies for Urban Cancer.''         ''Like a construction gang bulldozing a site clean of all habitations, good or bad,'' Mr. Mumford wrote, ''she bulldozes out of existence every desirable innovation in urban planning during the last century, and every competing idea, without even a pretense of critical evaluation.''         Form Over Substance?         Even the architecture critic Paul Goldberger, while expressing profound admiration for Ms. Jacobs in a New York Times article in 1996, suggested that she may have overstated the importance of the physical form of cities.         ''Sometimes big, ugly high-rise towers work just fine,'' he wrote.         Ms. Jacobs next book, ''The Economy of Cities'' (Random House, 1969), challenged the ideas that cities were established on a rural economic base; rather, she suggested, rural economies have been built directly through city economies. After that came ''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle for Sovereignty'' (Random House, 1980). It argued that Canada and Quebec would be better off without each other, on the general grounds that smaller is better.         She delved more deeply into economics and cities with ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations: Principles of Economic Life'' (Random House, 1984), in which she contended that national governments undermine the economy of cities, which she saw as the natural engines of economic growth.         Her ''Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics'' (Vintage, 1994) looks at the moral underpinnings of work by examining different value systems. ''The Nature of Economies'' (Modern Library, 2000) likens economic activity to an ecosystem. Her last book, ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Random House, 2004), argues that North American culture is collapsing, then suggests ways to reverse the trend.         During her last years, Canadians held conferences to honor Ms. Jacobs. For New Yorkers, she lived on in the famous photo of her with a beer and a cigarette in the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, as well as memories of her plotting municipal mischief at another Village hangout. To generations of planners, architects and students of cities, Ms. Jacobs remains a seminal influence.         She perhaps perceived herself as an intellectual adventurer ready and able to follow her quixotic, often brilliant instincts into ever more fascinating terrain.         In ''Systems of Survival,'' one of her characters worried that he was not qualified.         ''Why not us?'' replied the man who had invited the group together. ''If more qualified people are up to the same thing, more power to them. But we don't know that, do we?''       
         Nadia Chilkovsky Nahumck, a performer and transcriber of dances by Isadora Duncan and an influential teacher, died on Sunday in Blue Bell, Pa. She was 98.         Her death was announced by Judith Finkelstein, a former student.         Born in Kiev, Ukraine, Ms. Nahumck came to the United States as a child and grew up in Philadelphia, where she established the Children's Dance Theater in 1944. Later known as the Philadelphia Dance Academy, it became part of the University of the Arts. Her students included Judith Jamison, now the artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.         Ms. Nahumck performed Duncan's dances as a member of the company of Irma Duncan, an adopted daughter of Isadora Duncan's, from 1921 to 1931. She performed with Martha Graham in the 1920's. She was also a founding member of the New Dance Group and of the Society for Ethnomusicology.         Moving back to Philadelphia after a serious injury, Ms. Nahumck also organized a college division of the dance academy in 1954 and a private school in 1962 for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. She wrote several notation workbooks and notated a variety of choreography, including dances from the television show ''American Bandstand.''         Her book ''Isadora Duncan: The Dances Choreographed in Labanotation'' was published in 1996. She taught at colleges including the Curtis Institute of Music, Swarthmore College and Temple University.         Ms. Nahumck leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Kathleen Powers Pflueger, owner of one of the world's great collections of 18th-century porcelain and 16th- and 17-century faience, a form of earthenware, died on March 30 surrounded by her pieces in the Park Avenue apartment that she had designed to house them. She was 90.         Her death was confirmed by her nephew Donald H. Dewey.         Mrs. Pflueger, who was known as Kiyi (pronounced kai-yai), was born into a family that counted among its ancestors early settlers of Manhattan, Rhode Island and Martha's Vineyard.         She was drawn into the rarefied world of porcelain by her husband, Edward M. Pflueger, who had begun collecting it in the 1930's. They married in 1943. Mr. Pflueger had immigrated to the United States from Germany to establish an American base for Bayer A.G., the pharmaceutical company. He was chairman and president of the company in New York until 1975. Mrs. Pflueger became his partner in assembling collections of more than 700 pieces.         A turning point in their collaboration came in 1949, when they acquired the Otto Blohm porcelain collection, one of the finest in the world.         ''The Pfluegers collected for more than 40 years and formed an absolutely superb collection of French faience and German porcelain and faience,'' said Anne Little Poulet, director of the Frick Collection. She came to know the Pfluegers when she led the department of European decorative arts and sculpture at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.         Ms. Poulet, who traveled with the couple to shows and auctions, helped persuade them to donate 377 pieces to the Boston museum. Mr. Pflueger agreed to do so on his wife's death. He died in 1997 at the age of 91. The rest of the collection will remain with the family, Ms. Poulet said.         Tracey Albainy, senior curator of decorative arts and sculpture in the museum's European art department, declined to disclose the collection's estimated value.         The collection is particularly admired for the quality of its porcelains from the Japanese Palace in Dresden, Germany. In the early 1700's, the palace was a getaway for Augustus II, known as Augustus the Strong, who was King of Poland and an elector of Saxony and who built the palace specifically for his collection.         The Pfluegers also acquired an impressive number of porcelain figures modeled on commedia dell'arte, the Italian comic theater.         In 1993 Christie's auction house published two books showing the Pflueger collection.         Most of their acquisitions were housed in the spacious Park Avenue apartment that Mrs. Pflueger had designed for them.         But some went to their country home, Kiyiwana Farm, a 1,000-acre property in Dutchess County. The farm has five houses, stables and barns, and a red tea house, all largely designed by Mrs. Pflueger. Formal terraced gardens feature 18th- and 19th-century statuary.         In Manhattan, Mrs. Pflueger was a founder of the Winter Antiques Show, established in 1954 to aid the East Side House Settlement, on whose board she served from 1947 to 1991. Modeled on the Grosvenor House Art and Antiques Fair in London, it became, and remains, one of the premiere antiques shows in Manhattan. Mrs. Pflueger was also on the arts committee of the China Institute and helped design and establish a gallery there.         Mr. Dewey, her nephew, said that Mrs. Pflueger had been a firm believer in the importance of genealogy. Her father was descended from early New York settlers; her mother, from colonizers of Martha's Vineyard and Newport, R.I. One of her grandfathers became a parks commissioner in New York; another held a patent on the term ''tomatoketchup.''         She belonged to a raft of organizations with lofty pedigrees in American society, among them the Colonial Dames of America, the Order of the Crown of Charlemagne, the Hereditary Order of Descendants of Colonial Governors and the Order of Colonial Lords of Manors in America.         Kathleen Isabel Powers was born on Oct. 4, 1915, the fifth of eight children of Harry Lord Powers and Elizabeth Robinson Hazard at Shrewsbury Manor, their agricultural and equestrian estate in Shrewsbury, N.J. She lived there until she was a teenager, when she was sent to school in Paris. As a young woman, she worked as an interior designer. ''Like a lot of people in the Depression,'' Mr. Dewey said, ''she was left with all the trappings, but not much money.''         She is survived by a sister, Patricia Hazard Powers Frech, of Manhattan.       
         Muriel Spark, known for her finely polished, darkly comic prose and for the unforgettable Miss Jean Brodie, one of the funniest and most sinister characters in modern fiction, died Friday at a hospital in Florence, Italy. She was 88.         Ms. Spark's death was announced yesterday, The Associated Press reported, by Massimiliano Dindalini, the mayor of the Tuscan village of Civitella della Chiana, where she had lived for almost 30 years.         Her work, unlocked from her innermost memories of her experiences before and after her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1954, built a canon of short, sometimes macabre, sometimes humorous novels that sought to pare away the absurdities of human behavior.         Ms. Spark's first novel was published when she was 39, and after that she supplied a stream of slender novels and enigmatic short stories peopled with such curiosities as narrators from beyond the grave, flying saucers, grandmotherly smugglers with bread bins full of diamond-studded loaves and individuals of so little substance that they disappear when the door closes.         In her writing, evil is never far away, violence is a regular visitor and death is a constant companion. Her themes were generally serious but nearly always handled with a feather-light touch.         It is this lightness, and a contrived detachment toward her characters, that became the target of the harshest criticism of her work, which at her death included more than 20 novels, several collections of short stories, poetry, criticism, biography, plays and a handful of children's books.         Some accused her of coolness and even cruelty toward the characters she invented and then sent -- sometimes quite merrily -- to terrible deaths.         ''People say my novels are cruel because cruel things happen and I keep this even tone,'' she said in an interview in The New Yorker. ''I'm often very deadpan, but there's a moral statement too, and what it's saying is that there's a life beyond this, and these events are not the most important things. They're not important in the long run.''         She was born Muriel Sarah Camberg in Edinburgh on Feb. 1, 1918, the daughter of Bernard Camberg, an engineer whose Jewish family had settled earlier in Scotland, and his wife, the former Sarah Elizabeth Maud Uezzell, a Protestant from a country village near London.         When she was 5 she began attending James Gillespie's High School for Girls, where she became one of the cr√®me de la cr√®me of students selected for a specialized and somewhat unorthodox curriculum by Christina Kay, the teacher who would become the model for the protagonist in ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' (1961), which was later adapted for the stage and film.         Muriel Camberg acquired her Spark from her brief, and as she had put it, ''disastrous,'' marriage at the age of 19 to Sydney Oswald Spark, 13 years her senior, who was about to leave Scotland to teach in Africa.         He was known as S. O. S., a fitting nickname, it turned out, when his mental instability and violence led her to end the marriage after seven miserable years. ''He became a borderline case, and I didn't like what I found on either side of the border,'' she wrote in her 1992 autobiography, ''Curriculum Vitae.''         They lived in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and their union produced her only child, a son, Robin.         She kept the name Spark, partly for her son's sake and partly because she thought it had ''some ingredient of life and of fun.''         She longed to return to Britain, but she was trapped in Rhodesia for most of World War II because of wartime restrictions on travel. She finally succeeded in returning aboard a troopship in 1944, leaving her son, then 6, in the care of convent nuns in Central Africa until the war was over.         Once home, she went to London in search of work, taking up residence at the Helena Club, which later became the model for the May of Teck Club, the setting for her 1963 novel, ''The Girls of Slender Means.''         Propaganda and Poetry         In London she landed a job with the Foreign Office in a secret division that disseminated black propaganda, a brand of disinformation she described as ''detailed truth with believable lies.'' The reports, broadcast on what masqueraded as a German radio station, used real names and addresses to lend veracity to invented stories, and the announcers were German prisoners of war. Although the fabricated news items were aimed at undermining the Nazis, there were times when they worked too well and surfaced as news in the British press.         After the war she worked at a jewelry trade publication, Argentor, in London, joined the Poetry Society and later became editor of its Poetry Review, a job that lasted for two tempestuous years before she was dismissed. Her innovations there included paying for worthy submissions and ending the practice of accepting payments from poets, a change that drastically altered the content of the review and outraged its establishment.         She founded a short-lived literary magazine, then went to work for a publishing house, devoting the remainder of her time to writing poetry, doing book reviews and writing and editing scholarly works, including the letters of John Henry Cardinal Newman.         Ms. Spark said she discovered through the writings of Cardinal Newman that the foundations of the Roman Catholic church corresponded with her personal convictions. She described her conversion to Catholicism as a natural step in her life. ''There was no blinding revelation in my case,'' she wrote in her autobiography.         Her first novel, ''The Comforters'' (1957), was born of religion and delusions. Newly converted and living in London in 1954, during the period of postwar food rationing, Ms. Spark ate little and chased away her hunger with Dexedrine, a combination that led to a period of hallucinations. The words she had once manipulated turned on her, trapping her in a fog of anagrams and crosswords and convincing her that a code ran through the literature she read.         After a few months, she sought medical help and stopped taking the amphetamines, but remained weak and ill. It was at this troubled time in Ms. Spark's life that Graham Greene stepped in, and for a while she was sustained by the money he sent, along with bottles of red wine, which, she wrote, ''took the edge off cold charity.''         In ''The Comforters,'' a young woman recovering from a breakdown finds that she is a character in a novel that is being written on a phantom typewriter that only she can hear.         Religion is present in Ms. Spark's work in a variety of guises, from the unseen and unforgiving hand in ''Memento Mori'' (1959) to the hypocrisy of self-righteously pious characters like the couple in the short story ''The Black Madonna.'' Later in her life, the issue of her religious heritage became a persistent irritant.         She traced the seeds of ''Memento Mori,'' her third novel, to her childhood, when she learned about old age and human frailty at close range, caring for her dying grandmother. Although the novel is steeped in death and deception it is at times unabashedly hilarious. In the book, one elderly person after another in a close circle gets a mysterious phone call with a simple message: ''Remember, you must die.'' This slim novel about confronting mortality, packed with sex, blackmail and mystery, was adapted for the stage.         While Ms. Spark's books cover a broad territory of plot and character, some central similarities can be found in many of the novels and short stories.         Michiko Kakutani, in a review of Ms. Spark's novel ''Reality and Dreams'' in The New York Times in 1997, described the author's approach as a recipe: ''Take a self-enclosed community (of writers, schoolgirls, nuns, rich people, etc.) that is full of incestuous liaisons and fraternal intrigue; toss in a bombshell (like murder, suicide or betrayal) that will ricochet dangerously around this little world; and add some allusions to the supernatural to ground these melodramatics in an old-fashioned context of good and evil. Serve up with crisp, authoritative prose and present with 'a light and heartless hand.' ''         Delving Into School Secrets         This recipe appears with variations in novels including ''The Ballad of Peckham Rye'' (1960) , in which a truly devilish young man who calls himself an industrial analyst insinuates himself into the life of a community and goes about creating suspicion among neighbors, delving into personal secrets and destroying lives.         It reappears in ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' which provides a memorable example of a small and controlled community -- a girls school in Edinburgh in the 1930's -- in which the imperious teacher molds lives in a way few educators can.         ''Give me a girl at an impressionable age and she will be mine for life,'' intones the elegant Miss Brodie, who does not care whether her charges know their history or arithmetic as long as they have an appreciation of the finer things: art, Mussolini, proper care of the complexion, Franco.         She captivates her students and enriches their lives while exerting unnatural control, grooming them to serve her will, whether in the bed of one of her lovers, as her personal spy or as a martyr to one of her political causes. Her single-mindedness in devoting her ''prime'' to her students has consequences for every life she touches, from the men who love her to the student who is the author of her undoing.         Jay Presson Allen's adaptation for the stage became a vehicle in London in 1964 for Vanessa Redgrave, on Broadway in 1968 for Zoe Caldwell, who won a Tony for her performance, and in Hollywood in 1969 for Maggie Smith, who won an Oscar for best actress in the role.         No other book by Ms. Spark has received the widespread popular acclaim and exposure of ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' but in subsequent interviews, the author expressed a firm preference for dwelling on the future rather than the past.         In 1965 she published ''The Mandelbaum Gate,'' a heftier book and one that seems overstuffed by her standards. Set in Jerusalem against the backdrop of the war-crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann, ''The Mandelbaum Gate'' tackles questions of religion, memory and history superimposed on a torturous plot. The book won the James Tait Black Memorial prize.         In ''The Driver's Seat,'' published in 1970, a woman embarks on a wild search through Europe for the man who will kill her. With ''Hothouse on the East River'' in 1973, she moved the locale to New York, and the next year she responded to the Watergate scandal with ''The Abbess of Crewe,'' her own tale of burglars and stolen secrets set in yet another type of institution -- a convent. ''The Only Problem,'' in 1984, returns to the book of Job for inspiration.         Divine retribution of a sort neatly ties up her book ''Aiding and Abetting'' (2000), a fictional tale of a real man, Lord Lucan, known as Lucky, who killed his children's nanny, whom he apparently mistook for his wife in the dark, severely battered his wife, then disappeared, with the help of his friends. In the novel, two men claim to be the aging Lord Lucan, and both present themselves to a very high-priced Paris therapist who is fleeing her own past -- that of a fraudulent stigmatic.         Her last book, ''The Finishing School'' (2004), revisits the themes of boarding schools and envy.         Ms. Spark was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1967, became a Dame of the British Empire in 1993 and in 1997 won the David Cohen Literature Prize for lifetime achievement.         She took issue, however, with the label ''British writer.'' She told one interviewer, ''I am Scottish by formation.'' She pointed out repeatedly that the bulk of her life had been spent in other countries. After London, she lived briefly in New York in the 1960's, then abandoned the crush of the literary world for Rome, where she had a rich social life and entertained lavishly.         Alliance and Estrangement         In Rome, she met the painter and sculptor Penelope Jardine, who became her secretary and later her companion. The two women traveled together, lived together, and over the years their lives grew deeply intertwined.         Interviewers repeatedly asked about the nature of the relationship of the two women who spent so many years together. Ms. Spark brushed aside the idea that their involvement was romantic; it was characterized as an ''old-fashioned friendship.''         Ms. Jardine purchased a sprawling medieval church compound in Tuscany, and they ultimately settled there. There Ms. Spark settled into her routine of writing in her favorite composition books, in longhand, using only pens untouched by other human hands, and rarely rewriting or revising what flowed from those pens. Ms. Jardine handled the business of everyday life, down to the typing of Ms. Spark's work.         When asked in an interview what she contributed to the household, Ms. Spark said she made her own bed, took morning tea to Ms. Jardine and took her out to meals. ''I think I pull my weight somehow or other,'' she said.         She saw her craft, she said in a 2004 interview, as driven by inspiration from an ''outside force'' unlocking memory in a manner derived from her reading of Marcel Proust.         ''It inspired me more than anything,'' she said at the time. ''I wouldn't have wanted to write like Proust, but I could see what you could do with memory. I could see what you could do with incidents. It was after reading Proust that I found I rather liked writing prose.''         In her later years it became clear that she and her son, Robin, a painter who lives in Edinburgh, were irreconcilably estranged over various issues, including what he referred to as her abandonment of him, as well as her opinions about his ability as an artist and his public statements about their heritage.         Ms. Spark was harsh in her public criticism of his work and open about their estrangement. She told a newspaper: ''He can't sell his lousy paintings, and I have had a lot of success. He keeps sending them to me and I don't know what to do with them. I can't put them on my wall. He's never done anything for me, except for being one big bore.''         Their public feud extended to their religions and spilled into letters to newspapers and became a part of Ms. Spark's literary history when she donated letters from her son to the National Library of Scotland. Mr. Spark, who embraced Judaism about the same time his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, insisted that her mother had been Jewish, which by matrilineal inheritance would make him Jewish by birth; Ms. Spark, who considered herself only half-Jewish, maintained that though her father was Jewish, her mother was not.         Critics have disagreed on how to classify her work, which is alternately bleak and side-splitting. John Updike spoke of ''fun-house plots, full of trapdoors, abrupt apparitions and smartly clicking secret panels.'' Barbara Grizzuti Harrison called her a ''profoundly serious comic writer whose wit advances, never undermines or diminishes, her ideas.''         Taking the opposite view, Robert Maurer questioned the emotional underpinnings of her fiction, writing, ''One wonders how vast a reserve of sympathy lies beneath the iceberg of her consciousness, and how far beyond trickery her work would go if she let it show through.''         Ms. Spark said in several interviews that she would rather not fit neatly into any literary category. ''I have a comic strain, but my novels are serious,'' she said in 1993. ''Sometimes one makes one's own category, you know.''         Correction:  July 18, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary on April 16 about the novelist Muriel Spark misstated the date of her death. It was April 13, not April 14. The error was pointed out by a reader last week; the correction was further delayed for research.       
         Ellen Kuzwayo, the lone woman and the least flashy of the founders of the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and a quiet moral force throughout the rise of the African National Congress from outlaw movement to governing party, died Wednesday in Johannesburg. She was 91.         The cause was complications of diabetes, her son Bobo told The South African Press Association.         Along with playing a role in fighting white oppression, Ms. Kuzwayo was also an early leader of the struggle of African women for equality with their men.         Her 1985 autobiography, ''Call Me Woman,'' described her beatings by her first husband and her loss of their children to him when they separated, because by law and tradition she was a minor. With it, she became the first black writer to win South Africa's premier literary prize, the CNA Award.         After Nelson Mandela's inauguration as president in 1994, she became, at the age of 79, a member of the first multiracial Parliament and served for five years.         At her death, Ms. Kuzwayo still lived in Soweto, the vast, isolated satellite city of tiny tract homes and jammed squatter camps a few miles from Johannesburg, a product of the determination of South Africa's white rulers to eject from their midst all blacks not employed as their domestic servants.         After the 1976 Soweto riots, set off by police shootings of schoolchildren protesting the forced change to the Afrikaans language in class, Ms. Kuzwayo became the lone woman on the Committee of 10, which informally governed the township when residents resisted paying rent to the despised Urban Bantu Council, appointed by the white government.         As a result, she was imprisoned without charge for five months in 1977.         In her 1996 testimony to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which investigated apartheid-era crimes, she described her predawn arrest, hiding in the bathroom trying to bathe and dress as police horses trampled her yard, and instructing Bobo, then a teenager, to keep a sharp eye out so that the police did not plant evidence as they searched.         She later helped establish the Urban Foundation, which pressed the government to let blacks own their houses, and she was a longtime adviser of the Zamani Soweto Sisters Council, the umbrella body for women's self-help groups; the first president of the Black Consumer Union; and the general secretary of the Y.W.C.A.         Ms. Kuzwayo, whose name before her marriage was Nnoseng Ellen Serasengwe, was born June 29, 1914, in the Orange Free State, an Afrikaner-dominated farming region, into a family of ministers and teachers; her maternal grandfather graduated from a missionary college in 1879 and had been the headmaster of a multiracial boys school and a court interpreter.         At 22, she began attending local African National Congress conferences with her father.         She later inherited the 6,000-acre farm owned by her mother's family, but lost it in the 1970's when the area was rezoned for white ownership only.         In the 1940's, she joined Mr. Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo and others in forming the breakaway African National Congress Youth League, a more militant offshoot of the Congress, and served as its secretary. Mr. Mandela later formed its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation. He was convicted in 1964 on charges of treason and sabotage and imprisoned until 1990.         She became a teacher in 1938, but quit the profession in 1952 when the Native Education laws were supplanted by the Bantu Education Act, and missionary schools were closed.         ''I did not have the strength nor the courage to teach the children of my community what appeared to be very poisonous to their minds,'' she said later. ''The National Party gave them an inferior education so those children were going to remain the slaves of white people.''         She became a social worker, eventually becoming a revered figure in Soweto, known as Ma K, giving advice to women's groups, churches and schools and earning a salary from the social work department of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.         Besides her son Bobo, she is survived by another son, Justice; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         One of her most common laments was the lasting damage that apartheid and the violent fight against it had done to South Africa's children. The film ''Tsotsi,'' which won an Oscar as best foreign film this year, vividly shows the lives of young thugs on the Soweto-Johannesburg trains, and in 1996, Ms. Kuzwayo described to the truth commission the changes she had seen in young men like them.         In her early days as a social worker, she said, ''Sometimes after sunset I would be going through Orlando Station to go to my home, and it would be dark, and if I saw a group of young men standing there, I just ordered them to take me home.''         ''They would be grousing that they should be doing something else rather than taking this old lady home, but they obeyed. Believe you me, today I cannot do that, because I don't trust the very children who ought to protect me because of the handling of the government of South Africa of those days. They turned our children into animals.''         She herself was in a famous film about crime and injustice in South Africa, the 1951 version of ''Cry, the Beloved Country,'' starring Sidney Poitier. She had a small role as a shebeen queen -- the owner of an illegal Soweto tavern.       
         Henriette D. Avram, a systems analyst who four decades ago transformed millions of dog-eared catalog cards in the Library of Congress into a searchable electronic database, and in the process helped transform the gentle art of librarianship into the sleek new field of information science, died on April 22 in Miami. She was 86 and had lived for many years in California, Md.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Avram, who was not a librarian by training, is widely credited with developing the automated cataloging system that rendered printed cards obsolete. Known to librarians as Marc, for Machine Readable Cataloging, Mrs. Avram's system is, in its current form, the worldwide standard.         Her work changed forever the relationship of a library to its users, making it possible, with the push of a button, to search the holdings of a library thousands of miles away. It also made it possible to ''visit'' the library at midnight attired in nothing more than a bathrobe, a practice brick-and-mortar libraries traditionally discouraged.         When Mrs. Avram joined the Library of Congress in the mid-1960's, the American card catalog had scarcely changed in half a century. Each item in a library's collection was represented by typewritten cards of thick, cream-colored paper. Many of the cards were annotated by hand, in what, impossibly, seemed to be the same handwriting in widely separated libraries. (In fact, the characteristic script -- squarish and slanting slightly backward -- was taught in library schools.)         ''She developed the mechanism for being able to capture the data that the user was seeing on the 3-by-5 catalog card into an electronic format,'' Beacher Wiggins, the director of acquisitions and bibliographic access at the Library of Congress, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''And what that did was open the door for data to be shared broadly.''         Mrs. Avram's work in encoding and organizing data for transmission across long distances also helped set the stage for the development of the Internet, Mr. Wiggins said.         Henriette Regina Davidson was born in Manhattan on Oct. 7, 1919. She began premedical studies at Hunter College, and in 1941 married Herbert Mois Avram (pronounced AH-vrum).         In the early 1950's, after her husband took a job with the National Security Agency, Mrs. Avram moved to the Washington area, where she studied mathematics at George Washington University.         Mrs. Avram's husband died in January. She is survived by their children, Marcie, of Manhattan; Lloyd, of Key West, Fla.; and Jay, of Arlington, Va.         In 1952, Mrs. Avram also went to work for the N.S.A., where she learned computer programming; she later worked for Datatrol, an early software company. In 1965, she joined the Library of Congress, where she was put in charge of the Marc pilot project.         It was not a job for the faint-hearted. The catalog comprised millions of items -- books, maps, films, sound recordings and more -- in hundreds of languages, many using non-Roman alphabets. The cards for each item contained many discrete pieces of information (including author, title, publisher and place of publication), each of which would need to be represented with a separate mathematical algorithm.         To translate the cards into something a computer could digest, understand and share, Mrs. Avram also had to enter the mind of the library cataloger, a profession whose arcane knowledge -- involving deep philosophical questions about taxonomy, interconnectedness and the nature of similarity and difference -- was guarded like priestly ritual.         ''A big challenge would be just understanding what goes on in this world of cataloging because it's a really complicated world,'' Allyson Carlyle, an associate professor at the Information School at the University of Washington, said in an interview. ''It's something that's passed from generation to generation; there's still a lot of unwritten practice.''         The pilot project was finished in 1968, and, starting the next year, bibliographic records were dispatched on magnetic tape to libraries around the country. In 1971, Marc became the national standard for electronic cataloging; it was named the international standard two years later. Mrs. Avram retired from the Library of Congress in 1992 as associate librarian for collections services.         Today, a mouse click brings up the Library of Congress Online Catalog (catalog.loc.gov), the modern incarnation of the work Mrs. Avram began in 1965.         It also brings up eBay, where a copy of the American Library Association's book ''Rules for Filing Catalog Cards'' (2nd ed., 1968; 104 pp.; softcover; 6 x 9 inches), can be had for 99 cents.       
         Cheikha Rimitti, a pioneer of the rebellious Algerian pop called ra√Ø, died on May 15 in Paris, where she had lived since 1978. She was 83.         The cause was a heart attack, her Web site said.         Cheikha Rimitti was considered the queen of ra√Ø (RYE or rah-AY), which means opinion in Arabic. She sang daringly and forthrightly about sexuality, poverty, drinking, oppression and independence. ''Misfortune is my teacher,'' she often said.         Her brash lyrics and deep, rough-hewn voice made her an international star. She defied taboos, and her music was often banned.         ''Ra√Ø music has always been a music of rebellion, a music that looks ahead,'' she said in a 2001 interview with Afropop Worldwide, a syndicated radio program and Web site. Two nights before her death, she performed at the Z√©nith concert hall in Paris.         She was born in 1923 in the village of Tessala near Sidi Bel-Abb√©s in Western Algeria. Her parents named her Saadia, which means joyful. But she was orphaned as a young girl and grew up poor, often homeless.         To support herself, she began singing at weddings. She arrived in the town of Relizane and joined a troupe of traveling musicians when she was 20, performing at festivals as a singer, a dancer and an equestrienne, riding with a rifle in each hand.         Her stage name, Rimitti, was derived from the French word remettez (put it back, or slang for another). Various stories link the name to her buying rounds of drinks for fans or calling for refills herself. Later, the honorific Cheikha was added.         North Africa has a tradition of bawdy wedding songs, performed by and for women. Cheikha Rimitti began to sing them for mixed audiences in public. She also wrote songs about social conditions, including, in the 1940's, the harshness of French colonial rule and the epidemics that ravaged Algeria. She wrote about rough lives and about the temporary diversions of sex and alcohol.         ''I sang all the subjects back then,'' she told Afropop Worldwide. ''I sang about misery. I sang about love. I sang about the condition of women. I sang about ordinary life, concrete things. I sang the life I had seen, my own history.''         Although she composed hundreds of songs, Cheikha Rimitti was illiterate. ''Words sing silent in my head until I sing them loud,'' she once said. ''No need to take either a pencil or a notebook.''         A well-known Algerian musician, Mohammed Ould Ennems, helped arrange her first radio broadcasts in the 1940's. She made her first recording in 1952, and in 1954 she caused a controversy with a song called ''Charrag Gataa'' (''Tear, Lacerate''), which was taken as an attack on the virtue of female virginity. ''He crushes, whips and beats me,'' she sang. ''I say that I'm going away, but I still spend the night.''         When Algeria became independent of France in 1962, the new conservative Islamic government banned her songs from radio and television. She continued to perform at private gatherings, as ra√Ø music circulated on underground cassettes.         In 1976, she made a pilgrimage to Mecca and gave up drinking and smoking. She emigrated to Paris in 1978, but continued to visit Algeria, which eventually removed the ban on her music.         According to her manager, Nourredine Gafaaiti, she is survived by her 3 children and 18 grandchildren, all of whom live in Algeria.         By the 1980's, her songs had been taken up by a younger generation of ra√Ø musicians, though they often did not credit her. She was rediscovered by the world-music audience in the 1990's and modernized her music. Her 1994 album ''Sidi Mansour'' included the guitarist Robert Fripp from King Crimson, and Flea, the bassist from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, although she never met the musicians; she was recorded in Paris and the backup tracks were recorded in Los Angeles.         She continued to make albums, and one, ''N'ta Goudami'' (Because Music), was released this month. It was recorded in Oran, Algeria, the birthplace of ra√Ø.         In 2001 she made her United States debut with a triumphant concert at Central Park SummerStage.         ''When I'm on stage, I don't cheat,'' she told Afropop Worldwide afterward. ''I give everything I have in my soul and my spirit.''       
         Sister Rose Thering, a Roman Catholic nun and a former professor at Seton Hall University who battled anti-Semitism within her church and contributed to a historic Vatican declaration that Jews were not collectively responsible for the death of Jesus, died on Saturday at a convent in Racine, Wis. She was 85.         The cause was kidney failure, said Catherine Memory, a university spokeswoman. She said Sister Rose died at the Siena Center of the Sisters of St. Dominic, where she entered religious life in 1936 and had lived since retiring last year as professor emerita of education at Seton Hall, in South Orange, N.J.         Sister Rose -- who wore a Star of David fused to the cross on her neck, used words like ''chutzpah,'' and closed her letters with ''shalom'' -- devoted most of her adult life to writing, lecturing and traveling the world in a quest to promote greater understanding in the often-strained relationships between Christians and Jews.         As a member of a commission appointed by Gov. Thomas H. Kean, she helped write a 1994 law mandating the teaching of the Holocaust and genocide in all elementary and high schools in New Jersey. At Seton Hall, where she joined the faculty in 1968, she established workshops on Judaism for church leaders and teachers and led student groups on 54 tours of Israel.         In 2004, ''Sister Rose's Passion,'' a 39-minute documentary film on her life, won an award at the Tribeca Film Festival, and it was nominated for an Academy Award in 2005. She also received more than 80 humanitarian awards, including the Anti-Defamation League's Cardinal Bea Interfaith Award in 2004, the first to go to a woman.         ''The death of Sister Rose Thering is an immense loss for the entire Seton Hall family, indeed for all men and women who seek to forge a world of greater understanding,'' said Msgr. Robert Sheeran, the president of Seton Hall. ''For a half-century, she was an uncommon, inspired voice of reconciliation and dialogue among Christians and Jews.''         On a Wisconsin farm in childhood where Jews were spoken of in whispers, in her parochial school catechisms and other religious texts that portrayed Jews as Christ-killers, Rose Thering learned the coded messages of intolerance early in life and found them unsettling. Later, as a teacher, she examined the Catholic textbooks of her students more critically and was shocked by what she found.         ''I had ordered the most widely used Catholic religious teaching material from high school and grade school,'' she recalled in 2004. ''When I began to read, it almost made me ill.'' She cited a passage that asked, ''Why did the Jews commit the great sin of putting God himself to death?'' and another declaring, ''The worst deed of the Jewish people was the murder of the Messiah.''         She was in her 30's and had been teaching for years when she resolved to act against what she saw as a fundamental flaw in church teaching. The result was a study of anti-Semitism in Catholic texts and a dissertation for her 1961 doctorate at St. Louis University that propounded the evidence: textbooks and preachings that abounded in calumnies against Jews and Judaism. Her work was published later in an anthology, ''Faith and Prejudice'' (Paulist Press).         In 1962, when Pope John XXIII convened the ecumenical council known as Vatican II, Cardinal Augustin Bea used Sister Rose's study to draft portions of the 1965 Vatican document ''Nostra Aetate,'' (''In Our Age''), which reversed church policy and declared of Christ's death that ''what happened in his passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today,'' and, as for teaching, added: ''The Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God.''         ''They were 15 lines in Latin,'' Sister Rose recalled later, ''but they changed everything.''         In Catholic texts, in sermons, and in other pronouncements of the church, a new attitude toward Jews was officially adopted, and while centuries-old wounds remained, dialogues between the church and Israel and between Catholics and Jews have been elevated to a more respectful plane over time.         Sister Rose became an activist-teacher. She was hired at Seton Hall by Msgr. John Oesterreicher, an Austrian Jew who fled the Nazis in 1938. He converted to Catholicism, became a priest and in 1953 founded the Institute of Judeo-Christian Studies at Seton Hall, a groundbreaking program that included priests, nuns and rabbis on the faculty and offered seminars for clergy, teachers and others.         In 1974, Sister Rose presented a menorah to Pope Paul VI at the Vatican. In 1986, she went to Austria to protest the inauguration of President Kurt Waldheim, the former United Nations secretary general, who had served in a Nazi army unit implicated in the deportation of Jews from Greece in World War II. In 1987, she went to the Soviet Union to protest the government's treatment of Russian Jews.         Rose Elizabeth Thering was born on Aug. 9, 1920, in Plain, Wis., the sixth of 11 children in a German-American farm family that prayed together daily. She joined the Sisters of St. Dominic at 16, and earned a bachelor's degree from the Dominican College in Racine in 1953, a master's degree from the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul in 1957 and a doctorate at St. Louis University four years later.         In recognition of her interfaith work, the Rose Thering Endowment for Jewish-Christian Studies was established at Seton Hall in 1992; it has given scholarships to 350 teachers for graduate studies on the Holocaust and other subjects.         She is survived by two brothers, Raymond Thering, of Reedsburg, Wis., and Dr. H. R. Thering, of El Paso, Tex.; and four sisters, Lucille Neuheisel, of Sauk City, Wis., Imelda Misslish, of Prairie du Sac, Wis., Bernice Leigel, of Muscoda, Wis., and Mary Phillips, of Middleton, Wis.       
         Luba Kadison Buloff, who went from playing children's roles to reigning as a leading lady in the Yiddish theater, helping bring its flavorful blend of wrenching drama and comedic shrug from Europe to the Lower East Side in the 1920's, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 99.         Her daughter and sole survivor, Barbara Buloff of Manhattan, confirmed the death.         Over five decades, billed as Luba Kadison, she played 7-year-old walk-ons, teenage ing√©nues and then starring roles in works by the greatest playwrights of Yiddish theater, including I. S. Singer and Sholem Asch. Often she co-starred with her husband, Joseph Buloff, whom she met in Poland. Mr. Buloff, who later moved on to well-known roles on Broadway, died in 1985.         In her later years, Ms. Kadison was an interpreter for Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union and an acting teacher. She was also a voice of history, consulted by theater researchers like Caraid O'Brien, who is writing on a book on the Yiddish theater.         ''She was an incredible mentor to a lot of young people and acting students,'' Ms. O'Brien said. ''Even though she never went to college, she was the most beautifully educated person I've ever known,'' Ms. O'Brien added. ''She taught me Yiddish.''         ''On Stage, Off Stage: Memories of a Lifetime in the Yiddish Theater,'' which she and her husband wrote with Irving Genn, was published in 1992 by the Judaica Division, Harvard College Library.         Luba Kadison was born on Dec. 14, 1906, in Kovno (now called Kaunas), in Lithuania. During World War I, her family moved to the capital, Vilnius, where her father, Leib Kadison, became a founder and the director of the Vilna Troupe. The company gained fame for its production of ''The Dybbuk,'' by S. Ansky, with Ms. Kadison at first playing a small part, but later taking over the lead role of Leah, the bride possessed by the title character, a malicious spirit.         Soon after the war, the Vilna Troupe moved to Warsaw, where Mr. Buloff joined the company. In addition to acting, he directed ''Yoshke Muzicant'' by Osip Dimov, a folk tale told through the eyes of a child. Ms. Kadison, still a teenager, played the lead. She and Mr. Buloff were married in 1923.         Five years later, the American impresario Maurice Schwartz invited the couple to New York to join his Yiddish Art Theater, on Second Avenue and 12th Street. There Ms. Kadison played opposite Stella Adler in Sholem Asch's ''God of Vengeance,'' among many other roles over the next 30 years.         While Mr. Buloff began to get parts on Broadway, including the peddler Ali Hakim in the original production of ''Oklahoma,'' Ms. Kadison continued to play leading roles with the Yiddish Art Theater, including Dina, the spoiled wife, in the ''Brothers Ashkenazi,'' by I. J. Singer, and Malkeleh, a disturbed girl, in Singer's ''Yoshe Kalb.'' In one of her most famous performances, she played Linda, Willy Loman's suffering wife, in the Yiddish production of Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman.''       
         Mary Martin McLaughlin, an internationally renowned scholar of the Middle Ages who spent the last four decades working almost entirely outside the academy, died on June 8 at her home in Millbrook, N.Y. She was 87.         The cause was cancer, her niece Kathleen Bayard Derringer said.         Ms. McLaughlin's small but distinguished body of work was highly regarded by academic medievalists around the world. Her research focused in particular on the role of women, children and families in the Middle Ages, largely overlooked subjects when she began her career in the 1940's.         Ms. McLaughlin was also known to generations of college students for two anthologies, ''The Portable Medieval Reader'' (Viking, 1949) and ''The Portable Renaissance Reader'' (Viking, 1953), both of which she edited with another medievalist, James Bruce Ross.         For the last 40 years, Ms. McLaughlin labored over two books, to be published posthumously, that colleagues describe as her masterworks. One is the first full biography of H√©lo√Øse, the lover and later wife of the 12th-century French philosopher Peter Ab√©lard. The other is the first English translation of the complete correspondence of H√©lo√Øse and Ab√©lard.         While reams of scholarship have been devoted to H√©lo√Øse and Ab√©lard, among history's most ill-starred lovers, few investigators have considered H√©lo√Øse alone. Ms. McLaughlin was the first to do so, colleagues said in interviews last week.         ''Often H√©lo√Øse is seen to some extent as in the shadow of Ab√©lard, whether one likes him or not,'' said Giles Constable, emeritus professor in the School of Historical Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. ''And Mary, very correctly, I think, separated out H√©lo√Øse and concentrated on her work.''         Ms. McLaughlin's forthcoming biography, ''H√©lo√Øse and the Paraclete,'' centers on H√©lo√Øse's years as abbess of the convent at the Paraclete, a monastery founded by Ab√©lard. The biography is scheduled to be published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2008, the letters in 2009.         Mary Martin McLaughlin was born on April 15, 1919, in Grand Island, Neb. She earned a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Nebraska in 1940, a master's from Nebraska the next year and a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1953.         In the 1940's and 50's, Ms. McLaughlin taught at Wellesley, Vassar and Nebraska; she rejoined the Vassar faculty in 1959. Aided by a small private income, she left in 1967 to pursue the life of an independent scholar.         Ms. McLaughlin is survived by a sister, Rosanne McLaughlin Morey of Montclair, N.J., and by several nieces and nephews.         In the decades she worked on H√©lo√Øse and Ab√©lard, Ms. McLaughlin also published a string of articles and reviews in prominent scholarly journals. She signed her work simply, ''Mary Martin McLaughlin, Millbrook, N.Y.''       
         Flora Gill Jacobs, an internationally recognized authority on dollhouses who spent her adult life blissfully awash in minutiae, including tiny, lavishly appointed mansions and an ornate Mexican villa that came with its own chapel (very small priest included), died on May 31 in Washington. She was 87 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         For many years, Ms. Jacobs presided over the Washington Dolls' House and Toy Museum, which she founded in 1975 and ran for nearly three decades, usually at a loss. Her work there, and her writings, were credited with creating interest in dollhouse collecting in the United States in the second half of the 20th century.         While there are many museums of dolls in this country, Ms. Jacobs's, a result of six decades of ardent collecting, was believed to be the first here devoted primarily to dolls' homes. In its heyday, it attracted more than 20,000 visitors annually, most of them adults.         Six days a week, Ms. Jacobs went to the museum to fuss, dust and instruct. As she told The Washington Post in 1988, ''I hardly ever go out into the life-size world.''         She closed the museum in 2004, citing rising costs and advancing age.         A newspaperwoman by training, Ms. Jacobs wrote many highly regarded books on dollhouses, among them ''A History of Dolls' Houses: Four Centuries of the Domestic World in Miniature'' (Scribner, 1953); ''Dolls' Houses in America: Historic Preservation in Miniature'' (Scribner, 1974); and, most recently, ''The Small World of Antique Dolls' Houses'' (Lake Isle Press, 2005).         The first known dollhouse was made in the mid-16th century, and since then dolls' houses have inflamed the acquisitive passions of generations of collectors. A dollhouse lets its owner preside over a miniature cosmos. It affords control, or at least the illusion of it, in a disorderly world. One can make all the aesthetic decisions, and do all the wiring, without ever having to argue with contractors.         The finest dollhouses have electric lights that turn on; running water (cold, usually); libraries with tiny printed books that can be taken down and read; and kitchen stoves that can be fired up. They can contain ornate chandeliers; scaled-down fine furniture; minute sterling tea sets; and little household pets, often made from fur-coat scraps.         For Ms. Jacobs, the attraction went beyond even these things. To her, an antique dollhouse was social history in microcosm, offering a meticulous record of the architecture and decorative arts of its era. And today, with many real historic buildings falling to the wrecker's ball, dollhouses, as she often said, offer a small way of preserving the past.         Flora Gill was born in Washington on Dec. 22, 1918. Growing up, she did not have a dollhouse, but the girl next door did -- a magnificent one that her father, a soldier in World War I, had brought back from Germany.         While Flora was still a student at George Washington University, she wrote film reviews for the old Washington Times-Herald. She left college for a job on the paper, eventually becoming the fashion editor. She later went to work as a reporter for The Washington Post, where she was assigned to the women's page.         In 1940, she married Ephraim Jacobs. He survives her, along with their daughter, Amanda, of Centreville, Md.         Leaving The Post after several years, Ms. Jacobs decided to write a book about dollhouses and, not long afterward, decided she had better own one. She bought her first from a New Jersey antiques shop in 1945. A derelict post-Civil War sandstone with a mansard roof, it cost $35.         At the time, dollhouses were unfashionable things in the world of collectibles. ''Most antiques dealers didn't even know what I was talking about,'' Ms. Jacobs told The Washington Times in 1999. ''One thought I was looking for doghouses.''         As her collection grew, friends clamored to see it. So did friends of friends. Brownie troops trooped through. Eventually, Ms. Jacobs's houses outgrew Ms. Jacobs's house. She rented a small building in northwest Washington, and the museum was born.         Comprising about 40 dollhouses from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, the museum's collection focused on Victoriana. The star attraction was the multistory Mexican villa, built circa 1890. Besides the chapel, it had roof gardens, an aviary, a working elevator and a gated driveway with a vintage Paige touring car.         Among the other miniature buildings on display were a dentist's office, a milliner's shop and a seaside hotel. There was a tiny circus and a tableau of Teddy Roosevelt on safari in Africa that featured porters, a naturalist and a menagerie that, somewhat incongruously, included a kangaroo.         Ms. Jacobs, who lectured throughout the world on dollhouse history, also wrote several children's books inspired by her work, among them ''The Doll House Mystery'' (Coward-McCann, 1958) and ''The Toy Shop Mystery'' (Coward-McCann, 1960).         In May 2004, the contents of the museum were sold at auction for about $1.4 million. The Mexican villa alone brought $231,000, said Noel Barrett, a dealer in antique toys who handled the sale.         It was hard for Ms. Jacobs to see her dollhouses go, but she had ample consolation at home. There, she had a collection as big as -- by some accounts bigger than -- the one at the museum.       
         Barbara Epstein, a founder and co-editor of The New York Review of Books and a figure at the center of New York literary life for decades, died yesterday in the apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in which she had lived for more than 50 years. She was 77.         The cause was lung cancer, her son, Jacob, said. He added that his mother, whose cancer was diagnosed in September 2005, was in her office as recently as two and a half weeks ago.         For much of her career, Ms. Epstein was famous for being part of a tandem. During the 1950's and 60's, she and her husband at the time, Jason, were the first couple of publishing, powerful book editors who knew everyone and gave the kind of high-octane dinner parties that warranted mention in Edmund Wilson's journals.         With Robert Silvers, her co-editor at The New York Review, she had an office partnership that endured even longer than her marriage, which ended in divorce in 1980.         ''Barbara was one of the most influential editors of our time,'' the writer Janet Malcolm said. ''But she had none of the qualities -- aggressiveness, ruthlessness, egotism -- that are commonly associated with powerful editors. Barbara's uncommon modesty, gentleness and charm were the source of a certain mysteriousness. They were also, of course, entirely of a piece with the magazine she and Bob Silvers put out.''         Ms. Epstein was born Barbara Zimmerman, the younger of two sisters, in Boston in 1928. Her father sold textiles and her mother was a homemaker. She attended Girls Latin School and graduated in 1949 from Radcliffe.         She began her editorial career as an assistant at Doubleday, then quickly rose to prominence there as the editor of Anne Frank's ''Diary of a Young Girl,'' among other books. She went on to work at Dutton, McGraw-Hill and The Partisan Review. In 1954 she married Mr. Epstein. Their children, Jacob, of Los Angeles, and Helen, of Brooklyn, survive her, as do three grandchildren.         It was at the Epsteins' dinner table, during the winter of 1962, that the idea for The New York Review of Books was hatched. New York's daily newspapers were on strike, and the absence of The New York Times Book Review had stranded publishers with no place to advertise their books and authors with no place for their work to be written about. To fill the vacuum, Mr. and Mrs. Epstein, together with Robert Lowell and his wife, Elizabeth Hardwick, who were guests that evening, decided to put out a book review of their own. ''Jason was, like, 'Kids, let's put on a show,' '' Ms. Epstein recalled.         The strike ended in February, but The Review, which had by then come out twice, was so successful that Ms. Epstein and Mr. Silvers, who had been recruited as co-editor, decided to keep it going. It became one of the most influential and admired journals of its kind, attracting a high-powered roster of writers. The books reviewed and those who reviewed them were all carefully hand picked, causing many to view the magazine as a kind of private club.         Ms. Epstein and Mr. Silvers made an unusual literary tag team. He is large and formidable. She was small, friendly and enthusiastic. They informally divided the literary turf between them. Mr. Silvers claimed history, politics, science and art history; Ms. Epstein looked after the arts and more literary books. But philosophically they saw eye to eye.         ''We were such close partners in the way of sharing every commission, every manuscript, every decision,'' Mr. Silvers said yesterday. Ms. Epstein, he said, read every manuscript that made it into The Review.         The poet James Fenton said: ''The system was always that whichever was actually editing you, the other was always checking in. Nothing was done by one without the participation of the other.''         Ms. Epstein was famous for putting articles though multiple revisions if necessary, sending out what were known as the A, B, C and sometimes the D and E proofs. ''She was the fiercest editor,'' the writer Diane Johnson, a close friend, recalled. ''Very much the perfectionist, but in a very sympathetic way.''         And she was arguably the more fun-loving of The New York Review's ruling pair, reliably turning up at book parties, no matter how obscure, except on evenings when she was giving her own. Her companion of many years after her divorce was the columnist Murray Kempton, who died in 1997.         ''She loved Champagne,'' the writer Nora Ephron recalled, ''and she herself had this quality that was so fizzy and festive, with such an appetite for trivia and gossip, that you completely forgot she was the editor of The New York Review.''       
         Dorothea Towles Church, the first successful black model in Paris, who discovered personal liberation on the runways of Christian Dior and Elsa Schiaparelli in the 1950's, died on July 7 in Manhattan. She was 83.         Her death was confirmed by Michael Henry Adams, a curator at the Museum of the City of New York, where she is among those to be featured in an exhibition called ''Black Style Now,'' opening on Sept. 7.         Ms. Church's success was a historic achievement in an industry that had been especially resistant to using any but white models to represent beauty on magazine covers, advertisements and runways. Ms. Church was responsible for breaking down some of those barriers and was revered in France during the five years she modeled there.         ''If you're beautiful, they don't care what color you are,'' she said of the French, describing her days in the couture salons and nights in postwar Paris.         ''I got invited out all the time,'' she said in Barbara Summers's 1998 book ''Black and Beautiful.'' ''I was the only black model in Europe and I just thought I was an international person.''         Her easy acceptance in Paris was reported back home in black publications, in articles about the designers she knew and how she once dyed her hair platinum at Dior's request.         But her growing fame did not eliminate prejudice on the part of some designers. At Schiaparelli, she once overheard someone describe her as Tahitian. While working for Pierre Balmain, she recalled, he would not allow her to borrow dresses for a photograph for Ebony magazine, fearing that would offend his white clientele. She took the clothes later on the pretext that she would wear them to a party, and the magazine then photographed them. This particular ruse endeared her to young black women with dreams of careers in fashion.         Norma Jean Darden, a former model and an owner of Spoonbread Catering in Manhattan, said: ''When I was 13 years old, I remember reading in Ebony magazine that there was this marvelous woman who had gone to Paris and broken through the color barriers. She was a true inspiration for those who followed fashion.''         Dorothea Towles was born on July 26, 1922, in Texarkana, Tex., the seventh of eight children in a farming family. She studied biology at Wiley College in Marshall, Tex., and planned to go into medicine, but when her mother died, she accepted the invitation of a wealthy uncle to live with him in Los Angeles. She completed a master's degree in education there at the University of Southern California.         In search of a profession, Ms. Church was attracted by the glamour of Los Angeles, so her friends suggested the movies. But there were few roles for black actors, and Ms. Church described herself as more commercially minded. She thought she could succeed in modeling, and enrolled in the Dorothy Farrier Charm and Modeling School as its first black student.         She then found jobs on the West Coast in fashion shows and magazines that catered to black audiences, and a husband, a much older dentist who spoiled her. In 1949, while on a two-month vacation in Paris, where her sister Lois Towles was touring with the concert choir of Fisk University, Ms. Church decided to try modeling there. Dior hired her on the spot to replace one of his regulars, who was on vacation. Ms. Church found that she liked Paris so much that she informed her husband she was staying.         ''He wrote me and even called me, but I told him I wasn't coming back,'' she said. ''He finally got tired, and then he got a lawyer and sued for divorce.''         After a few months, Ms. Church began using her model's discount to buy samples from the designers, piece by piece, until she had assembled several wardrobes' worth of couture gowns that had rarely been seen by American audiences. In 1954, she returned to America by ship, because she had so much luggage, and began a tour of black colleges with her collection. She staged fashion shows and fund-raisers for more than 200 branches of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a college sorority established by black women. Ms. Darden, who was 18 when she met Ms. Church at a benefit show organized by her father for the N.A.A.C.P. in Montclair, N.J., became one of the models in her troupe.         Ms. Church later signed with the Grace del Marco modeling agency in New York, and worked there for several years. She met Thomas Church, a prominent immigration lawyer, shortly after arriving in New York, and they were married in 1963. Mr. Church died in 2000. Ms. Church is survived by their son, Thomas.         ''I feel that my going all over America with my show had a great influence on American black women dressing differently and feeling good about themselves,'' Ms. Church said in ''Black and Beautiful.'' ''I saw them dressing more creatively, more internationally. They could say, 'If she can do it, I can do it, too.' ''         Correction:  July 26, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Dorothea T. Church, the first successful black model in Paris, gave an outdated date for the opening of an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York, ''Black Style Now,'' in which she will be featured. It is Sept. 9, not Sept. 7.       
         Reathel Odum, a bank clerk who was chosen by Senator Harry S. Truman during the Depression to be one of his secretaries and later served in the White House as personal secretary to Bess Truman, died in her hometown, Benton, Ill., on June 6. She was 97.         Miss Odum's nephew, Richard Odum Hart, said news of her death was not released for several weeks.         In 17 years with the Trumans -- including two years chaperoning their daughter, Margaret, when she was making national tours as an aspiring classical singer -- Miss Odum became close to the family.         ''People have urged me to write a book and I said no,'' she said in a 1988 oral history for the Truman Presidential Museum and Library in Independence, Mo. ''I don't know anything that would be tantalizing or gossipy.''         If it does not offer significant historical observations, Miss Odum's oral history does provide interesting glimpses of Truman and his family, for example, how much he missed Mrs. Truman when she went home to Independence in the summer.         ''He'd put his head in the office door and say, 'Is there any mail from the Boss? If there isn't, I'm going to fire every one of you,' '' Miss Odum recalled. ''That was a standing joke.''         While Truman had a reputation for spicy language, Miss Odum said: ''He never did swear in front of us girls. He put women on a pedestal.''         Asked about Mrs. Truman's role as first lady, Miss Odum said, ''After meeting so many people and shaking their hands at receptions, she would go to her room and soak her hand in paraffin.''         Born on Sept. 29, 1908, Miss Odum was the youngest of five children. Her father died when she was 4, and her mother raised the family. Miss Odum, who never married, has no immediate survivors.         She graduated from Benton Township High School in 1926 and soon got a job at a local bank. One day 10 years later, Truman walked into a bank in St. Louis where Miss Odum was working and told its president, a friend, that he needed a secretary. The bank president recommended Miss Odum. ''I was scared to death,'' she recalled. ''I had never talked to a senator before.''         Miss Odum arrived at Truman's Senate office in Washington in October 1936 and worked there until 1945. She and Mrs. Truman volunteered together at the local U.S.O. during World War II. ''We peeled carrots and did whatever to help entertain soldiers away from home,'' Miss Odum said. Often, they took bike rides around the Tidal Basin.         Truman became vice president in 1945; less than three months later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was dead. On his first full day as president, Truman asked Miss Odum to be Mrs. Truman's personal secretary.         Unlike Eleanor Roosevelt, Mrs. Truman did not like to speak to reporters. Sometimes a ''press girl'' would call and ask what Mrs. Truman would be wearing to a reception, Miss Odum said, and the first lady would say, ''It's none of their business.''         In 1947, Miss Odum began accompanying Margaret Truman on her concert tours. Asked how Miss Truman reacted to music critics, Miss Odum said: ''She tried not to read the reviews. She had determination to go ahead despite the critics.''         After her White House service, which ended when Truman left office in 1953, Miss Odum worked as a secretary for Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri, for a coal industry lobbying group and then for the Truman Scholarship Foundation.         Whenever the Trumans returned to Washington, she said, ''I'd go over to the Mayflower and say hello.''         Correction:  August 9, 2006, Wednesday  A picture on July 24 with an obituary of Reathel Odum, secretary to Bess Truman when she was first lady, was published in error. The photograph, released by The Associated Press in 1945 and identified as Miss Odum, was actually Jane Lingo (a friend of President Truman's daughter, Margaret).       
         Louise Simone Bennett-Coverly, a Jamaican poet and folklorist who became the voice of the island's culture at home and abroad, died on Wednesday in Toronto. She was 86.         Her death was announced by the Jamaica Information Service, which did not give a cause. She was hospitalized in Toronto after collapsing late Tuesday night.         A social commentator who liberally used Jamaican patois and made famous the Jamaican catchphrase ''Walk good,'' she brought an overwhelming talent to the stage, radio, television and movies. She also was a presenter on the BBC's Caribbean Service.         Louise Bennett, known to her fans worldwide as Miss Lou, was born on North Street in Kingston on Sept. 7, 1919, the only child of Cornelius Bennett, a baker, and Kerene Robinson, a dressmaker. Her father died when she was young, and she was reared mostly by her mother.         Ms. Bennett was educated in Jamaican schools, and though she was fond of literature, she once described herself as ''an average student.''         In 1936 she made her first public appearance, on Christmas Day at a concert, reciting a poem in Jamaican dialect. She was presented a prize of two guineas by the impresario Eric Winston Coverly, better known as Chalk Talk, who became her husband in 1954. She used the money to buy a pair of shoes.         She continued to write in dialect, following in the footsteps of the well-known Jamaican poet Claude McKay, although he only flirted with the style.         Not surprisingly, Ms. Bennett was ostracized by educated Jamaicans who saw the local patois as inferior to the Oxford English they tried to speak.         The island's newspaper The Gleaner refused at first to publish her poems, but later paid her for a regular Sunday column, which became popular.         Her published verse originated mostly as print or radio journalism, and her monologues often referred to the news, with shrewd social and political commentary. She invented the character of Aunty Roachy on the radio to ridicule the authorities with wit, sometimes ending her monologues with local proverbs.         Ms. Bennett performed in her first Christmas pantomime in 1943, and she and the stage actor Ranny Williams immediately became the leading duo of Jamaican theater. Together they wrote ''Anancy and Beeny Bud'' (1958), ''Jamaica Way'' (1959) and ''Carib Gold'' (1960). (Anancy, the famous trickster of African and Caribbean folklore, was a frequent subject for her.)         Also in 1943, she entered Friends' College, where she began to study Jamaican folklore seriously.         Ms. Bennett won a British Council Scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London in 1945 and was the first black student there. After graduation she worked with British repertory companies. In 1945 and 1946 she was host of a BBC radio show, ''Caribbean Carnival.''         Returning to Jamaica in 1947, she found it hard to earn a living. In 1950 she went back to England, where she again found work with the BBC, as host of another Caribbean show, ''West Indian Night.''         Moving to New York in 1953, she worked at Macy's. She and Mr. Coverly directed a folk musical, ''Day in Jamaica,'' which began at St. Martin's Little Theater in Harlem and later moved around Episcopal church halls in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.         Ms. Bennett worked with Alma John, a well-known black broadcaster, and sang folk songs at the Village Vanguard in Greenwich Village. Then, in May 1954, she married Mr. Coverly; they returned to Jamaica in 1955.         In 1956 she was appointed drama officer with the Jamaica Social Welfare Commission, then was its director from 1959 to 1963. Her work at the commission took her across Jamaica, putting her back in touch with her studies of its folklore and oral history.         She also taught drama and folklore at the University of the West Indies, and was on the staff of the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation briefly in 1959, but resigned to pursue a freelance career.         Ms. Bennett was made a Member of the British Empire (M.B.E.) in 1960 for her work in Jamaican literature and theater.         Among her several books on poetry and folklore, ''Jamaica Labrish'' (1966) is perhaps her most famous. Her first publication was ''Dialect Verses'' (1942). She also recorded many albums, including ''Jamaica Folksongs'' (Folkways) in 1953 and ''Yes Me Dear'' (Island Records Jamaica) in 1981.         Ms. Bennett was perhaps the most popular radio personality in Jamaica in the 1950's and 60's, with shows like ''Laugh With Louise,'' ''Miss Lou's Views'' and ''The Lou and Ranny Show.'' In the 1970's Jamaican children adored ''Ring Ding,'' her Saturday morning children's television show.         In the 1970's a theater for children's productions was named for her; it was refurbished in 1987 to celebrate her 50th anniversary in the theater. In 1979 the Jamaica Information Service produced a film on her, ''The Hon. Miss Lou.''         Ms. Bennett and Mr. Coverly lived in Canada for several years. The Jamaican government had refused to grant duty concessions for costly drugs he needed, and they sold their home and possessions to make the move. She said at the time that Jamaica was wherever she was.         After she nursed him through years of ill health, her husband died at 91. Ms. Bennett is survived by her stepson, Fabian Coverly, and three step-grandsons.         She made a tearful and triumphant final visit to Jamaica in 2003 for a celebration organized by the former prime minister P. J. Patterson.       
         June Allyson, whose perky wholesomeness made her the perfect girlfriend in a series of MGM musicals during the 1940's and the perfect screen wife during the 1950's, died on Saturday at her home in Ojai, Calif. She was 88.         Her death was announced yesterday by her daughter, Pamela Allyson Powell. The cause was pulmonary respiratory failure and acute bronchitis, she told The Associated Press.         Cheerful, blonde and petite but with a husky voice, Miss Allyson turned from chorus girl into movie star when she melted into the arms of Van Johnson in ''Two Girls and a Sailor'' in 1944. For the next decade, Miss Allyson and Mr. Johnson were a romantic team, co-starring in ''High Barbaree'' (1947), ''The Bride Goes Wild'' (1948), ''Too Young to Kiss'' (1951), and ''Remains to Be Seen'' (1953).         She also starred twice opposite Robert Walker -- in ''Her Highness and the Bellboy'' (1945) and ''The Sailor Takes a Wife'' (1946) -- and played a bouncy Jo March in MGM's glossy 1949 remake of ''Little Women.''         By 1950, Miss Allyson had made the segue from adoring girlfriend to devoted wife. She was happy to leave musicals behind. Although she had started in the chorus on Broadway, she told an interviewer in 1951: ''I couldn't dance, and, Lord knows, I couldn't sing, but I got by somehow. Richard Rodgers was always keeping them from firing me.''         She was the steadfast wife of James Stewart's one-legged baseball player in ''The Stratton Story'' (1949); the widow left behind by Mr. Stewart's bandleader in ''The Glenn Miller Story'' (1953); the worried wife of Mr. Stewart's baseball player recalled to active duty in ''Strategic Air Command'' (1955); and the understanding wife who loses Alan Ladd's jet pilot to honor and duty in ''The McConnell Story ( 1955).         In ''Executive Suite'' (1954), she assured her husband, played by William Holden, who was vying for president of the Tredway Corporation, ''Darling, if it's something you really want, that's all that's important to either of us.''         Ms. Allyson was always modest about her star power. ''Women identify with me,'' she said in a 1986 intervew, ''and while men desire Cyd Charisse, they'd take me home to meet Mom.''         When Miss Allyson tried to move beyond Peter Pan collars and sugary characters as the harsh and nasty woman who pushes her husband (Jos√© Ferrer) into a nervous breakdown in ''The Shrike'' (1955), her acting was praised but audiences refused to accept her, and the movie was a box-office failure.         June Allyson was born Ella Geisman on Oct. 7, 1917, in the Bronx. Her alcoholic father skipped out when she was 6 months old. When she was 8, she was crushed by a falling tree limb while riding a bicycle. After four years in a back brace, she taught herself to dance by watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies.         The expensive therapy the injuries required tumbled the Geisman family out of genteel poverty into desperation. In her 1982 autobiography, ''June Allyson,'' written with Frances Spatz Leighton, Miss Allyson said she and her mother were forced to move countless times. The best months were when her mother had a job in a restaurant, she wrote, ''because sometimes she could bring home food.''         Recovering from her injuries, she tried out for and won a chorus job in a 1938 Broadway revue, ''Sing Out the News,'' taking the name June (for the month) Allyson. Between 1938 and 1941, Miss Allyson sang and danced in several Broadway shows, including ''Very Warm for May,'' ''Higher and Higher'' and ''Panama Hattie.'' As understudy to Betty Hutton, who played the comedy lead in ''Panama Hattie,'' Miss Allyson took over the part for five performances when Miss Hutton came down with measles. In a plot development worthy of an MGM musical, the producer George Abbott saw her performance and offered her a small featured role in his next musical, ''Best Foot Forward.'' MGM bought the movie rights to the musical, and Miss Allyson was invited to Hollywood to play her role on screen. She stayed at MGM for 11 years and 25 movies.         ''The only parental authority I had was the studio,'' Miss Allyson said in 1972. ''When I was a star, there was always somebody with me, to guard me. I was not allowed to be photographed with a cigarette, a drink, a cup of coffee or even a glass of water because someone might think it was liquor. When I left the studio I was already married and had two children, but I felt as sad as a child leaving home for the first time.''         A second-tier star at a studio that prided itself on owning ''more stars than there are in heaven,'' Miss Allyson defied the studio boss Louis B. Mayer in only one thing. She fell in love with the married movie star Dick Powell. Mr. Powell divorced his wife, the actress Joan Blondell, and married Miss Allyson in 1945, despite Mr. Mayer's opposition. Although the marriage was rocky at times -- Miss Allyson once filed for divorce -- it lasted until Mr. Powell's death from cancer in 1963 at age 58. In her autobiography she touched on her struggle with alcoholism after Mr. Powell's death.         Miss Allyson and Mr. Powell co-starred in two mediocre movies in 1950, ''The Reformer and the Redhead'' and ''Right Cross.'' Miss Allyson recalled being told that because of her childhood accident, she would never be able to have children, so she and Mr. Powell adopted a baby girl, Pamela, in 1948. Two years later, she gave birth to a son, Richard.         Pamela Allyson Powell now lives in Santa Monica, Calif. Richard, of Los Angeles, also survives Miss Allyson, as does her husband, David Ashrow, a dentist whom she married in 1976. A previous marriage, to Mr. Powell's hairdresser, Glenn Maxwell, in 1963, the year Mr. Powell died, ended in divorce.         Miss Allyson's film career had petered out in the late 1950's with a remake of ''My Man Godfrey '' (1957) opposite David Niven, and a sudsy Ross Hunter melodrama ''A Stranger in My Arms'' (1959). From 1959 to 1961, she was host of and occasionally starred in ''The DuPont Show With June Allyson,'' a dramatic anthology on CBS. After replacing Julie Harris as the star of ''40 Carats'' on Broadway and touring for a year in a revival of ''No, No Nanette,'' she returned to the screen and to MGM in 1972 as a lesbian murderess in ''They Only Kill Their Masters.'' She also appeared on ''Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and other television shows.         In 1985 she became the national spokeswoman for Depend, a diaper for adults with incontinence. Still wearing her trademark pageboy hairdo, she broke one of the last taboos by bringing this uncomfortable subject into the nation's living rooms by way of television commercials.         Writing about Miss Allyson's autobiography in The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote: ''Miss Allyson presents herself as the same sunny, tomboyish figure she played on screen. Even the tough parts of her life -- the death of her husband Dick Powell and her subsequent bout with alcoholism -- are described in a relatively blithe manner.'' Ms. Maslin added that Miss Allyson sounded ''like someone who has come to inhabit the very myths she helped to create on the screen.''       
         Dorothy Uhnak, once famous as a 125-pound New York City Transit Authority policewoman who knocked down and arrested an armed mugger and then better known as the author of gritty, suspenseful, best-selling crime novels, died on Saturday in Greenport, N.Y. She was 76 and lived in Shelter Island, N.Y.         Her daughter, Tracy Uhnak, said she died of a deliberate drug overdose. She added that her mother had had a variety of accidents in recent years, was often depressed and had discussed suicide matter-of-factly.         ''You don't have to kill yourself today,'' she said more than once, her daughter recalled. ''You can do it tomorrow.''         Ms. Uhnak (pronounced YOU-nak) combined vibrant elements of her native New York, long experience as a police officer and a hard-boiled literary style that some compared to Hammett's or Chandler's in nine books of fiction and one of nonfiction.         Critics often cited the authenticity of scenes and characters in reviewing her crime novels ''Law and Order,'' ''Victims,'' the ''Christie Opara'' series -- and her first book, the semi-autobiographical ''Policewoman: A Young Woman's Initiation Into the Realities of Justice.'' She preceded Joseph Wambaugh as an ex-cop writing about the netherworld of crime and was a precursor of other women who have written about tough crime-fighting protagonists, including Marcia Muller, Sue Grafton and Patricia Cornwell. Her work was translated into 15 languages and was particularly popular in France.         ''I write about very hard situations and in a strong way,'' Ms. Uhnak said in an interview with The New York Times in 1977. Carol Cleveland, in The St. James Guide to Crime and Mystery Writers, noted her ''copious, pounding style that forces the reader to be involved.''         Ms. Uhnak was born Dorothy Goldstein next door to the 46th precinct on Ryer Avenue in the Bronx on April 24, 1930. Her novel ''The Ryer Avenue Story'' (1993), a murder mystery with a horrifying twist, roams her old neighborhood.         She was a tomboy who liked to hang out at the precinct and help with typing. She lamented to Newsday in a 1964 interview that she was ''always chased out when something interesting happened.''         She attended City College, then joined the transit police. She won two awards for bravery, but sometimes had an unusual perspective on people she arrested. She gave $125 she had won on a television quiz show to the pregnant wife of the large armed man who had attacked her.         ''I wondered what it feels like, how a criminal tells his family what he's done,'' she said to Newsday. ''I felt so sorry for him when I saw his family.''         After 14 years with the transit force, 12 of them as a detective, she resigned to complete her college education at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. She also suggested that she left police work because of sex discrimination. ''Policewoman'' was published in 1964, after several editors recognized the woman who had pestered them with submissions as the name in the news.         Her first novel, ''The Bait,'' won the Edgar Award as the best first mystery novel of 1968 and introduced Detective Second Grade Christie Opara, who starred in Ms. Uhnak's next two novels, ''The Witness'' (1969) and ''The Ledger'' (1970).         She jettisoned the series after the editor Michael Korda at Simon & Schuster approached her to write a big police novel, modeled on ''The Godfather,'' Mario Puzo's blockbuster. The result was ''Law and Order'' (1973), Ms. Uhnak's breakout book, about three generations of a police department family. It became a television movie in 1976.         Another of her big successes was ''The Investigation'' (1977), which was the basis for the 1987 television movie ''Kojak: The Price of Justice.'' It generated controversy because it seemed to exploit the real case of Alice Crimmins, who was convicted of murdering her two young children. Ms. Uhnak insisted that the heroine of her novel, Kitty, was entirely her own creation.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Kew Gardens, Queens, Ms. Uhnak is survived by her husband, Anthony, and a sister, Mary Ellis of Hartsdale, N.Y.         Though it was Ms. Uhnak's own alchemy that turned police duty into imaginative fiction, she sometimes gave part of the credit to the criminals she had met in the line of duty.         ''Once I arrested a character at a subway stop for indecent exposure, and through the years I'd come home and write endless short stories about him,'' she told The Times in 1981. ''He finally evolved as a rapist-murderer in my first novel.''         Correction:  July 26, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on July 12 about Dorothy Uhnak, the policewoman turned detective novelist, gave an incorrect given name for her surviving sister. She is Mildred Ellis, not Mary.       
         Mary Day, one of American ballet's most distinguished teachers and the longtime artistic director of the Washington Ballet, died on Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 96.         The cause was heart failure, said Judith Keyserling, the Washington Ballet spokeswoman.         Unlike many directors of professional ballet troupes in the United States, Ms. Day was not a major choreographer, financial patron or even a former professional dancer.         Yet when she and her own teacher, Lisa Gardiner, founded the Washington School of Ballet in 1944 and then a small performing group, she set in motion a pioneering career that had national and international impact.         That Ms. Day was doing something more than right was spectacularly confirmed by the influx of her students into first-rank companies and by the prizes they won beginning in the 1970's in top international competitions in Moscow; Helsinki, Finland; Lausanne, Switzerland; and Varna, Bulgaria. Her fiercely devoted alumni range from Shirley MacLaine to Kevin McKenzie of American Ballet Theater.         Some trained with her for a few years but many, like Mr. McKenzie, studied with her since childhood.         ''To be a really good teacher, one has to truly want each person to learn and to want to touch each student,'' Ms. Day said.         Attracting pupils from throughout the country (Mr. McKenzie's mother brought him from Vermont), Ms. Day became a nationally recognized teacher. Through the Washington Ballet, a respected regional company of some 20 dancers, she introduced Washington to an adventuresome repertory of old and new works.         Although guest stars passed through, the Washington Ballet until Ms. Day's retirement as artistic director in 1999, was essentially a showcase for young talent.         Among Ms. Day's other students were Amanda McKerrow of Ballet Theater, Virginia Johnson of Dance Theater of Harlem, Patrick Corbin of the Joffrey Ballet and the Paul Taylor Dance Company, Mimi Paul of New York City Ballet, Marianna Tcherkassky of Ballet Theater and Bonnie Moore of Ballet Theater and the Royal Ballet. Mr. McKenzie danced with the Joffrey before becoming one of Ballet Theater's danseurs nobles.         A teacher at heart, Ms. Day was resigned to seeing her most talented pupils leave her company for wider horizons. Ms. McKerrow was a teenager in the Washington Ballet when she made international headlines by winning a gold medal at the 1981 Moscow International Ballet Competition.         Shortly afterward, Ms. Day said: ''Amanda is due to be a very prominent ballerina in this next generation. She'll probably be here at Washington Ballet for a while. But we want what's best for her.''         The departure of her best students might have kept the Washington Ballet at the level of a regional company, no matter how admired. Yet the company established a strong presence in Washington, anything but a dance town until the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was built and could present international-level troupes.         Mary Day was born on Jan. 25, 1910, in Washington, where she studied with Ms. Gardiner, who had danced with Anna Pavlova's company. After founding the Washington School of Ballet in 1944, both women presented their students in children's ballets, often with the National Symphony Orchestra. Ms. Gardiner had called her small performing group the Washington Ballet, a title that was retained when the troupe was reorganized and Ms. Gardiner became artistic adviser in 1956. She died in 1958.         Ms. Day, whose drive to establish ballet in Washington was accompanied by a brisk elegance, then directed the small company with Frederic Franklin, a star of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. When Mr. Franklin left in 1961 to form a new company, the National Ballet, in Washington, Ms. Day shifted her attention to her school, adding an academic wing.         The National Ballet folded in 1974, and Ms. Day reorganized the Washington Ballet as a professional company in 1976. She was artistic director from 1976 to 1999, when she was succeeded by Septime Webre, the current director. She retired as director of the school in 2003.         The clarity and musicality that Ms. Day favored as a teacher were reflected in the uncluttered look of the repertory and performances of the Washington Ballet. This was especially true when the company's profile was strongly influenced by the dynamic plotless works of Choo San Goh, from Singapore, the company's resident choreographer from 1976 until his death in 1987. In the years afterward, Ms. Day and Elvi Moore, then the Washington Ballet's general director, encouraged company members and new choreographers to create works for their dancers.         Ms. Day leaves no immediate survivors.         Ms. Day's most popular production was her 1961 version of ''The Nutcracker,'' infused with vivid and cozy charm. Daughters of American presidents, including Chelsea Clinton and Caroline Kennedy, passed through the Washington School of Ballet, and Ms. Clinton had a small role in ''The Nutcracker.''         As for Ms. MacLaine, who grew up in the Washington area, she once thanked her beloved teacher at a benefit performance for recognizing her lack of talent and not encouraging her to go into ballet.       
         Zelda Foster, a social worker and early leader of the hospice movement who wrote a seminal article in 1965 attacking what she called the ''conspiracy of silence'' facing dying patients in hospitals, died on July 4 at her home in Park Slope, Brooklyn. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, said Harold Foster, her husband of 41 years.         Mrs. Foster applied principals of hospice care to patients in her charge at a Veterans Administration hospital long before such practices became widespread. She was largely successful at spreading those ideas throughout the nation's hospitals, particularly in the V.A. hospital network.         Starting as a caseworker in the late 1950's, and eventually as a supervisor at hospitals in Brooklyn, Mrs. Foster pressed hospitals to address the psychological needs -- along with the medical ones -- of the terminally ill. She was unable to ignore her growing discomfort with the way dying patients were treated -- the lack of information from their doctors, the sense of separation from their families, their silent submission to their fate.         In her 1965 article, in the Journal of the National Association of Social Workers, she wrote of her experiences as supervisor of social work at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Brooklyn and of the hospital's efforts to reform its treatment of the terminally ill. For the first time, she wrote, ''the majority of patients were considered capable of understanding the nature of their diseases.''         ''The good patient was no longer one who silently submitted to his fate,'' Mrs. Foster wrote. ''Patients were able to view the doctor more realistically and had less of a need to invest him with magical, omnipotent powers.''         Dr. Susan Gerbino, a professor at the New York University School of Social Work, said: ''She was way ahead of her time. And that was long before anybody was talking about patient autonomy and informed consent.''         Zelda Phyllis Leader was born on Aug. 8, 1934, a daughter of Nathan and Ida Leader, the owners of a candy store in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. Besides her husband, Mrs. Foster is survived by a daughter, Rachel Kodsi, and a son, Joshua, both of Brooklyn; a sister, Jeanette Katz, of Queens; and three grandchildren.         Mrs. Foster graduated from Brooklyn College in 1955 and earned a master's degree from the Columbia University School of Social Work three years later. By then, she was already a caseworker at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. She started work at the Brooklyn V.A. hospital in 1959.         In May 1966, eight months after Mrs. Foster's article sent ripples through the social work field, an international conference on hospice care was held at the Yale University School of Nursing. The keynote speaker, Dr. Cicely Saunders, requested that Mrs. Foster be invited. From then on they were both considered leaders of the movement.         Dr. Saunders is credited with starting the hospice movement in England in the late 1940's. By the early 1960's, the patients' rights movement had taken a foothold in the United States.         Dr. Florence S. Wald, the dean of the Yale School of Nursing at the time, said Mrs. Foster was instrumental in persuading hospitals to adopt the principles of hospice care. ''She focused on the organization, from the top down,'' Dr. Wald said. ''Not only hospices, but hospitals must make room for family members to stay overnight, not just during visiting hours; that they be able to feed their dying family members; that the minister or the rabbi be part of the decision-making process.''         Mrs. Foster taught at the Columbia School of Social Work and was director of mental health for the Children's Aid Society. She was also the first president of the New York State Hospice Association. After working at the Brooklyn V.A. hospital from 1959 to 1971, she returned in 1979, serving as chief of social work until her retirement in 1998.         Dr. Gerbino, of N.Y.U., said Mrs. Foster also ''trained hundreds of social workers in leadership for end-of-life care.''         ''There are many mini-Zeldas that she inspired, myself included,'' Dr. Gerbino said.       
         Cora T. Walker, a prominent New York lawyer who nearly 60 years ago became one of the first black women to practice law in the state, died last Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was cancer, said her son Lawrence R. Bailey Jr., a lawyer, who practiced with his mother for many years.         For decades, Ms. Walker ran a private practice in Harlem, first on 125th Street and later from a restored brownstone at 270 Lenox Avenue. From 1976 until her retirement in 1999, she was the senior partner in Walker & Bailey, one of the city's few black law firms, which she established with her son.         The firm's practice eventually included corporate clients like Conrail, the Ford Motor Company, Texas Instruments and Kentucky Fried Chicken. But Ms. Walker continued drawing up wills and preparing personal-injury claims for the men and women she described as the ''plain, ordinary, not elegant people'' of her Harlem community.         Active in Republican politics, Ms. Walker ran unsuccessfully for the New York State Senate in 1958 and 1964. In 1970, The New York Times included her -- the only woman -- on a list of the most powerful leaders in Harlem.         Cora Thomasina Walker was born on June 20, 1922, in Charlotte, N.C., one of nine children of William and Benetta Jones Walker. The family moved to the Bronx when she was a child. When she was an adolescent, her parents separated, leaving her, her mother and her siblings dependent on public assistance.         After graduating from James Monroe High School in the Bronx, Ms. Walker promptly informed the Welfare Department that their help was no longer required: she would support the family. She took a night job as a teletype operator with Western Union and also sold Christmas cards.         At the same time, Ms. Walker was enrolled at St. John's University, then in Brooklyn, in a special six-year program in which students earned both a bachelor's degree and a law degree. She received a bachelor's degree in accounting from St. John's in 1945 and a law degree the next year.         For much of her career, Ms. Walker was active in the National Bar Association, a historically black organization. She helped found the association's Corporate Counsel Conference, an annual meeting sponsored by its commercial law section. Begun in 1988, the conference helps black lawyers cultivate relationships with corporate clients.         In the 1960's, Ms. Walker became the first woman to serve as president of the Harlem Lawyers Association.         Ms. Walker's marriage, to Lawrence R. Bailey Sr., a lawyer, ended in divorce. In addition to her son Lawrence Jr., of the Bronx, she is survived by another son, Bruce E. Bailey, a physician, of Norwich, Conn.; a sister, Danetta Black, formerly of White Plains; and three grandchildren.         In 1947, when Ms. Walker was admitted to the New York bar, she found the doors of the city's law firms tightly shut. (One firm relented and offered her a position -- as a secretary.) So she struck out on her own.         Her first client was an undertaker, for whom she did collections. Before long, by dint of reading self-improvement books, Ms. Walker had learned to ''join everything, give everybody a card, join a political club,'' as she told The New York Times in 1989.         In 1999, the New York County Lawyers' Association installed a plaque outside the Lenox Avenue brownstone where Ms. Walker had her office, commemorating her half-century in the law. The building has since been sold, her son said, and the plaque is now gone.       
         Joan Guggenheimer, a soft-spoken lawyer who had the ear of the chief executives at two of the world's biggest banks, died Sunday at her home near Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 54.         The cause was colon cancer, her husband, Peter, said.         As general counsel of Citigroup and later of J. P. Morgan Chase, Mrs. Guggenheimer navigated both companies through Wall Street's legal waters, defending Smith Barney against sexual harassment charges in the ''Boom Boom Room'' case and helping resolve the Enron litigation at J. P. Morgan last year.         But she will be remembered as much for a quiet, effective style that made her a trusted adviser in the executive suite.         Mrs. Guggenheimer considered Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup's chairman and chief executive, a mentor as she rose through its legal ranks to become co-general counsel in 2001. She was also one of the closest advisers to James Dimon, who relied on her judgment when he ran the Smith Barney brokerage division of Citigroup. He recruited her in 2003 to be the top lawyer for Bank One, and later for J. P. Morgan when he became the chief executive.         Her husband said that her respect for fairness and rules helped find an ethical middle ground while defending the sexual harassment claims.         ''It was difficult because she understood there were real grievances,'' Mr. Guggenheimer said. ''But her role was to protect the company and she accomplished both goals.''         Joan Bleckman was raised in Queens and married Peter Guggenheimer, an architect, 33 years ago. After earning a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Binghamton University in 1973, Mrs. Guggenheimer graduated from Columbia Law School in 1979.         Mrs. Guggenheimer was a litigator before she took a job in Smith Barney's legal department in 1985.         She is survived by her husband, Peter, and their two children: Laura, a paralegal for the Manhattan district attorney's office; and Eric, a sophomore at Cornell University.         There will be a service at 11:45 a.m. today at Riverside Memorial Chapel at 180 West 76th Street.       
         Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, the German-born soprano whose interpretations of Strauss and Mozart made her one of the most dazzling artists of her time, died yesterday at her home in Austria. She was 90.         Her death was reported by Austrian state television. Citing a funeral home director, the broadcaster, ORF, said Miss Schwarzkopf had died in the town of Schruns in Austria's westernmost province, Vorarlberg. No cause of death was given.         To her legions of admirers, Miss Schwarzkopf was a peerless interpreter of Strauss's Marschallin, Mozart's Donna Elvira and other operatic roles. But her image was tarnished in her later years by revelations that she had lied about the extent of her association with the Nazis during World War II.         Not only had she performed for the Nazis, it was learned, but she had also been a member of the party. In her defense, she said that for an artist needing work, joining the party had been ''akin to joining a union.''         For a singer of such unquestionable stature, Miss Schwarzkopf's work was controversial. In her prime, she possessed a radiant lyric soprano voice, impressive technical agility and exceptional understanding of style. From the 1950's until the 1970's, she was for many listeners the high priestess of the lieder recital, a sublime artist who brought textual nuance, interpretive subtlety and elegant musicianship to her work.         But others found her interpretations calculated, mannered and arch (the ''Prussian perfectionist,'' one critic called her), and complained that in trying to add textual vitality, Miss Schwarzkopf resorted to crooning and half-spoken dramatic effects.         Connoisseurs and critics could be surprisingly divided about her basic vocal gifts.         Will Crutchfield, reviewing some live recordings of Miss Schwarzkopf in recital, wrote in The New York Times in 1990: ''It was always clear that she had a superior voice (a smooth, glamorous lyric soprano) and superior technical command.'' Yet Peter G. Davis, writing in The Times in 1981, described her career as ''a triumph of intelligence and willpower over what was basically an unremarkable voice.''         The consensus, however, was that in roles like the Marschallin and other Strauss heroines (Ariadne in ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' the countess in ''Capriccio''), as well as Mozart's Fiordiligi and Countess Almaviva and Wagner's Eva and Elsa, she could sing incomparably, with shimmering tone and richness and charismatic presence.         She was an uncommonly beautiful woman, despite a visible gap between her two front teeth that she never bothered to correct, with light hair and deep-set gray eyes. For a time in her younger years she pursued a career as a film actress and might have succeeded had she continued.         A hard-working, self-challenging singer, she performed 74 roles in 53 operas, including Anne Trulove in the world premiere of Stravinsky's ''Rake's Progress'' in Venice in 1951. Her lieder repertory included hundreds of songs by Schubert, Schumann, Mozart and Strauss, and she was a pioneering champion of the songs of Hugo Wolf, which she sang with insight and affecting beauty.         Olga Maria Elisabeth Frederike Schwarzkopf was born on Dec. 9, 1915, in Jarotschin, Germany, in what is now west-central Poland. Both her parents were Prussian. Friedrich Schwarzkopf, her father, a classics schoolmaster, was an easygoing intellectual. Her mother, the former Elisabeth Frohling, was an efficient homemaker who took charge of her adored only child's education and budding musical career.         Friedrich Schwarzkopf's work as a teacher necessitated that the family move several times. When Elisabeth was 13, they settled in Magdeburg, Germany, where she studied piano, guitar, viola and organ and developed a naturally high, light voice that kept her in demand for concerts at school and local amateur performances.         The family moved to Berlin in 1933, the year Hitler came to power. Miss Schwarzkopf attended the Berlin Royal Augusta School and later won admission to the Hochschule f√ºr Musik. In 1934, before beginning her formal training, she won a grant from the League of National Socialist Students for a cycling and camping trip to England, where she learned English. She retained a fondness for the country, which after the war embraced her as an artist and made her a Dame of the British Empire in 1992.         At the music school, students were required to attend daily lectures on Hitler's National Socialist movement, and in 1935, when she was nearly 20, Miss Schwarzkopf joined the student association of the National Socialist Party. Alan Jefferson, a Schwarzkopf biographer, said she became f√ºhrerin of the student organization and that one of her responsibilities as ideological leader was to ''keep an eye on other students.''         Her teacher at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Lula Mysz-Gmeiner, though distinguished in her field, inexplicably believed that Miss Schwarzkopf should be a contralto. It was not until after her formal training, in 1938, when she began singing with the Berlin State Opera, that Miss Schwarzkopf came into her own vocally.         During this time she gained a reputation as a singer fiercely determined to leap from the small roles typically assigned a newcomer into substantive parts. The director of the company, Wilhelm Rode, had won the favor of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister. One reason Miss Schwarzkopf later gave for cooperating with the Nazis was that it was incumbent on aspiring singers in the company to support the party.         But until the 1980's, she maintained that she had never officially joined the Nazi Party. She denied having done so in three Allied questionnaires in 1945, a time during the occupation when former party members were usually barred from public performance in Germany.         In 1982, however, a music historian at the University of Vienna, Oliver Rathkolb, published a doctoral dissertation that revealed details of her party membership. The information had come from documents discovered in the Allied Denazification Bureau in Vienna and subsequently moved to the National Archives in Washington.         According to these records, Miss Schwarzkopf applied for membership on Jan. 26, 1940, and was accepted on March 1 of that year, becoming Nazi member No. 7548960. Scholars and authors have since placed her application for party membership even earlier.         In an interview with The Times in 1983, Miss Schwarzkopf denied she had been a party member. But when told of these documents by The Times, she admitted that she had joined the party. ''We thought nothing of it,'' she said. ''We just did it.'' In a letter to The Times, she expanded on her explanation: ''It was akin to joining a union, and exactly for the same reason: to have a job.''         In other interviews, she quoted in her defense the first line of Tosca's famous aria: ''Vissi d'arte,'' which translates, ''I lived for art.''         Discussion of her Nazi past re-emerged briefly in connection with tributes to her on her 80th birthday. Mr. Jefferson's biography, ''Elisabeth Schwarzkopf,'' which came out at the time, raised debate about her wartime role, depicting her as an ambitious singer who was focused on furthering her career.         As a Nazi, Miss Schwarzkopf gave performances at party functions and sang for Waffen SS troops at the front. Some researchers believe she became a member of Goebbels's Reichstheaterkammer, working in the propaganda ministry and appearing insome films.         Still, if she had hoped that party affiliation would quickly advance her career at the Berlin State Opera, it did not work as planned. She was still expected to sing, sometimes nightly, bit roles in ''Carmen,'' ''Die Fledermaus'' and frothy operettas.         Her breakthrough came with the dauntingly difficult coloratura role of Zerbinetta in ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' which she first sang in late 1940. Her performance won the attention of Maria Ivog√ºn, a noted exponent of the role. Miss Ivog√ºn was so impressed, she took on Miss Schwarzkopf as a private student, coaching her in the high soprano repertory, and training her as a lieder singer. Miss Schwarzkopf was soon engaged by the Vienna State Opera.         She realized that her future lay with the lyric soprano repertory. Engagements followed at the first postwar Salzburg Festival in 1947, where she worked with the conductor Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, and in subsequent summers, when she formed a close working relationship with the conductor Herbert von Karajan. She also toured with the Vienna State Opera in 1947, traveling to London, where she performed in ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Fidelio'' at Covent Garden.         The London performances were an enormous success, and she was invited to join the newly founded Covent Garden company. She sang with the company for the next five years, performing not just her German repertory but also Violetta, Mimi, Gilda, and Massenet's Manon, all in English.         Her career and repertory choices were now being shaped by Walter Legge, then a music administrator and critic. Born in London in 1906, Legge had no formal training in music but was musically astute. He had been an assistant to Sir Thomas Beecham and was largely responsible for forming the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus.         After the war, Legge worked mainly for recording companies. It was during a scouting trip to Vienna in search of new talent for EMI Records that the severe-looking, bespectacled Legge first heard Miss Schwarzkopf in an audition. Thus began an artistic partnership that grew into a life partnership. Legge, then divorced from his first wife, Nancy Evans, a mezzo-soprano, married Miss Schwarzkopf in 1953.         Opinion is divided about the effect Legge had on Miss Schwarzkopf as an artist. He tended to treat her as a musical and intellectual inferior. He was capable of berating her in public when she failed to meet his approval.         But he introduced her to a wealth of repertory, especially the songs of Hugo Wolf, and as artistic director of EMI Records, he supervised her recordings, coaching her in detail and ensuring that the engineers captured her voice at its best. Given Miss Schwarzkopf's association with the Nazis, there was some trepidation about launching her American career. Her debut in the United States was delayed until October 1953, but that performance, a single sold-out song recital at Town Hall in New York, captivated the critics.         This was followed in late 1954 by an American tour, which ended back at Town Hall. A critic for Musical America wrote that Miss Schwarzkopf's singing at Town Hall had ''displayed the exquisite finish, technical mastery and interpretive felicity that had marked her debut recital here last season.''         In the fall of 1956 she sang a recital at Carnegie Hall. It was the first time the hall had ever been sold out for a program of German lieder.         Miss Schwarzkopf's American operatic debut came in 1955 with the San Francisco Opera as the Marschallin. Mildred Norton, a critic for The Saturday Review, reported that a capacity audience had saluted a ''memorable new Princess Werdenberg.'' Miss Schwarzkopf, she wrote, was ''a poised and vibrant new personality with a vocal radiance and a personal grace.''         Her debut at the Metropolitan Opera did not occur until October 1964, again as the Marschallin. Though Raymond Erickson, a critic for The Times, noted less freshness and bloom in Miss Schwarzkopf's voice (she was nearly 49), he said she had ''conquered her listeners, and the roar that filled the house when she took her bows must be the kind that the most vain prima donna could ask for.''         Outside the Metropolitan Opera House, there were scattered protests over her wartime career, and Miss Schwarzkopf had a chilly relationship with the Met's general manager Rudolf Bing, an Austrian-born Jew. Besides her six performances of the Marschallin that debut season, she sang only one more time at the Met, a Donna Elvira in 1966.         But she performed frequently in New York in recital and with orchestras and continued to win devoted admirers around the world. Many of her EMI recordings became immediate classics. Among them were her Mozart song album with the pianist Walter Gieseking and her Schubert song album with the pianist Edwin Fischer, both recorded in 1952; her 1957 recording of ''Rosenkavalier,'' conducted by Karajan, and, one of her finest achievements, her 1959 recording of ''Capriccio,'' conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.         As her career slowed, she began giving master classes, usually teaming with Legge, gaining a reputation as an insightful but almost impossibly exacting coach. In 1977-78, she embarked on a swan song recital tour, mostly accompanied by the pianist Geoffrey Parsons, who was her partner for her official farewell recital in Zurich on March 19, 1979. Two days later, Legge, who had become embittered that his talents were no longer sought by recording companies, died of a heart attack at 72.         Miss Schwarzkopf leaves no immediate survivors. Asked once whether she regretted having had no children, she replied, ''I have 500 children, the songs I sing.''         Correction:  August 5, 2006, Saturday  A photograph with an obituary yesterday about the renowned soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who died Thursday in Austria at age 90, was published in error. The picture, supplied by the Salzburg Festival, showed Anneliese Rothenberger, not Miss Schwarzkopf, in the role of Sophie from a 1962 film adaptation of Richard Strauss's opera ''Der Rosenkavalier.'' Miss Schwarzkopf played the Marschallin in that production, which the festival had staged for the film. The Marschallin was a signature role for Miss Schwarzkopf, who performed it, above, in 1959 at Covent Garden in London.         (Photo by Evening Standard/Getty Images)         Correction:  August 5, 2006, Saturday  A picture yesterday with an obituary of the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was published in error. It showed Anneliese Rothenberger -- not Miss Schwarzkopf -- in the role of Sophie from ''Der Rosenkavalier,'' a 1962 film adaptation of the Richard Strauss opera. The Salzburg Festival mounted that production, in which Miss Schwarzkopf had the role of the Marschallin, and originally distributed the photograph with the incorrect information. A picture of Miss Schwarzkopf appears today on Page C10.         The obituary also misspelled the surname of a music critic for The New York Times who reviewed Miss Schwarzkopf's debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1964. He was Raymond Ericson, not Erickson.         Correction:  August 10, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Friday of the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf referred incorrectly to her birthplace in some copies. When she was born in 1915, the town was Jarotschin, Germany, not Jarocin, and it was not ''near Poland;'' Poland did not exist then as an independent nation. Since 1918 the town has been Jarocin, Poland.       
         Victoria Jackson Gray Adams, a key figure in the struggle by Mississippi blacks to win their political and civil rights in the 1960's and the first woman to seek a seat in the United States Senate from her state, died Aug. 12 in Baltimore. She was 79.         Her death was announced by her son, the Rev. Cecil Conteen Gray of Baltimore.         Forty-two years ago, Mrs. Gray Adams, a teacher, door-to-door saleswoman of Beauty Queen cosmetics and leader of voter education classes from the hamlet of Palmers Crossing, on the edge of Hattiesburg, Miss., decided to take on Senator John C. Stennis, the Mississippi Democrat who at the time had been in the Senate for 16 years.         In July 1964, she announced that she and others from the tiny Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party would challenge the power of the segregationist politicians, like Mr. Stennis, who represented her state. The time had come, she said, to pay attention ''to the Negro in Mississippi, who had not even had the leavings from the American political table.''         That decision became a turning point for the civil rights movement and for the Democratic Party, which for most of its history had been profoundly influenced by all-white delegations from the South. From Hattiesburg, the waves of the civil rights movement ''swept quietly through the church world into politics,'' the author Taylor Branch wrote in ''Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years, 1963-65'' (Simon & Schuster, 1998).         Mrs. Gray Adams was defeated by a ratio of 30 to 1 in the Democratic primary, in part because Mississippi had effectively disenfranchised black voters. But the party she started and led went on to challenge the right of the all-white Mississippi delegation to represent her state at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City.         ''We had women, men, African-Americans, whites,'' Mrs. Gray Adams said of the party in a 2004 interview for the Virginia Organizing Project, a grass-roots political group she helped found. ''We were going in the face of the Mississippi Democratic Party, which included some of the most powerful members of the U.S. Congress, to demand that we be recognized to have representation at the Democratic National Convention. It was wild.''         Millions of Americans watching on television saw Fannie Lou Hamer, the best known of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party's founders, tell the convention's credentials committee how she had been jailed and beaten for trying to register blacks to vote. ''Is this America?'' Ms. Hamer asked. The third founder of the party who sought to be seated as a delegate was Annie Devine.         The all-white Mississippi delegation walked out of the convention. It rejected a compromise proposal to give the integrated Freedom Democratic Party token representation on the floor. It was the beginning of the end of an old political tradition. In 1968, Mississippi seated an integrated delegation at the Democratic convention.         ''We really were the true Democratic Party,'' Mrs. Gray Adams said in the 2004 interview. In the end, she said, ''we accomplished the removal of the wall, the curtain of fear in Mississippi for African-Americans demanding their rights.''         She continued: ''We eliminated the isolation of the African-Americans from the political process. I believe that Mississippi now has the highest number of African-American elected officials in the nation. We laid the groundwork for that.''         Born on Nov. 5, 1926, in Palmers Crossing, the daughter of Mack and Annie Mae Ott Jackson, Mrs. Gray Adams was educated at Wilberforce University in Ohio, the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and Jackson State College in Mississippi. She went on to serve as a campus minister at Virginia State University and to teach and lecture at schools, colleges and universities across the nation.         Her first marriage, to Tony Gray, produced three children, Georgie; Tony Jr., who died in 1997; and Cecil, and ended in divorce in 1964. Other survivors include her husband of 40 years, Reuben Earnest Adams Jr.; their son, Reuben III; a brother, Glodies Jackson; and eight grandchildren.         Mrs. Gray Adams said she learned in 1964 that there are two kinds of people in grass-roots politics, ''those who are in the movement, and those who have the movement in them.''         ''The movement is in me,'' she said, ''and I know it always will be.''       
         Lydia, Duchess of Bedford, an English aristocrat who helped transform Woburn Abbey, her second husband's ancestral home in Bedfordshire, into a pioneering and satisfyingly lucrative example of blueblood tourism, died July 25 in Chertsey, Surrey, England. She was 88.         Her death came after she was injured in a fall, said Paul de Fraine, personal assistant to the present duke.         After inheriting Woburn Abbey in 1953, with its staggering estate taxes and annual heating bills of $14,000, Ian Russell, 13th Duke of Bedford, a former newspaper reporter and rent collector, decided to make the dilapidated property pay for itself by reinventing it as a tourist attraction. It was not easy; half the building had been demolished because of dry rot.         The estate, with more than 10,000 acres of land, had been in the Russell family since 1547, and when the new duke and duchess, who had been farming in South Africa, were called home to do their dynastic duty, they literally rolled up their sleeves and washed antique porcelain dinner services and dusted off the paintings by Canaletto, Landseer and Van Dyck.         Six months of cleaning later, Woburn Abbey's doors were opened to the public in 1954. The entrance fee was a half-crown, about 35 cents; it is now ¬£10.50, about $20.         Some of the couple's noble friends were horrified at additions that they considered shocking intrusions of show business: in addition to snack bars and sailboat rentals, there was a children's zoo with a skunk named Jasmine. More startling stunts were to come. The property eventually developed a safari park with lions, giraffes and Barbary apes. Marilyn Monroe was invited to sleep in one of the historic beds.         However, many members of the nobility tried to follow the example of the duke and duchess when it became clear that the newly enlivened Woburn Abbey was a moneymaker.         In the first five months of 1957, according to an article in The New York Times, 373,000 tourists visited the property, paying more than $200,000 toward the upkeep of the estate.         The estate is now managed by the duke's grandson Andrew Russell, 15th Duke of Bedford. Today, it incorporates three award-winning golf courses, an inn, a stud farm, an antiques center and a restaurant housed in a Tudor-style half-timbered building that was displayed at the Paris Exhibition of 1878.         Born in 1917 as the Hon. Lydia Yarde-Buller, the duchess was a member of a family whose genealogical tentacles connected her to an array of notables, including Sir Walter Raleigh, Robert E. Lee, Olivia de Havilland and President Benjamin Harrison. Her father, John Yarde-Buller, the third Baron Churston, was a military officer who served in the Boer War. Her mother, Jessie Smither, was one of Edwardian London's most alluring musical comedy stars, performing under the stage name Denise Orme. Adding further exotic gloss to the Yarde-Buller clan was the duchess's sister Joan, who married the playboy Prince Aly Khan, converted to Islam and adopted the name Princess Tajuldowlah.         The duchess married her first husband, Capt. Ian Archibald de Hoghton Lyle, heir to a baronetcy, in 1938; he was killed in action four years later. She married the Duke of Bedford in 1947, about a year after the suicide of his first wife, when he was still the Marquess of Tavistock. They divorced in 1960 because of the duke's affair with the French television producer Nicole Milinaire, who became his third and last wife.         Lydia, Duchess of Bedford (who kept her title after the divorce, with the customary addition of her first name to avoid confusion with her husband's new wife) is survived by two sons, Sir Gavin Lyle, third baronet, of Murthly, Perth, Scotland, and Lord Francis Russell of London; a daughter, Lorna Alexander of St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland; a stepson, Lord Rudolf Russell, also of London; and nephews and nieces who include Aga Khan IV, the 49th imam of the Shiite Imami Ismaili Muslims, who lives in Paris.       
         Annely Juda, a London art dealer whose gallery, Annely Juda Fine Art, was known for its pioneering shows of early European modernists, died on Aug. 13 in London. She was 91.         Ms. Juda died after nearly a year of declining health, said Michael Michaeledes, an artist and friend of the family, who has exhibited with Ms. Juda's gallery since 1963.         In a gallery career that spanned five decades, Ms. Juda represented numerous contemporary artists, among them Anthony Caro, David Hockney, Leon Kossoff, Alan Charlton, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, and Tadashi Kawamata. But she was especially known for her annual summer exhibitions, often titled ''The Non-Objective World,'' which helped reintroduce the work of the Russian avant-garde and of de Stijl and Bauhaus artists to the London art world and beyond; they often contained works rarely seen elsewhere. The 1981 summer show, for example, featured seven sculptures by the Russian Constructivist Vladimir Tatlin reconstructed from archival photographs by Martyn Chalk, a British sculptor.         Ms. Juda was born Anneliese Brauer in Kassel, Germany, in 1914. Her mother was a designer of clothing and typefaces, and her father was an industrial chemist with a keen interest in Goethe's theory of color. Ms. Juda began studying art history, but the family, which was Jewish, moved to Palestine shortly after Hitler came to power.         Three years later, she traveled to London, working in a boarding house for German refugees in lieu of paying rent while she studied art history and clothing design at the Reimann School. In 1939, she married Paul Juda, also German, and in 1949 she returned with her husband to Germany to try to reclaim his family's confiscated property.         In 1955, the couple separated and Ms. Juda took their three children to London, where she raised them alone, often by working several jobs at once. For two years she administered the Eric Estorick Collection, which immersed her in the art of the Italian Futurists.         In 1960 Ms. Juda opened the Molton Gallery with partners; it was followed in 1963 by the Hamilton Galleries, also with partners. In 1968, she joined forces with her son, David, to form Annely Juda Fine Art, inaugurating the gallery with her first summer exhibition of non-objective art. Ms. Juda was made a Companion of the Order of the British Empire in 1998.         In addition to her son, she is survived by two daughters, Carol Spund of Glasgow and Susan Habrovitsky of Fontenay-sous-Bois, France; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Melissa Hayden, one of American ballet's greatest ballerinas, whose exultant, dramatic style defied the supposed impersonal mold of the ''Balanchine dancer,'' making her one of New York City Ballet's first international stars, died yesterday at her home in Winston-Salem, N.C. She was 83.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her son, Stuart H. Coleman.         Direct in both her dancing and her views about dance, Ms. Hayden was known for her unmatched blend of individuality and versatility.         ''Blunt honesty and generosity in her life and dancing, that was her name,'' Jacques d'Amboise, her longtime partner, said yesterday.         Ms. Hayden began her career with American Ballet Theater from 1945 to 1947 and returned there in 1953 and 1954. But essentially she was a charter member of City Ballet, joining the troupe shortly after it was founded by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein at the end of 1948. She retired in September 1973.         Unlike other Balanchine ballerinas who were about to leave the company, Ms. Hayden was honored with a new ballet that Balanchine created for her. Although that work, ''Cort√®ge Hongrois'' was considered a pi√®ce d'occasion, it remains in the City Ballet repertory, bringing back memories of Balanchine as a flower boy giving Ms. Hayden a bouquet onstage.         At the same performance, Mayor John V. Lindsay presented her with New York City's Handel Medallion, which praised her as an ''extraordinary ballerina who has filled the hearts of her audiences with joy.''         On the same theme and in his own tribute, Kirstein wrote: ''Melissa has been the nearest thing to a 'star' in our starless company. We have never encouraged stardom on programs, posters or publicity; managers can't make stars. The public does.''         In the last 25 years, Ms. Hayden also established herself as an influential teacher. After retiring from performing, Ms. Hayden headed the ballet department at Skidmore College and the School of Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, where she was briefly artistic director. She also opened her own school in Manhattan. Since 1983, she had taught at the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem. Among her 6,000 students was Gillian Murphy, now a principal at Ballet Theater.         John Mauceri, the school's chancellor, said yesterday that Ms. Hayden had taught until a month ago. Her ''astonishing 23 years'' as a mentor at the school ''speaks to her genius, commitment and passion for the dance,'' he said.         Passion was certainly a synonym for Ms. Hayden's dancing. Although her early triumphs in City Ballet were in works with a narrative tinge (William Dollar's ''Duel'' and Frederick Ashton's ''Illuminations''), she did not need a dance drama to excel. By the end of her career, she had danced some 60 ballets in the repertory, mainly Balanchine's plotless works.         Anyone who saw her in Balanchine's step-packed Tchaikovsky ballet ''Allegro Brillante'' could be stunned by her outpouring of energetic classical style. At the close, Ms. Hayden seemed as emotionally spent as her audience.         After she returned from Ballet Theater in 1955, Balanchine began to create new works for her, clearly valuing her temperament as he might not have before. A popular favorite is the 1958 ''Stars and Stripes,'' to music by Sousa. Its pas de deux was created for Ms. Hayden and Mr. d'Amboise, who both embodied its marching-band spirit and good humor.         ''The company called us Ike and Mamie,'' Mr. d'Amboise said, referring to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife.         Ms. Hayden was born on April 25, 1923, in Toronto, where she began ballet lessons at 12 with the Moscow-trained teacher Boris Volkoff. Seeking further training, she went to New York, where for six months she danced in the ballet corps of Radio City Music Hall. (The troupe was later disbanded.) In one pageant she appeared as a star in a flag representing Oklahoma. When onstage, she said, she would tell herself: ''I am Oklahoma. I was admitted to the union on Nov. 16, 1907. I'm a great producer of oil.''         When she joined Ballet Theater in 1945, the choreographer Antony Tudor suggested that she change her name from Mildred Herman to Melissa Hayden.         After Ballet Theater disbanded temporarily, she danced on Broadway and joined other dancers from the company in 1948 for a nine-month tour of Cuba and Latin America by the newly organized Ballet Alicia Alonso. Nicholas Magallanes, who had been in Balanchine's previous troupes, recommended her to Balanchine for his new company. In Argentina, Ms. Hayden received a telegram from Balanchine telling her to pick up a plane ticket to New York.         Although Balanchine had gone out of his way to recruit her, Ms. Hayden found her path anything but smooth in the first few years. In ''Melissa Hayden Off Stage and On,'' the first of her three books, she spoke frankly of the problems a dancer can face.         In her own case, she said, she was torn originally between her love for Balanchine's works and the greater applause and cheers she received when dancing as a guest with other companies. In ''Melissa Hayden,'' she wrote: ''To dance Balanchine's ballets successfully, we must subordinate our personalities and blend with all the other dancers onstage. To do this means that the audience will not see us as individuals. In ballets of other choreographers and especially story ballets, the opposite is true.''         Upset that Balanchine did not create new roles for her and would not let her dance in his ''Swan Lake'' in her early years with the company, Ms. Hayden returned to Ballet Theater. When she came back to City Ballet because she missed the high quality of Balanchine ballets, she and the choreographer reconciled.         As always, Ms. Hayden remained herself. Although Balanchine frowned on his ballerinas' having children, Ms. Hayden had two with her husband, Donald Coleman, who survives her. Besides her son, of Scarsdale, N.Y., she is also survived by a daughter, Jennifer C. Damsky, of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.         During her career, Ms. Hayden reached a mass audience with frequent appearances on television, especially ''The Kate Smith Show.'' In 1952 she was the dancing double for Claire Bloom in Charlie Chaplin's film ''Limelight.''         But essentially, she was a versatile dancer at a time when City Ballet was more eclectic in its programs than in later years. New works by choreographers other than Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were the norm. In ''The Duel,'' Ms. Hayden was the female warrior in a plumed helmet who died a melodramatic death at the hands of her Crusader lover. ''The audience screamed after the performance in London,'' Mr. d'Amboise said.         ''When we all went to London, she was the big star,'' he added. ''She won the audience.''         Those who saw her in ''Illuminations,'' Ashton's meditation on the poet Arthur Rimbaud, will hardly forget her as Profane Love, one foot bare and one in a toeshoe as a turbulent allegorical figure.         At the same time, she was prominent in a host of Balanchine ballets. She was the first and vibrant Titania in his ''Midsummer Night's Dream,'' the mesmerizing, passionate Eurydice in his ''Orpheus,'' an especially vivacious Sugarplum Fairy in ''The Nutcracker'' and the virtuosic ballerina in the ''Spanish'' solo of ''Agon.'' Finally, she was the womanly and emotional Odette in her coveted role in ''Swan Lake.''       
         Ann W. Richards, the silver-haired Texas activist who galvanized the 1988 Democratic National Convention with her tart keynote speech and was the state's 45th governor until upset in 1994 by an underestimated challenger named George W. Bush, died Wednesday at her home in Austin. She was 73.         The cause was complications of esophageal cancer, a family spokeswoman, Cathy Bonner, said. Ms. Bonner said the illness was diagnosed in March.         A champion of civil rights for minorities, women and gay men and lesbians, Ms. Richards first ran for governor in 1990 calling for a ''New Texas'' that would offer more opportunity and power to those groups.         She went on to become one of the most effective in a long line of Texas progressives who vied for control of the state when it was largely a Democratic stronghold. But her defeat after one term was a strong signal that generations of Democratic dominance in Texas had ended.         If one Mr. Bush closed out her political career, another figured into her rise, as a target of her barbs. ''Poor George, he can't help it,'' Ms. Richards said at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta, speaking about the current president's father, former President George Bush. ''He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.''         Her saucy, plain-spoken keynote address, borrowing from the great tradition of vernacular Southern oratory, was one of the year's political highlights. ''We're gonna tell how the cow ate the cabbage,'' she said at one point.         The speech transformed her, then the Texas treasurer, into a national figure. And it made her, a mother of four, an admired champion of feminism. ''Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did,'' she told the national audience. ''She just did it backwards and in high heels.''         Her defeat in 1994, coming in a year of sweeping Republican success at the polls nationwide, did not dim her celebrity on the national stage. She continued to speak out on behalf of liberal causes, was a regular commentator on CNN and appeared in national advertising campaigns, including one for snack chips.         She also went to work as a senior adviser for the international law firm of Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand (now DLA Piper) and later for the public relations company Public Strategies. She also served on numerous boards of directors, including those of J. C. Penney, Brandeis University and the Aspen Institute.         Dorothy Ann Willis was born Sept. 1, 1933, an only child, in Lakeview, Tex. She graduated in 1950 from Waco High School, where she showed a special facility for debate and met her future husband, David Richards. In her junior year, she attended the Girls State mock government program in Austin and was one of two delegates chosen to attend Girls Nation in Washington.         Ms. Richards went on to enroll at Baylor University in Waco on a debate scholarship and married. After graduating, she and Mr. Richards moved to Austin, where she earned a teaching certificate at the University of Texas in 1955 and taught social studies for several years at Fulmore Middle School. She reared her four children -- Cecile, Daniel, Clark and Ellen -- in Austin, and they were with her at home when she died, Ms. Bonner said.         Ms. Richards is also survived by eight grandchildren. Cecile Richards, who became president of Planned Parenthood this year, lives in New York; the other siblings live in Austin.         As a young woman, Ann Richards volunteered in several campaigns for governor: in 1958 for Henry B. Gonzalez and in 1952, 1954 and 1956 for Ralph Yarborough. She then helped Mr. Yarborough's senatorial campaign in 1957.         In the early 1960's, she and a handful of other young Democrats founded North Dallas Democratic Women in an effort to give more power to women in the party. ''The regular Democratic Party and its organization was run by men who looked on women as little more than machine parts,'' she said later.         In 1972, she ran her first campaign, helping elect to the Texas Legislature Sarah Weddington, who had successfully argued Roe v. Wade before the United States Supreme Court.         In 1976, Ms. Richards defeated a three-term incumbent to become a commissioner in Travis County, which includes Austin. She held the job for four years. She also began drinking heavily, becoming alcoholic and putting great strain on her marriage, she said later. The marriage ended in divorce.         After entering rehabilitation, she stopped drinking in 1980 and later said that the decision to seek help had saved her life and salvaged her political career.         ''I have seen the very bottom of life,'' she said. ''I was so afraid I wouldn't be funny anymore. I just knew that I would lose my zaniness and my sense of humor. But I didn't. Recovery turned out to be a wonderful thing.''         In 1982, she ran for state treasurer and received the most votes of any statewide candidate, becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas in 50 years. She was re-elected in 1986.         In 1990, when Gov. William P. Clements Jr., the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction, decided not to run for re-election, Ms. Richards challenged a former governor, Mark White, in the Democratic primary and won. She went on to defeat the Republican candidate, Clayton Williams, a wealthy rancher, in the general election after a brutal campaign.         As governor, among other achievements, she fulfilled her campaign promise to bring more blacks, Hispanics and women into public office. She appointed the first black regent to the University of Texas and installed the first blacks and women on the state's legendary police force, the Texas Rangers. She also pushed for tougher penalties for polluters and gained control of the state's insurance board in a drive to reduce the industry's influence over state government.         Ms. Richards oversaw an expansion of the state's prison system, increasing the space for prisoners by a third, and cracked down on the number of prisoners being paroled. She also instituted a major substance abuse program for prisoners and championed creation of the Texas lottery as a source of public school financing. She bought the first lotto ticket herself on May 29, 1992.         The same year, she was named chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, which nominated Bill Clinton for president for the first time.         Two years later, she underestimated her young Republican challenger from West Texas, George W. Bush, going so far as to refer to him as ''some jerk.'' The comment drew considerable criticism. She later acknowledged that Mr. Bush had been more effective than she at ''staying on message'' and that he had made none of the mistakes that her campaign strategists had expected. She was beaten 53 percent to 46 percent.         Ms. Richards was a co-author of several books, including ''Straight from the Heart: My Life in Politics and Other Places'' (Simon & Schuster, 1989), with Peter Knobler, and ''I'm Not Slowing Down: Winning My Battle with Osteoporosis'' (Dutton, 2003), with Richard U. Levine, a doctor.         On her 60th birthday, she got a motorcycle license, an event that was commemorated in a cover photo in Texas Monthly showing Ms. Richards's head superimposed on the body of a woman in a fringed jacket atop a Harley-Davidson beneath the headline ''White Hot Mama.''         In recent years, Ms. Richards had worked to establish the Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders, a public college preparatory school in Austin. It will open next year, giving priority to economically disadvantaged students. She was also a sought-after commentator and speaker whose observations had lost little of their tart humor since her national emergence two decades ago.         As she once explained, ''I learned early on that people liked you if you made them laugh.''         Correction:  September 16, 2006, Saturday  A picture caption yesterday with the obituary of Ann W. Richards, the former Texas governor, misstated the year she gave the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. It was 1988, not 1998.       
         Patricia Kennedy Lawford, who as a sister of President John F. Kennedy had a front row seat to history and forged new links between her brother's administration and Hollywood through her marriage to the actor Peter Lawford, died yesterday at her home in Southampton, N.Y. She was 82 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Melissa Wagoner, a spokeswoman for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Mrs. Lawford's brother.         Poised as a princess, athletic and lithe, Mrs. Lawford is widely remembered as the Roman Catholic schoolgirl who dismayed her domineering father, Joseph P. Kennedy, the former Ambassador to Britain, by marrying Mr. Lawford, a debonair British actor.         Patricia Kennedy's 1954 marriage to Mr. Lawford was the stuff of newsreels; some 3,000 spectators gathered outside St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church on the Upper East Side.         The sixth of nine children born to Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald, Mrs. Lawford, like her siblings, had a well-honed understanding of politics and of the power of appearances. As early as 1946, she campaigned for her brother John during his first run for Congress, organizing highly effective women's coffees in Boston and Cambridge neighborhoods, and when he ran for President in 1960 she often substituted at events for his pregnant wife, Jacqueline Kennedy.         The Lawfords strengthened John F. Kennedy's ties to the show business world of Hollywood and Las Vegas through Mr. Lawford's association with ''The Rat Pack'' of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Shirley MacLaine.         Through the years, Mrs. Lawford was close friends with Marilyn Monroe, Tennesee Williams, and Sinatra, for whom she partly named her daughter Victoria Frances.         In 1966, after 11 years of marriage, Mrs. Lawford became the first Kennedy to file for a divorce. It was a highly publicized break, one that required Mrs. Lawford to establish residency in Idaho in order to circumvent New York's divorce laws of the time.         Afterward, Mrs. Lawford and her four children moved to New York, where she took on a busy social schedule, befriended artists and writers and became known as a generous benefactor of the arts. She was a familiar presence at benefit dinners and her patronage would increase the cachet of any fund-raising charity event. Her name still regularly appeared in the society columns of Palm Beach, New York and the Hamptons, where she maintained a residence.         Patricia Kennedy was born on May 6, 1924, in Brookline, Mass., the fourth daughter of Joseph P. and Rose Kennedy and the granddaughter of John F. Fitzgerald, the popular mayor of Boston who had earlier served in the House of Representatives. Hers was a family that expected women to be graceful and well-rounded while remaining in the background, quietly serving the ambitions of their men. Of the five Kennedy sisters, she was considered the most beautiful and sophisticated, with the aristocratic air of her mother. She was an accomplished athlete but unlike her ambitious siblings, she never caught the family's legendary fire for competition.         In her book 1987 book, ''The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys,'' Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote that Rose Kennedy was bothered by Patricia's lack of ambition. ''Although she had a good mind, a fine physique and a beautiful face which could easily have led her to excel in school, in sports or in appearance, Rose contended 'she would never make the effort to achieve distinction' in any of these areas.''         Much like her older sister, Kathleen, who made her mother furious by marrying outside her church, Patricia disappointed her parents by marrying Mr. Lawford, a nominal Episcopalian who agreed to raise their childen as Catholics.         Mrs. Lawford was the only Kennedy to move away from the family's traditional East Coast settings of Hyannis Port, Palm Beach and New York. She and Mr. Lawford settled into a sprawling mansion in Malibu that was once owned by Louis B. Mayer. The house became a recreation center for other family members, and the President would spend time lounging at his sister's pool when he was on the West Coast.         After the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, she was often seen in the company of his widow and their two children. As recently as 1986, she joined Senator Kennedy on an official visit to Chile that was marred by egg-throwing protestors angered by Mr. Kennedy's criticism of President Augusto Pinochet.         She devoted her energies to organizations that served the mentally disabled and those helping people with substance abuse problems. She had a close personal appreciation for both causes: her older sister Rosemary was born mildly retarded and was lobotomized at 23, and she, Mr. Lawford and her son Christopher had waged their own battles with drugs and alcohol.         Her brother Robert, the former attorney general and later senator from New York, was closest to her in age, just 18 months younger. After his assassination in 1968, Mrs. Lawford assembled a privately printed book of reminiscences about him, as John had done before about the oldest brother, Joe, who died in World War II.         Her book, ''That Shining Hour,'' was published in 1969. In her introduction, she wrote ''This is not a sad book. Bobby was not a sad person. His basic shyness to the outside world gave way to fun, humor and wit whenever he was with the family.''         In addition to her brother Edward and her three sisters, Jean Kennedy Smith, Eunice Kennedy Shriver and Rosemary Kennedy, Mrs. Lawford is survived by her son, Christopher, of New York, and three daughters, Sydney, of Washington, Robin, of New York, and Victoria Frances, of Washington, and 10 grandchildren.         Correction:  September 19, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary in some copies yesterday about Patricia Kennedy Lawford, a sister of President John F. Kennedy, misstated the location of her death. It was at her home in Manhattan, not her home in Southampton, N.Y. The article also erroneously included a survivor; her sister Rosemary Kennedy died last year. The obituary also misstated the place of residence of Mrs. Lawford's son, Christopher. He lives in California, not New York. A full obituary appears today on page B8.       
         Patricia Kennedy Lawford, who as a sister of President John F. Kennedy had a front row seat to history and forged new links between her brother's administration and Hollywood through her marriage to the actor Peter Lawford, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 and also had a home in Southampton, N.Y.         The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Melissa Wagoner, a spokeswoman for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Mrs. Lawford's brother.         Athletic, lithe and as poised as a princess, Mrs. Lawford is widely remembered as the Roman Catholic schoolgirl who dismayed her domineering father, Joseph P. Kennedy, the former ambassador to Britain, by marrying Mr. Lawford, a debonair British actor.         The marriage, in 1954, was the stuff of newsreels: some 3,000 spectators gathered outside St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church on the Upper East Side.         The sixth of nine children born to Joseph Kennedy and Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald Kennedy, Mrs. Lawford, like her siblings, had a well-honed understanding of politics and of the power of appearances. As early as 1946, she campaigned for her brother John during his first run for Congress, organizing highly effective women's coffees in Boston and Cambridge neighborhoods. When he ran for president in 1960, she often substituted at events for his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, who was pregnant.         The Lawfords strengthened John Kennedy's ties to the show business world of Hollywood and Las Vegas through Mr. Lawford's association with the ''Rat Pack'' of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Shirley MacLaine.         Mr. Sinatra threw his support behind Kennedy, and his hit song ''High Hopes,'' with lyrics by Sammy Cahn, became the Kennedy campaign song. At the opening of the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Sinatra, Davis, Mr. Lawford and Ms. MacLaine helped lead the singing of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''         Through the years, Mrs. Lawford was a close friend of Marilyn Monroe, Tennessee Williams and Sinatra, for whom she partly named her daughter Victoria Frances.         In 1966, after 11 years of marriage, Mrs. Lawford became the first Kennedy to file for a divorce. It was a highly publicized break, one that required Mrs. Lawford to establish residency in Idaho to circumvent New York's divorce laws of the time.         Afterward, Mrs. Lawford and her four children moved to New York, where she took on a busy social schedule, befriended artists and writers and became known as a generous benefactor of the arts. She was a familiar presence at benefit dinners, and her patronage would increase the cachet of any fund-raising event. Her name appeared regularly in the society columns of New York, the Hamptons and Palm Beach, Fla.         Patricia Kennedy was born on May 6, 1924, in Brookline, Mass., the fourth daughter of Joseph and Rose Kennedy and the granddaughter of John F. Fitzgerald, the popular mayor of Boston who had earlier served in the House of Representatives.         In the 1930's, while her father was ambassador to Britain, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Roehampton, a boarding school for girls on the outskirts of London. When her family moved to Bronxville, N.Y., she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart school in the Maplehurst section of the Bronx. (It later moved to Greenwich, Conn.) She attended Rosemont College in Pennsylvania, graduating in 1945.         Hers was a family that expected women to be graceful and well rounded while remaining in the background, quietly serving the ambitions of their men. Of the five Kennedy sisters, she was considered the most beautiful and sophisticated, with the aristocratic air of her mother. She was an accomplished athlete, but she never caught the family's legendary fire for competition.         In her 1987 book, ''The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys,'' Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote that Rose Kennedy was bothered by Patricia's lack of ambition. ''Although she had a good mind, a fine physique and a beautiful face which could easily have led her to excel in school,'' Ms. Goodwin wrote, ''in sports or in appearance, Rose contended 'she would never make the effort to achieve distinction' in any of these areas.''         But Mrs. Lawford's son, Christopher Lawford, wrote in his best-selling memoir, ''Symptoms of Withdrawal,'' published last year, that his mother had been resentful of her father for ''not being allowed fully to live up to her potential.''         In college she directed and acted in theater productions, and she pursued those interests after graduation, going to work as an assistant in the New York production department of NBC. She moved to Los Angeles to work as an assistant for Kate Smith's radio show and later for ''Family Theater,'' the radio program produced by the Rev. Patrick Peyton.         Much like her older sister Kathleen, who made her mother furious by marrying outside her church, Patricia disappointed her parents by marrying Mr. Lawford, a nominal Episcopalian who agreed to rear their children as Catholics.         Mrs. Lawford was the only Kennedy to move away from the family's traditional East Coast settings of Hyannis Port, Palm Beach and New York. She and Mr. Lawford settled into a sprawling oceanfront home in California once owned by Louis B. Mayer. The house became a recreation center for other family members; the president spent time lounging at his sister's pool when he was on the West Coast.         After the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, Mrs. Lawford was often seen in the company of his widow and their two children, Caroline and John Jr. In 1986, she joined Senator Kennedy on an official visit to Chile that was marred by egg-throwing protesters angered by Mr. Kennedy's criticism of President Augusto Pinochet.         Mrs. Lawford devoted her energies to organizations that served the mentally disabled and to those helping people with substance abuse problems. She had a close personal appreciation for both causes: her older sister Rosemary, who died last year, was born mildly retarded and was lobotomized at 23; and she, Mr. Lawford and her son had waged their own battles with drugs and alcohol.         Mrs. Lawford's brother Robert, the former attorney general and later senator from New York, was closest to her in age, just 18 months younger. After his assassination in 1968, Mrs. Lawford assembled a privately printed book of reminiscences about him, as John had done for their oldest brother, Joe, who died in World War II.         The book, ''That Shining Hour,'' was published in 1969. Mrs. Lawford wrote in her introduction: ''This is not a sad book. Bobby was not a sad person. His basic shyness to the outside world gave way to fun, humor and wit whenever he was with the family.''         In addition to her brother Edward, Mrs. Lawford is survived by her son, Christopher, of California; three daughters, Sydney and Victoria Frances, both of Washington, and Robin, of New York; her sisters Jean Kennedy Smith and Eunice Kennedy Shriver; and 10 grandchildren.         In her last years, Mrs. Lawford led a relatively private life. She may have been a Kennedy, a woman with an instantly familiar name, but she did not crave attention and enjoyed walking the streets of Manhattan without being recognized.

         Beth Levine, an innovative American shoe designer whose boots, as Nancy Sinatra sang while wearing them, were made for walking, died on Wednesday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         The cause was lung cancer, said her niece, Nan Bush, the wife and producing partner of the photographer Bruce Weber.         Mrs. Levine designed shoes for 30 years under the label Herbert Levine, named for her husband, and was known as America's First Lady of Shoe Design because of her prominence in 20th-century fashion, and because her designs were worn by the American first ladies Lady Bird Johnson, Patricia Nixon and Jacqueline Kennedy.         She made shoes for Barbra Streisand in ''Funny Girl'' and the white stiletto boots worn by Nancy Sinatra to sing ''These Boots Are Made For Walkin'.'' Mrs. Levine had reignited a trend for boots in the 1960's with her stretchy stocking styles and vinyl Go-Go boots, designed for dancing, (or walking all over you). When Ms. Sinatra released her anthem of women's empowerment in 1966, she was shown in film made for early video jukeboxes wearing the style from Herbert Levine. The song increased the demand for fashion boots so much that Saks Fifth Avenue opened a corner in its shoe department called Beth's Bootery.         ''She was among the most influential shoe designers of the century,'' said Elizabeth Semmelhack, the chief curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, who included Mrs. Levine in an exhibition this year called ''Icons of Elegance.''         ''In looking at 20th-century shoe design, she was in many ways a maverick mind,'' Ms. Semmelhack said. ''She saw the possibilities in all sorts of new materials and different ways of making a shoe.''         Mrs. Levine's designs were known for their poetic whimsy: She lined a sandal with an insole of Astroturf and affixed a plastic flower to its toe straps, and she designed heels made of rolled leather or silver thread that looked like a spool.         One of Mrs. Levine's most fanciful ideas, though it did not catch on, was the ''upper-less shoe,'' which was merely the sole of a high-heeled shoe with an adhesive insole that attached to the bottom of the foot. Her most outrageous designs -- driving shoes made to look like race cars, elaborately carved wooden blocks that looked like birds in flight and evening shoes that looked like Aladdin's lamp -- were included in an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1976, when she and her husband retired.         Beth Katz Levine was born on Dec. 31, 1914, in Patchogue, N.Y., the third of five children of Anna and Israel Katz, Lithuanian immigrants who operated a dairy farm. In the 1930's, she moved to Manhattan and found work as a shoe model (her feet were size 4B), then worked her way up from a stylist to head designer for I. Miller.         After working for the Red Cross in World War II, she applied for a job in 1944 designing shoes for another shoe manufacturer. She met Herbert Levine, who was running that company, and married him three months later.         Mr. Levine died in 1991. Mrs. Levine is survived by a daughter, Anna Thomson-Wilson, of Manhattan.         Mrs. Levine once said: ''My mother always thought a fine pair of shoes was a necessity. And my father dealt with horses and cows, so I knew about leather.''         In 1948, the couple started a business under the name Herbert Levine. Mrs. Levine wrote in a letter to the Bata Shoe Museum this year: ''We wanted to create a shoemaking niche. We were making very pretty shoes that nobody needed, but everybody wanted.''         Mrs. Levine was given the Coty Award in 1967, for design innovations that overcame traditional boundaries of footwear. In the 1950's, European designers had created a demand for mules, but they were difficult for women to walk in without crunching their toes to keep them on. Mrs. Levine's solution was a strip of elastic that caused the heel of the mule to flip upward as a woman walked, maintaining the tension between the ball of the foot and the heel. She called her invention the Spring-O-Later.         ''Clothes designers have gravity on their side,'' Mrs. Levine said. ''But shoe designers work upside down. Ideas are easy to come by. Getting them realized is something else.''         Although she worked closely with fashion designers to create shoes that would match their clothes, including a regular collaboration with James Galanos, Mrs. Levine was often a vocal critic of their work. Even after her retirement, she would call the designer Helmut Lang after his show to tell him what she liked and what she did not.         Ms. Bush once recalled introducing her aunt to Gianni Versace at a restaurant. ''The first thing she said was: 'You should be ashamed of yourself. Some of those clothes you make are really degrading to women,' '' Ms. Bush said. ''But by the end of the night, they were friends.''       
         Maureen Daly, a writer whose first novel, ''Seventeenth Summer,'' anticipated the young-adult genre by decades when it appeared in 1942 and has endured as a classic coming-of-age story, died on Monday in Palm Desert, Calif. She was 85 and made her home in Palm Desert.         The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, her sister, Sheila Daly White, said.         Written when Ms. Daly was a teenager and published while she was still in college, ''Seventeenth Summer'' told the story of Angie and Jack, two teenagers who fall in love during one enchanted summer in a Wisconsin lakeside town. Written in a straightforward, unpretentious style, the book is full of innocent pastimes -- boating on the lake, Cokes at the corner drugstore -- mingled with more grown-up pleasures like beer and cigarettes.         Reviewing the novel in The New York Times Book Review, Edith H. Walton wrote:         ''By a kind of miracle, and perhaps because she is so close to an experience not easy to recapture, Miss Daly has made an utterly enchanting book out of this very fragile little story -- one which rings true and sweet and fresh and sound.''         Published originally by Dodd, Mead & Company and most recently in 2002 by Simon & Schuster, ''Seventeenth Summer'' has sold more than a million copies worldwide, according to the reference book Authors and Artists for Young Adults.         Though fiction about adolescents was nothing new in the 1940's -- among its eminent practitioners had been Mark Twain, Booth Tarkington and Louisa May Alcott -- the concept of novels specifically earmarked for adolescents would not exist until the late 1960's, ushered in by writers like Paul Zindel and S. E. Hinton.         Yet a quarter-century earlier, ''Seventeenth Summer'' anticipated many of these authors' concerns, as Teri Lesesne, a professor of library science at Sam Houston State University and a specialist in young-adult literature, explained in a telephone interview yesterday.         ''For '42, this is a pretty avant-garde young woman: she smokes, she drinks, she dates,'' Ms. Lesesne said. ''She thinks about more than a chaste kiss at the end of a date.''         Maureen Patricia Daly was born on March 15, 1921, in Castlecaulfield, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. She came to the United States with her family as a young child.         When Ms. Daly was 15, her short story ''Fifteen'' was published in Scholastic magazine. The next year she wrote another story, fittingly titled ''Sixteen,'' that was included in the O. Henry collection of 1938, which gathered together the best short stories of the previous year. Then, working in the basement of her parents' home in Fond du Lac, Wis., she began ''Seventeenth Summer.''         After earning undergraduate degrees in English and Latin from Rosary College in River Forest., Ill., Ms. Daly worked as a reporter and book critic for The Chicago Tribune. She was later on the staff of Ladies' Home Journal and The Saturday Evening Post.         Among her many other books are the young-adult novels ''Acts of Love'' (1986) and ''First a Dream'' (1990), both published by Scholastic, and ''Mention My Name in Mombasa: The Unscheduled Adventures of an American Family Abroad'' (Dodd, Mead, 1958), a travel memoir written with her husband, William P. McGivern, a well-known crime novelist.         Ms. Daly's husband died in 1982; her daughter, Megan McGivern Shaw, died the next year. Besides her sister, Ms. White, of Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Patrick McGivern, of Palm Desert, and two grandchildren.         In an interview quoted in the reference book Major Authors and Illustrators for Children and Young Adults, Ms. Daly recalled the special urgency -- akin to grasping quicksilver -- that gave rise to ''Seventeenth Summer.''         ''I was so wildly and vividly happy about love and life at a particular time in my existence,'' she said. ''I wanted to get all that fleeting excitement down on paper before it passed, or I forgot the true feelings.''         She added, ''It was not until the reviews came out (and the royalties came in) that I realized I had recorded universal emotions and joys -- and people would want to read about them year after year.''       
         Dorothy Harmsen, who was a co-founder of the Jolly Rancher Candy Company, the maker of tangy, slowly dissolving bricks of fruit-flavored candy, and the owner of one of the nation's largest private collections of art of the American West, died in Denver on Aug. 29. She was 91.         The cause was a heart attack, said her son, William D. Harmsen Jr.         Over a career in confections that spanned 50 years, Mrs. Harmsen and her late husband, William, created scores of original candies on their farm in Colorado, including chocolates, fruit chews, jelly beans and lollipops.         But it was the Jolly Rancher, an unembellished rectangular hard candy, that became the couple's biggest contribution to the candy aisle. A top seller for every company that owned it -- in the end, there were four -- it earned a place alongside Life Savers as a household name in the often-overlooked hard candy business.         Mrs. Harmsen never intended to be a candy maker. In 1942, she and her husband, an airline pilot, moved onto a 10-acre ranch outside Denver, where they hoped to grow fruits and vegetables. But after several seasons of lackluster farming, they decided to start an ice cream shop.         Named the Jolly Rancher, to evoke Western hospitality, the store opened to strong sales in the summer months but struggled in the winter. So the Harmsens decided to add chocolate candy, which they produced in a barn on their farm. Soon candy sales far outstripped those of ice cream and the couple expanded their product line and work force.         Mrs. Harmsen managed the Jolly Rancher's finances and operations in Colorado while her husband traveled the country marketing candy and becoming the public face of the brand.         He held the title of president and she was secretary-treasurer. But ''she was the heart and soul of the operation,'' said Pamela Whitenack, who oversees the archives at the Hershey Company, which bought Jolly Rancher in 1996.         Jolly Rancher became a family affair, drawing in the Harmsens' three children, who dipped candy, handled paperwork and, seated at their kitchen table, became influential judges of new flavors and products.         Mrs. Harmsen is survived by three sons, William D. Harmsen Jr. of Banamichi, Mexico; Robert J. Harmsen of Arvada, Colo.; and Michael W. Harmsen of Lakewood, Colo.; and seven grandchildren.         The company's first breakout confection, in 1950, was a spicy, cinnamon-flavored taffy called Fire Stix. Its strong sales encouraged the company to emphasize hard candies over chocolates, which faced stiff competition from established candy makers.         Fire Stix became a template for Jolly Rancher's blockbuster product: rock hard when popped into the mouth, it melted slowly, releasing ever-more-intense flavor with each swirl of the tongue. It comes in several strong, distinctive flavors, including apple and watermelon.         Mrs. Harmsen, a proud Westerner who wore Indian jewelry and skirts, became a collector of regional art, including the work of Georgia O'Keeffe, Frederic Remington and Joseph Henry Sharp. She never finished college, but she wrote two widely used books about Western and Native American art.         In 2001, the Harmsens donated about 3,000 items, including 800 paintings, to the Denver Art Museum, more than doubling its Western art collection.       
         Dr. Gail Greenberg Shapiro, a pediatric allergist who contributed to important studies of drug treatments for asthma and allergies and helped develop widely used standards for managing childhood asthma, died on Aug. 25 in Seattle. She was 59.         Dr. Shapiro died during cardiac surgery. Her death was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, of which Dr. Shapiro was a past president.         Beginning in the 1970's, she combined research with a clinical practice in Seattle and participated in trials of antihistamines and other drugs intended to treat asthma, rhinitis, hives and eczema. She also investigated factors like exercise and indoor dust mites in producing reactions that can lead to asthma in children.         Dr. Gary S. Rachelefsky, an allergist in private practice in Los Angeles and, with Patricia Garrison, co-author of a book, ''Free Your Child From Asthma,'' said Dr. Shapiro had been instrumental in preparing fresh guidelines to test for asthma, which is sometimes confused with a chronic cough or bronchitis.         In the 1990's, Dr. Rachelefsky and Dr. Shapiro worked together to distribute the ''Pediatric Asthma Guide'' to physicians, nurses and school administrators, to help in diagnosing the disease before an acute attack might occur. The booklet remains in use.         Gail Ina Greenberg was born in Brooklyn. She received her undergraduate degree from Brown and a medical degree from Johns Hopkins, in 1970.         After training at the University of Washington, she went into private practice at the Northwest Asthma and Allergy Center in Seattle, where she became a senior partner and remained for her career. Dr. Shapiro was also a clinical professor of pediatrics at Washington.         She helped edit a medical textbook, ''Allergy, Asthma and Immunology from Infancy to Adulthood'' (1996).         Dr. Shapiro is survived by her husband of 39 years, Dr. Peter A. Shapiro, an orthodontist; a son, Evan, and a daughter, Jessica Mirsky; and a grandchild.       
         Julia Levien, a leading authority on the dances of Isadora Duncan and a teacher of her technique, died on Sunday at her home on Roosevelt Island. She was 94.         Her death was announced by Catherine Gallant, a dancer and choreographer who studied with her for many years.         Ms. Levien (pronounced Le-VINE) was taught by Anna Duncan, one of Isadora Duncan's six adopted daughters, making Ms. Levien a third-generation Duncan dancer. When Ms. Levien herself began offering lessons in Duncan's work to younger students, she not only had them learn Duncan's way of moving and her choreography but also wove together classroom exercises with a running commentary on the arts and social issues of Duncan's time and the major influences that helped to shape Duncan's philosophy of movement.         A small, no-nonsense woman, Ms. Levien spoke her mind as a teacher in upbeat ways and had boundless curiosity -- and opinions. She taught and lectured internationally and wrote many articles about Duncan, continuing to work until last year.         Her students included Annabelle Gamson, a solo dancer and choreographer known for her exhilarating performances of Duncan dances, and most Duncan dancers performing today in New York studied at one point with Ms. Levien.         She was also an energetic mediator in the often disorganized world of Duncan teachers and students, bringing factions together in the Duncan Dance Guild, which she organized in the 1950's. She created the Duncan Centenary Company in 1977 to celebrate Duncan's centenary, playing an important role in the rebirth of interest in Duncan's work.         Though she was not the only knowledgeable restager of the dances, Ms. Levien's reconstructions helped to prove that Duncan choreographed rather than improvised dances, and that they had structure, set steps, gestures and patterns, all informed by a philosophy of naturally flowing and gravity-bound movement. Ms. Levien's teaching made clear that Duncan's simple-looking moves demanded extreme focus and concentration to achieve not only the correct execution but also important and distinctive tones or emotional qualities.         ''We weren't allowed to change from left to right a pinky!'' said Ms. Levien in a 1978 interview in The New York Times, in which she recalled her training in and performance of Duncan dances.         Ms. Levien dined out on stories about Duncan she heard from childhood, including an account of Duncan's visit to a reception for writers at her family's home in the Bronx, which the dance star described as ''the charming little hideaway I've dreamed of.''         After training with Anna Duncan, Ms. Levien performed throughout the world in the 1930's and 40's with her company and that of Irma Duncan, another of Isadora Duncan's daughters. Ms. Levien also began to create her own choreography in the 1930's in dances that, like most modern dance of the time, reflected social concerns.         Ms. Levien danced the Duncan pieces ''in a totally different manner which is nonimitative, nontraditional and her own,'' John Martin wrote in a 1943 review in The Times. ''She moves with great beauty and an apparently innate sense of dynamics,'' he continued, describing her performance of her own choreography: ''Few dancers can manage to make sustained, lyrical movement so engrossing simply as movement.''         Ms. Levien married and settled in Queens, where she raised a family and taught Duncan dance to children. She wrote and illustrated ''Duncan Dance, A Guide for Young People,'' published by the Princeton Book Company in 1994.         She is survived by her son, Eliot Golden of Roslyn, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         As a child, Ms. Levien met Duncan.         ''I recall a diaphanous white figure moving magically in a vast blue space,'' she said in a speech at the 92nd Street Y in 1996. ''After the performance, when all of us children in the audience rushed to the apron of the stage, Isadora stood gesturing above us, asking the audience for donations for her Russian school. The money rained down. It was at that moment that I noticed her hennaed hair and streaked makeup. Still, to us she seemed like some extraordinary goddess.''       
         Ann W. Richards, the silver-haired Texas activist who galvanized the 1988 Democratic National Convention with her tart keynote speech and was the state's 45th governor until upset in 1994 by an underestimated challenger named George W. Bush, died Wednesday at her home in Austin. She was 73.         Ms. Richard died, surrounded by her four children, of complications from the esophageal cancer, the Associated Press reported.         Ms. Richards was the most recent and one of the most effective in a long-line of Lone Star State progressives who vied for control of Texas in the days when it was largely a one-party Democratic enclave, a champion of civil rights, gay rights and feminism. Her defeat by the future president was one of the chief markers of the end of generations of Democratic dominance in Texas.         So cemented was her celebrity on the national stage, however, that she appeared in national advertising campaigns, including one for snack chips, and was a lawyer and lobbyist for Public strategies and Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand.         ''Poor George, he can't help it,'' Ms. Richards said at the Democratic convention in 1988, speaking about the current president's father, former President George Bush. ''He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.''         Her acidic, plain-spoken keynote address was one of the year's political highlights and catapulted the one-term Texas governor into a national figure.         ''We're gonna tell how the cow ate the cabbage,'' she said, bringing the great tradition of vernacular Southern oratory to the national political stage in a way that transformed the mother of four into an revered icon of feminist activism.         Dorothy Ann Willis was born Sept. 1, 1933, in Lakeview, and graduated in 1950 from Waco High school where she showed a special facility for debate. She attended the Girl's Mock State government in Austin in her junior year and was one of two delegates chosen to attend Girl's Nation in Washington.         She attended Baylor University in Waco -- on a debate scholarship -- where she met her future husband, David Richards. After college, the couple moved to Austin where she earned a teaching certificate at the University of Texas in 1955 and taught social studies for several years at Fulmore Middle School.         She raised her four children in Austin.         She volunteered in several gubernatorial campaigns, in 1958 for Henry Gonzalez and in 1952, 1954 and 1956 for Ralph Yarborough and then again for Yarborough's senatorial campaign in 1957.         In 1976, Ms. Richards defeated a three-term incumbent to become a commissioner in Travis County, which includes Austin, and held that job for four years, though she later said her political commitment put a strain on her marriage, which ended in divorce.         She also began to drink heavily, eventually going into rehabilitation, a move that she later credited with salvaging her life and her political career.         ''I have seen the very bottom of life,'' she said. ''I was so afraid I wouldn't be funny anymore. I just knew that I would lose my zaniness and my sense of humor. But I didn't. Recovery turned out to be a wonderful thing.''         In 1982, she ran for state treasurer, received the most votes of any statewide candidate, became the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas in 50 years and was re-elected in 1986.         In 1990, when the incumbent governor, William P. Clements Jr., decided not to run for re-election, she ran against a former Democratic governor, Mark White, and won the primary, then later fought a particularly brutal campaign against Republican candidate Clayton Williams, a wealthy rancher, and won.         Among her achievements were institutional changes in the state penal system, invigorating the state's economy and instituting the first Texas lottery, going so far as to buy the first lotto ticket herself on May 29, 1992.         It was her speech to the Democratic convention in Atlanta, though, that made her a national figure.         A champion of women's rights, she told the television audience: ''Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels.''         In 1992, she was chairwoman of the convention that first nominated Bill Clinton.         Two years later, she underestimated her young Republican challenger from West Texas, going so far as to refer to George W. Bush as ''some jerk,'' a commend that drew considerable criticism. Later, she acknowledged that the younger candidate has been much more effective at ''staying on message'' and made none of the mistakes that her campaign strategists had expected. She was beaten, 53 percent to 46 percent.         Her celebrity, however, carried her onto the boards of several national corporations, including J.C. Penney, Brandeis University and the Aspen Institute.         She also co-wrote several books, including ''Straight from the Heart: My Life in Politics and Other Places'' in 1989 with Peter Knobler and ''I'm Not Slowing Down'' in 2004, with Richard M. Levine.         On her 60th birthday, she got her first motorcycle license.         ''I've always said that in politics, your enemies can't hurt you, but your friends can kill you,'' Ms. Richard once said.         Survivors, according to The AP, include her children, Cecile, Daniel, Clark and Ellen Richards, and eight grandchildren.         Correction:  September 15, 2006, Friday  An obituary in some copies yesterday about former Gov. Ann Richards of Texas referred incorrectly to her later positions with the public relations company Public Strategies and the international law firm Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand (now DLA Piper). She was an adviser to both, not a lobbyist and lawyer. She did not have a law degree. The obituary also misstated the middle initial of the co-author of her book ''I'm Not Slowing Down: Winning My Battle with Osteoporosis.'' He is Richard U. Levine, not Richard M.

         Jane Wyatt, who reigned as America's ideal suburban mom during the 1950's when she starred with Robert Young in the television sitcom ''Father Knows Best'' and who nearly lured Ronald Colman away from diplomacy and into a lamasery in Frank Capra's 1937 film ''Lost Horizon,'' died on Friday at her home in Bel Air, Calif. She was 95.         Her death was confirmed by her publicist Meg McDonald, The Associated Press reported.         A petite, attractive brunette, Ms. Wyatt found it hard to avoid being typecast and wound up playing quite a few of what she described as ''good wives of good men,'' though she confessed she would have been happier ''playing the murderer or the heavy.'' She did get to play a few offbeat roles on stage and screen. In Philip Barry's wryly titled play ''The Joyous Season'' (1934), she was a moody member of a family seething with petty feuds. As the wife of an attorney (Dana Andrews) in the 1947 film ''Boomerang,'' she became embroiled in the corruption surrounding a notorious murder. And in Lillian Hellman's ''Autumn Garden,'' on Broadway in 1951, she was married to an indolent drifter (Fredric March) for whom she felt nothing but contempt.         For the most part, however, as she shuttled between Hollywood and Broadway, she was called upon to be loyal, loving and courageous. In ''None but the Lonely Heart,'' a 1944 film starring Cary Grant and Ethel Barrymore, she was an adoring musician who pined for an indifferent Grant. She was cast as a courageous nurse in ''Canadian Pacific'' (1949); as the faithful, supportive wife of a naval airman (Gary Cooper) in ''Task Force'' (1949); and as a happily married (to David Wayne) mother of five in ''My Blue Heaven'' (1950).         Her Broadway credits included ''Night Music'' (1940), by Clifford Odets, a Group Theater production directed by Harold Clurman, in which she played a young woman who finds the love of her life in New York; and ''Hope for the Best'' (1945), by William McCleery, with Ms. Wyatt as a factory worker who helps a popular columnist (Franchot Tone) see the light of liberalism.         Jane Waddington Wyatt was born on Aug. 12, 1911, in Campgaw, N.J., into a family of distinguished lineage and grew up in New York City. Her father was an investment banker, her mother a writer for Commonweal and other publications. She attended the Chapin School and studied at Barnard College for two years before joining the apprentice school at the Berkshire Playhouse in Stockbridge, Mass. Back in New York she found work as an understudy in a Broadway show, and her name was removed from the New York Social Register. Clearly, the wicked stage was no place for proper young ladies.         Not daunted, she continued to audition and soon made her Broadway debut in 1931 in A. A. Milne's ''Give Me Yesterday,'' as the daughter of an ambitious British politician (Louis Calhern). She achieved a breakthrough of sorts in 1933 when she succeeded Margaret Sullavan in ''Dinner at Eight,'' the hit comedy by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, and then toured in the show, leading to a contract offer from Universal and her Hollywood debut in ''One More River'' (1934), based on John Galsworthy's last novel.         Ms. Wyatt said at one point that her favorite film role had been in ''Task Force,'' opposite Gary Cooper, but she is probably best remembered for her work in ''Lost Horizon,'' based on the novel by James Hilton and directed by Frank Capra. Most of the film's action takes place in Tibet in a fabled region called Shangri-La, ruled by an ancient High Lama. A plane crash brings a small group of Westerners led by a British diplomat Bob Conway (Ronald Colman) to the lamasery. There, Colman meets and is entranced by Sondra (Ms. Wyatt), an attractive young woman who has grown up in Shangri-La. The High Lama is looking for a successor, Sondra is looking for love, and the Colman character must choose whether to stay or return to the war-torn world beyond the mountains. Critics agreed that Ms. Wyatt was luminous in the role.         Ms. Wyatt had already made a number of appearances in television dramas before she joined the cast of ''Father Knows Best'' in 1954. The show followed the lives of the Anderson family in the Midwestern town of Springfield, with Robert Young as Jim Anderson, Ms. Wyatt as his wife, Margaret, and their three children, two of them teenagers. Family crises arose -- a son's first dance, a daughter's first crush -- and were firmly but lovingly resolved. When CBS dropped the show in 1955 there were so many protests from viewers that NBC was persuaded to pick it up. ''Father Knows Best'' returned to CBS for the 1959-1960 season, its final run of new episodes. The show brought Ms. Wyatt three Emmy Awards. In 1977 she returned to the role, this time as a grandmother, in two made-for-television movies, ''The Father Knows Best Reunion'' and ''Father Knows Best: Home for Christmas.''         Ms. Wyatt married Edgar Bethune Ward in 1935. He died in 2000. She is survived by their two sons, Christopher Ward of Piedmont, Calif., and Michael Ward of Los Angeles; three grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         One of her more offbeat television parts was that of Amanda, the human mother of Mr. Spock, the pointy-eared Vulcan member of the ''Star Trek'' crew of space voyagers in the late 1960's. She reprised the role in the 1986 film, ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.''         Correction:  October 24, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary and headline yesterday about the actress Jane Wyatt misstated her age. She was 96, not 95. (The error was repeated in a front-page contents entry and in the News Summary.)       
         Former Representative Helen P. Chenoweth-Hage of Idaho, an archconservative who ridiculed the Endangered Species Act and the protection of salmon in her own state and called for disbanding large parts of the federal government, died on Monday in a car accident in Nevada. She was 68.         Rocky Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Nevada Highway Patrol, said Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage, a passenger in a sport utility vehicle, died when it overturned on a remote northern Nevada highway about an hour's drive from her ranch in Monitor Valley, Nev., where she had moved five years ago.         She was traveling with her daughter-in-law, Yelena Hage, and Ms. Hage's 5-month-old son, Bryan Hage, who survived with minor injuries.         Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage was elected in 1994 as part of the Republican takeover of the House and served three terms, from 1995 to 2001, representing Idaho's First Congressional District.         She said she did not condone violence against the federal government, which militias and racial separatists in her largely rural district called for, but she had a reputation as a sagebrush rebel who sometimes sympathized with their causes.         She said she thought that the federal government asserted too much claim to Western land and resources and intruded on personal liberties. In a 1996 interview with The New York Times, she declared support for the South's position in the Civil War, as a ''state's rights issue.'' But she said she opposed slavery and would distance herself from racist groups and militias that regularly hailed her.         Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage received national attention for mocking the Endangered Species Act, saying it applied to white males, and, during her first campaign, in 1994, holding what she called endangered-salmon bakes. She served canned salmon and complained about the presence of Idaho salmon on the endangered species list.         Her suspicion of the federal government led her to advocate the elimination of the Education, Energy, Commerce and Housing Departments, and she accused Fish and Wildlife agents of harassing ranchers with helicopters. She later conceded she had little evidence of that.         As much as liberals and environmentalists loathed her -- ''Can Helen, Not Salmon'' went one bumper sticker -- supporters admired what they considered a principled, call-it-as-I-see-it manner.         She was born Helen Palmer in Topeka, Kan., on Jan. 27, 1938, grew up in Grants Pass, Ore., and attended Whitworth College in Spokane, Wash., before moving to the northern Idaho town of Orofino.         While at Whitworth, she met and married Nick Chenoweth, and they had two children, Mike and Meg Chenoweth-Keenan, of Boise, Idaho, who survive her, along with several grandchildren.         The couple divorced in 1975, and Mrs. Chenoweth moved to Boise, becoming active in politics and serving for a time as executive director of the Idaho Republican Party and then as chief of staff to Representative Steven D. Symms.         She scored an upset in the 1994 Republican primary over David H. Leroy, a former state attorney general, and went on to defeat the Democratic incumbent.         In 1999, she married Wayne Hage Sr., a Nevada rancher prominent in the movement to expand private property rights. He died in June.         Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage left office fulfilling a promise, in the spirit of the Contract With America's call for term limits, not to serve more than three terms.       
         Rosamond Carr, a Manhattan fashion illustrator whose love affair with Africa long survived her divorce from the dashing big-game hunter she followed there and culminated when she, as an octogenarian, opened an orphanage in war-ravaged Rwanda, died on Sept. 29. She was 94.         She died of pneumonia at her home near Gisenyi in the mountains of northwest Rwanda, said Ann Howard Halsey, her niece.         Mrs. Carr owned a flower plantation in a volcanic paradise, was stalked by leopards, pestered by elephants and cuddled by monkeys and became a close friend of Dian Fossey, the mountain gorilla researcher, who was mysteriously killed in 1985.         Mrs. Carr became a successful businesswoman at a time when they were rare in Africa. She endured political turmoil most Westerners fled. But her world was upended when Rwanda's Hutu massacred another of the country's ethnic groups, the Tutsi, and killings were committed on her property, eight of them in her flower garden.         When the spear-wielding mob demanded to know the whereabouts of yet another potential victim, Mrs. Carr exploded.         ''You don't mind killing old women,'' she said, as recorded in her 1999 autobiography, ''Land of a Thousand Hills: My Life in Rwanda.'' ''If you want to kill someone, here I am. Kill me!''         Mrs. Carr was forced to flee on five minutes' notice. Once in the United States, as televised images made the magnitude of the tragedy apparent -- perhaps 800,000 dead, two million exiled, two million more in refuge camps in Rwanda -- she made a decision.         It involved a capacious building she had used to dry flowers. It somehow seemed like the perfect place for an orphanage. With arduous work, it became one.         ''One of the few regrets in my life is that I never had children of my own,'' she wrote, three years after the arrival of the first orphan, a boy named Gahungu, whose mother had dropped dead in front of him. ''Today at the age of 85, I am blessed with 72,'' she said.         Mrs. Carr's life does not merely sound cinematic. The actress Julie Harris played her in ''Gorillas in the Mist,'' the movie about Ms. Fossey. A British company is making a documentary about Mrs. Carr, and producers have bought rights to her book, which Ms. Halsey helped write.         Rosamond Halsey was born in 1912 in South Orange, N.J. Her father was a bond trader ruined by the Depression, and college was not an option. She became an illustrator for department stores.         She happened to see some films about Africa presented by Kenneth Carr, who had lived there for 28 years, hunting big game and working as a tattoo artist, coffee planter and miner. An Englishman, he was a charming conversationalist and gave her a lion's claw covered with gold. They married, struggled financially and soon had trouble getting along. They decided that moving to Africa might help.         ''Most people would go to a marriage counselor, but they went to Africa,'' Ms. Halsey said.         Mrs. Carr, then 37, bought four cotton dresses, a pith helmet ''and a lifetime supply of cold cream'' and the two sailed away on a tramp steamer. They chugged 1,280 miles up the Congo River in a wood-burning paddle-wheel steamer, then drove a second-hand Ford pickup to the Congo-Rwanda border, where they eventually managed a farm.         It was beautiful and exotic: there was a 50-foot waterfall on their property, wildlife prowled, and Mrs. Carr became fascinated by local culture. She dispensed medicine to the people.         The marriage foundered, and in the mid-1950's, Mrs. Carr bought a 270-acre flower plantation in the foothills of the Virunga volcanoes. She lived in an ivy-covered stone cottage and planted a formal English garden. She grew fields of lilies and other flowers to sell.         After Belgium granted independence to the Congo in 1960, most Europeans (with whom Americans were lumped) left. After Rwanda became independent 1962, the dominant Hutu took control, and persecuted the minority Tutsi, who had historically ruled. Year by year, tensions mounted.         Mrs. Carr stayed. She befriended Ms. Fossey, who had moved to Rwanda because of violence in Congo. Theirs was a close but stormy relationship, beginning with an argument about where Rwandan gorillas were and were not. Mrs. Carr was right.         Rwanda's genocide started in 1994 after President Juv√©nal Habyarimana was assassinated. The Hutu government and Hutu gangs mercilessly attacked Tutsi. Waves of retaliations by Tutsi and counterretaliations by Hutu followed.         Violence prevented Mrs. Carr and her 120 orphans from returning to their original home until November 2006. The orphanage, now on a larger, more modern campus, is run by her longtime associates.         Mrs. Carr is survived by her brother, William G. Halsey, of Basking Ridge, N.J., and her sister, Dorothy K. Halsey, of Chatham, Mass.         In her book, Mrs. Carr rhapsodized about relaxing at day's end in front of a crackling fire in a cozy cottage that never had electricity or modern plumbing.         ''My day is done,'' she wrote, ''and I wonder with a flutter of anticipation what new adventures and surprises tomorrow will bring.''         Correction:  October 10, 2006, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Sunday about Rosamond Carr, a former fashion illustrator who opened an orphanage in Rwanda and was driven from it by violence, misstated the date of the orphans' return to the facility. It was November 2005, not November 2006.       
         Eve Adamson, who founded the Jean Cocteau Repertory and built it into a respected classical theater company, died on Sunday in her Manhattan apartment. She was 68.         The cause has not been determined, said her brother and only survivor, Lloyd Crisfield.         In 1971, disappointed with the projects she was finding as an actress, Ms. Adamson gathered a group of actors and started an ensemble in a converted storefront in the East Village.         An enthusiast of the absurdist tradition, Ms. Adamson named it the Jean Cocteau, after the French avant-garde polymath. The company began its first season of rotating repertory in 1973, performing four plays, including Eugene Ionesco's ''Lesson,'' and Samuel Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot.'' Mel Gussow, writing that year in The New York Times, described the Cocteau as ''an enterprising company whose limited financial and technical resources are offset by artistic resourcefulness.''         After receiving a grant from New York State, the company moved into the 140-seat Bouwerie Lane Theater in 1974 and became a staple of the burgeoning Off Off Broadway theater scene. Ms. Adamson was artistic director for 18 years, and her company presented a demanding repertory: works by Pinter and Pirandello alongside Restoration comedies, Chekhov dramas and Shakespeare standards.         Under her direction, the Cocteau presented Tennessee Williams's ''Something Cloudy, Something Clear'' in 1981; it was the last play by Williams to have its premiere in New York during his lifetime.         After stepping down as artistic director in 1989, Ms. Adamson traveled widely, directing plays nationally and in Europe. She continued to stage plays at the Cocteau from time to time, and when a group of Cocteau veterans broke off in 2004 and formed their own company, the Phoenix Theater Ensemble, Ms. Adamson directed their first production. She died a week before starting rehearsals for a Phoenix production of Jean Anouilh's ''Antigone.''         Ms. Adamson was born on Oct. 30, 1937, in Beverly Hills, Calif. Her father was Harold Adamson, a lyricist who helped write songs for movies like ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' and ''An Affair to Remember.'' In her 20's, she acted and directed in children's theater in Los Angeles; she moved to New York in the 1960's because she wanted to work on original plays. But the quality of the plays she was presented with sent her back to the classics.         ''Choosing what plays to do was always very personal for me,'' she said in a 1990 interview in The Times. ''I looked for things that would challenge me, the cast and the audience alike -- plays that were timeless. I hate the museum approach. I hate to do anything that couldn't have been written today.''       
         Dani√®le Huillet, the French-born filmmaker who, in collaboration with her husband, Jean-Marie Straub, created some of the most challenging and intensely debated motion pictures of the modernist era, died on Monday at the home of friends in the Loire Valley in France. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, Agence France-Presse reported. Ms. Huillet, who lived in Rome with her husband, was visiting France for treatment of her illness.         Their latest film, ''Ces Rencontres Avec Eux'' (''These Encounters With Them''), is scheduled to open in France on Wednesday. In the film, nonprofessional actors recite from the Italian writer Cesare Pavese's ''Dialogues With Leuco'' while standing in a forest. It was presented in competition in September at the Venice Film Festival, where the couple received a special award for ''the innovative aspect of the cinematographic language'' of their body of work.         Among the best-known films of Straub-Huillet, as the couple was known in critical shorthand, are ''The Chronicle of Anna-Magdalena Bach'' (1967), an approach to the life and work of Johann Sebastian Bach as seen through the journals of his wife; and ''Class Relations,'' a 1984 film based on Franz Kafka's unfinished novel, ''America.''         As filmmakers, Mr. Straub and Ms. Huillet belonged to the generation that produced the French New Wave, although their work took a radically different direction. Their aesthetic, grounded in the philosophical materialism of Marx and Engels, was one of extreme realism that resisted superfluous embellishments and editing effects. Their work has been extensively analyzed and argued about in many books and film journals.         Shooting most often in black-and-white, in extreme long takes either from a fixed camera position or in carefully choreographed tracking shots, the filmmakers tried to be faithful to the landscapes or interiors in which their films were set, presenting them whole, with little editing or distortions of spatial relationships.         The texts they chose were taken from both classical sources (Pierre Corneille for ''Othon,'' 1969) and modern ones (Arnold Schoenberg's opera ''Aaron and Moses,'' filmed in 1975). Read by a narrator, either onscreen or off, the texts were placed in counterpoint to concrete images, creating a sense of language as a solid, sensual phenomenon itself.         Dani√®le Huillet (pronounced hwee-YAY) was born in Paris on May 1, 1936, and attended the Lyc√©e Jules Ferry. She gained a reputation for intellectual independence early. According to one often-cited anecdote, when applying to Idhec, as France's national film school was known in the 1950's, she refused to submit the required entrance essay on the grounds that the film she was asked to analyze, Yves All√©gret's ''Man√®ges,'' was unworthy of serious consideration.         In 1954, she met and soon married Mr. Straub, a kindred spirit from Lorraine. She later joined him in exile in Germany when Mr. Straub left France rather than serve in the Algerian war. It was there that the couple made their first short film, ''Machorka-Muff'' (1963), and their first feature, ''Not Reconciled'' (1965), both based on texts by the novelist Heinrich B√∂ll about the survival of Nazism in postwar German life.         Their next film, ''The Chronicle of Anna-Magdalena Bach,'' was their first international success. It remains the only Straub-Huillet film available on DVD in the United States. Shot largely in the actual locations where Bach lived and worked, and featuring the musician Gustav Leonhardt playing period instruments, the film created a moving contrast between the material conditions of Bach's life and the transcendent quality of his music.         In the 1970's, the pair moved to Rome, where they established a famously disordered household filled with the stray cats and dogs that they could not resist taking in. They had no children. Italy quickly became part of their cultural storehouse, and they made their first film based on Pavese's writing, ''From the Clouds to the Resistance,'' in 1979.         Famously combative, solidly built and never without a Brechtian cigar, Mr. Straub enjoyed playing bad cop at festival press conferences to Ms. Huillet's softer, more conciliatory personality.         Never willing to abide by the rules of commercial filmmaking, the couple financed their work through an elaborate network of film and television producers, often underwritten by state film funds. Even as they became institutions on the festival and museum circuit, they projected the brash, provocative aspect of eternal Young Turks, always willing to upset any and all apple carts in the immediate vicinity.         In a tribute published yesterday in the French newspaper Lib√©ration, the critic Olivier Seguret expressed the fears of many admirers of Straub-Huillet: ''Dead, Dani√®le Huillet kills us twice, because her passing probably means that Straub will never film again.''       
         Wang Guangmei, the widow of President Liu Shaoqi and a powerful figure in China before she was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, died Friday in Beijing. She was 85.         Her death was confirmed by a family member.         Ms. Wang was once widely known in China as its beautiful, articulate, sophisticated first lady.         Liu Shaoqi was president from 1959 to 1967, when he became one of the first high-level officials to be denounced as a ''capitalist roader'' and purged by Mao during the Cultural Revolution.         Mr. Liu died in prison in 1969, after being beaten and tortured. Ms. Wang was also arrested and accused of being an American spy.         In some of the uglier scenes of the decade-long Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966, she was publicly humiliated at mass rallies by a group of Red Guards who forced her to wear a necklace of Ping-Pong balls.         After Mao's death in 1976, Mr. Liu was rehabilitated by the Communist Party, and the notorious Gang of Four, who were accused of conspiring on Mao's behalf, were imprisoned and put on trial.         Ms. Wang spent about 12 years in prison, and her four children were also harshly treated. She was released in 1979, just before Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, a leader of the Gang of Four, was put on trial and accused of leading the effort to destroy President Liu and his wife.         Wang Guangmei was born in 1921 and grew up in a distinguished and prominent Chinese family. Her father was a government minister and a diplomat; her mother was an educator.         Ms. Wang studied French, Russian and English, and earned a degree in physics from Furen Catholic University in Beijing. She also studied at an American missionary university.         In the mid-1940's, however, she traveled to the Communist Party headquarters in Yanan and served as an interpreter during efforts by the American statesman George C. Marshall to negotiate a truce between the Nationalist government and the Communist rebels.         There, at the age of 24, she met Liu Shaoqi, who was nearly twice her age and had married five times before.         For years she served as his secretary, and he was named a key deputy to Mao after the Communists took power in 1949. In 1959 Mr. Liu was named president, making him the second most powerful man in the country.         In the early 1960's, the couple traveled abroad on state visits to Afghanistan, Burma, Pakistan and Indonesia.         But in 1966, Ms. Wang was part of a group that purged the party leadership of Tsinghua University, and the effort backfired when she came under attack by a militant opponent who accused her of being a counterrevolutionary. This came at a time when her husband was also under fire by Mao and his deputies as being the leading ''capitalist roader.''         Jiang Qing, Mao's fifth wife, was said to be jealous and angry with Ms. Wang and to have complained about the way she dressed, noting that she even wore a pearl necklace on a trip abroad.         The disgraced Mr. Liu died in prison. Ms. Wang was put under house arrest, then imprisoned. Her four children were also punished.         After she was released from prison in 1979, however, she was appointed a member of the National People's Congress standing committee, and she devoted herself to social causes. She even donated some of her family's valuable antiques, a few dating back to the Qing and Song dynasties, to charity.         She is survived by four children, some of whom have risen to prominent positions.         Her eldest son, Lt. Gen. Liu Yuan, was appointed a political commissar of the Academy of Military Sciences, a rank equivalent to a cabinet minister, according to Reuters.         Her daughter, Ting Liu, graduated from Boston University and Harvard Business School and is chairman and president of the Asia Link Group, consultants in corporate finance.       
         Sally Lilienthal, who established one of the largest American foundations dedicated to preventing the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, died at a hospital in San Francisco on Oct. 24. She was 87.         Her death came after an extended illness, said Deborah Bain, an administrator of the Ploughshares Fund, the organization Ms. Lilienthal founded.         Ms. Lilienthal set up the fund in 1981, a year when NATO announced plans to place medium-range missiles in Europe, and an international nuclear-freeze movement was born. She envisioned the foundation as a way to get money quickly to people with practical ideas for stopping the buildup of nuclear weapons.         Since its founding, the Ploughshares Fund has given more than $40 million to research scientists, academics and civic groups for projects to improve the monitoring of underground nuclear tests, prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, reorient Russian nuclear weapons facilities and increase international cooperation. It has also been active in the campaign to abolish land mines.         ''The Ploughshares Fund moves faster than almost anyone else,'' said George Perkovich, a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''More traditional foundations usually need a very clear sense of a prospect's institutional history. Ploughshares sees a promising person and puts its money down.''         Ms. Lilienthal was involved in other political and philanthropic causes. In the 1960s and '70s, she was on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, and, in 1971, she became a founder of the Northern California Committee of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc.         She was also appointed to the San Francisco Arts Commission in the early 1960s.         Born Sally Ann Lowengart in 1919 in Portland, Ore., she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1940.         She is survived by five children from her marriage to Arthur J. Cohen, who died in 1953, and two stepchildren from her marriage to Philip Lilienthal, who died in 1984: Laurie Cohen, Liza Pike and Thomas Cohen of Mill Valley, Calif., Matthew Royce of San Francisco, Steven Cohen of Berkeley, Calif., Sukey Lilienthal of Oakland, and Andrea Lilienthal of Brooklyn. She is also survived by 11 grandchildren.       
         Ruth Brown, the gutsy rhythm and blues singer whose career extended to acting and crusading for musicians' rights, died yesterday in Las Vegas. She was 78 and lived in Las Vegas.         The cause was complications following a heart attack and a stroke she suffered after surgery, and Ms. Brown had been on life support since Oct. 29, said her friend, lawyer and executor, Howell Begle.         ''She was one of the original divas,'' said the singer Bonnie Raitt, who worked with Ms. Brown and Mr. Begle to improve royalties for rhythm and blues performers. ''I can't really say that I've heard anyone that sounds like Ruth, before or after. She was a combination of sass and innocence, and she was extremely funky. She could really put it right on the beat, and the tone of her voice was just mighty. And she had a great heart.''         ''What I loved about her,'' Ms. Raitt added, ''was her combination of vulnerability and resilience and fighting spirit. It was not arrogance, but she was just really not going to lay down and roll over for anyone.''         Ms. Brown sustained a career for six decades: first as a bright, bluesy singer who was called ''the girl with a tear in her voice'' and then, after some lean years, as the embodiment of an earthy, indomitable black woman. She had a life of hard work, hard luck, determination, audacity and style. Sometimes it was said that R&B stood as much for Ruth Brown as it did for rhythm and blues.         As the 1950s began, Ms. Brown's singles for the fledgling Atlantic Records -- like ''(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean'' and ''5-10-15 Hours'' -- became both the label's bankroll and templates for all of rock 'n' roll. She could sound as if she were hurting, or joyfully lusty, or both at once. Her voice was forthright, feisty and ready for anything.         After Ms. Brown's string of hits ended, she kept singing but also went on to a career in television, radio and movies ( including a memorable role as the disc jockey Motormouth Maybelle in John Waters's ''Hairspray'') and on Broadway, where she won a Tony Award for her part in ''Black and Blue.'' She worked clubs, concerts and festivals into the 21st century.         ''Whatever I have to say, I get it said,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1995. ''Like the old spirituals say, 'I've gone too far to turn me 'round now.' ''         Ms. Brown was born Ruth Weston on Jan. 12, 1928, in Portsmouth, Va., the oldest of seven children. She made her debut when she was 4, and her father, the choir director at the local Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, lifted her onto the church piano. In summers, she and her siblings picked cotton at her grandmother's farm in North Carolina. ''That made me the strong woman I am,'' she said in 1995.         As a teenager, she would tell her family she was going to choir practice and perform instead at U.S.O. clubs at nearby naval stations. She ran away from home at 17, working with a trumpeter named Jimmy Brown and using his last name onstage. She married him, or thought she did; he was already married. But she was making a reputation as Ruth Brown, and the name stuck.         The big-band leader Lucky Millinder heard her in Detroit late in 1946, hired her for his band and fired her in Washington, D.C. . Stranded, she managed to find a club engagement at the Crystal Caverns. There, the disc jockey Willis Conover, who broadcast jazz internationally on Voice of America radio, heard Ms. Brown and recommended her to friends at Atlantic Records.         On the way to New York City, however, she was seriously injured in an automobile accident and hospitalized for most of a year; her legs, which were smashed, would be painful for the rest of her life. She stood on crutches in 1949 to record her first session for Atlantic, and the bluesy ballad ''So Long'' became a hit.         She wanted to keep singing ballads, but Atlantic pushed her to try upbeat songs, and she tore into them. During the sessions for ''Teardrops From My Eyes,'' her voice cracked upward to a squeal. Herb Abramson of Atlantic Records liked it, called it a ''tear,'' and after ''Teardrops'' reached No. 1 on the rhythm and blues chart, the sound became her trademark for a string of hits.         ''If I was getting ready to go and record and I had a bad throat, they'd say, 'Good!','' she once recalled.         Ms. Brown was the best-selling black female performer of the early 1950s, even though, in that segregated era, many of her songs were picked up and redone by white singers, like Patti Page and Georgia Gibbs, in tamer versions that became pop hits. The pop singer Frankie Laine gave her a lasting nickname: Miss Rhythm.         Working the rhythm and blues circuit in the 1950s, when dozens of her singles reached the R&B Top 10, Ms. Brown drove a Cadillac and had romances with stars like the saxophonist Willis (Gator Tail) Jackson and the singer Clyde McPhatter of the Drifters. (Her first son, Ronald, was given the last name Jackson; decades later, she told him he was actually Mr. McPhatter's son, and he now sings with a latter-day lineup of the Drifters.)         In 1955 Ms. Brown married Earl Swanson, a saxophonist, and had a second son, Earl; the marriage ended in divorce. Her two sons survive her: Mr. Jackson, who has three children, of Los Angeles, and Mr. Swanson of Las Vegas. She is also survived by four siblings: Delia Weston of Las Vegas, Leonard Weston of Long Island and Alvin and Benjamin Weston of Portsmouth.         Her streak of hits ended soon after the 1960s began. She lived on Long Island, raised her sons, worked as a teacher's aide and a maid and was married for three years to a police officer, Bill Blunt. On weekends she sang club dates in the New York area, and she recorded an album in 1968 with the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Big Band. Although her hits had supported Atlantic Records -- sometimes called the House That Ruth Built -- she was unable at one point to afford a home telephone.         The comedian Redd Foxx, whom she had once helped out of a financial jam, invited her to Los Angeles in 1975 to play the gospel singer Mahalia Jackson in ''Selma,'' a musical about civil rights he was producing.         She went on to sing in Las Vegas and continued a comeback that never ended. The television producer Norman Lear gave her a role in the sitcom ''Hello, Larry.'' She returned to New York City in 1982, appearing in Off Broadway productions including ''Stagger Lee,'' and in 1985 she went to Paris to perform in the revue ''Black and Blue,'' rejoining it later for its Broadway run.         Ms. Brown began to speak out, onstage and in interviews, about the exploitative contracts musicians of her generation had signed. Many hit-making musicians had not recouped debts to their labels, according to record company accounting, and so were not receiving royalties at all. Shortly before Atlantic held a 40th-birthday concert at Madison Square Garden in 1988, the label agreed to waive unrecouped debts for Ms. Brown and 35 other musicians of her era and to pay 20 years of retroactive royalties.         Atlantic also contributed nearly $2 million to start the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, which pushed other labels toward royalty reform and distributed millions of dollars directly to musicians in need, although it has struggled to sustain itself in recent years.         ''Black and Blue'' revitalized Ms. Brown's recording career, on labels including Fantasy and Bullseye Blues. Her 1989 album ''Blues on Broadway'' won a Grammy Award for best jazz vocal performance, female. She was a radio host on the public radio shows ''Harlem Hit Parade'' and ''BluesStage.'' In 1995 she released her autobiography, ''Miss Rhythm'' (Dutton), written with Andrew Yule; it won the Gleason Award for music journalism. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.         She toured steadily, working concert halls, festivals and cabarets. This year she recorded songs for the coming movie by John Sayles, ''Honeydripper,'' and was about to fly to Alabama to act in it when she became ill.         Ms. Brown never learned to read music. ''In school we had music classes, but I ducked them,'' she said in 1995. ''They were just a little too slow. I didn't want to learn to read no note. I knew I could sing it. I woke up one morning and I could sing.''       
         Anita O'Day, whose coolly ebullient and rhythmically assured vocal style made her a premier singer of both the big-band and postwar jazz eras, and whose taste for fast living secured her name as one of jazz's toughest survivors, died yesterday in Los Angeles. She was 87.         Her death was announced by her manager, Robbie Cavolina, who said that she had been recovering from pneumonia. Ms. O'Day had no children or immediate family, he said.         ''When you think of the great jazz singers, I would think that Anita is the only white woman that belongs in the same breath as Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan,'' said the jazz critic Will Friedwald in ''Anita O'Day: Life of a Jazz Singer,'' a forthcoming documentary directed by Mr. Cavolina and Ian McCrudden.         Born Anita Belle Colton in Chicago, Ms. O'Day began her career as a dance-marathon contestant. She adopted her stage name early on. ''I'd decided O'Day was groovy,'' she explained in ''High Times Hard Times,'' her unvarnished autobiography written with George Eells, ''because in pig Latin it meant dough, which was what I hoped to make.''         Through most of the 1940s, Ms. O'Day ranked among the best of the big-band vocalists. Her first big break came with the Gene Krupa Orchestra, and it was with that band that she had her first hit, a duet with the trumpeter Roy Eldridge called ''Let Me Off Uptown.'' Though essentially a novelty tune, it was also a bold stroke at a time when black and white musicians were still not commonly heard side by side.         It wasn't the only boundary Ms. O'Day would push during her early years in the spotlight. Bucking the glamorous expectations of a big-band canary, or ''girl singer,'' she performed in a standard-issue band jacket and skirt. This tomboyish image proved both influential and a bit scandalous, like a number of things in Ms. O'Day's life and career.         After Krupa, Ms. O'Day worked more briefly with the orchestras of Woody Herman and Stan Kenton. Her version of ''And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine'' was one of Kenton's biggest hits up to that time.         Ms. O'Day's personal life was famously a cyclone of drug and alcohol abuse, marriages, numerous abortions and affairs. She had a weakness for drummers: her first husband, Don Carter, played drums, and so did her closest musical partner for many years, John Poole. In 1947 she made headlines for her arrest, with her second husband, Carl Hoff, for marijuana possession. She was arrested again in 1952, and went to prison. Her near-death from a heroin overdose in the late 1960s prompted a serious try at rehabilitation.         Ms. O'Day always maintained that her notoriety helped fuel her success, and the music doesn't contradict her. In the 1950s she made a string of well-produced pop albums on Verve Records, with what would become signature renditions of ''Honeysuckle Rose'' and ''Sweet Georgia Brown.''         Her Sunday afternoon performance at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival, as captured in Bert Stern's film ''Jazz on a Summer's Day,'' was one of her great offhanded achievements. Turned out in a crisp black dress and ostrich-feathered hat, she sang an insinuating ''Sweet Georgia Brown'' and a breakneck ''Tea for Two,'' both with a playful mastery.         Ms. O'Day was fond of asserting that she was not a singer, but a song stylist; she took pride in her self-made technique and her ability to deliver a tune with confidence, no matter how frenetic the setting. It was the same skill that she emphasized in her life. ''Given a choice,'' she wrote in her autobiography, ''I wanted to be where the action was.''       
         Betty Comden, who with her longtime collaborator Adolph Green wrote the lyrics and often the librettos for some of the most celebrated musicals of stage and screen, died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 89 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said Ronald Konecky, her lawyer and the executor of her estate.         During a professional partnership that lasted for more than 60 years, and which finally ended with Mr. Green's death in 2002, the Comden-Green blend of sophisticated wit and musical know-how lit up stage shows like ''On the Town,'' ''Wonderful Town,'' ''Peter Pan'' and ''Bells Are Ringing.'' Their Hollywood credits included the screenplays for two landmark film musicals, ''Singin' in the Rain'' and ''The Band Wagon.''         Through the years they worked with composers like Leonard Bernstein, Cy Coleman, Jule Styne and Andr√© Previn, creating songs like ''New York, New York,'' ''The Party's Over,'' ''It's Love'' and ''Some Other Time.'' They were adept at making their lyrics fit the mood, whether it was rueful (''Lonely Town''), raucous (''100 Easy Ways to Lose a Man'') or romantic (''Just in Time'').         The title of one of their own songs, from ''Bells Are Ringing,'' summed up their joint career: it was truly a ''Perfect Relationship'' in which they met daily, most often in Ms. Comden's living room, either to work on a show, to trade ideas or even just talk about the weather.         ''We stare at each other,'' Ms. Comden said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. ''We meet, whether or not we have a project, just to keep up a continuity of working. There are long periods when nothing happens, and it's just boring and disheartening. But we have a theory that nothing's wasted, even those long days of staring at one another. You sort of have to believe that, don't you? That you had to go through all that to get to the day when something did happen.''         Ms. Comden, slim, dark-haired and composed, was the ideal counterbalance to the often rumpled, wild-haired and restless Mr. Green. Sometimes, during discussions, Ms. Comden would finish one of his sentences, or vice versa. Songs and shows grew that way too, although the story was always the starting point.         ''The book comes first,'' Ms. Comden said in the 1977 interview , recalling how the song ''Just in Time'' took shape. ''At some point when we were working on 'Bells Are Ringing,' '' she said, ''Jule Styne wrote that tune. Dee da dum, da dee da dee da dum. We all agreed it had to be in the show somewhere, but for months we couldn't find a place for it, or even a title, but Jule was playing it all over town at parties, calling it 'Dee Da Dum.' And that became the official title until the point where, rewriting part of the book one day, the situation was there, and we finally wrote the words to fit 'Dee Da Dum.' ''         The starting point for their partnership was Greenwich Village where, in the late 1930s, they joined up with another aspiring entertainer named Judy Holliday and two other friends to form a cabaret act. They called themselves the Revuers and persuaded Max Gordon, the owner of a club called the Village Vanguard, that their act would be good for business. It was.         The Revuers opened at the Vanguard in 1939, performing material that included freewheeling sketches like ''The Banshi Sisters'' and ''The Baroness Bazuka,'' a zany operetta, and frequently accompanied at the piano by one of Mr. Green's friends, a talented young musician named Leonard Bernstein, who dropped in often enough to be taken for part of their act.         The act's success earned them a movie offer, and the Revuers traveled west in hopes of finding instant fame in ''Greenwich Village,'' a 1944 movie starring Carmen Miranda and Don Ameche, in which the newcomers turned out to be virtually invisible. Ms. Comden and Mr. Green came back to New York, where they resumed working at the Vanguard and other clubs.         It wasn't long before they heard from Mr. Bernstein, their erstwhile accompanist, who said he'd been working on a ballet with Jerome Robbins and that the two of them had decided that the ballet, called ''Fancy Free,'' had the makings of a Broadway show. They were looking for someone to write the book and lyrics.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green jumped at the chance and jumped into the limelight with their work on the show. The result, ''On the Town,'' the story of three sailors on shore leave in New York, opened late in 1944 and was a smash. Both Ms. Comden and Mr. Green appeared in the show, he as one of the sailors and she as Claire de Loone, an amorous anthropologist. New Yorkers inside and outside the theater were soon humming the town's geography √† la Comden and Green:         The Bronx is up and the Battery's down,         The people ride in a hole in the ground,         New York, New York,         It's a helluva town.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green were definitely on their way up, not to the Bronx but to big-time success.         Betty Comden was born Elizabeth Cohen on May 3, 1917, in Brooklyn. Her father, Leo, was a lawyer, her mother, Rebecca, a teacher. She attended Erasmus Hall High School and studied drama at New York University, graduating in 1938.         By that time she had changed her surname to Comden, had had nose surgery to make her look more stageworthy, had acted with the Washington Square Players and had met and become friends with Mr. Green, another aspiring actor. Their circle soon included three other would-be entertainers, Ms. Holliday, Alvin Hammer and John Frank. Then came their decision to form the Revuers, and all else followed.         Ms. Comden married Steven Kyle, a designer and businessman, in 1942. He died in 1979, and she never remarried. They had two children, a daughter, Susanna, and a son, Alan. Their son, a drug addict, contracted AIDS and died of complications of his addiction in 1990. She is survived by her daughter, Susanna Kyle, of Manhattan.         Ms. Comden reminisced about her Brooklyn childhood, her student years and her long marriage in a 1995 memoir, ''Off Stage,'' in which she also told of the difficult circumstances of her son's struggle with drugs. The book included tributes to some of her friends and colleagues, among them Mr. Bernstein and Lauren Bacall, but hardly dealt at all with her professional life.         After the success of ''On the Town,'' Ms. Comden and Mr. Green tried their hands at writing the book for another Broadway musical. ''Billion Dollar Baby,'' which opened in 1945, had a score by Morton Gould, choreography by Mr. Robbins and was directed by George Abbott, but it was not as well received.         Hollywood called again, and this time, for the most part, they had better luck. ''Good News'' (1947), with June Allyson and Peter Lawford as singing, dancing campus sweethearts, was their first screenplay. They wrote ''The Barkleys of Broadway'' (1949), which marked the film reunion of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, and adapted ''On the Town'' (1949) for the screen, with Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin as the freewheeling sailors navigating the streets of New York.         They contributed heavily to the success of ''The Band Wagon'' (1953), the Vincente Minnelli musical for which they wrote the witty screenplay. The film had a score by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz and starred Mr. Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray. The Comden-Green screenplay received an Academy Award nomination.         They were still wedded to Broadway, however, and their stage work during the next few years included the Jule Styne musical ''Two on the Aisle'' (1951), a revue with Bert Lahr and Dolores Gray; ''Wonderful Town'' (1953), an adaptation of the 1939 comedy hit ''My Sister Eileen,'' with music by Mr. Bernstein and starring Rosalind Russell and Edie Adams as two sisters from Ohio trying to make it in the Big Town; and, most notably, ''Bells Are Ringing.''         That 1956 musical reunited them with Ms. Holliday, who headed the cast as an operator at an answering service who falls in love with one of the service's male clients (Sydney Chaplin) after listening to his voice over her telephone line. The score included the comic lament ''I'm Going Back (To the Bonjour Tristesse Brassiere Company)'' as well as some songs that became part of the standard pop repertory, like ''Just in Time,'' ''Long Before I Knew You'' and ''The Party's Over,'' which ended with the melancholy verse:         Now you must wake up         All dreams must end         Take off your makeup         The party's over         It's all over, my friend.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green also wrote the screenplay for the 1960 film version, which starred Ms. Holliday.         Even their less successful shows yielded musical nuggets, one example being the 1960 ''Do Re Mi,'' which had a book by Garson Kanin and music by Mr. Styne for which they wrote the lyrics. It featured Phil Silvers and Nancy Walker. That largely unmemorable score included one gem, ''Make Someone Happy.''         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green went on to write ''Subways Are for Sleeping'' (1961), with Carol Lawrence and Mr. Chaplin, and ''Fade Out-Fade In'' (1964), with Carol Burnett and Jack Cassidy, both shows with music by Mr. Styne, and the lyrics for ''Hallelujah, Baby'' (1968), which had music by Mr. Styne and a book by Arthur Laurents and which starred Leslie Uggams and Robert Hooks. They wrote the book for ''Applause'' (1970), adapted from the film ''All About Eve,'' with music by Charles Strouse and lyrics by Lee Adams. The show starred Ms. Bacall as the take-no-prisoners movie queen Margo Channing played by Bette Davis in the film.         In the years that followed Ms. Comden and Mr. Green teamed up with the composer Cy Coleman for ''On the Twentieth Century'' (1978), based on the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur play about a flamboyant movie producer (John Cullum) and his leading lady (Madeline Kahn), traveling from Hollywood to Broadway on the Twentieth-Century Limited in the 1930s. The show was a hit and brought them Tony Awards for their book and score.         In 1982 they wrote the book and lyrics -- Larry Grossman wrote the music -- for what was meant to be a kind of musical sequel to Ibsen's ''A Doll's House,'' but the result, ''A Doll's Life'' (1982), was a four-performance disaster.         Their last major Broadway show was ''The Will Rogers Follies,'' a 1991 Ziegfeld-style extravaganza with music by Mr. Coleman, book by Peter Stone and direction and choreography by Tommy Tune. Keith Carradine starred as the folksy humorist-philosopher. Despite mixed reviews the show won six Tony Awards, including one for the music and lyrics, and enjoyed a run of two and a half years.         By the time ''Will Rogers'' came along, Ms. Comden and Mr. Green had worked together for more than a half-century. On Broadway, starting with ''On the Town'' in 1944, they had won a shelf full of Tony Awards. They were among the recipients of the 1991 Kennedy Center honors for their contributions to American musical theater.         Their early Hollywood credits included ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' (1949), with Gene Kelly, Mr. Sinatra and Esther Williams, and ''It's Always Fair Weather'' (1955), with Mr. Kelly, Dan Dailey, Michael Kidd and Ms. Charisse, for which their screenplay received an Academy Award nomination. A bittersweet sequel of sorts to ''On the Town,'' the plot of ''It's Always Fair Weather'' revolved around the reunion a decade after World War II of three former G.I. companions who find that time has altered their friendship for the worse.         ''I don't think there's ever been a musical quite like it,'' Ms. Comden said in a 1999 interview with The Times. ''The corrosive effect that time has on friendships -- that's a very unusual subject for a musical.'' She and Mr. Green said it was one of their favorites.         After their stage debut in ''On the Town'' they didn't perform on Broadway again until 1958, when they appeared in ''A Party with Betty Comden and Adolph Green,'' a revue that included some of their early favorites like ''The Baroness Bazuka,'' which they described as a tribute to the Shubert brothers (''J. J., O. O., and Uh-Uh.''). The revue was well received, and they brought an updated version back to Broadway in 1977.         Ms. Comden also performed in films from time to time. She acted in Sidney Lumet's ''Garbo Talks'' (1984), in which Mr. Green also made a fleeting appearance, and James Ivory's ''Slaves of New York'' (1989). She appeared onstage in 1983 in a rare dramatic role in Wendy Wasserstein's ''Isn't It Romantic,'' playing the mother of a footloose girl waiting for Mr. Right to come along.         In 1999 Ms. Comden and Mr. Green were saluted by their peers in a two-night program at Carnegie Hall. Elaine Stritch and Brian Stokes Mitchell were among the performers who sang numbers from the Comden-Green repertoire.         Recent Broadway revivals of their work included a 2001 production of ''Bells Are Ringing'' starring Faith Prince, which closed after a brief run, and the 2003 revival of ''Wonderful Town'' with Donna Murphy, which settled in for a long stay at the Al Hirschfeld Theater.         After Mr. Green's death in October 2002, Broadway turned out in force two months later for a memorial program at the Shubert Theater. Kevin Kline, Joel Grey, Ms. Bacall and others paid affectionate tribute to Mr. Green in song and story. At one point during her own reminiscence about him, Ms. Comden paused and said to the audience, ''It's lonely up here.'' After six decades the perfect relationship was over.         Correction:  February 26, 2007, Monday  An obituary on Nov. 24 about the Broadway lyricist Betty Comden misstated her given name at birth. Although the name Elizabeth is widely reported in reference works, she was named Basya Cohen and was never called Elizabeth, according to her memoir, ''Off Stage.'' (She chose the name Betty because Basya is pronounced Bahssie and she wanted to avoid the nickname for a cow, Bossy.) A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message on Tuesday, and this correction was further delayed for research.       
         Muriel Castanis, a sculptor whose fluidly draped figures are displayed in public places and galleries around the United States, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Greenwich Village.         The cause was lung failure, her husband, George Castanis, said.         A self-taught artist, Ms. Castanis was known in particular for her method of laying an epoxy-soaked cloth over a mannequin built of plastic foam. She would then remove the foam, leaving empty, faceless figures that were reminiscent of Greek sculpture.         In a 1990 review of her work in a joint show by nine sculptors, Vivien Raynor of The New York Times wrote, ''Just as the Invisible Man was defined by his bandages, Muriel Castanis's figures are the sum of their classical draperies.''         In 1984 Ms. Castanis made three caryatids to adorn the top of 580 California Street in San Francisco, a skyscraper and architectural landmark of the city designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee.         The youngest of six children, Ms. Castanis, born Muriel Brunner, grew up in Greenwich Village and discovered her love for art at Greenwich House, the settlement house where she would go to escape her family's hectic, crowded cold-water apartment. She attended New York's High School of Music and Art but did not start working as an artist until 1964, after 10 years as a full-time wife and mother of four.         She began by painting over subtle designs on fabric. She would smear Elmer's glue on a board with a washcloth and paste the fabric onto it. But eventually she became more intrigued by the shapes formed by the dried washcloths, and turned to sculpture.         Her sculpturing career took off after a sold-out show in 1980 at OK Harris Works of Art in Manhattan, which represented her from then on.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Castanis is survived by her four children: Thaddeus, of New York; Claudius and Augustus, of Los Angeles; and Phoebe Coombs, of Schwenksville, Pa.; and two grandchildren.         Ms. Castanis's works are featured in the Detroit Institute of Arts, Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Fla.; the library at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass.; and the I.B.M. Corporation Atrium in Atlanta. One of her notable public artworks in New York is ''Flatbush Floogies,'' cast-bronze reliefs embedded in the walls of the Flatbush Avenue-Brooklyn College subway station.       
         Phyllis Cerf Wagner, who led a whirlwind life as the socially dynamic wife of two of New York's most prominent men but who was always proudest of collaborating with a former advertising colleague, Dr. Seuss, on a series of landmark children's books, died on Friday. She was 90.         Mrs. Wagner died at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital of complications from a fall in the bedroom of the home on East 62nd Street where she had lived since 1941, said her older son, Christopher Cerf.         A newspaper and magazine columnist, movie actress, publisher, writer of radio soap operas, advertising executive and civic fund-raiser, she lived at the center of Manhattan social life, entertaining successive generations of the city's artistic and political elite, first as the wife of the Random House co-founder Bennett Cerf, then as the wife of former Mayor Robert F. Wagner.         As a hostess and occasional confidante, she hobnobbed with the most famous people of the day, including Frank Sinatra, William Faulkner and Truman Capote.         ''In my dad's day, it was theater people mixing with book people,'' said Jonathan Cerf, her younger son. ''In Bob Wagner's day, it was political people mixing with powerful people from the private sector.''         While she was a teenager in Oklahoma City, Ginger Rogers, her cousin, invited her to move to Hollywood to try acting. Family legend has it that Ginger Rogers got her stage name because as a child, Phyllis had trouble pronouncing her real one, Virginia.         With Ginger Rogers's help, Phyllis Fraser landed small roles in several films beginning in 1932, including 1934's ''Little Men'' and 1938's ''Vivacious Lady,'' though her biggest part was opposite John Wayne in ''Winds of the Wasteland'' in 1936.         By 1939, she realized acting was not her future, so she moved to New York, joined the advertising agency of McCann Erickson and began writing radio plays. She shared a desk at the agency with an illustrator named Theodor Seuss Geisel.         Years later, after he became Dr. Seuss and, in 1957, published his breakthrough book, ''The Cat in the Hat,'' Mrs. Wagner suggested to him and his wife, Helen, that they collaborate on a series of learning-to-read books. Their new imprint, Beginner Books, eventually included classic titles like ''The Cat in the Hat Comes Back'' and ''Green Eggs and Ham.''         They worked together for more than a decade and often fought, eventually parting professionally. ''They had some disagreements which were memorable,'' Christopher Cerf said. ''They were both perfectionists and would argue about every comma that went on the page.''         Shortly after she arrived in New York in 1939, Ginger Rogers introduced Phyllis Fraser to Harold Ross, editor of The New Yorker, who decided that she would make a nice match for Bennett Cerf. He introduced them at a party and they were married in 1940. Mr. Cerf died in 1971.         He encouraged her to remain professionally active, so she wrote a column for Newsday, often chronicling her encounters with celebrities. She also often took pictures for the book jackets of some of Random House's most renowned authors. Later, she wrote a household hints column for Good Housekeeping.         In the 1950s Mr. Cerf was a regular panelist on the television program ''What's My Line?'' His wife sometimes filled in as a guest panelist, and she was also a regular on the panel of an early '50s quiz program called ''Down You Go.''         A few years after her husband's death, she was introduced to former Mayor Wagner. They married in 1975. The couple lived in the same town house that the Cerfs had purchased in 1941 but made regular forays to Rome in the late '70s when Mr. Wagner was President Jimmy Carter's envoy to the Vatican.         In 1980, Mrs. Wagner co-founded the Women's Committee of the Central Park Conservancy and worked tirelessly to raise money to revive Central Park. After Mr. Wagner's death in 1991, she returned to work, joining the advertising firm of Wells Rich Greene. Part of her job was to organize elaborate parties to attract clients.         ''My mother was an incredibly gifted hostess, wonderful at putting people together,'' Jonathan Cerf said. ''She did it with enthusiasm. But the thing that always made her proudest was those books that helped so many children learn to read.''       
         Phyllis Cerf Wagner, who led a whirlwind life as the socially dynamic wife of two of New York's most prominent men but who was always proudest of collaborating with a former advertising colleague, Dr. Seuss, on a series of landmark children's books, died on Friday. She was 90.         Mrs. Wagner died at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital of complications from a fall in the bedroom of the home on East 62nd Street where she had lived since 1941, said her older son, Christopher Cerf.         A newspaper and magazine columnist, movie actress, publisher, writer of radio soap operas, advertising executive and civic fund-raiser, she lived at the center of Manhattan social life, entertaining successive generations of the city's artistic and political elite, first as the wife of the Random House co-founder Bennett Cerf, then as the wife of former Mayor Robert F. Wagner.         As a hostess and occasional confidante, she hobnobbed with the most famous people of the day, including Frank Sinatra, William Faulkner and Truman Capote.         ''In my dad's day, it was theater people mixing with book people,'' said Jonathan Cerf, her younger son. ''In Bob Wagner's day, it was political people mixing with powerful people from the private sector.''         While she was a teenager in Oklahoma City, Ginger Rogers, her cousin, invited her to move to Hollywood to try acting. Family legend has it that Ginger Rogers got her stage name because as a child, Phyllis had trouble pronouncing her real one, Virginia.         With Ginger Rogers's help, Phyllis Fraser landed small roles in several films beginning in 1932, including 1934's ''Little Men'' and 1938's ''Vivacious Lady,'' though her biggest part was opposite John Wayne in ''Winds of the Wasteland'' in 1936.

         Bebe Moore Campbell, a best-selling novelist known for her empathetic treatment of the difficult, intertwined and occasionally surprising relationship between the races, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 56.         The cause was complications of brain cancer, said Linda Wharton-Boyd, a longtime friend.         Along with writers like Terry McMillan, Ms. Campbell was part of the first wave of black novelists who made the lives of upwardly mobile black people a routine subject for popular fiction. Straddling the divide between literary and mass-market novels, Ms. Campbell's work explored not only the turbulent dance between blacks and whites but also the equally fraught relationship between men and women.         Throughout her work, Ms. Campbell sought to counter prevailing stereotypes of black people as socially and economically marginal. Though critics occasionally faulted her characters as two-dimensional, her novels were known for their crossover appeal, read by blacks and whites alike.         Often called on by the news media to discuss race relations, Ms. Campbell was for years a familiar presence on television and radio. With the publication of her most recent novel, ''72 Hour Hold'' (Knopf, 2005), she also became a visible spokeswoman on mental-health issues. The novel, about bipolar disorder, was inspired by the experience of a family member, Ms. Campbell said.         Originally a schoolteacher and later a journalist, Ms. Campbell made her mark as a writer of fiction with her first novel, ''Your Blues Ain't Like Mine'' (Putnam), published in 1992. Rooted in the story of Emmett Till, the book tells of a black Chicago youth killed by a white man in Mississippi in 1955. After the murderer is acquitted at trial, the narrative follows his increasing dissolution.         ''I wanted to give racism a face,'' Ms. Campbell said in an interview with The New York Times Book Review in 1992. ''African-Americans know about racism, but I don't think we really know the causes. I decided it's first of all a family problem.''         Reviewing the novel in The Book Review, Clyde Edgerton wrote: ''By showing lives lived, and not explaining ideas, Ms. Campbell does what good storytellers do -- she puts in by leaving out.''         Ms. Campbell's other novels, all published by G. P. Putnam's Sons, are ''Brothers and Sisters'' (1994), written in the wake of the Los Angeles riots of 1992; ''Singing in the Comeback Choir'' (1998), about a black television producer feeling cut off from her roots; and ''What You Owe Me'' (2001), about the friendship between two women, one African-American, the other a Jewish Holocaust survivor, in the 1940's.         Elizabeth Bebe Moore was born in Philadelphia on Feb. 18, 1950, to parents who divorced when she was very young. Bebe spent each school year in Philadelphia with her mother, grandmother and aunt -- strong, upright women she collectively called ''the Bosoms'' -- who set her on a course of study, discipline and staunch middle-class respectability.         She spent summers in North Carolina with her father, who had been paralyzed in an automobile accident. There, she was enveloped in a heady world of beer, laughter and cigar smoke. She documented her contrasting lives in her memoir, ''Sweet Summer: Growing Up With and Without My Dad'' (Putnam, 1989).         After earning a bachelor's degree in elementary education from the University of Pittsburgh in 1971, Ms. Campbell taught school in Atlanta for several years before embarking on a career as a freelance journalist. Her first book was a work of nonfiction, ''Successful Women, Angry Men: Backlash in the Two-Career Marriage'' (Random House, 1986).         She also wrote two picture books for children, ''Sometimes My Mommy Gets Angry'' (Putnam, 2003; illustrated by E. B. Lewis); and ''Stompin' at the Savoy'' (Philomel, 2006; illustrated by Richard Yarde).         Ms. Campbell's first marriage, to Tiko Campbell, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, Ellis Gordon Jr., whom she married in 1984; her mother, Doris Moore of Los Angeles; a daughter from her first marriage, Maia Campbell of Los Angeles; a stepson, Ellis Gordon III of Mitchellville, Md.; and two grandchildren.         Despite the subject matter of her books, Ms. Campbell expressed hope about the future of American race relations. In an interview with The New York Times in 1995, she described her motivation for writing ''Brothers and Sisters,'' the story of the friendship between a black banker and her white colleague.         ''It was my attempt to bridge a racial gap,'' Ms. Campbell said. ''That's the story that never gets told: how many of us really like each other, respect each other.''       
         Hilda van Stockum, an award-winning children's author and illustrator whose books depicted family life in the Netherlands, Ireland, the United States and Canada, died on Wednesday at her home in Berkhamsted, England. She was 98.         The cause was a stroke, said her son John Tepper Marlin of Manhattan.         Ms. van Stockum won honors from the Newbery Medal committee in 1935 for her first book, ''A Day on Skates: The Story of a Dutch Picnic.'' Based on her own childhood experiences, the book contained illustrations by Ms. van Stockum and a preface by her aunt, Edna St. Vincent Millay.         Ms. Stockum's later books, which were written for children from the ages of 7 to 12, reflected the wanderings of her own families. ''The Cottage at Bantry Bay'' (1938) and two sequels were set in Ireland, where she spent part of her childhood. ''The Mitchells'' (1945) was the first of three books about a family like the one she and her husband reared; they lived in Washington, then moved to Canada.         In the 1960s she again began setting her books in the Netherlands, writing ''The Winged Watchman,'' about boys who helped the Dutch resistance during World War II, and ''The Borrowed House'' (1975), about a Jewish child hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam.         Hilda Gerarda van Stockum was born in Rotterdam in 1908, the daughter of a Dutch naval officer. In addition to her son John, she is survived by her daughters Olga Marlin, who lives in Kenya, and Sheila O'Neill and Elisabeth Paice , who live in Britain; her son Randal Marlin of Ottawa; 18 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. Her husband of 62 years, Ervin Ross Marlin, died in 1994; a native New Yorker, he had worked for the State Department and the United Nations.         Ms. van Stockum was a painter as well. In 1993 one of her still lifes was chosen to appear on an Irish postage stamp as part of a series honoring contemporary art.       
         Ernestine Gilbreth Carey, who, with a younger brother, wrote ''Cheaper by the Dozen,'' the account of their growing up in a family of 12 children that led to several movies of the same name, died on Saturday in Fresno, Calif. She was 98 and lived in Reedley, Calif.         Her death was confirmed by her son, Charles E. Carey.         ''Cheaper by the Dozen,'' which became a best seller when it was published in 1948, beguiled readers with the autobiographical details of the Gilbreths, a family in the 1920's dominated by Dad but discreetly monitored by Mother. The book, replicated in numerous editions since its publication, is a testament to the intelligence, energy and eccentricity of the Gilbreth parents, who ran the family's management consulting firm.         The business focused on the science of motion study and industrial efficiencies. Frank Bunker Gilbreth believed that the factory management principles he espoused to his clients could also be applied to his family of six girls and six boys, produced in 17 years; Lillian Moller Gilbreth, who had a Ph.D. from Brown University (earned around 1915, while she had several children at home), was an industrial psychologist and an engineering expert. Mr. Gilbreth died of a heart attack in 1924 at 55, the day after Mrs. Carey graduated from high school; his wife died in 1972 at 93.         Mrs. Carey's brother Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr. received first billing as a co-author, and the book's narrative voice is decidedly unified, never betraying who wrote what. Nevertheless, Mrs. Carey wrote other books (as did her brother, who died in 2001), including ''Jumping Jupiter,'' ''Rings Around Us'' and ''Giddy Moment.''         The charming havoc of ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' found a wide audience just after World War II. Mrs. Carey and her brother mined a rich vein of humorous and quirky material from the Gilbreth clan. Mrs. Carey, the third child, and Frank, the fifth, plumbed what appeared to be the best of living in a brood that size.         An outing in their Pierce-Arrow, with Dad at the wheel and babies tucked in the front seat near Mother in the days before seat belts, felt ''like a back somersault off the high diving board.'' The household was described as ''organized confusion,'' resembling a ''newspaper on election night.'' In their house in Montclair, N.J., servants took care of cooking and gardening, although every child was assigned to look after a younger sibling and performed other tasks.         Given their father's penchant for order, ''nothing was considered more of a sin in our house than wasted time and motions,'' the authors wrote. Dad, though a benevolent soul, ran a household that was above all else driven to learn. Language records were played in the bathrooms while the children washed; they absorbed French and German that was later recited at the dinner table. Mealtime could be as intense as a board meeting, since ''no one could talk unless the subject was of general interest.'' Practical jokes, centered around Dad, defused the tension.         Toward the book's end, Ern, as Mrs. Carey was called, briefly enjoyed some of the spotlight when she and her older sister, Anne (who died in 1987), began dating in high school. With her wide face and compelling gaze, she attracted many suitors. But Dad had a little trouble with this, referring to one fellow as a ''simpleton with pimples in his voice.'' That didn't stop another boy from climbing a cherry tree near Ern's bedroom to spy on her, inciting her to label him a ''sneaking Peeping Tom.''         Hollywood wasted little time, spiriting ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' into a movie by 1950, starring Myrna Loy as Mother and Clifton Webb as Dad. It was remade and modernized in 2003 with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt as the parents, with ''Cheaper by the Dozen 2'' appearing in 2005. The Gilbreth brother-and-sister team also wrote ''Belles on Their Toes,'' a 1950 sequel that was turned into a movie in 1952. In July of this year Mrs. Carey finished writing a memoir but did not want to talk about it prematurely for fear of ''bad luck.''         Mrs. Carey graduated from Smith College in 1929, with a degree in English. She worked as a department-store buyer and in management in New York City for 14 years, marrying Charles E. Carey, who died in 1986, and having two children. Her own mother eventually lived with Mrs. Carey, after a long career of mothering, teaching, writing and consulting. Mrs. Carey also gathered her mother's extensive papers and photographs to donate them to Smith College.         Mrs. Carey is survived by two brothers, Frederick Gilbreth of Larchmont, N.Y., and Robert Gilbreth, of Franklin, N.H.; her children Charles E. Carey of Livermore, Calif., and Lillian Barley of Riverdale, Calif.; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Jeanne A. Smith, a former top administrator at Harlem Hospital Center and an expert on sickle cell anemia who helped establish broader federal guidelines for testing newborns for the disease, died on Nov. 11 in Lewisboro, N.Y. She was 75.         The cause was complications of a stroke, her family said.         In the 1970s, '80s and '90s, Dr. Smith, a hematologist, led several studies that were financed by the National Institutes of Health and contributed to changes in federal recommendations in screening for and aggressively treating sickle cell anemia and related diseases.         Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder in which crescent-shaped red blood cells can lodge in blood vessels, starving the body's tissues of oxygen and leading to infection, organ damage or stroke. The disease is most prevalent in blacks, and the sickle cell trait is present in about 8 percent of African-Americans.         In 1993, Dr. Smith was co-chairman of a federal panel that called for more intensive screening that would include infants and children in families of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and South American origin. The panel further recommended that infants with the disease be given vaccinations and daily treatments of penicillin to prevent infections. The guidelines were accepted by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and were widely adopted.         Dr. Clarice D. Reid, a pediatrician and chief of the sickle cell disease branch of the National Institutes of Health from 1975 to 1994, praised Dr. Smith's expertise in evaluating clinical trials and said that her ''keen diagnostic acumen'' had led to ''a no-nonsense approach to tackling sickle cell anemia and other challenges, including advocating for patients and informing them about the disease.''         Beginning in the 1970s, Dr. Smith served as a co-principal investigator on a benchmark N.I.H. study that followed sickle cell patients from infancy into adolescence and adulthood. Dr. Reid said that the study followed primarily black patients, tracking their nutrition, growth and development, and became an important means for comparing the severity of the disease in patients over time.         Jeanne Allen Smith was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and earned her medical degree from New York University in 1957. She later received a master's degree in public health from Columbia.         Dr. Smith joined Harlem Hospital in 1968 and served as president of its medical board from 1984 to 1987. She was a director of the hospital's sickle cell center and also taught at Columbia. She retired in 2002.         Dr. Smith's husband, Russell F. Smith Jr., died in 1983. The couple lived in Englewood, N.J., where Dr. Smith was president of the Board of Health in the 1980s. Earlier, in the 1970s, she served as president of Englewood's Board of Education.         She is survived by two sons, Russell F. Smith III of Clinton, Md., and David Smith of Kansas City, Mo.; five grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.       
         Anne Rogers Clark, a commanding figure in the world of show dogs who won renown at the Westminster Dog Show as a handler, a judge and a breeder, died Wednesday in Wilmington, Del., at the home of a friend. She was 77 and a longtime resident of Greenwood, Del.         The cause was kidney failure associated with colon cancer, said Thomas H. Bradley III, the chairman of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.         At 6 feet 2 inches, Mrs. Clark was an imposing and instantly recognizable presence in the show ring. For six decades, she was a fixture at Westminster, and she holds many of its records. Among them, she was the first woman to win best in show as a professional handler, and she ranked second among all handlers with three best in shows.         She also shared the record for most judging appearances at Westminster, with 22. She would have broken that record in February, when she was scheduled to be judge of the terrier group at Madison Square Garden.         A walking encyclopedia on the standards of more than 400 breeds worldwide, she was one of only two dozen people licensed to judge all 165 breeds and varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club.         She had more than a deep knowledge of dogs, though; she had a way with them.         ''Dogs responded to her,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''As a judge, she was authoritative and friendly. Some dogs who were shown to her many times would even recognize her. They would wag their tails when they saw her.''         Born in 1929 in Flushing, Queens, Anne Rogers was the great-granddaughter of a 19th-century mayor of New York, Philip Hone, and a second-generation dog person. Her mother, who ran a kennel in Pound Ridge, N.Y., started a successful dog department at Abercrombie & Fitch, then opened a grooming service in Manhattan called Dogs Inc.         Turning down a scholarship to the veterinary school at Cornell, Anne Rogers joined her mother's business after high school, then took to the show ring as a handler. She won her first best in show at Westminster in 1956, handling a toy poodle, Ch. Wilbur White Swan, the first dog from the toy group to win top honors there.         She turned to judging in 1967, two years after retiring as a handler. Although she said she was possibly the slowest judge in American Kennel Club history during her first few years, by 1973 she had worked her way to Westminster to judge the toy group. She judged the best in show in 1978.         Mrs. Clark was also a winner at Westminster as a breeder. She and her husband, James, captured non-sporting-group honors with their standard poodle Ch. Rimskittle Ruffian in 1980. In 2002, her miniature poodle Ch. Surrey Spice Girl, which she bred with Barbara Furbush and her prot√©g√© Kaz Hosaka, won best in show.         Mrs. Clark's activities extended beyond Westminster. Until recently, she spent most weekends traveling around the country judging at specialty shows. She was a president of the Poodle Club of America and the English Cocker Spaniel Club of America, co-wrote ''The International Encyclopedia of Dogs'' and published a compilation of her monthly columns for Dogs in Review magazine called ''Annie on Dogs!''         Mrs. Clark, whose husband died in 1991, had no children and leaves no survivors. She did hope to leave a legacy in the world of registered purebreds.         ''I have to get through to you that I adore to judge,'' she was quoted as saying in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. ''I look forward to walking in the ring. I feel when a class comes in, it's like a blank canvas, and if I'm lucky, I can paint on this canvas what the breed should be.''       
         Eleanor Thomas Elliott, an advocate for women's rights who successfully fought Columbia University's attempt to take over Barnard College in the early 1970s, died Sunday in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 80 and lived in Cross River, N.Y.         The cause was injuries from a car accident, said her brother-in-law, Osborn Elliott, the former editor of Newsweek and a former dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.         Ms. Elliott was chairwoman of the board at Barnard when she helped organize administrators, faculty members and students there to oppose a Columbia merger. ''If she hadn't held the line, it might well have gone the other way,'' said Helene Kaplan, a board member at the time and its chairwoman in the 1980s. ''Elly believed that Barnard offered something special for young women that could not be duplicated in a merged institution.''         Barnard, a women's college, is affiliated with its neighbor Columbia in Manhattan but maintains its independence.         Ms. Elliott led the Barnard board from 1973 to 1976. She was also a former board member of the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund. During the Reagan administration, she served on the National Advisory Council on Women's Educational Programs. ''She was a bridge for feminism into many traditional places,'' said the feminist leader Gloria Steinem, a friend.         In the early 1990s, Ms. Elliott was chairwoman of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation in Princeton, N.J., which promotes excellence in teaching, the humanities and women's studies.         Eleanor Lansing Thomas Elliott was born in Manhattan on April 26, 1926. She graduated from Barnard in 1948 and became a writer and editor at Vogue magazine. Her husband of 48 years, John Elliott Jr., known as Jock, a former chairman of Ogilvy & Mather, the advertising firm, died last year. They had no children.       
         Rosie Lee Tompkins, a renowned African-American quiltmaker whose use of dazzling color and vivid geometric forms made her work internationally acclaimed despite her vehement efforts to remain completely unknown, was found dead on Friday at her home in Richmond, Calif. She was 70.         The cause of death had not been determined, Eli Leon, a quilt scholar and longtime friend, said yesterday.         In everyday life, Ms. Tompkins was Effie Mae Howard, a fiercely private woman who lived quietly in Richmond and worked as a practical nurse. As Rosie Lee Tompkins, the pseudonym under which her quilts were shown, she was exhibited, much to her chagrin, in prestigious museums and galleries in the United States and Japan.         Lavishly praised by critics, Ms. Tompkins's quilts are in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Oakland Museum in California. Her work was included in the Whitney Biennial in 2002.         Writing in The New York Times the same year, Roberta Smith reviewed an exhibition of Ms. Tompkins's work at the Peter Blum Gallery in Manhattan: ''Unerring and intuitive in their sense of color, shape and scale, Ms. Tompkins's quilts are formidably joyful visual events that ignore the usual boundaries between cultures, histories and mediums.''         Born and raised in Arkansas, Ms. Tompkins was heir to the long tradition of black Southern quilting, a form of folk art whose best-known practitioners include the women of Gee's Bend, Ala. Their work, vibrant geometric quilts made from whatever scraps came to hand, became famous after it was shown at the Whitney in 2002 and 2003.         Ms. Tompkins's quilts are even more radical. Made of massed, vivid patches, they exude a barely controlled geometric anarchy. Stripes can be thrillingly off kilter. Patterns shift and fracture. The result, riotous mosaics in cloth, has been likened by critics to Modernist painting.         In traditional quilts, the fabric of choice is cotton. Ms. Tompkins's quilts can also include cut-up feed sacks, rayon, velvet, polyester, fake fur, wool and silk. Each material reflects light differently; in combination, they make her work look like something viewed through a prism.         Ms. Tompkins was born Effie Mae Martin on Sept. 6, 1936, in rural southeast Arkansas. (Effie Mae Howard was her married name.) One of 15 children, she picked cotton and helped her mother make quilts for the family. She left school before starting high school, and in 1958 settled in California.         There, she took classes in practical nursing and went to work in nursing homes. Around 1980, Ms. Tompkins started to quilt in earnest, producing hundreds of patchwork items of various sizes, showing them to almost no one outside her family.         She arrived at many of her designs -- abstract, improvisational and filled with deep personal significance -- after private prayer. Ms. Tompkins believed herself to be merely an instrument, Mr. Leon said. It was God, she felt, who designed the quilts and guided her hand.         She also believed that her phone was tapped. Sometimes she heard voices. She covered one wall of her bedroom with hangings, thick with appliqu√©d crosses, which she hoped would still them. They did not.         Even as her quilts gained renown, Ms. Tompkins revealed her true identity to only a handful of trusted associates, among them Mr. Leon, the quilt scholar. She never attended her out-of-town exhibitions. If a friend managed to drag her to a local exhibition of her work, she quietly slipped into the gallery anonymously.         ''Something she told me once was that despite the fact that nobody knew who she was, she felt like she had no privacy,'' Mr. Leon said by telephone yesterday. ''She felt like she lived in a glass house and people were watching her.''         Ms. Tompkins, who for deeply held reasons of her own refused to sign documents, rarely sold her work. Those quilts she did sell went for tens of thousands of dollars apiece, Mr. Leon said.         She was also fiercely circumspect about disclosing the names and whereabouts of family members. Mr. Leon was equally circumspect yesterday. It is known that Ms. Tompkins was married and divorced twice; survivors include her mother; several children and stepchildren; and many siblings, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.         A one-woman show of Ms. Tompkins's work is scheduled for next year at the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vt., from May 20 to Oct. 31.         Correction:  December 8, 2006, Friday  An obituary on Wednesday about Rosie Lee Tompkins, a reclusive maker of improvisational quilts, misstated her response to having her work exhibited in museums and galleries in the United States and abroad. Although Ms. Tompkins always worked under a pseudonym to preserve her anonymity, rarely attended her own exhibitions and agreed to sell few of her quilts, she was nonetheless pleased -- not chagrined -- to have her work shown, Eli Leon, a quilt scholar and longtime friend, told The Times on Wednesday.         Correction:  December 13, 2006, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary last Wednesday about Rosie Lee Tompkins, a renowned quiltmaker, misstated the name of the museum that has her work in its permanent collection. It is the Oakland Museum of California, not the Oakland Museum.       
         Ruth Bernhard, whose classical black-and-white photographs of the female nude and inanimate objects earned her a place of distinction among 20th-century photographers, died on Monday at her home in San Francisco. She was 101.         The San Francisco medical examiner's office said her death was of natural causes.         Ms. Bernhard was known primarily for her dramatically lighted nude studies, which expressed her interest in abstract shape and form. ''My quest, through the magic of light and shadow, is to isolate, to simplify and to give emphasis to form with the greatest clarity,'' she said. ''To indicate the ideal proportion, and reveal sculptural mass and the dominating spirit, is my goal.''         In 1935 a chance meeting with the photographer Edward Weston on the beach in Santa Monica, Calif., altered the course of Ms. Bernhard's life. He became her mentor, and she studied with him for years. Seeing his pictures for the first time, she said, was a revelation. ''It was lightning in the darkness,'' she said. ''Here before me was indisputable evidence of what I had thought possible -- an intensely vital artist whose medium was photography.''         In the 1940s Ms. Bernhard became part of Group f/64, joining Modernist West Coast photographers like Weston, Ansel Adams, Minor White, Imogen Cunningham, Wynn Bullock and Dorothea Lange. All took a purist approach to their subjects. Their work is characterized by photographic clarity and detailed precision.         Weston's influence, in particular, on Ms. Bernhard's work is evident from the compositional simplicity of his own nude studies and still lifes of organic objects like shells and peppers.         Ms. Bernhard photographed almost exclusively in the studio. She was known to take a single picture from one specific angle after setting up a composition meticulously, sometimes over days.         ''If I have chosen the female form in particular, it is because beauty has been debased and exploited in our sensual 20th century,'' she told Margaretta K. Mitchell, author of ''Ruth Bernhard: Between Art and Life'' (2000). ''Woman has been the subject of much that is sordid and cheap, especially in photography. To raise, to elevate, to endorse with timeless reverence the image of woman has been my mission.''         She supported herself by holding private classes in her studio and leading workshops. She published several books of photographs, and her work is in collections at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.         Ruth Bernhard was born in Berlin in 1905. Her parents, Lucian and Gertrud, divorced when she was 2, and her father brought her up with the help of two teachers, both women, in their 40s. A graphic designer and typographer, her father was known for designing the font Bernhard, which is still in use. He married again and had four children. Two half-brothers -- Karl, of Afton, N.Y., and Alexander, of London -- survive her.         Ms. Bernhard followed her father to New York in 1927 after she completed two years at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin. She began photographing the female nude in the early 1930s and eventually became acquainted with Berenice Abbott and her artistic circle. She also supported herself with commercial photographic assignments.         In the early 1940s Ms. Bernhard became involved with an artist and designer, Eveline Phimister, and for the next 10 years they lived together in New York, then in Carmel, Calif.; Los Angeles; and San Francisco, which became Ms. Bernhard's permanent home in 1953.         In 1967 she became involved with an Air Force colonel, Price Rice, 10 years her junior. She remained with him until his death in 1999. Ms. Bernhard talked openly in Ms. Mitchell's book about her many affairs with men and women. ''I allowed life to give me presents,'' she told Ms. Mitchell. ''And everything just sort of happened the way it was supposed to happen. I did not pursue anything. It more or less pursued me.''
