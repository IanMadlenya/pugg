         Maxine Postal, the Suffolk County legislative leader who resigned her post this week because of failing health, died Thursday in a hospice in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., where she also had a home. She was 61 and lived in Amityville, N.Y.         In announcing her resignation, which took effect a day before her death, Ms. Postal cited her recent diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rapidly spreading brain disorder. Her death was reported yesterday by her press secretary, Kara Hahn.         One of the highest-ranking elected officials in the county, Ms. Postal was first voted into the county Legislature 15 years ago. A Democrat, she championed equal rights for women, environmental protection, and programs for children, the elderly and the poor.         She was chosen as presiding officer for a one-year term last year by a coalition of Democrats and Republicans. As such she was in a position to shape the legislative agenda, name committee chairmen and preside at meetings of the 18-member body.         As her illness progressed in recent months, her duties often fell upon the deputy presiding officer elected alongside her, Joseph Caracappa, a Republican from Selden. The Republican caucus designated him last month to succeed her as presiding officer.         Born Maxine Levy in Brooklyn on Nov. 24, 1942, Ms. Postal was a 1962 fine-arts graduate of Brooklyn College, where she also received an M.A. in fine arts in 1965. She taught at public junior high and high schools in Brooklyn for six years before opening the Busy Bee Nursery School and Kindergarten there in 1968.         After moving to Long Island, she owned and directed the Busy Bee nursery in Amityville from 1976 to 1990, when the press of her community work and public service prompted her to sell the business.         She served as president of the Hauppauge Library Board in the 1970's and was a vice president of the Amityville Board of Education from 1984 to 1988.         In 1987 she was elected to the County Legislature. She served as minority leader and headed the Health Services Committee, the Human Services Committee and the Senior Citizens Committee.         In 2002 she was the vice chairwoman of the Finance and Fiscal Services Committee.         Ms. Postal is survived by two sons, Army Lt. Gregory J. Postal of Silver Spring, Md., and Dr. Eric S. Postal of Albany; a sister, Deborah Gitelman of Orangeburg, N.Y.; and her companion, Elie Mystal of Amityville. Her marriage to Jeffrey L. Postal ended in divorce.       
         MARIE C. WILSON, the president of the Ms. Foundation for Women, has the comportment of a seasoned politician. One of the sharper ones. She speaks with passion and laser-beam focus in a soft Georgia accent. Perhaps this impression is enhanced by that snappy red blazer, so bold and camera ready. Maybe it's the good political hair. It stays in place.         In this election year, does she wish she were out there? ''No,'' she says in a quick breath, eager to steer the chat back to her campaign with the White House Project, a nonpartisan group focused on getting women into leadership roles, up to the presidency. Besides, Ms. Wilson, who is 63, has been there, done that. Twenty years ago, she left a seat on the Des Moines City Council, where she got encouragement to run for governor, to lead the Ms. Foundation, which finances hundreds of programs to advance the rights of women and girls.         This brings us to the subject of the white bowler, emblazoned with ''Madame President'' in red, white and blue, propped on Ms. Wilson's computer in her comfortable office on Wall Street. What's with the hat?         Ms. Wilson is convinced that it won't be long before a woman is in the Oval Office. Perhaps in this decade. She thinks this even with nary a woman among the current pack since the withdrawal of Carol Moseley Braun, whom she praises highly.         She rubs her slender hands together fiercely, as if kindling fire. ''This is our time,'' she says. ''I think by 2008, we're going to see several women in the race.'' As president of the five-year-old White House Project, she hopes to recruit and train 1,000 women to become political leaders, and to enlist 25,000 women to get out the vote this year. She hopes to find these women by teaming with sister groups across the country. (She has contacts!)         So getting back to the presidency, who can we expect four years from now? Hillary Rodham Clinton? ''The common thinking is about Hillary Clinton, but there are other women, great women governors out there,'' says Ms. Wilson, a Democrat. She mentions two Democrats, Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona and Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, and a Republican senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas.         ''I think we will see two or three women running,'' she continues. ''And that's the point, to get enough women running so they are seen and they're evaluated on their agenda, not just gender, because numbers matter. One woman is always hair, hemline and husband. She has to prove she is man enough for the job.''         One might be tempted to say good luck.         Yet in 1993, people didn't take Ms. Wilson seriously when she had this notion to get parents to take their daughters to their workplaces to focus attention on their potential, not on their problems. Take Our Daughters to Work Day now has the participation of about 15 million adults annually.         ''People would tell us, 'I've always trusted you, but that's the nuttiest thing I've heard,''' she says.         Let's just say, in women Ms. Wilson trusts. She goes into this more in her book, ''Closing the Leadership Gap: Why Women Can and Must Help Run the World,'' due out next month from Viking Press. It is a call to action.         ''Think about what is going on in the country: terrorism, corporate greed,'' she says. ''These are things people are so concerned about that they are glued on the election. And what's an intervention that might have the most positive outcomes? It is bringing in a critical mass of women, a diversity of women, so you get some really different perspectives at the table so we can have different solutions.''         When Ms. Wilson arrived at the Ms. Foundation, there were four staff members and a $500,000 annual budget. The foundation now has a budget of $11 million and 40 employees. One is a man, a receptionist.         SHE describes her life as that of an ordinary American woman. Raised in segregated Atlanta, the daughter of a typesetter and a dental hygienist, she was high school homecoming queen and a cheerleader. She became immersed in civil rights after studying philosophy at Vanderbilt University. Her passion was stoked by a childhood incident in which a white bus driver dragged her crying from the back of the bus where she sat with her black baby sitter.         She married a man who became a minister of music, and followed him to churches in Delaware, Pennsylvania and Iowa, where she developed women's programs at Drake University. Later, she became an educator and human resources director for the Iowa Bankers Association. Her family grew to five children. She divorced. She came to New York to lead the Ms. Foundation.         ''I ended up loving a woman,'' she says simply. ''My relationship is wonderful.''         Her partner of 15 years is Nancy A. Lee, a vice president for business development at The New York Times, and they live in Manhattan.         One senses she would rather keep her private life private. The conversation turns to topics of the day. Same-sex marriage? ''The most important thing is really having the rights,'' she says. ''It's not about the marriage. It's having the same rights that you would get if you were married.''         She is asked if she thinks the foundation, created in 1972, is as relevant today as it was then. Of this, she has no doubt. ''Whether you look at the glass ceiling or the sticky floor, we're still there,'' she says. ''We've stayed in the game.''         PUBLIC LIVES  Correction:  February 19, 2004, Thursday  A Public Lives profile on Tuesday about Marie C. Wilson, president of the White House Project, which is trying to involve more women in leadership roles, misstated the type of hat, emblazoned with ''Madame President,'' that sits atop Ms. Wilson's computer. As the picture showed, it is a boater, with a flat crown and brim, not a bowler, which would have a round crown and curved brim.       
         Mary B. Goodhue, a longtime New York State senator who lost her seat in 1992 in a rare Republican primary to a little-known assemblyman by the name of George E. Pataki, died on Wednesday at Northern Westchester Hospital, her son, Francis A. Goodhue III, said. She was 82 and lived in Bedford, N.Y.         Mrs. Goodhue had represented northern Westchester and Putnam Counties in the State Legislature for 18 years, first in the Assembly and for seven terms in the Senate, when she was challenged in a Republican primary by Mr. Pataki, a protégé of hers who had once worked on her Senate staff as legislative counsel.         It was the year women running for political office across the nation had named ''the year of the woman,'' and Mrs. Goodhue, who was 71, was the only woman in the State Senate's Republican majority. That spring she had announced she would retire; a few days later, at the urging of party leaders, she changed her mind.         But Mr. Pataki, then 47, decided to challenge her anyway. It was a rare spectacle in state politics: a bitter primary in a party that usually avoids public squabbles. Mr. Pataki campaigned from the right, casting his former boss as too liberal.         Mrs. Goodhue told voters that year that Mr. Pataki was ''a very nice fellow; the only thing is, how come he wants my seat?'' In his autobiography, Mr. Pataki recalled the race as ''an arduous primary battle against an enormously popular incumbent.'' He won narrowly, and the statewide attention that the race drew helped set him on his path to the governorship.         Governor Pataki issued a statement yesterday expressing his condolences to Mrs. Goodhue's family and announcing that he had ordered the flags at the State Capitol in Albany and elsewhere to be flown at half-staff in her honor. ''Mary Goodhue was a dedicated public servant who had a long and distinguished career and contributed much to the greatness of our state, and particularly to Westchester and the Hudson Valley region,'' he said.         Mrs. Goodhue, who was born in London in 1921, became an American citizen as a child. She graduated from Vassar College and earned her law degree from the University of Michigan. As a lawyer, she worked for several firms and at the New York State Crime Commission from 1951 to 1953. She founded her own firm -- Goodhue, Arons & Neary, based in Mount Kisco, N.Y. -- and worked there until 2002.         In the Senate, Mrs. Goodhue, the chairwoman of the committee on child care, investigated violations at day care centers, delved into minutia of the state's complex school financing formulas, and introduced legislation regulating surrogate mothers.         Mrs. Goodhue was married for 42 years to Francis A. Goodhue Jr., who died in 1990. She is survived by her son, of Bedford, and three grandchildren.         Correction:  April 3, 2004, Saturday  An obituary of former New York State Senator Mary B. Goodhue on March 26 misstated the name of the her law firm at its founding; it was Goodhue & Lange. (It later became Goodhue, Arons & Neary; it is now Arons & Neary.)       
         THE ''puppet'' scuttlebutt -- that her latest career move has strings attached and that she's not the person pulling them -- rankles Louise Mirrer. Hence that furrow in the brow of the otherwise self-possessed president of the New-York Historical Society, who is inaugurating her tenure with a $5 million blockbuster exhibition on Alexander Hamilton, a founding father hitherto best known for decorating $10 bills with his somber visage.         According to some historians, Ms. Mirrer is allowing conservative board members to push the society into showcasing national history at the expense of the city's, and kicking it all off with a tribute to Hamilton, a conservative icon. But according to her, Hamilton is underappreciated, and she is getting a bum rap for steering the society from venerable stagnation into 21st-century relevance.         ''For one thing, the people doing the complaining are not the decision-makers at this institution,'' she says, spoiling the hush in her third-floor office. ''The society was too narrowly focused. Really, the new mission is like the old mission. The original mission 200 years ago was to focus in all ways possible on American history first, and then on history in New York State.''         Her books (she was a medievalist in her academic days) are not yet unpacked, but the Oriental carpet and artwork -- including a Klimt-inspired portrait of Ms. Mirrer's ''inner spirit'' by a Dominican artist, Jorge Severino, who painted her as a white-gowned and regal black woman -- lend a rich ambience. ''Maybe it's my ego, but I don't want to preside over an institution that puts on exhibitions that have limited popular appeal,'' she says. ''If there's a small exhibit that has merit, fine, do it somewhere, but not on Central Park West! I personally would not want to see this institution become an inconsequential institution.''         Next up after Hamilton, she's mounting another blockbuster, ''From Bondage to Freedom,'' a $2 million overhauled version of the society's original $50,000 exhibition on slavery, which did not, in her opinion, make enough of an impression. No pizzazz. No revelatory narrative.         Next February she has planned an Audubon exhibition for birders, and others, to die for: taxidermy, artwork, avian surround-sound. Then there's a First Ladies exhibition that will -- listen up, critics of Ms. Mirrer's ''big picture'' machinations -- be New York City-centric. Her board, she admits, smiled benevolently about the Audubon show and has not yet signed off on First Ladies. But she is confident they will. ''This is not a fractured board,'' she notes, a touch defensively.         With full panache intact at 51 -- her black skirt is short, her patent heels are high, her blue Hermès scarf is, like that 600-pound granite gargoyle on a corner pedestal, a gift from colleagues at the City University of New York, where she was executive vice chancellor -- Ms. Mirrer is an avowed fan of blockbusters on a national scale. This is no time, she says, for the society to do the museum equivalent of contemplating its navel, or the city's, though the focus on the latter was an inarguable strength of her predecessor, Kenneth T. Jackson, a Columbia University historian.         But she is adamant that the society is not compromising its integrity by supporting a blockbuster-friendly agenda endorsed by two deep-pocketed additions to its board, Richard Gilder and Lewis E. Lehrman, both Republicans. And she insists that the loan to the society of historic documents owned by Mr. Lehrman and Mr. Gilder -- a co-chairman of the search committee that recruited her -- has not unduly influenced curatorial decisions. Sure, she wants their documents at her institution, especially after $1 million was spent on a vault for them. But the entire board, she says, endorsed the Hamilton exhibit: the proof is the $5 million raised for it since her arrival in June.         THE exhibition will sponsor a few private receptions during the Republican National Convention before opening to the public, but Ms. Mirrer denies that the society's agenda is partisan: ''I don't see this as a place that nurtures one view of history at the expense of another,'' she says. Translation: Mr. Gilder is not controlling policy.         Besides, Ms. Mirrer, unlike her benefactor, is a Democrat. ''I don't think he even knows,'' she says.         She grew up in Great Neck, on Long Island, where her father was an internist and her mother a historian and educator. Even her grandmother was a college graduate. Ms. Mirrer was a pre-med major at the University of Pennsylvania until a curriculum requirement -- a history course -- changed her trajectory. On her mother's advice, she opted for a medieval history course, then switched academic gears. She received a linguistics degree from Cambridge and a doctorate at Stanford and came to CUNY, where she supervised a revamping of the admissions policy, from the University of Minnesota. Her second marriage, to the University of California, Los Angeles, sociologist, David Halle, is on commuter terms: neither wished to become ''a faculty spouse.''         She lives on Beekman Place with two of her three children -- both attend public schools -- and, despite seeing her husband only on weekends, makes time for Saturday-morning tennis with another female executive, Kathryn Wylde, who heads the Partnership for New York City.         So they're doubles partners? Ms. Mirrer frowns. ''Singles; we're way too competitive for doubles.''         PUBLIC LIVES
