        Peggy van Praagh, an English dancer, ballet mistress and teacher, died in Melbourne, Australia, on Jan. 15. She was 79 years old and had been in poor health for several years.         Peggy van Praagh, an English dancer, ballet mistress and teacher, died in Melbourne, Australia, on Jan. 15. She was 79 years old and had been in poor health for several years.         Miss van Praagh, who was born in London, trained in ballet, mime and modern dance with Margaret Craske, Lydia Sokolova, Vera Volkova and Agnes de Mille, among others. As a soloist with the Ballet Rambert from 1933 to 1938 and a principal dancer with Antony Tudor's London Ballet in 1938, she created important roles in some of Mr. Tudor's signature works, including Episode in His Past in ''Lilac Garden'' and the Russian Ballerina in ''Gala Performance.''         Miss van Praagh inaugurated the popular wartime Lunch-Hour Ballet in London in 1940. She joined the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet the following year, and was appointed ballet mistress of the junior company, the Sadler's Wells Theater Ballet, in 1946, serving as its assistant director from 1951 to 1955. She also was ballet producer for British Broadcasting Corporation Television from 1949 to 1955.         Invited to take over the artistic direction of the Borovansky Ballet in Australia, she made a curtain speech urging national support for Australian ballet and was asked to head the newly reorganized Australian Ballet, which she directed from 1962 to 1974.         Miss van Praagh was the author of ''How I Became a Dancer'' and, with Peter Brinson, of the influential book ''The Art of Choreography'' (1963). She was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1966 and a Dame of the British Empire in 1970.       
        Jane Yockel, an arts administrator known for her support of avant-garde dance, theater and music, died of a heart attack on Jan. 31. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Jane Yockel, an arts administrator known for her support of avant-garde dance, theater and music, died of a heart attack on Jan. 31. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Yockel was born in Cuba, N.Y., and received degrees in English literature from the University of Indiana and Columbia University. She was the controller of the Brooklyn Academy of Music from 1968 to 1971, when she helped to found Art Services, a management agency whose clients have included John Cage, Joseph Chaikin, Richard Foreman, Philip Glass, Trisha Brown and Lucinda Childs.         Ms. Yockel served on the boards of the Byrd Hoffman Foundation, the Technical Assistance Group and the Wooster Group. At the time of her death, she was a director of Art Services.         She is survived by a sister, Molly Henderson, of Norwood, Mass., and a brother, Judson Moak, of Ocala, Fla.       
        Maria Gambarelli Fenton, who was prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet and headed the bills that opened the Capital and Roxy theaters and Radio City Music Hall, died after a cerebral hemorrhage on Sunday at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, L.I. She was 89 years old.         Maria Gambarelli Fenton, who was prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet and headed the bills that opened the Capital and Roxy theaters and Radio City Music Hall, died after a cerebral hemorrhage on Sunday at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, L.I. She was 89 years old.         The Italian-born Miss Gambarelli came to New York with her family and began her training at the age of 7 at Metropolitan Opera's ballet school. She had previously auditioned for the prima ballerina Anna Pavlova, who told the child that she had no technique but sufficient grace to become a great dancer.         Miss Gambarelli made her stage debut as an Ethiopian slave child in ''Aida'' at the Metropolitan, where, at age 13, she became the understudy to prima ballerina Rosina Galli. ''My goal was to be the youngest prima ballerina in America,'' she said in a 1988 interview in The New York Times. ''To set that record, I'd have to do it before I was 14. But Galli was mean. She never let me go on for her.''         She left the Metropolitan the following year, when she was invited by Samuel (Roxy) Rothafel, the theatrical impresario, to dance at the Capitol Theater in shows that accompanied films. Her name shortened to ''Gamby'' by Mr. Rothafel, she also starred in ''Roxy's Gang,'' a hit radio show in the 1920's, on which she sang and became known nationally for the ''Gamby giggle.'' Miss Gambarelli also directed ''Gamby's Girls,'' a troupe of 16 precision ballet dancers who she said were the genesis of the Roxyettes, later the Rockettes.         Miss Gambarelli then went to Hollywood to perform in ballets and in three films: ''Here's to Romance,'' ''Hooray for Love'' and ''Santa Barbara Fiesta.'' There she married Edward Fenton, a screenwriter.         Miss Gambarelli was prima ballerina of the Metropolitan from 1939 to 1941. She was known for her gift for pantomime, her expressive arms and hands, and her blond movie-star looks. She also choreographed and directed a dance company that made extensive tours of the United States and Canada, and she appeared in occasional television commercials into her 80's.         ''During my time, even if I danced in movie theaters, I made people, the everyday American public, love the dance,'' Miss Gambarelli said in 1988. ''We taught them about the ballet.'' She is survived by her husband.       
        Margaret Craske, a leading ballet teacher in England and the United States, died on Sunday at Grand Strand General Hospital in Myrtle Beach, S.C. She was 97 years old.  A pupil of Enrico Cecchetti, the great Italian ballet pedagogue, Miss Craske danced for a short time with the Diaghilev Ballets Russes and toured with Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, in a small group that performed in English variety theaters during the 1920's.         Margaret Craske, a leading ballet teacher in England and the United States, died on Sunday at Grand Strand General Hospital in Myrtle Beach, S.C. She was 97 years old.  A pupil of Enrico Cecchetti, the great Italian ballet pedagogue, Miss Craske danced for a short time with the Diaghilev Ballets Russes and toured with Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, in a small group that performed in English variety theaters during the 1920's. She had her own studio in London, where she was ballet mistress for the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet and conducted examinations for the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing. She left for New York when, at the suggestion of the choreographer Antony Tudor, American Ballet Theater invited her to become the company's ballet mistress and teacher in 1946.         When Ballet Theater and the Metropolitan Opera House collaborated to open a school at the Metropolitan in 1950, she remained there to teach. It later became the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School, and Miss Craske became its director during her nearly-20-year association with the school. She left in 1968 to become ballet mistress of the Manhattan Festival Ballet. She also taught at Juilliard School and the Manhattan School of Dance, and for many summers at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival. She continued to teach at Manhattan School into her 90's. Among her students were Melissa Hayden, Hugh Laing, Nora Kaye, Carmen Mathe, Paul Taylor and Sallie Wilson.         Injury Ended Performing         Miss Craske was born in Norfolk, England. She began her professional career dancing in music halls. Serge Diaghilev chose her for his company in 1920 after seeing her in a class taught by Cecchetti. When a serious foot injury forced her to stop performing, Cecchetti asked her to help him teach at his London studio. In 1931, she set off for India to study with Meher Baba, an Indian guru. She remained with him for seven years and continued as a disciple for the rest of her life.         An austere, private woman with a sense of humor, Miss Craske was an extremely popular teacher who was known for the consistency and clarity of classes in which she would sometimes spend hours on a single step. ''She was a tiny woman - maybe all of five feet tall - with little feet in pink ballet slippers,'' a student, Nancy Reed, told Klasina VanderWerse for a 1983 feature on Miss Craske in Ballet News. ''She'd wear bell-bottomed trousers to teach in, and her feet would dart out of the trousers like hummingbirds, the pants flapping.''         Like Cecchetti, Miss Craske stressed exact technique and attention to detail in her teaching, emphasizing balance and encouraging her students to pay attention to the quality of movement and the anatomical and physiological workings of the body.         Friendly Competitiveness         Miss Craske was thought by many to have influenced Tudor's choreographic style, though she herself dismissed the notion. She and Tudor ''nipped'' at each other's teaching, as one student put it, as colleagues at the Metropolitan, with Tudor sometimes teaching students wild variations on the strict steps and gestures she had taught them the day before.         Like Tudor, however, she believed that movement must ''mean something,'' as she put it. ''There is no room in the world for dancers running around and around the stage and then kicking their right ear,'' she said in a 1983 interview. ''That doesn't mean a thing.''         Miss Craske retired from teaching in 1986, moving to Myrtle Beach, where she had served as a director of the Meher Spiritual Center for 11 years.         She was the author of two standard references on the Cecchetti technique: ''The Theory and Practice of Allegro in Classical Ballet,'' written with C. W. Beaumont in 1950, and ''The Theory and Practice of Advanced Allegro in Classical Ballet,'' written with Derra de Moroda in 1956. She also wrote ''The Dance of Love,'' published in 1980, and the recent ''Still Dancing with Love,'' a journal of her work with Meher Baba.       
        Dorothy Spence Illson, a retired editor at Life and Fortune magazines, died of cancer on Tuesday at New Rochelle (N.Y.) Hospital Medical Center. She was 70 years old and lived in New Rochelle.         Dorothy Spence Illson, a retired editor at Life and Fortune magazines, died of cancer on Tuesday at New Rochelle (N.Y.) Hospital Medical Center. She was 70 years old and lived in New Rochelle.         Mrs. Illson joined Life magazine in 1947 and became chief of the copy room in 1972. She moved to Fortune magazine the next year, where she was instrumental in its conversion to electronic typesetting and publication every two weeks in 1978. She retired in 1986.         She was a graduate of Simpson College. She served with the Red Cross in the Pacific in World War II, and was a copy editor for Dance magazine before joining Life.         She is survived by her husband, Murray, a former reporter for The New York Times; three sons, Richard, of Lakewood, Ohio, James, of Seattle, and John, of Lakewood, Colo., and a brother, Dexter Spence of Roswell, Ga.       
        Anne Tonetti Gugler, a Broadway actress and dancer who was a founding resident of an enclave of actors and artists in Rockland County, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday at her home in Orangetown, N.Y. She was 87 years old.         Anne Tonetti Gugler, a Broadway actress and dancer who was a founding resident of an enclave of actors and artists in Rockland County, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday at her home in Orangetown, N.Y. She was 87 years old.         In her late teens, she took a leave from high school to dance with Isadora Duncan's troupe in Europe. In the 1920's, she had minor roles on Broadway in ''The Green Hat'' and ''Saturday's Children.''         She left acting to pursue a career in real estate and cultivate her native hamlet of Sneden's Landing in Orangetown, overlooking the Hudson River, as a community of artists, writers and actors. Mrs. Gugler was following in the steps of her mother, an artist, who acquired almost two dozen homes in the secluded hamlet around the turn of the century and sought out poets, actors and musicians as tenants.         Sneden's Landing eventually became a haven for artistic celebrities, including Noel Coward, Laurence Olivier, Ethel Barrymore, Katharine Cornell and E. B. White. Today, the actors Bill Murray and William Hurt own homes there, as does Mikhail Baryshnikov.         Mrs. Gugler's husband, the architect Eric Gugler, died in 1974. She is survived by a sister, Alexandra, of Santa Barbara, Calif.       
        Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Miss Goddard, a Hollywood star of the 1930's, 40's and 50's, was also publicized for her friendships with many notable figures; her marriages to Charles Chaplin, Burgess Meredith and Erich Maria Remarque, and her glamorous life style.         The actress, a former fashion model and showgirl, made her first major screen appearance in 1936 as a waterfront waif befriended by a forsaken assembly-line worker (played by Chaplin) in ''Modern Times,'' the last silent comedy feature.         Hollywood quickly took notice, and Miss Goddard earned leading comedy roles as an adventuress in ''The Young in Heart,'' as a battling wife seeking a Reno divorce in ''The Women,'' and as Bob Hope's pert romantic foil in ''The Cat and the Canary'' and ''The Ghost Breakers.''         Other early roles included a put-upon laundress in Mr. Chaplin's ''Great Dictator'' (1940); Fred Astaire's partner in ''Second Chorus'' (1941), in which she gamely struggled to keep up with him in the dance ''I Ain't Hep to That Step, But I'll Dig It,'' and a lusty Southern belle singing a suggestive sea chanty to a party of prudes in the 1942 adventure ''Reap the Wild Wind.''         Runner-Up for Scarlett         The last of these roles was a consolation prize for the major disappointment of her acting career: losing the coveted part of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh in the final round of the ''Gone With the Wind'' competition. At the time Miss Goddard said she ''cried her eyes out,'' but years later she said she recalled the episode as only ''like a game.''         Miss Goddard, an energetic and articulate woman, was a close friend of a wide range of artists, including the composer George Gershwin, the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera and the artist Andy Warhol. She was wealthy, both from her Hollywood salaries and her husbands, but in later years she sold many costly artworks at auction, including her collection of Impressionist art, which was sold in 1979 for $2.9 million.         At the time, she said her reason for selling was no secret. ''It's because I don't want the responsibility any longer for this movable feast,'' she said, explaining that she was tired of carting the art from Switzerland to California and New York when she changed residences. Coincidentally, more than 20 items in her extensive jewelry collection are being sold today as part of an auction at Sotheby's in New York.         Tributes for Giving and Acting         The actress was known for her philanthropies as well as her art and gems. In the last 12 years, she awarded more than $3 million in scholarships to 300 theater and film students at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. She had previously given the university the diaries, manuscripts and personal library of Remarque, who died in 1970. In a statement yesterday, John Brademas, the university's president, hailed the ''vision and continued generosity'' of ''this remarkable actress.''         Miss Goddard's acting also inspired tributes. The writer Robert Benchley praised her as ''a woman who could charm a rock,'' and Ray Milland, a frequent co-star, hailed her as ''the most honest actress I ever knew; she gave it all she had.''         A celebrated Goddard role was a witty social-climber in ''The Diary of a Chambermaid,'' directed in 1946 by Jean Renoir. She said she preferred such roles to ''sweet, boring'' parts and that moviegoers also favored ''adventuruous characters because 90 percent of the public is good.'' When an interviewer called her glamorous, she defined glamour as ''a spell of charm,'' adding: ''I don't want to be a phony. I want to be real.''         The actress could also be blunt. When several of her friends were accused of being Communists by members of Congress in 1947, she remarked, ''If anyone accuses me of being a Communist, I'll hit them with my diamond bracelets.''         Powers Model and Ziegfeld Girl         Paulette Goddard was born Marion Levy in Great Neck, L.I., on June 3, 1911, according to major film refererence works. However, news agencies yesterday quoted municipal employees in Ronco as giving her birth year of record as 1905. Her parents separated in her childhood, and she later chose her mother's maiden name, Goddard.         She left school early and became a Powers model and then a Ziegfeld Girl. She was briefly married to Edgar W. James, a lumber industrialist, and soon sought fame in Hollywood. She played a series of chorus and other bit parts, joined the Hal Roach stock company and met Mr. Chaplin, from whom she became inseparable.         Miss Goddard's later film roles included ''North West Mounted Police'' (1940), ''Nothing But the Truth'' (1941), ''So Proudly We Hail'' (1943), ''Kitty'' (1946), ''Unconquered'' (1947) and ''Anna Lucasta'' (1949).         Her roles in the 1950's were disappointing, and, except for a 1964 Italian film, ''Time of Indifference,'' she lived in retirement with Mr. Remarque from the time of her marriage to the novelist in 1958 until his death. Her other marriges ended in divorce.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Lotte Jacobi, a fourth-generation photographer who fled Nazi Germany in 1935 and won fame with her sensitive portraits of scientists, statesmen and luminaries in the arts, died of pneumonia on Sunday in the Havenwood Nursing Home in Concord, N.H. She was 93 years old and lived in Deering, N.H.         Lotte Jacobi, a fourth-generation photographer who fled Nazi Germany in 1935 and won fame with her sensitive portraits of scientists, statesmen and luminaries in the arts, died of pneumonia on Sunday in the Havenwood Nursing Home in Concord, N.H. She was 93 years old and lived in Deering, N.H.         In 1979, when she was 83 and was being honored in an exhibition of 10 outstanding 20th-century female photographers, she told an interviewer: ''If it had come 20 years ago, I might have been able to appreciate it. Now it's a strain. I have too much else to do.''         Mrs. Jacobi made her portraits in Germany and the United States over six decades. Her subjects included Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, the Soviet director Konstantin Stanislavsky, the theologian and philosopher Martin Buber, the actor and singer Paul Robeson, the poets Marianne Moore, W. H. Auden and Robert Frost, the cellist Pablo Casals, and the writers W. E. B. DuBois and Thomas Mann.         Miss Jacobi's portrait of the writer Theodore Dreiser is currently on exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, which has several Jacobi portraits in its collection, as do other museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York.         Fourth Generation in the Art         Though best known for her portraits, between 1946 and 1955 she made a notable series of photo abstractions called ''Photogenics,'' experiments with light and shadow. She also photographed street scenes in New York, nature scenes in New Hampshire, and people and landscapes in the Soviet Union, Central Asia and her native Germany.         Miss Jacobi was born in Thorn, West Prussia. Her great-grandfather, Samuel Jacobi, learned photography from Louis Daguerre, who gave his name to an early picture-making process. Her grandfather and father took up the camera in turn, and as a beginner she was encouraged to start out by making her own camera.         In Berlin she eventually specialized, photographing personalities in the arts, theater and dance. She moved to New York in 1935 and opened a studio with her sister, Ruth. She moved to Deering in 1955 and continued working actively through the 1970's. In 1981 she donated her archives, consisting of 47,000 negatives, to the University of New Hampshire.         She is survived by her sister, Ruth, who lives in a nursing home in Mission Viejo, Calif.       
        Jean Marie Gee, a dance teacher and ballerina who created the title role in Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Pomona,'' died on April 18 at the M. B. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She was 87 years old.         Jean Marie Gee, a dance teacher and ballerina who created the title role in Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Pomona,'' died on April 18 at the M. B. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Gee, born in Chicago, was trained there as a child with Mabel Wentworth, and later with Andreas Pavley and Serge Oukrainsky, the ballet master of the Chicago Opera, who renamed her Anna Ludmila. She performed in New York City as a teen-ager, then became the prima ballerina of the Chicago Opera.         Mrs. Gee danced in the premiere of ''Pomona'' at the company's first performance, in 1930. ''Few things have given me such satisfaction as your performance in this ballet,'' Ashton wrote her.         An injury forced her to retire in 1933. Her first marriage, to Jack Broderick, ended in divorce, and she married Howard Gee and moved with him to the Panama Canal Zone in 1945. She was named director of the ballet department at the National School of Dance in Panama City three years later. In 1967, she moved to College Station, Tex., where she continued to teach ballet.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Patricia Dunn, a dancer who was one of the original members of Jerome Robbins's Ballets U.S.A., died of lung cancer on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 years old.         Patricia Dunn, a dancer who was one of the original members of Jerome Robbins's Ballets U.S.A., died of lung cancer on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 years old.         Mr. Robbins described Miss Dunn yesterday as a ''very, very special dancer,'' adding that she had been outstanding earlier in choreography by Jack Cole, considered the major pioneer of jazz dance in musicals.         Born in Los Angeles, Miss Dunn grew up and studied dance in San Francisco. She made her debut with the San Francisco Ballet in 1948. In 1950 she appeared in ''Of All Things,'' a Los Angeles revue choreographed by Eugene Loring. That same year she toured with the Jack Cole Dance Group - a company that also included Gwen Verdon - and appeared with it in the movie ''On the Riviera.'' She danced for Mr. Cole on Broadway in such musicals as ''Kismet'' (1953), ''Jamaica'' (1957) and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' (1963). She also appeared in the film version of ''Kismet.''         Miss Dunn joined Ballets U.S.A., Mr. Robbins's touring company, at its inception in 1958, when it appeared at the Spoleto Festival in Italy and the World's Fair in Brussels. Remaining with it until it disbanded three years later, she created roles in such major Robbins ballets as ''New York Export: Opus Jazz'' and ''The Concert.''         She is survived by her husband, Ronald J. Lehrman.         A service is to be held on Wednesday at 6:30 P.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, near 81st Street.       
        Edna McRae, a Chicago ballet teacher who received national recognition as a trainer of young dancers, died Thursday in a residence for the elderly in Evanston, Ill. She was 88 years old.         Edna McRae, a Chicago ballet teacher who received national recognition as a trainer of young dancers, died Thursday in a residence for the elderly in Evanston, Ill. She was 88 years old.         Miss McRae was one of several teachers and choreographers who, from the 1920's to the early 1960's, helped make Chicago a major ballet center, one that, in the 20's and 30's, occasionally rivaled New York City in importance.         Miss McRae was much admired as a teacher by Robert Joffrey, who placed her in charge of his company's West Coast scholarship courses and invited her to be guest teacher at his New York school.         Was Trained in Many Forms         She was born in Chicago and attended the Chicago Normal School of Physical Education. She studied ballet with, and danced in the companies of, such prominent Chicago teachers as Andreas Pavley, Serge Oukrainsky and Adolph Bolm.         She also studied ballet in New York, Paris and London and, like many dancers and teachers of her time, was trained in such varied forms as Spanish and tap dance. She opened her own Chicago school in 1925. Until Miss McRae retired from regular teaching in 1964, her school was one of the places where touring dancers would take class when they were appearing in Chicago.         She is survived by a niece.       
        Evelyn Klein Spitalny, a violinist who was the concertmaster in Phil Spitalny's All-Girl Orchestra, died on Sunday at a hospital in Miami Beach. She was 79 years old and died of heart failure, said the executor of her estate, Barton S. Goldberg.         Evelyn Klein Spitalny, a violinist who was the concertmaster in Phil Spitalny's All-Girl Orchestra, died on Sunday at a hospital in Miami Beach. She was 79 years old and died of heart failure, said the executor of her estate, Barton S. Goldberg.         Mrs. Spitalny was born in New York City. She graduated with honors from the Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School, in the early 1930's, and she was a fellowship student at the Institute's graduate school. She joined the Spitalny All-Girl Orchestra while still pursuing a solo career, making a Carnegie Hall debut in 1937. She married Mr. Spitalny in 1945.         As concertmaster of the orchestra, she received top billing as Evelyn and Her Magic Violin, both in the group's live performances and on its radio show, ''The Hour of Charm.'' The orchestra was active until Mr. Spitalny retired in 1955. Mrs. Spitalny also collaborated with her husband in writing several songs, including ''Save the Last Dance for Me'' and ''Pining for You.''         There are no survivors.       
        Laura Perls, a founder of the Gestalt school of psychotherapy, died Friday in Pforzheim, West Germany. She was 84 years old.         Laura Perls, a founder of the Gestalt school of psychotherapy, died Friday in Pforzheim, West Germany. She was 84 years old.         She died of complications from a thyroid condition, said Daniel Rosenblatt, a Gestalt therapist in Manhattan who was a close friend.         In the late 1940's and 1950's, Mrs. Perls collaborated with her husband, Fritz Perls, to develop the theory and technique of Gestalt therapy. The therapy is an eclectic blend borrowing from such sources as the work of Freud and Wilhelm Reich, psychodrama, existentialism and a German theory of perception of the 1930's called gestalt.         Fritz Perls, a psychiatrist, was the better-known and more flamboyant of the pair, acting as teacher in residence at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, Calif., during the 1960's heyday of the human potential movement it expounded, and traveling the world to train therapists. He died in 1970.         A Turn to the Present         But among many Gestalt therapists, Laura Perls was seen as the mainstay of the movement, heading the major Gestalt training institute in New York City for almost 40 years, and an unacknowledged contributor to the early books by her husband that formulated the approach.         Gestalt therapy was one of the first psychotherapies to break with the traditional methods of psychoanalysis, which focused on the traumas of early life, and turn the focus on a person's emotions and perceptions at the present.         While the method met with intense opposition and criticism from analysts in its early days, Gestalt therapy is now recognized as a major approach to treating emotional problems, and its methods are widely employed even among therapists of other schools.         Some techniques that Gestalt therapists use derive from theater and movement. For instance, the therapy holds that each element in a patient's dream symbolizes an aspect of the self. In one technique, someone who dreamed about talking to a cigar-smoking conductor on a train might enact being, in turn, the cigar, the conductor and even the train.         Laura Perls, whose given name was Lore Posner, was born in 1905, the daughter of a prosperous merchant, in Pforzheim. She had returned to her birthplace earlier this year to be near her daughter, Renate Perls.         Studied With Theologians         As a student in Germany, Mrs. Perls took courses with the theologians Paul Tillich and Martin Buber and studied the work of the psychologists who had formed a new gestalt school, though not a method of treatment. These psychologists included Kurt Goldstein. A student of movement and dance as well as an accomplished pianist, Mrs. Perls became a psychoanalyst in Germany.         But she shared with her husband a dissatisfaction with Freudian orthodoxy that led them to the innovations that developed into Gestalt therapy. Many of the early developments have been attributed to her, including having the patient sit up and face the therapist rather than lying down as is traditional in psychoanalysis.         Laura and Fritz Perls met as students in Frankfurt and were married in 1930. They left Germany for South Africa in 1933 to escape the rise of fascism. Coming to America in 1948, they settled in New York City, where they founded the New York Institute for Gestalt Therapy in 1952. Mrs. Perls headed the institute until recent years.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Perls is survived by a son, Dr. Stephen R. Perls, a psychologist in Albuquerque, N.M.; a brother, Robert Posner, of Providence, R.I.; four grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.       
        Fredrika Blair-Hastings, author of a 1986 biography of the dancer Isadora Duncan, died on July 1. She was 71 years old and lived in Carmel, Calif.         Fredrika Blair-Hastings, author of a 1986 biography of the dancer Isadora Duncan, died on July 1. She was 71 years old and lived in Carmel, Calif.         The cause of death was cancer, a family friend, Jeremiah Newton, said.         Born in New York City, Mrs. Blair-Hastings was a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville. She began work on the Duncan biography, titled ''Isadora, Portrait of the Artist as a Woman,'' in the 1950's. During the next decade she produced a dance documentary starring Anna Duncan, Julia Levien and Hortense Kooluris, all exponents of Duncan dance.         Mrs. Blair-Hastings is survived by her husband, Jerome Hastings, and a sister, Helen Votichenko, of Scotsdale, Ariz.       
        Dr. Margaret Brown, a former president of the Panzer College of Physical Education and Hygiene in East Orange, N.J., died on Monday at the Hospital Center at Orange. She was 98 years old and lived in Maplewood, N.J.         Dr. Margaret Brown, a former president of the Panzer College of Physical Education and Hygiene in East Orange, N.J., died on Monday at the Hospital Center at Orange. She was 98 years old and lived in Maplewood, N.J.         Dr. Brown was dean of Panzer College, now part of Montclair State College, from 1921 to 1932, when she became president and a professor of education. She held those posts until she retired in 1958.         Earlier, she taught physical education in the Montreal public schools and in the 1920's, taught in the New Jersey State teacher-training summer school at Newton, N.J., and at Rutgers University.         Dr. Brown was a judge of gymnastics at the London Olympic Games and a delegate to the 1938 World Gymnastic Championships.         She was president of the New Jersey Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance in 1948 and president of the New Jersey Association of Colleges and Universities in 1950.         She was born in St. Lambert, Quebec, and graduated from Rutgers University, where she also received an M.A. She received a Ph.D. in higher education from New York University.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, had accompanied her to the hospital.         The singer left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had a fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in-promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century by the languorous sexuality of her throaty voice as well as by the directness of her personality. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical ''Hello Dolly!,'' which she played on Broadway from 1967 to 1969.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' Miss Bailey once remarked in attempting to describe herself. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune.''         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.''         Criticism on All-Black Casting         Miss Bailey was equally straightforward with those who criticized her because the cast of her ''Hello, Dolly!'' was all black. ''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job? What is good for the Negro? What is good for the Negro is good for everyman. Every man has a place in this world, but no man has a right to designate that place.''         Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''         Part Indian Ancestry         Pearl Mae Bailey was born on March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Va., the youngest of four children of black and Creek Indian ancestry. Miss Bailey's parents were divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried and moved to Philadelphia.         Her only brother, Willie, was a tap-dancing protege of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and performed for a time as Bill Bailey. He once chased her from the theater where he was rehearsing, and to get back at him, Miss Bailey, at 15, entered an amateur contest. She sang ''Poor Butterfly'' and ''Talk of the Town'' and did a tap dance, and won first prize.         For several winters she worked for $15 a week and tips as a singer and dancer in small clubs in the coal-mining section of Pennsylvania. One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.''         Won Award in 1946         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.'' She won the Donaldson Award as the most promising new performer of 1946 for her performance. Later Broadway roles included ''Arms and the Girl,'' ''Bless You All'' and ''House of Flowers.''         In addition to ''Carmen Jones'' and ''Porgy and Bess,'' she appeared in the films ''Variety Girl,'' ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''Father's Day,'' ''That Certain Feeling'' and ''St. Louis Blues.''         From 1946 on she was a top attraction in night clubs and variety houses and on television in the United States and Britain. Her act changed relatively little from year to year, and always retained some early successes, including ''From Mouton to Muskrat to Mink'' -a perennial favorite.         Miss Bailey's received a special Tony Award in 1968 for her performance in ''Helly, Dolly!''         Besides Mr. Bellson, Miss Bailey is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee, both of Los Angeles, and by two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, both of Philadelphia.         Correction:  August 25, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary of Pearl Bailey in some editions last Saturday and some on Sunday referred incompletely to her co-stars in the Broadway musical ''Hello, Dolly!,'' and a correction in this space on Tuesday misidentified the actor with whom she first performed the role. Cab Calloway starred with Miss Bailey in a 1967 staging of the musical, and Billy Daniels appeared with her in a 1975 revival.

A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         In a stage career that began in 1933 when she won first prize at an amateur night in Philadelphia and reached a peak with her 1967 starring role on Broadway in an all-black version of the musical ''Hello, Dolly!'' with Cab Calloway, Miss Bailey said she thought of herself as a singer and not an actress.         'I Tell Stories to Music'         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' she told an interviewer some years ago. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune. I laugh at people who call me an actress.''         Her trademark was a warm, lusty singing voice accompanied by an easy smile and elegant gestures that charmed audiences and translated smoothly from the nightclub stage and Broadway to film and television.         On stage her ample figure, often swathed in fur and sparkling with rhinestones and jewels, was a magnet for audience attention as she tossed off a ballad in throwaway style.         ''I've lost one of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life,'' Mr. Calloway said after learning of Miss Bailey's death. ''I've lost a co-worker and a wonderful person.''         Carol Channing, who had created the role of Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical three years before Miss Bailey undertook the part, said: ''The entertainment world has lost one of its most creative performers of our time. Her talent was unique and enduring.''         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, to whom she was married for 38 years and who went with her to the hospital on Friday, said simply, ''I've lost my best friend.''         The singer had left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint.

She was 61 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Louise (Mama Lu) Parks, an actress and dancer who founded the Mama Lu Parks Jazz Dancers, died on Sunday at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 61 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Ms. Parks, who had become blind as a result of diabetes, died of a heart attack that occurred while she was in the hospital, said her sister, Claudette Paul of Richmond, Va.         Ms. Parks, whose full name was Louise Parks Duncanson, founded her dance group in 1959. The company, which specialized in jitterbug and Lindy Hop dance routines, traveled extensively. On a tour of Africa, the dancers performed for Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia. Ms. Parks also performed and taught in welfare hotels.         Many of Ms. Parks's dancers came to her as children. At an early stage of their career, Hines, Hines and Dad, the dance trio with Maurice and Gregory Hines and their father, Maurice, were featured in many of Ms. Parks's programs.         Ms. Parks, a graduate of Emerson College in Boston, appeared in several films, including ''Putney Swope,'' ''Cotton Comes to Harlem,'' ''Come Back Charleston Blue'' and ''When the Spirit Moves.'' In addition to her sister, she is survived by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Parks, and a brother, William Jr., all of Boston.         Funeral services are to be held at 9:30 A.M. on Saturday at Benta's Funeral Home, 630 St. Nicholas Avenue, at 141st Street.       
        Bertha Lindsay, the last surviving eldress of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming, known as the Shaker Society, died Wednesday at her home at Shaker Village in Canterbury, N.H. She was 93 years old.         Bertha Lindsay, the last surviving eldress of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming, known as the Shaker Society, died Wednesday at her home at Shaker Village in Canterbury, N.H. She was 93 years old.         She apparently died of a stroke, said Dr. Scott Swank, director of the village.         Sister Ethel Hudson, who is 94, is now the last of a community of Shakers in Canterbury that once numbered 400 men, women and children. The community, founded in 1792, was a communal society of shared property; followers were devoted to celibacy, living simply and pacifism. The Shakers in Canterbury once owned about 4,000 acres, most of which is being preserved. About 690 acres remain, and efforts are under way to have that too remain free of development.         There is one other Shaker community in the country, in Sabbathday Lake, Me. It has four covenanted members and four others who follow the Shaker practices.         History of Sect         The Shakers, who included free-form and choreographed dance in their worship, were an offshoot of the Shaking Quakers from England. They are thought to have derived their name from a belief that shaking from religious fervor was a manifestation of inner spiritual experience.         Miss Lindsay came to Canterbury in 1905 as an orphan. She lost her sight when she was 90 years old and put her remaining energies into making audio recordings about the history of the movement. ''I want people to know we did have fun and plenty of it,'' she said in an interview.         She is survived by a niece.       
        Betty Walberg, a composer, arranger and pianist for ballet, Broadway and modern-dance choreographers, including Jerome Robbins, died Wednesday in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 69 years old.

Betty Walberg, a composer, arranger and pianist for ballet, Broadway and modern-dance choreographers, including Jerome Robbins, died Wednesday in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 69 years old. The cause of death was not disclosed. Miss Walberg, a lecturer in the division of dance at the University of California at Santa Barbara, worked on many Broadway shows. She was the dance arranger for the original productions of Mr. Robbins's ''Gypsy'' and ''Fiddler on the Roof'' and for both the Broadway and the film versions of ''West Side Story.''         As company pianist for Ballets: U.S.A., the troupe Mr. Robbins founded in 1958, she appeared on stage on Sept. 4, 1958, in the New York premiere of the revised version of ''The Concert,'' a comic work he had originally choreographed for the New York City Ballet in 1956. Ms. Walberg portrayed a long-suffering pianist who plays a Chopin recital while dancers act out their often-bizarre daydreams and fantasies.         Other Broadway shows for which she was dance arranger include ''Anyone Can Whistle,'' ''It's a Bird . . . It's a Plane . . . It's Superman,'' ''Kelly'' and ''On a Clear Day You Can See Forever.'' She also contributed arrangements to several Fred Astaire television spectaculars.         Miss Walberg, a native of Hebron, Neb., was a graduate of Bennington College. She often collaborated with modern dancers, serving as a pianist for the first American Dance Festival at Connecticut College in 1948 and for such choreographers as Martha Graham, Hanya Holm, Anna Sokolow and Martha Hill. Over the years she taught at many places, including the Juilliard School and the School of Performing Arts in New York City and the University of California at Santa Cruz, California State University at Long Beach and the University of Hawaii.         She is survived by nieces and nephews.       
         Mary Martin, America's favorite leading lady of musical comedy, as Ens. Nellie Forbush in "South Pacific," Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" or the title role in "Peter Pan," died Saturday afternoon at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 76 years old.         She died of cancer, said Richard Grant, who handles publicity for the actress's son, Larry Hagman. Miss Martin, who had been hospitalized recently at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, returned home last Tuesday.         More than any of her peers, she was what she played and she incarnated the songs that she sang. Miss Martin was "a cockeyed optimist" and she was also the eternal child imagined by James M. Barrie. Approaching 70, she was still saying, "I can't help thinking I'm 19." On stage, at least figuratively, she never stopped flying. Echoes of Poetry         In reviewing her performance in "South Pacific," Kenneth Tynan said that she reminded him of something Aldous Huxley wrote about the minor Caroline poets: "They spoke in their natural voices and it was poetry." While Ethel Merman was an entire brass section and Carol Channing was a parade, Miss Martin remained natural and exactingly true to life -- and it was poetry.         Her voice was never the strongest instrument. She was not beautiful (though she could be radiant). Through determination, pluck, charm, self-mocking humor and a profound sense of self, everything converged to create an exhilarating theater artist.         For 50 years Miss Martin projected the vitality of someone who loved her work and knew precisely how to make other people share in her happiness. As Elia Kazan, who directed her in her first Broadway starring role in "One Touch of Venus," said in his autobiography, she was "full of the love of being loved." Specialized in Long Runs         Although she made a number of films, she was devoted to the theater. She starred in relatively few Broadway shows, but the work was valuable; one could regard the actress herself as being the heyday of the Broadway musical.         She specialized in long runs and was known for not missing performances. In his autobiography, Richard Rodgers called her "an extraordinary trouper," adding, "In all the years I've known her, I have never seen her give a performance that was anything less than the best that was in her." She did have, he said, one unusual trait: "She cannot utter even the mildest form of profanity." The "strongest expression" he ever heard her use was "He's a son-of-a-bear."         If there had been a darker side to Miss Martin, she certainly kept it hidden from her public, which never failed to think of her as joyful. In her private life, she endured tragedies (including her husband's death) and on stage was prone to suffer accidents, but she never let anything interfere with the sheer delight of her performance.  A Thousand Shampoos         Repeatedly she set herself challenges, many of them physical. It was at her suggestion that Nellie Forbush literally washed that man "right out-a my hair," which meant that she shampooed her hair on stage for 1,000 performances. Originally she had planned to sing another song in "South Pacific" while cartwheeling across the stage -- until she cartwheeled right into the orchestra pit. It was also her idea to sing a song standing on her head in "Jennie," one of her less successful musicals. In rehearsal at the age of 63 in the Aleksei Arbuzov play "Do You Turn Somersaults?," she turned somersaults on stage until she fell from a revolving platform and was grounded by her doctors.         In her autobiography, "My Heart Belongs," she declared that of all her characters Peter Pan was indisputably her favorite, for a very simple reason: "Everyone else loves Peter so." She added, "Neverland is the way I would like real life to be: timeless, free, mischievous, filled with gaiety, tenderness and magic."         The key to her first Broadway success, in 1938 in the Cole Porter musical, "Leave It to Me," was her innate ability to combine innocence and insouciance. In that show she sang "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," a vintage Porter song in which almost every word has a double meaning. She played against the lines, which made them even funnier, and she did a striptease as if she was hanging up the laundry. It was often said about that song that Miss Martin did not know what she was singing until Sophie Tucker, who was also in the cast, explained the worldly, witty lyrics to her. The actress was never to lose that inbred sense of ingenuousness.  An Early Flight, A Crash Landing         From the first, Mary Virginia Martin was self-propelled. She was born in Weatherford, Tex., on Dec. 1, 1913 (although some reports placed the date one year later), the younger daughter of Preston Martin, a lawyer, and Juanita Presley Martin, a violin teacher. As one of a trio of little girls dressed as bellhops, she sang on a bandstand outside her father's courtroom. When she was 5, she sang "When Apples Grow on the Lilac Trees" at a fireman's ball. Once she tried to fly -- from the roof of a garage, without the mechanical assistance she would have later as Peter Pan -- and broke her collarbone.         Frequently she sang in churches and at clubs, and learned about show business by watching movies and imitating singers and dancers. As a young woman, she appeared with her best friend, Bessie Mae Sue Ella Yaeger, in amateur theatricals and later wondered why she had become a star and Bessie Mae had not. She decided it was because "I react to an audience.         "Give me 4 people and I'm         on         . Give me 400 and I'm a hundred times more on."         As a tribute to Bessie Mae -- and for good luck -- she worked her friend's name into many of her scripts, on stage and in films.         In her book Miss Martin recalled that Weatherford was famous for its watermelons. Long after she became a star, a sign was erected on the courthouse lawn: "Weatherford, Texas, home of watermelons and Mary Martin." Her observation: "I never got top billing in my hometown."         Nevertheless she had, she was convinced, a very happy childhood. Her parents sent her to Ward Belmont, a finishing school in Nashville. At 16, she married Benjamin Hagman, a Weatherford accountant and later a lawyer. They had one child, Larry Martin Hagman, who -- as the world knows -- became famous as J. R. on television's "Dallas."  Dancing Her Way To Hollywood         The actress's first marriage lasted only a few years, and the teen-age bride brought up her son as if he were her younger brother. Miss Martin was soon caught up in her career. At 18, she opened the Mary Hagman School of Dance in Weatherford, then went to Hollywood to study dancing and to search for a way to enter the movies. For several years she went back and forth between the two states and between teaching and performing.         The dancing school flourished (until it was destroyed by fire) while her performing career took several divergent paths. In Texas she sang on radio; in California she sang and danced in nightclubs. One evening she performed in a Sunday night talent show at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Singing "The Weekend of a Private Secretary" and an operatic number entitled "Il Bacio" in her own syncopated version, she created a sensation. To her astonishment, people stood on chairs and tables and shouted bravo. Jack Benny, who was in the audience, later told her that it was one of the most exciting moments he could remember. "In 10 minutes," she said, "my life had changed."         Another member of the audience was Lawrence Schwab, a producer who took charge of her career. In answer to the frequent question, what causes a big break, she said: "Work. Work and work and work; be ready when the break comes." As she wrote in her autobiography, "All my life I have felt guilty if I didn't use any talent I have as fully as I could."         Under Mr. Schwab's aegis, she came to New York and auditioned to fill a suddenly vacant supporting role in the forthcoming Broadway musical "Leave It to Me." The unknown actress strode into a suite in the Ritz Towers and announced that she was going to sing four songs, adding, "If I can't sing all four, I'd rather not sing." As she recalled in her book, "A man reclining on a couch said, very mildly, 'Carry on, on all fours.' " She later discovered that the philosophical man on the couch was Cole Porter, the composer of the show. Bella Spewack, co-author of the book with her husband, Sam Spewack, asked Miss Martin if she had ever been on the New York stage. She admitted that she had not, and when Mrs. Spewack asked her why she thought she could do it, she answered boldly, "Try me."         In the audition, she was called upon to read her character's dialogue. She shouted the first line, "I'd like to renew my subscription" (meaning she would like to continue having a love affair). Her straightforward, self-confident delivery brought down the house. Should she get the part, Mr. Spewack told her, she should never change the reading of the line. Throughout her career her art was founded on such intuition.  A First Casting Much Against Type         She so captivated Porter and his collaborators that she was signed, despite the fact -- or rather because of the fact -- that she was cast against type: the innocent country girl playing a kept woman, and singing a striptease showstopper, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy." Fifty years later, in 1988, as a great-grandmother, she was still singing "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," at a celebration honoring Cole Porter. In May 1990 she was scheduled to sing the song again at the 75th anniversary celebration of the Shubert Theater in New Haven, but canceled her appearance because of illness.         Her overnight success on Broadway on Nov. 9, 1938 put her on the cover of Life magazine and drew the attention of Hollywood. Under contract to Paramount, she appeared in a series of forgettable roles in forgettable films, including "The Great Victor Herbert," "Rhythm on the River," "Love Thy Neighbor," "New York Town," "Birth of the Blues," "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," "Happy Go Lucky" and "True to Life."         There was one positive result of her Hollywood experience. She met and married Richard Halliday, a story editor at Paramount. He also became her producer and closest professional adviser and the father of their daughter, Heller Halliday. If she had remained in Hollywood, she might have disappeared into the studio system, but wisdom prevailed and she returned to New York, where she became a Broadway star and remained one for the next four decades.         Her first starring role was in "One Touch of Venus," written by Kurt Weill, Ogden Nash and S. J. Perelman. To combat his wife's hesitancy about playing the title goddess, a role originally conceived for Marlene Dietrich, Mr. Halliday took her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and showed her the many interpretations of Venus in painting and sculpture. As the "Venus of Ozone Heights," who comes to life and steps down from her pedestal, she had her customary winsomeness, singing her signature song, "That's Him," simply sitting in a chair facing the audience.  The Bumpy Road To 'South Pacific'         After "One Touch of Venus," she starred in the musical "Lute Song" and in London in Noel Coward's "Pacific 1860" and toured for a year in Irving Berlin's "Annie Get Your Gun." Though Ethel Merman had played the title character, Annie Oakley, in the original production, the role -- along with the song, "Doin' What Comes Naturally" -- seemed made to measure for Miss Martin. As always, she was undeterred by the fact that she was succeeding another star (which she also did later when she took Carol Channing's "Hello, Dolly!" on tour of military bases in Vietnam).         In 1948, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d offered her the central role in "South Pacific." She was hesitant for two reasons. Disliking hospitals, she was not anxious to play the role of a nurse, and she felt insecure because her leading man would be an opera star, Ezio Pinza. When it was decided that the two would not be asked to sing a duet, she accepted the offer. Nellie Forbush, singing "Cockeyed Optimist," "Honey Bun," "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out-a My Hair" and, especially, "I'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy," became one of her greatest successes.         "South Pacific" was followed in 1954 by "Peter Pan" (her daughter was also in the cast) which she performed on Broadway and on television, live and then on tape, complete with her celebrated aerial ballet. The Broadway production ran for only 152 performances. It was largely through the taped television version (which was recently released on videocassette) that she became so identified with the role.         "Peter Pan" was an exact meeting of actress and character. As Miss Martin said, "I cannot even remember a day when I didn't want to be Peter." For years she had dreams of flying, all of which stopped just before the first television presentation of the show. Trying to explain the end of those dreams, she said, "Perhaps it was because I had experienced at last the joy of really flying." She could become almost mystical whenever she spoke about the experience, as in her statement: "I discovered I was happier in the air than on the ground. I probably always will be."  Another Character, Another Classic         In 1959, Rodgers and Hammerstein went to her again to ask her to play Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music." Though her own background could not have been more dissimilar from that of her real-life model, she -- and the audience -- felt the kinship. As she said, "We both have the same drive, utter determination." During her two years in the role, she missed only one performance.         Of her three Broadway triumphs only "Peter Pan" was to be recorded for posterity -- in the television version.In the case of both "South Pacific" and "The Sound of Music," other actresses played her role on screen (Mitzi Gaynor was Nellie and Julie Andrews was Maria von Trapp.) This meant that, except for her television appearances, especially one dynamic evening teamed with Ethel Merman, her most noteworthy performances existed only on the stage and on records.         As one sign of her own fallibility she often pointed to the fact that while accepting "South Pacific," "Peter Pan" and "The Sound of Music," she turned down the chance to be in "Oklahoma!", "Kiss Me Kate" and "My Fair Lady."         Among her other Broadway shows were the two-character musical "I Do I Do" and "Jennie." Occasionally she acted in dramas -- in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth," which she and Helen Hayes took on tour, and in "Do You Turn Somersaults?"         She and her husband owned a ranch in Brazil, Nossa Fazenda (Our Farm), next to a home owned by her friend Janet Gaynor. The Hallidays used the ranch as a vacation retreat. After her husband died in 1973, Miss Martin worked less but never fully retired. In 1981 she was a host on "Over Easy," a public television series about aging. In 1982 she was in a taxicab accident in San Francisco that took the life of her close friend Ben Washer and severely injured Miss Martin, Miss Gaynor and Miss Gaynor's husband, Paul Gregory. In 1986, fully recovered, she returned to the theater in a dramatic role, co-starring with Carol Channing in James Kirkwood's "Legends." Each portrayed an aging actress. "Legends" toured but never came to New York.         In 1989, Miss Martin returned to New York for a tribute to the television work of Richard Rodgers and to see "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," which reprised "I'm Flying" from "Peter Pan." Several months later, the 1960 television version of "Peter Pan" was shown again, with great success. Later, an illness precipitated her withdrawal from "Grovers Corners," Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's musical version of "Our Town," in which she was scheduled to play the Stage Manager. In 1989 she received a Kennedy Center Award, given annually at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Famous First Line One More Time         Some years ago she participated in a birthday tribute to Richard Rodgers at the Imperial Theater, where, decades before, she had made her Broadway debut in "Leave It to Me." For days, she worried about what she would say. When the time came, in characteristic fashion, she improvised. She walked on stage and said as loudly as she could, "I would like to renew my subscription." When she wrote about this moment in her autobiography, she commented, "That's what I would like to say, now and forever, to all audiences everywhere." Mary Martin's lifetime renewal was gratefully accepted.         Miss Martin is survived by her son, her daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York at a later date.       
         Mary Kirk, a jazz pianist, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.         Margery Elliott, a family friend, said her death was caused by complications of pulmonary cancer.         Mary Colston Kirk, a native of Denver, was a pupil there of Paul Whiteman's father. She later worked in Denver in George Morrison's dance band, where she met her husband, the band-leader Andrew Dewey (Andy) Kirk. He later led the famed Dark Clouds of Joy.         In Kansas City, her ensemble, the Mary Kirk Trio, included Paul Gunther, drummer, and Charlie Parker, saxophonist, in his first professional job.         After coming to New York with her husband, Mrs. Kirk taught music for many years.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Bernice Brown of New York.       
         Dorsha Hayes, a dancer and writer, died Tuesday at Doctors Hospital in Manhattan. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications after a stroke, said Richard N. Bentley, a cousin.         Born in Galesburg, Ill., Mrs. Hayes, whose name was originally Doris Bentley, made her debut as a dancer in 1912 in "The Daughter of Heaven," a spectacle based on a novel by Pierre Loti. A student of Ruth St. Denis, she also appeared with the Fokine Ballet and with Fred and Adele Astaire in "The Passing Show of 1918." In 1924, she and her husband, Paul Hayes, who died in 1969, founded the Theater of the Dance, whose productions combined dance and music with poetry by such authors as T. S. Eliot and William Butler Yeats.         After an attack of rheumatic fever ended her performing career in 1936, Mrs. Hayes became a writer, publishing poetry in literary magazines, articles on Jungian psychology and several novels, including "Mrs. Heaton's Daughter" (1943) and "Who Walk the Earth" (1945). She also wrote "The American Primer" (1941), a study of American democracy, and "Chicago, Crossroads of American Enterprise" (1944), a history.         There are no immediate survivors. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday at 11 A.M. at Holy Trinity Church, 316 East 88th Street.       
         Eugenia Delarova Doll, a ballerina with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and a dance and music patron, died on Thursday at New York Hospital. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Doll died of complications following surgery for a brain tumor, said Robert Fizdale, the pianist, who was a longtime friend.         Mrs. Doll, born in St. Petersburg, left the Soviet Union in 1926. The next year she performed in Paris with the Folies-Bergere, where she met Leonide Massine, the choreographer and dancer, at the stage door and soon after became his second wife. The Massines moved to New York City in 1928 and danced at the Roxy Theater until 1931.         Mrs. Doll joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1933, dancing as Eugenia Delarova. She originated character roles in several ballets choreographed by Massine, then ballet master and a choreographer and dancer with the company. Among the roles were the Flower Girl in "Gaite Parisienne."  Opened a Flower Shop         The couple were divorced in 1938. Mrs. Doll opened a flower shop on Madison Avenue and appeared on Broadway as a dancer and actress in shows like "Simple Simon" and "The Lady Comes Across." She married Henri G. Doll, an industrialist, inventor and director of research and development at Schlumberger Ltd. Their house on East 78th Street became a second home for musicians and dancers from all over the world, particularly Russian emigres, who were befriended and helped by the Dolls.         Mrs. Doll was an enthusiastic balletgoer, who recommended to Massine that he hire "a fantastic dancer" named Jerome Robbins "to do all his parts," as she later put it. Mr. and Mrs. Doll later commissioned Mr. Robbins's "Other Dances."         This year, Mrs. Doll gave a total of $3 million to American Ballet Theater, the New York City Ballet, the School of American Ballet and the American Friends of the Paris Opera and Ballet. Mrs. Doll also contributed to the Dance Theater of Harlem, the Joffrey Ballet and the companies of Paul Taylor and Alvin Ailey, as well as the American Symphony Orchestra, Carnegie Hall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the French Institute/Alliance Francaise. In 1986 she was named an Officier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government for her support of the Paris Opera Ballet.         Mrs. Doll is survived by her husband.
