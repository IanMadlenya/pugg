         Edith Haisman, the oldest survivor of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, died on Monday night at a nursing home in Southampton, England. She was 100.         Karen Kamuda, the vice president of the Titanic Historical Society, said  in a telephone interview today from Indian Orchard, Mass., that Mrs. Haisman's death left 7 of the 705 survivors still living, 3 in the United States and 2 each in Britain and France.         Mrs. Haisman, who was 15-year-old Edith Brown at the time of the sinking, was the last survivor who was a teen-ager in 1912. The ones who are still alive ranged in age from 9 weeks to 8 years old at the time of the disaster, which claimed more than 1,500 lives.         She was a guest of honor last August on a pilgrimage cruise to the spot 400 miles off the Newfoundland coast where the liner, on its maiden voyage, hit an iceberg on the night of  April 14-15, 1912.         In 1995 she took part in the opening of a memorial garden at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, with a granite monument commemorating the victims, and in 1993 she appeared in public in Southampton to receive a gold watch thought to be her father's from the head of the American company that had salvaged it from the wreckage.         She had last seen the watch protruding from the waistcoat pocket of her father, Thomas William Solomon Brown, 60, a hotel owner from Worcester, a suburb of Cape Town, South Africa. He was taking his wife, Elizabeth, and his daughter Edith to Seattle, where he intended to open a new hotel. In the hold of the cruise liner were tableware, furnishings and 1,000 rolls of bed linen for the new enterprise.         In a series of interviews in her later years and a biography, ''A Lifetime on the Titanic,'' published in 1995, Mrs. Haisman gave a vivid account of the ship's final moments, although some details have been called into question.         Mrs. Haisman said she remembered that her father was dressed in an Edwardian dinner jacket, stabbing the cold night air with his cigar and sipping from a snifter of brandy on the deck of the listing ship as she and her mother were being winched 70 feet down into a lifeboat.         Mrs. Haisman said that she never forgot the horror of that night and the loss of her father and that even in her later years she suffered nightmares in which she heard the screaming of the drowning victims in the Atlantic. It was 11:40 P.M. when she recalled being jolted in her three-berth stateroom. ''Father appeared a few minutes later,'' she recalled. ''He told us: 'You'd better put on your life jackets and something warm, it's cold on deck. It's just a precaution. We've struck an iceberg -- it's nothing much. The steward in the corridor says it's nothing to worry about.' ''         They hurried through the corridors, leaving behind in their haste her mother's jewelry case, 400 gold sovereigns and a roll of bank notes on top of a bunk. ''We waited for ages on the boat deck for someone to tell us what to do. The ship's band was playing ragtime. They played to keep our spirits up. It was so brave of them. Everybody kept saying: 'She's unsinkable. She won't go down.'         ''Father kissed us and saw us into Lifeboat 14. Up to 50 people got in as it swung perilously over the side. One man jumped into the boat dressed as a woman. As we rowed away from the ship, we could still hear the band playing, but now it was hymns.'' She watched the mighty liner go down.  ''We were almost six hours in the lifeboat and during that time we had  no water and nothing to eat. I kept wondering if my father had got off the ship -- that's all I could think of.''         She and her mother were picked up by the Cunard liner Carpathia and taken to New York, where they left on a train trip to Seattle to spend time with an aunt of Mrs. Haisman's, who lived there and had inspired the move to the West Coast. They soon returned to South Africa, where five years later Edith married Fred Haisman, a shipbuilder's engineering draftsman from London.         Married for 60 years, the couple lived in South Africa, Australia and Southampton, where Mr. Haisman worked in the boatyard. They had 10  children.         Ms. Kamuda, of the Titanic Historical Society, said Mrs. Haisman had ''elaborated'' her story over the years, adding details about what her father was wearing, for example.         ''This is not a criticism of Mrs. Haisman,'' Ms. Kamuda said. ''On the contrary it is only to point out how our memories fail us as time passes and numerous outside influences shape our lives.''         Mrs. Haisman did not share the concern of some survivors and many curators and historians over efforts to salvage mementos from the wreck and to raise parts of the ship itself. The 18-carat pocket watch that she said was her father's had been found in a purser's black leather portmanteau during a dive in 1987.         R. M. S. Titanic of Southport, Conn., the company that exhibits artifacts from the ship and that has drawn charges of exploiting the disaster from Ms. Kamuda and others, had the watch attached to a sterling silver plate inscribed with the words, ''What better use for scientific technology than to reunite a father with his child.'' The chairman of the company, George Tulloch, presented it to Mrs. Haisman in Southampton in December 1993.         By her bed in the nursing home stood a photograph of her father in a straw boater, stiff collar and bowtie.         Mrs. Haisman was born on Oct. 27, 1896. She is survived by four sons, two daughters and more than 30 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.       
         Emily Hahn, an early feminist and a prolific author who wrote 54 books and more than 200 articles for The New Yorker, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 92, said her daughter, Carola Boxer Vecchio.         Ms. Hahn was known for her writings about her adventurous life in the Far East before World War II and for her books on such diverse subjects as Africa, D. H. Lawrence and apes. (Ms. Hahn kept gibbons.) She also worked as a Hollywood screenwriter during the 1920's.         Over the course of her career, Ms. Hahn wrote about Chinese cooking, about feminism (''Once Upon a Pedestal: An Informal History of Women's Lib,'' 1974) and about diamonds (''Diamond: The Spectacular Story of Earth's Rarest Treasure and Man's Greatest Greed,'' 1956). Another work was ''The Islands: America's Imperial Adventures in the Philippines'' (1981). In her later years, Ms. Hahn wrote several books about animals, including ''Eve and the Apes'' (1988), about women who owned apes. In ''Look Who's Talking'' (1988), she examined communication between beasts, and between beasts and humans.         Emily Hahn was born in St. Louis,  where her father, Isaac Newton Hahn, was a salesman. At a time when few middle-class women had careers, she was determined to be a mining engineer. But her adviser at the University of Wisconsin told her, she once said, that the female mind was ''incapable of grasping mechanics or higher mathematics.'' That remark only hardened her resolve, and she stayed on, graduating in 1926. She is believed to be the first woman to earn a degree in mining engineering at the university. She worked for a year for the Deko Oil Company of St. Louis but grew bored with the work.         Her career as an author began in 1924, when she took a trip across the country in a Model T Ford, and her letters home so captivated her brother-in-law that he sent them to The New Yorker, which bought some of them. In 1930, her first book, ''Seductio ad Absurdum: The Principles and Practices of Seduction -- A Beginner's Handbook,'' was published.         Inspired by Charles A. Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic, Ms. Hahn decided she wanted to be ''free,'' she said, and in 1930 she embarked on a journey to Africa, where she worked in a hospital and lived with a tribe of Pygmies.         In 1935, The New Yorker hired her to be its China correspondent. China was the place, Ms. Hahn once said, that had the greatest impact on her life. She arrived during the period of the Communist revolution and the war against the Japanese, and made the acquaintance of Mao Zedong and Chou En-lai. She also became a confidante of the Soong sisters, one of whom married Sun Yat-sen, another Chiang Kai-shek, and in 1941 published ''The Soong Sisters,'' a biography.         While in China, Ms. Hahn had an affair with Sinmay Zau, an aristocratic intellectual whom she described as her ''cultural and political guide to China.'' She also spent time in opium dens, eventually becoming addicted to the drug, she said.         ''I was young and I thought it was romantic to smoke opium,'' she told The Washington Post. ''I was quite determined. It took me a year or so to become addicted, but I kept at it.'' Later, she said, ''I went to a man who hypnotized me and sure enough, I didn't want it any more.''         In Hong Kong, Ms. Hahn met Maj. Charles Boxer, a British intelligence officer in the Far East. He was already married, but they began an affair. In 1940 she became pregnant. At a time when such pregnancies were often kept secret, she chose not only to keep her baby daughter, Carola, but to proclaim her birth proudly.         Soon after their daughter's birth, Major Boxer was captured by the Japanese and put in a prison camp. For some months, Ms. Hahn brought food to him there, avoiding repatriation by claiming to be Eurasian. But fearing for the safety of her daughter, she fled Hong Kong in 1943. Major Boxer survived his captivity. Ms. Hahn married him in 1945, and they had a second child, Amanda. Ms. Hahn described her wartime romance in her 1944 book, ''China to Me: A Partial Autobiography.''         At The New Yorker, Ms. Hahn became one of the few writers to work for all four of its editors, Harold Ross, William Shawn, Robert Gottlieb and Tina Brown. She and her husband often lived an ocean apart,  with Ms. Hahn, because of British tax laws, spending no more than 91 days a year in England while Major Boxer remained at their home in Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire.         Ms. Hahn continued writing until the end of her life, including an article about Amanda's dog published this month in a British magazine. In December, Ms. Hahn had her first poem published in The New Yorker, ''Wind Blowing.''         Ms. Hahn is survived by her husband; her daughters, Carola, of  Jackson Heights, Queens, and Amanda, of London; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.         ''My younger daughter once rebuked me for not being the kind of mother one reads about,'' Ms. Hahn once told an interviewer. ''I asked her what kind that was, and she said, the kind who sits home and bakes cakes. I told her to go and find anybody who sits at home and bakes cakes.''       
         Pamela Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, a leading figure in the Democratic Party and for decades one of the most vivacious women on the international scene, died yesterday at the American Hospital in Paris of complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 76.         Mrs. Harriman, who was preparing to relinquish her post and return to Washington, suffered the hemorrhage on Monday at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, where she had gone for her usual swim.         She devoted her later years to helping to rebuild the Democratic Party in the 1980's, raising millions of dollars. She was appointed Ambassador by President Clinton in 1993, and was well regarded as a diplomat.         The President yesterday called her an ''extraordinary U.S. ambassador,'' adding, ''She was a source of judgment and inspiration to me, a source of constant good humor and charm and real friendship, and we will miss her very, very much.''         However great her accomplishments, she could never put to rest the legend of the captivating woman who snared some of the world's richest and most attractive men on two continents, marrying three of them.         Along the way she was trailed by a chorus of angry women who repeated tales of her escapades for decades.         Born in England in 1920 into an old aristocracy that no longer counted for much, she ultimately made her way into a new aristocracy of the wealthy and powerful that counted a great deal. She was 19 when she married Randolph Churchill. Within months he went off to war and she found herself at the center of London as a confidante and hostess for her new father-in-law, Winston Churchill. She called him Papa, and he reveled in her company.         Through Winston Churchill she met Max Beaverbrook, the press baron, who became her mentor; Harry Hopkins, Franklin D. Roosevelt's envoy, who became her friend, and W. Averell Harriman, the lend-lease administrator, who became her lover, and, 30 years later, her third husband.         With expenses underwritten by Mr. Harriman, she took up wartime residence in Grosvenor Square, a small parcel of London that became so filled with Americans that she remembered it as Eisenhowerplatz. There she brought prominent Americans and their British allies together for small dinners and raised eyebrows with her numerous liaisons. The most prominent among them were her London neighbor, John Hay (Jock) Whitney, who became the United States Ambassador to Britain, and Edward R. Murrow, the wartime voice of CBS in London.         After the war, divorced and the mother of a son, Winston Spencer Churchill, she moved to Paris where, with her customary energy and resourcefulness, and with the cachet and connections of the Churchill name, she established a glittering place for herself in international high society.         Later she moved on to America, where she charmed, and married, Leland Hayward, the renowned Broadway agent and producer. After Hayward's death Averell Harriman reappeared, and after a brief courtship they married and became the couple that helped reinvigorate the Democratic Party.         As a girl, Pamela Digby was peaches-and-cream pretty, but no great beauty. Taught, as were most girls of her class, that her goal was to marry well, she developed an exceptional ability to beguile men. She enveloped them in her attention, anticipated their every need and locked on them with adoring eyes that suggested genuine interest in their every word. When it was mentioned to one acquaintance that she was lacking a sense of humor, he shrugged and replied, ''Maybe, but she makes you feel you have the best sense of humor in the world.''         One of her biographers, Christopher Ogden, was beguiled himself when he described her on the night in November 1992 when she welcomed Bill Clinton, the new President she had helped to elect, to a dinner reception at her Georgetown house.         ''She looked fabulous, almost breathtaking,'' he wrote in his book ''Life of the Party.''         ''Her smile can appear too practiced but tonight it was wonderfully wise and guileless,'' he wrote. ''Her voice was low with a sexy, croacky catch.''         Not everyone agreed. Sally Bedell Smith, the author of another biography, ''Reflected Glory,'' said in 1996: ''She wanted great wealth and power. These were big ambitions for a person with little to say and no wit, but she had unflagging determination and ruthlessness.''         Mrs. Harriman was quick to deny that she had ever had an agenda. In 1996, in an interview in the Embassy residence in Paris, she said: ''My life, for me, has been free-flowing. I never thought, 'Now I'm here, I want to go there or do that.' I've taken life as it has presented itself to me.''         She bristled at the way she was characterized in the press and said she should not be faulted if the succession of men in her life happened to be rich and influential. ''Those were the people I met,'' she said. ''Everything in life, I believe, is luck and timing.''         Her first bit of luck was to be born, on March 20, 1920, to Edward Kenelm Digby, soon to become the 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, the former Constance Pamela Alice Bruce. She grew up at Minterne Magna, a 50-room stone mansion in Dorset, where despite severe financial pressures, the family's four children were tended to by maids, governesses and tutors.         She grew up in what she called ''a very small, closed society, the last of really 19th-century culture.''         The Startling Remaking Of a Country Girl         ''It's almost incredible to people I work with today,'' she said last year, ''to realize I was born in a world where a woman was totally controlled by men. I mean, you got married and there was kind of no alternative. The boys were allowed to go off to school. The girls were kept home, educated by governesses. It never sort of occurred to me in the first, I suppose, 20 years of my life that a woman could move from the position that pre-World War II women like me were in.''         She received a certificate in domestic science in 1936 from the Downham School in Hertfordshire. Then she was sent to Paris and Munich for ''finishing.'' As she approached the social season of 1938, when she was presented at court, she was still considered an unfashionable country girl.         Then Winston Churchill's only son, Randolph, well educated but spoiled and trailing a reputation for brilliance, arrogance, extravagance and drunkenness, took her to dinner and proposed on their first date, having already been turned down, according to the London gossips, by a number of other women. He was going off to war, told friends he was sure he would die, and wanted to produce an heir.         They were married on Oct. 4, 1939. ''I was absolutely sincere in wanting it to work,'' she said, ''and I still believe that if it hadn't been wartime, that marriage probably would have worked. I mean there's been too much exaggeration about Randolph being a drunk and Randolph being this and Randolph being that. He was his own worst enemy and very difficult to be his father's son and all that, but he had many, many admirable qualities.''         After following her husband to a succession of army camps, Pamela Churchill was taken under her father-in-law's wing. The Prime Minister found her enchanting. She brought him the London gossip and played the card game bezique with him into the early hours of the morning when he couldn't sleep. And he was elated that she was bearing his grandchild and namesake.         ''Nobody in today's generation can fully understand what it was like to be part of the last probably great war,'' she said, and years later she remembered it as the most exciting time of her life.         During bombing raids she shared the shelter under 10 Downing Street with the Prime Minister and his wife, Clementine. Above ground there were dinners and weekends with world leaders at Chequers or at Lord Beaverbrook's, tea dances at Claridges and the Dorchester, officers to entertain at the Churchill Club and Roosevelt's envoy, Harry Hopkins, to look after.         A Fling With Aly Khan, And Other Romances         After the war she became a reporter for Lord Beaverbrook's Daily Express and Evening Standard, cabling news about politics, the arts and the social scene from London, New York, Palm Beach, Montego Bay, Paris and the south of France.         She looked back at those postwar years as a time to ''catch up on all the things that I might have done if I hadn't had those six years of war,'' she said. ''I wanted to discover a lot of things that I had not done at the age of 19.''         She had a fling with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the Aga Kahn, and after the breakup of her marriage to Randolph Churchill she began her new life in Paris. There she met the Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli and fell in love, and during their five-year romance provided him with connections in England and America. She converted to Catholicism in what some said was an effort to be a more acceptable bride to the heir to the Fiat fortune. But that was not to be.         After their breakup there were five years as mistress to Baron Elie de Rothschild of the French banking family. Because he was married to one of the most well-liked women in Paris society, Mrs. Churchill made enemies. But she had admirers, too, among them Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon.         ''I'm censured for having had friends,'' Mrs. Harriman said in 1996, assailing the many books and articles written about her, ''and, of course, more friends than I've ever really had. Men friends. The amount of people that I read about that I've slept with that I've never slept with -- I mean it's extraordinary!''         She insisted that she was not looking for a rich husband, saying of her biographers and detractors: ''The one thing that they've all missed is the fact that having once been married I said to myself, 'I don't have to get married again.' I was bruised. What annoys me, especially in this world where women are equal with men, why do they all take the same tack, that people didn't marry me? Nobody's ever thought that I didn't want to marry.''         But then she did marry, in 1960. During a visit to New York she was introduced to Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer of such hit musicals as ''South Pacific'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' A friend asked her to go to the theater with Hayward, whose wife, Slim, later known in New York society as Lady Keith, was in Europe. It was not long before Hayward proposed.         She showered him with what Sally Bedell Smith characterized as ''geisha-like devotion.'' She cooked chicken hash on a hot plate when they were out on the road and organized splendid houses in New York and Westchester, but theirs was a complicated marriage. Hayward had three children from his marriage to the actress Margaret Sullavan, who committed suicide in 1960, 11 years after their divorce. The children loved their mother and their first stepmother, but not their father's new wife.         When Hayward died of a stroke in 1971, there was a feud over his will. His daughter Brooke Hayward even suggested in her book, ''Haywire,'' that her last stepmother absconded with a string of pearls her mother had left to her. Pamela Harriman insisted that she knew nothing about the pearls.         As the Wife of Harriman, She Buoys the Democrats         Five months after Hayward's death, at a dinner party given by Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, there was a serendipitous reunion with W. Averell Harriman, who had been widowed the year before. A month later Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward, 51, married the 79-year-old former Governor of New York, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Harry Truman's choice to be President of the United States.         Although Harriman was the heir to the Union Pacific Railroad fortune, he was famously parsimonious. With his new wife, however, he was generous, and began to live up to his means. She fixed up his houses. She became an American citizen and adopted his interests in the Soviet Union and, more exuberantly, in the Democratic Party.         As Mrs. Averell Harriman, she gave fund-raising dinners for Democratic candidates in the 1970's. But it was the election of Ronald Reagan and the big Republican gains in Congress in the 1980 election that galvanized both Harrimans to action. To resuscitate the Democratic Party, they agreed to form their own political action committee, which quickly became known as PamPAC. Mrs. Harriman surrounded herself with advisers and learned quickly. She built up her political curriculum vitae, giving speeches and, with the help of friends, writing Op-Ed pieces for The New York Times and The Washington Post.         The Harriman house in Georgetown, with its fine collection of Impressionist works,  became a headquarters of sorts for the party in exile. Contributors paid thousands of dollars to be invited to Mrs. Harriman's receptions and dinners, where they were given briefings and allowed to rub shoulders with party nabobs like Clark Clifford and Robert Strauss and any number of Presidential candidates and senators, current and past.         When Harriman's health deteriorated, his wife worked assiduously to keep him occupied, making sure he had visitors to keep him company when she was away. By then Mrs. Harriman had her own airplane, so she was able to return to him in the evenings. He died in 1986 at the age of 94.         A $100 Million Fortune, And a Family Feud         There were two funeral services, one in New York and one in Washington, and two burials. Mourners thought they were witnessing his burial in the family plot next to his previous wife, Marie. In fact, The Washington Post later reported, Mrs. Harriman had postponed the actual interment for two months while another burial plot was prepared at his estate in Arden, N.Y. Pamela Harriman will be buried at his side, after a funeral service in Washington next Thursday and a memorial service in Paris.         In addition to her son, Mrs. Harriman is survived by her sisters, Sheila Moore of Atlanta and Ireland, and Jaquetta James of the Isle of Mull, Scotland; her brother, Edward, Lord Digby, of Minterne Magna; four grandchildren and three great grandchildren.         Harriman left his widow most of his fortune, more than $100 million, and designated her an executor and trustee of his estate and their charitable trusts. His daughters and their children were to share in the remains of a trust after Pamela Harriman's death. The financial arrangement set the stage for another family feud.         At about the time of their marriage, Harriman put his investments in the hands of William Rich, a man he believed to be a careful and conservative investor, and he engaged his old friend Clark Clifford and his partner Paul Warnke as his lawyers.         He told his wife to follow their advice, but Mr. Clifford soon became preoccupied with defending himself against charges growing out of allegations that he was involved in the huge B.C.C.I. bank and money-laundering scandal, and Mr. Warnke moved to another law firm. Mr. Rich proceeded to make what the Harriman heirs have charged were highly speculative and unwise investments that resulted in huge losses.         The heirs turned to her to make good on those losses. In 1994 they sued her in Federal court in Manhattan. Family members suggested she had pushed Mr. Rich into making risky investments to maintain her expensive habits. She denied it.         ''I never got involved in finances,'' she said. ''It is totally absurd to think that I had any influence, or tried to have any influence, on the running of the office or the management of the money. Never. There was no reason.''         Mrs. Harriman sold some property as well as a Picasso, a Matisse and a Renoir during that time. The two sides reached a settlement in 1995, agreeing not to divulge the terms, then joined forces to file a civil suit against Mr. Rich in Virginia.         Clinton's Her Candidate And Is Duly Grateful         In 1988 Mrs. Harriman's choice for President was Al Gore, not Michael Dukakis. For the 1992 election she considered a number of candidates before settling on Bill Clinton. She committed herself wholeheartedly to raising money for his campaign and he showed his gratitude by choosing her house for his first triumphal victory dinner in Washington. Later he named her Ambassador to France.         That was how Mrs. Harriman came to preside over the palatial residence of American ambassadors on the Rue du Faubourg-St.-Honore, not far on a Paris street map but a world away from the Avenue de New York and the apartment she occupied in the 1950's as Pamela Churchill.         That she was a woman with a past enhanced her standing with the French. Her energy went into 16-hour days dealing with questions of international trade, NATO expansion and the war in Bosnia, and working the telephone to Washinton late into the night, trying to forestall cuts in the Foreign Service budget. She loved every minute of it.         Remembering Mrs. Harriman yesterday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called her a ''central figure in the history of this century.''         ''America has lost a remarkable representative, the State Department has lost one of its most effective diplomats and I have lost a friend,'' she said.         That Sunday morning in late 1996, as she sat in the living room of her private apartment in the Embassy residence, Mrs. Harriman was asked if there was anything she wished she had done differently.         ''No,'' she said.         ''Really, no regrets?''         ''I consider I have had a very fortunate life.''         ''A happy life?''         ''Very, very. I drank deep of the well.''       
         Dr. Ruth Sager, a geneticist who carried out influential research about the location of genetic material in cells, died on Saturday at her home in Brookline, Mass. She was 79.         She had cancer of the bladder, said her husband, Dr. Arthur B. Pardee.         At her death, Dr. Sager was chief of cancer genetics at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. She joined the institute's staff in 1975. She was also a professor of cellular genetics at the medical school from 1975 until she retired from that post in 1988 as a professor emerita.         Dr. Sager was widely known for research that altered the prevailing view about where genetic material was within the cell. That work began in the 1950's and came to fruition in the 1960's.         Dr. Charles D. Stiles, a professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Institute, said Dr. Sager had made a ''revolutionary discovery'' while doing research at the Rockefeller Institute, now Rockefeller University, and later at Columbia University. Before her research, Professor Stiles said, the view was widespread ''that all genetic information was sequestered in the nucleus of the cell.''         ''But what Ruth said,'' he added, ''was that important fragments of the genetic repertoire were located in the cell cytoplasm,'' outside the cell's nucleus in the cellular organelles where it does its respiration (and, in the case of plants, photosynthesis).         Dr. Lawrence Bogorad, the Maria Moors Cabot Professor of Biology emeritus at Harvard University, said the alterations that Dr. Sager achieved ''in the way people thought about extranuclear genetic material, that is, genes in the cell outside the nucleus,'' had proved to be highly significant.         ''These days, scientists know a lot about most of the genes in the organelles,'' Dr. Bogorad said. ''Increasing numbers of human diseases that result from mutations in genes in respiratory organelles are becoming recognized. These discoveries are direct results of the change of thinking about the problem that Ruth's work brought about.''         ''In the latter half of her career, Ruth turned her attention to problems in cancer and in human genetics,'' Dr. Stiles said. When Dr. Sager moved to the Dana-Farber Institute in 1975, he said, ''she quickly saw the potential of recombinant DNA technology, a technology that was then in its infancy'' and involves the manipulation of genetic material to explore basic biological questions.         ''Her main contribution at the institute was to recognize, quickly and early on, the potential and the power of cloning technology,'' he said.         Dr. Sager established the institute's division of cancer genetics and recruited able young scientists for its staff. Many of them have become prominent in genetics.         She was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The honors she received included the  the Gilbert Morgan Smith Medal from the national academy, an Outstanding Investigator Award from the National Cancer Institute and a Guggenheim fellowship.         Dr. Sager was born in Chicago and received a bachelor's degree in 1938 from the University of Chicago and a doctorate in 1948 from Columbia. After becoming a senior research associate at Columbia, she was a professor at Hunter College from 1966 to 1975.         In addition to her husband, a professor emeritus of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the division of cell growth and regulation at the Dana-Farber Institute,  Dr. Sager is survived by two sisters, Esther Altschul of Wilmette, Ill., and Dr. Naomi Sager of Manhattan.       
         Helene-Diane Shulman Kravis Ruger, an interior designer known professionally as Hedi Kravis, died on Wednesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Ms. Kravis, who maintained homes in Manhattan and Bedford, N.Y., was 49.         The cause was cancer, her son, Robert S. Kravis, said.         With her friend Elissa Cullman, known as Ellie, Ms. Kravis was a founding partner in 1984 of the Manhattan decorating firm of Cullman & Kravis.         They were among a new breed of interior designer -- young, chic, energetic and enterprising -- who were part of the society they designed for.         Their natural habitats were the Upper East Side and summer homes in the country. And instead of serving long apprenticeships with well-known decorators or taking courses in interior design, these women began by decorating their own apartments, their husbands' offices and their friends' country retreats.         For their clients, they enhanced the kind of settings they knew well -- spacious living rooms for parties, paneled libraries for leisure, tables hospitable to guests numbered in the dozens and richly canopied beds for slumber.         ''If you can really organize a household, you can do anything,'' Ms. Kravis said in an interview in 1987.         For one assignment, Ms. Kravis and her clients donned sunglasses and sun hats in the first week in January to imagine what summer would be like at a sprawling stucco and shingle house of 8,500 square feet on a site overlooking the Atlantic in East Hampton, L.I., where she had only six months to effect a transformation.         ''We imagined the landscaping and the not-yet-built tennis court,'' Ms. Kravis said, ''and thought what it might be like to walk through the house and out to play tennis.''         In 1987, Mrs. Cullman traced the origins of the firm to a movie script that she and Ms. Kravis showed to Stanley Jaffe, a film producer and old friend. ''His reaction was that we were talented, but could we help him refurbish his house in the country and pull his different homes together?'' she said. ''We were obsessive. We went down to the last details -- matchbook covers and guest towels.''         Both women married young, bore children, traveled, entertained, served on the boards of charities and collected antique English furniture, Chinese porcelain, American folk paintings and modern art.         Ms. Kravis, whose father, Bernard Shulman, was a psychiatrist, was born and reared in Brooklyn. She graduated from Finch College in 1969 and studied English at Columbia University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.         She was a member of the board of the Irvington Institute for Medical Research and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University. She also worked on behalf of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the American Jewish Committee.         Her marriage to Henry Kravis, the leveraged-buyout specialist, ended in divorce. Her second marriage, to J. Thompson Ruger, an executive of Sturm, Ruger & Company, manufacturers of firearms, was ended by his death in 1993.         In addition to her son, Ms. Kravis is survived by a daughter, Kimberly R. Kravis, and a sister, Sharon Beckerman, all of Manhattan.       
         Thelma Carpenter, whose long roller-coaster career as a singer took her to the heights with the big bands of the 1930's and 40's, out of show business into years as a file clerk and back to the big-time on Broadway in the 60's, was found dead on Thursday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 77.         Detective Thomas A. Frey of the 24th Squad said Ms. Carpenter's death appeared to be the result of natural causes.         ''I'm a singer first, last and always,'' Ms. Carpenter once said.         And indeed she was, from the time she was 7 and asked the manager of a radio ''Kiddies Hour'' for an audition until the end of her life, when she performed at places like Michael's Pub and on ''The Cosby Show.''         At the height of her career, the Brooklyn-born Ms. Carpenter, who combined a bubbling, buoyant personality with a pliant voice and a polished sense of showmanship, sang with such jazz greats as Teddy Wilson, Coleman Hawkins and Count Basie.         On the supper club circuit, she was a soloist at Julius Monk's Ruban Bleu, the Maisonette at the St. Regis and Bon Soir in Greenwich Village.         She made her Broadway debut in 1944 in ''Memphis Bound'' with Bill Robinson, appeared in ''Ankles Away'' with Beatrice Lillie, created the role of Irene Page in ''Bubbling Brown Sugar'' and took on a starring role in ''Dolly!'' in 1968 and 1969, when she became Pearl Bailey's standby and portrayed Dolly Levi more than 100 times.         She performed in such films as ''Hellzapoppin' '' (1941), singing with the Basie orchestra, ''The Wiz'' (1978) and ''The Cotton Club,'' Francis Ford Coppola's 1984 film about gangsters and Harlem nightlife.         On radio and television, Ms. Carpenter appeared with Eddie Cantor and Ed Sullivan, was a co-star of the ABC television series ''Barefoot in the Park'' and made guest appearances in everything from ''The Love boat'' to ''The Cosby Show.''         When ''Barefoot in the Park'' was canceled in 1970 after 13 weeks, as when she was out of show business for several years after her mother died in 1962, Ms. Carpenter, while disappointed, refused to turn bitter.         ''My grandaddy taught me something I've never forgotten,'' she said in a 1970 interview. ''What you need is so much more important to you than what you want. Anyway, I've never aspired to be a superstar. You talk about stardom, well, your nose bleeds up there. I got close enough to know. Suddenly there were people I'd never seen, telling me I owed them something. Listen, I've given my money away, where I thought it would help, but I don't want 'yes' people around me. Basically I'm a loner.''         Ms. Carpenter, who left no immediate family survivors, was an only child and never married. ''Yes, I've never married, though you might say,'' she said in 1970, ''that I've done lots of heavy rooming and light housekeeping in my time. Honey, I like life.''         Ms. Carpenter was still a student at Girls' Commercial High School of Brooklyn in 1939 when she was heard by John Hammond, the jazz enthusiast and recording executive who had started Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman and Count Basie on the way to stardom. Mr. Hammond put her on with Teddy Wilson's band at the Famous Door on 52d Street.         Later that year, Coleman Hawkins, the legendary jazz saxophonist, returned to the United States after five years in Europe, formed a band and looked for a singer. ''They make 'em like you in America?'' he asked when he saw Ms. Carpenter. ''You can have the job.''         Ms. Carpenter's career prospered in the United States and abroad, but when her mother died, she said, ''I just lay down in my bed for a whole year.'' Finally, when she needed money, she went looking for a job, applying at a personnel agency that found work as a file clerk at Duffy-Mott, makers of Mott's Applesauce.         When her friend Martha Raye told her there was going to be an all-black company of ''Hello, Dolly!'' Ms. Carpenter went to see the show when Ginger Rogers was playing the lead. ''Son of a gun, I could do that!'' Ms. Carpenter told herself. Pearl Bailey got the role, but when her original standby left, Ms. Carpenter took over the role.         ''I had to go out there and face an audience that had just been told that Pearl Bailey won't be there,'' Ms. Carpenter said. ''I decided I was either going to be Dolly or I wasn't going to be Dolly. 'You don't have to pay me,' I felt, 'just applaud me.' And when they'd stand up and cheer, I'd won.''         Correction:  May 30, 1997, Friday         An obituary of the singer Thelma Carpenter on May 17 misidentified the Broadway show in which she appeared with Beatrice Lillie. It was ''Inside U.S.A.,'' not ''Ankles Aweigh.''       
         Thalassa Cruso, an authority on plants who was known as ''the Julia Child of horticulture'' for her common-sense if often loopy gardening programs on television in the 1960's, died on June 11 at Newton and Wellesley Alzheimer Center in Wellesley, Mass. She was 88 and lived in Marion, Mass.         Ms. Cruso, a witty, acerbic Englishwoman, wrote and starred in the weekly public-television program ''Making Things Grow'' from 1966 to 1969. In brisk, impeccable diction, she indoctrinated viewers into the mysterious world of cyclamen and spathiphyllum, enjoining them to tend their plants with loving kindness, and to throw them in the dustbin without a backward glance if the little ingrates failed to respond.         ''If a plant is unbelievably tatty, dispose of it without the least feeling of guilt,'' she told McCall's in 1971.         Trim and elegant, with dark bangs and a determined chin, Ms. Cruso possessed an uproarious wit, blunt candor and cultivated eccentricity.         ''Ha! There's the little brute,'' she once exclaimed as she flicked an invading slug onto her worktable. Cautioning squeamish viewers to avert their eyes, she raised a flowerpot on high. The pot came crashing down, and the slug was history. WGBH in Boston, which produced the program, was inundated with mail from delighted viewers.         ''Making Things Grow'' was aimed at the novice, and its appeal lay in Ms. Cruso's role as Everygardener, a true amateur who drew her advice from personal experience rather than formal horticultural training. ''I have never studied it, and there is so much I don't know,'' she once said. ''And I'm afraid I'll make some terrible mistake.''         Ms. Cruso did not merely handle plants: she communed with them as if they were sentient creatures, pinching them, patting them, sometimes dumping them unceremoniously onto the counter as dirt flew around the set.         In addition to her broadcasting career, which also included a household-advice program, ''Making Things Work,'' in the early 70's, Ms. Cruso wrote a gardening column for The Boston Globe for 22 years. She was the author of several books, including ''Making Things Grow'' (1969), ''Making Things Grow Outdoors'' (1971) and ''To Everything There Is a Season'' (1973).         She was born Jan. 7, 1909, in London, the daughter of Henry and Mildred Cruso. The name Thalassa, the Greek word for ''sea,'' was a whim of her mother's. According to family legend, a paternal ancestor, John Cruso, was a schoolmate of Daniel Defoe, who would later add an ''e'' to the surname and bestow it on his best-known literary hero. ''My mother's maiden name was Robinson,'' Ms Cruso once said in an interview, ''and I am told that the announcement of that engagement was the last thing that made Queen Victoria smile.''         The Crusos were passionate gardeners, and Thalassa fondly recalled childhood hours spent doing her homework in the greenhouse.         ''When we were given a holiday at school to do a project about our neighborhood, I made a collection of wild plants,'' she said in an interview. ''I bicycled miles to find them. And I found some rare ones.'' She added: ''I didn't win the prize because I presented them sloppily. The girl who won had a collection from her father's garden, neatly pressed. Mine were tied with a boot lace.''         Perhaps craving a way to muck about in the dirt and get paid for it, she went into archeology, receiving her diploma from the London School of Economics in 1931. She served as assistant keeper of the costume collection at the London Museum, and later directed an excavation at Bredon Hill, an Iron Age fort in Worcestershire. There she met the American archeologist Hugh O'Neill Hencken; they married in 1935, and she returned with him to Boston.         Mr. Hencken, who was for many years the curator of European archeology at the Peabody Museum of Harvard University, died in 1981. Ms. Cruso is survived by her daughters, Ala Reid of York Harbor, Me., Sophia Stone of New Orleans and Thalassa Scholl of Boston; seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.         As a wife and mother in Boston, Ms. Cruso was hardly satisfied to confine her days to the garden-club circuit. The inspiration for ''Making Things Grow,'' she recalled, came on a visit to her brother in England: ''We would watch the BBC gardening programs and complain about how bad they were. And I had watched and admired Julia Child on TV, and suddenly I thought, 'I could do that with plants.' ''         She began with brief snippets tacked onto the end of longer programs. ''I used to pop on after the baseball game, or the symphony, or a very serious lecture on birth control,'' she said.         Ms. Cruso's work led to frequent appearances on the ''Tonight'' show, where she taught Johnny Carson how to compost eggshells in a closet. As a result of her celebrity, she became an unofficial custodian of the public horticultural trust. ''People stop me on the street,'' Ms. Cruso once said, ''and ask what to do with their African violets.''       
         Alexandra Danilova, an internationally popular ballet star known for her vivacity and theatrical flair, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Beloved by audiences in a performing career that extended from the Imperial Russian Ballet of St. Petersburg to Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes of the 1920's and the various Ballets Russes companies that succeeded it, Miss Danilova was also a noted teacher and for many years a faculty member of the School of American Ballet, the New York City Ballet's school.         She was known to friends by the nickname Choura, and admired for her Champagne-like sparkle and a stage presence so intense that she could command attention even when she was not moving. With her heart-shaped face and dark brown hair, she was striking to behold. She was also celebrated for possessing what were considered the most beautiful -- and photogenic -- legs in ballet. Lincoln Kirstein, the New York City Ballet's director, once called them ''legs like luminous wax.''         Yet Miss Danilova did more than personify glamour. Extraordinarily versatile, she danced roles that ranged from the passionate Swan Queen in ''Swan Lake'' to the mischievous Swanilda in ''Coppelia'' and the worldly heroines of Leonide Massine's balletic comedies, ''Le Beau Danube'' and ''Gaite Parisienne.'' Although she particularly enjoyed dramatic roles, she also danced abstract ballets. George Balanchine, her schoolmate from St. Petersburg, created ''Danses Concertantes'' in 1944 for her and for Frederic Franklin, the English-born dancer who was her partner at the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from the late 1930's through the 50's.         She appeared in many experimental productions, including, in the Soviet Union, Fyodor Lopukhov's ''Dance Symphony'' of 1923, among the first abstract symphonic ballets. Artistically inquisitive, Miss Danilova once said: ''I have been so lucky. All my life I have worked with the avant-garde. That developed me enormously as an artist, much more than if I had danced just 'Swan Lake' and 'Giselle.' ''         She was born in Peterhof, Russia, near St. Petersburg, on Nov. 20, 1903, and orphaned when she was a small child. She was brought up by relatives and foster parents. When they discovered that the little girl loved to dance, they wondered if there might be a career in ballet for her, and she was accepted by the Imperial Ballet School in 1911. In 1920, she entered the Maryinsky Ballet, the company now known as the Kirov Ballet.         As a young dancer, she was caught up in the artistic ferment after the Bolshevik Revolution. Not only did she appear in the experiments of Lopukhov, but she also became a friend of Balanchine, at that time an experimental young choreographer. Along with several other dancers, she and Balanchine left the Soviet Union in 1924 on what was intended to be a tour of Western Europe. But that same year, she and Balanchine were accepted by Diaghilev: Miss Danilova as a dancer, Balanchine as a choreographer.         Until 1931, she and Balanchine lived together as husband and wife, although they were never married. Balanchine was still officially married to another dancer, Tamara Geva, and he told Miss Danilova that because his marriage papers had been left behind in Russia, he feared it might be difficult to arrange a legal separation.         When Diaghilev died in 1929, Miss Danilova said she felt as if the ground had collapsed beneath her feet. A few years later, however, she danced with the Ballets Russes, which Col. W. de Basil organized in 1933 as a successor to the Diaghilev company. In 1938, she became prima ballerina of a rival company, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, in part because its resident choreographer was Massine, whom she admired only slightly less than Balanchine. The coming of World War II turned the Ballet Russe into an American company and, often partnered by Mr. Franklin, she toured across the country until the early 1950's, appearing in the classics, in ballets by Massine and in works by other choreographers, including Balanchine.         Miss Danilova, who became an American citizen in 1946, was twice married, to Giuseppe Massera in 1934 and to Casimir Kokitch in 1941. Both marriages ended in divorce, and Miss Danilova said in ''Choura,'' her autobiography, which was published in 1986: ''I sacrificed marriage, children and country to be a ballerina, and there was never any misunderstanding on my part: I knew the price.''         She also wrote, ''In a way I regard American audiences as my children, because I helped to educate them.''         Many dancegoers who saw her with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo would agree to that. Miss Danilova gained the reputation of being an artist who was never slack and who gave one-night appearances in tiny villages the same loving care that she bestowed upon seasons at the Metropolitan Opera House.         ''I never danced for an audience that I thought was unworthy of my performance,'' she once declared. She said she believed that a ballerina should always be glamorous, onstage or off. In her autobiography, she wrote: ''Every woman has an image -- mother, princess, ballerina -- that she must uphold. I was privileged to be a ballerina and I, therefore, had a duty to my audience. They must never be disappointed in me.''         Miss Danilova was often in demand as a guest teacher around the country. She also coached works from the classical repertory, and in 1974, she and Balanchine staged ''Coppelia'' for the New York City Ballet. She appeared on Broadway in ''Song of Norway'' in 1944 and ''Oh, Captain'' in 1958 and in the movie ''The Turning Point'' in 1976. In 1958, she received the Capezio Award.         No immediate family members survive. A funeral service for Miss Danilova will be held at 5 P.M. on Thursday at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.         Although she was long reluctant to return to Russia, Lewis Ufland, her former manager, said yesterday that Miss Danilova did go back several years ago. She visited St. Petersburg as part of the trip, and was able to attend graduation performances at the Kirov School, the former Imperial Ballet School she had attended as a child. The faculty enthusiastically welcomed her as one of that institution's greatest alumnae.       
         Mary Louise Smith, a representative of the Republican Party's moderate wing and the only woman ever to serve as chairman of the Republican National Committee, died on Friday at Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines. She was 82 and a longtime resident of Des Moines.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son James E. Smith.         Mrs. Smith was chosen to be chairman of the Republican National Committee by Gerald Ford when he succeeded Richard M. Nixon as President in 1974.         She headed the party during the difficult period after Watergate and announced in November 1976 -- three weeks after President Ford was defeated for re-election by Jimmy Carter -- that she would step down in January 1977, instead of serving two more years.         When she made her decision known, she urged Republicans to avoid ''destructive division'' and ''a fatal lurch to either extreme of the political spectrum.''         Mrs. Smith evidently decided to step down when she did because she thought that the question of whether a moderate or a conservative was to succeed her should be resolved as soon as possible so that the party could begin getting ready for the 1978 Congressional and 1980 Presidential elections.         At the time, her party's conservative faction, associated with Ronald Reagan held the moderates responsible for President Ford's defeat. In January 1977, the Republican National Committee elected Bill Brock, a conservative former Senator from Tennessee, to succeed Mrs. Smith. After Mr. Reagan was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Smith to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. But in his second term, after she had been critical of Administration policies on civil rights, he refused to reappoint her.         Mrs. Smith, whose maiden name was Epperson, was born in the small Iowa town of Eddyville and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa. She became active and prominent in Republican politics and served on the Republican National Committee from 1964 to 1984. She also became a feminist and became known for supporting civil rights and abortion rights.         Her husband, Dr. Elmer Milton Smith, whom she married in 1934, died in 1980.         In addition to her son James, of Des Moines, she is survived by another son, Dr. Robert C., of East Lansing, Mich.; a daughter, Maggie of Jamestown, Calif.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Janet Good, a longtime civil rights worker who cooperated with Dr. Jack Kevorkian to help terminally ill people die, ended her own life yesterday in her home in suburban Detroit. She was 73.         Mrs. Good had suffered from pancreatic cancer and said she hoped not to die as her mother had, slowly and in great pain. As it was, Mrs. Good confounded her doctors, who had expected her illness to take her life by early 1996.         ''My time, obviously, is not quite here,'' she said in an interview late last year. Yesterday, she decided it was, said a person familiar with her decision and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         At a news conference in Southfield, Mich., Dr. Kevorkian's lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, asked the authorities not to pry into the circumstances of Mrs. Good's death.         And while Mr. Fieger declined to confirm that Dr. Kevorkian was present when she died, he said, ''Janet Good is no more the victim of a homicide than anyone else who has died in association and in the presence of Dr. Kevorkian.''         In recent years, Dr. Kevorkian has become well known for assisting in dozens of suicides. He has been tried but acquitted several times, and Mrs. Good became his top assistant, helping him screen those seeking help to die and consoling their survivors.         She said she was proud to have been indicted in late 1996 on charges of assisting in a suicide. ''I was almost offended when I wasn't charged last time,'' she said. The indictment was later dropped because of her deteriorating health.         Dr. Kevorkian's name was hardly known in 1989, when Mrs. Good started the right to die movement in Michigan by founding a chapter of the Hemlock Society in her living room. The chapter now has several hundred members.         In June 1990, Dr. Kevorkian asked her if he could use her house for the very first assisted suicide.         Although she agreed at first, she later declined after conferring with her husband, Ray, a retired Detroit police commander who thought the deed might be illegal.         ''The doctor called me every name in the book,'' Mrs. Good recalled later.         But they mended their differences, and in May 1996, after her husband had changed his mind, she allowed Dr. Kevorkian to use her home to help end a life.         After her own illness was diagnosed, she said her belief in a right to die had come naturally, in part because of her mother's suffering. ''I have worked for civil rights and women's rights and human rights for many years, and this seemed to me just another right we should have,'' she said.         A native of Detroit, Mrs. Good worked for the State of Michigan, processing unemployment claims.         In the 1970's, she led a successful drive to make sexual harassment illegal in the state, a triumph that won her election to the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.         She was also honored by the Log Cabin Society, a gay Republican group, for consoling AIDS patients and their families.         Survivors include her husband of 55 years; a son, Michael, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a daughter, Marjorie Helmling, and a sister, Margaret Moran, both of Detroit; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Her oldest daughter, Donna Ungar, died in 1995.       
         Helen Merrill, a strong-willed and influential theatrical agent who advanced the careers of many of the most imaginative playwrights, directors and designers in the American theater, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 79 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer, said Patrick Herold, who is a partner in her agency.         Ms. Merrill's strength was in finding and encouraging venturesome young artists. As an agent, she played an important role in the lives of the playwrights Christopher Durang, Albert Innaurato, Richard Greenberg, Paul Rudnick and David Henry Hwang, among others. The designers she represented included Ming Cho Lee, George Tsypin, Tony Straiges, Paul Gallo and William Ivey Long, and among her directors were Anne Bogart, Jerry Zaks, Christopher Ashley, Michael Greif and Lisa Peterson.         Not all these people remained her clients, but they generally continued to feel a great indebtedness. Mr. Greenberg, who subsequently moved on to another agency, said: ''Helen ushered in a generation of playwrights. She was tremendously important to the life of the New York theater.''         Outspoken and demanding, she was known for her unassailable belief in her clients, whom she would support economically as well as artistically, often lending them money, while urging them to challenge themselves.         Although she lived in New York City for almost 60 years, she never lost her heavy German accent, which became a distinguishing feature of her personality, along with her wry and often prankish sense of humor. Her clients affectionately imitated her accent and mannerisms.         Mr. Rudnick used her as the model for the actor's agent played by Celeste Holm in his play ''I Hate Hamlet.'' He said: ''She was known for her independence, her passionate devotion to theater and her carefully honed mystique. She loved to discover and nurture talent with a trademark combination of toughness and glee.''         While other agents might sit in offices waiting for scripts, Ms. Merrill was indefatigable in her search for new plays. Dressed in her characteristic uniform (Brooks Brothers striped button-down shirt, Gap khakis and tennis shoes, and, in winter, a full-length mink coat), she was a familiar figure on the outposts of Off Off Broadway, always on the alert for emerging artists.         In the case of Mr. Durang, she first saw his work at the Yale Repertory Theater, where he and Mr. Innaurato collaborated on the satiric musical ''The Idiot's Karamazov.'' Soon she was trekking to see Mr. Durang's comedies in late-night performances at small Manhattan theaters. Later, as his agent, she was instrumental in enlisting three regional theaters to offer sequential productions of his play ''A History of the American Film'' and then shepherded it to Broadway.         ''She was the opposite of the cliches about agents,'' Mr. Durang said. ''If you had an offer of a lot of money or a workshop at Playwrights Horizons, she would much prefer that you did the workshop.''         About her taste, he said, ''She liked plays on the edge, and would get restless with old-fashioned playwrights.''         Most of her writers were several generations younger than she was. Many became her friends, though even for them she retained an air of mystery. ''I thought she led many other lives and was opaque about telling us about them,'' Mr. Durang said. There had been a brief marriage, and there was her intense relationship with Anthony Perkins, with whom she shared a home for many years.         Her representation of scenic, costume, lighting and sound designers added an entirely new dimension to her career.         ''She was a major person in representing designers,'' said Ming Cho Lee. ''We all went to Helen.''         After Mr. Lee joined her agency, many of his design students at the Yale Graduate School of Drama followed. Immersing herself in the world of design, she became an indispensable ally to Mr. Lee and others.         ''Her ideas never aged,'' Mr. Lee said. ''She was opinionated, but her opinions mattered. She could discriminate between fashion and something with a real core. In terms of the art of theater, we don't have anyone else.''         Ms. Merrill was born in Cologne, Germany, and came to the United States in 1939 with her parents and sister. She is survived by her sister, Anjelica Wender of Manhattan, and her brother, Hervey, of Rochester.         Although Ms. Merrill was primarily known as an agent, it was actually her third career. Earlier she had been a theatrical photographer. Then, with the backing of Mr. Perkins, she ran the Osgood Gallery in Manhattan. When the art gallery failed, she reinvented herself as an agent. In 1973, she opened Helen Merrill Ltd., specializing in playwrights and designers while also continuing to represent literary clients.         ''She was perhaps the first play agent to realize the importance of the new nonprofit theater movement,'' said Andre Bishop, co-director of Lincoln Center Theater, and before that the head of Playwrights Horizons. ''She saw the future before others did, and she saw no difference between a 12-performance showcase and Broadway.''         Mr. Bishop said that for a single play at Playwrights Horizons, Ms. Merrill would sometimes represent the playwright, the director and all three designers. ''It could have been called Helen Merrill Horizons in those days,'' he said.       
         Shirley Clarke, an Academy Award-winning filmmaker, a champion of independent filmmaking and a missionary for video as a force in communications, died on Tuesday at the Palliative Care Center of Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston. She was 77 and lived in Carlisle, Mass.         Her sister Elaine Dundy, the novelist and biographer, said Miss Clarke entered the center, a hospice, after a stroke two weeks ago. She also suffered from Alzheimer's disease.         As a filmmaker, Miss Clarke was probably best known for the three pictures she made between 1960 and 1963. ''The Connection,'' filmed in cinema verite style in 1960 and taken from Jack Gelber's Off Broadway play, was a frank study of drug addiction that was banned on grounds of obscenity by the motion picture division of the New York State Board of Regents.         Her 1962 documentary, ''Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel With the World,'' a portrait of the poet, won an Oscar.         Her gritty 1963 film, ''The Cool World,'' adapted from a novel by Warren Miller and filmed on the streets of Harlem, tracked the life of a young man who rises briefly to the leadership of a juvenile gang.         ''Right now,'' Miss Clarke said in 1962, ''I'm revolting against the conventions of movies. Who says a film has to cost a million dollars and be safe and innocuous enough to satisfy every 12-year-old in America?''         In 1962 Miss Clarke and the filmmaker and critic Jonas Mekas founded the Film-Makers Cooperative, a nonprofit company for the distribution of independent films.         ''There must be 40 or 50 others like me in the country, with a desire for self-expression and no urge to move to Hollywood and make soap opera,'' Miss Clarke said.         ''We're creating a movie equivalent of Off Broadway, fresh and experimental and personal. The lovely thing is that I'm alive at just the time when I can do this.''         In 1967, Miss Clarke attracted attention with the release of ''Portrait of Jason,'' filmed during a single 12-hour session in her Manhattan apartment. The documentary, shown at the New York Film Festival, was a 105-minute interview with a gay black male prostitute.         ''The result, I'm convinced, is a portrait of a guy who is both a genius and a bore,'' she said.         By the 1970's, Miss Clarke was turning to video. ''Videotape is going to teach Americans to play with each other,'' she said then. ''The fight of the 1980's will be the battle for access to communications media.''         Released in 1986, her final movie, ''Ornette: Made in America,'' a portrait of the great modern jazz composer and saxophonist Ornette Coleman, mixed film and video.         From 1975 to 1983, Miss Clarke was a professor of film at the University of California at Los Angeles.         She came to her life in film and video after a career in dance. Her concern with movement led her to motion pictures, and among her earliest films were dance-related shorts. ''I became more interested in people than abstractions,'' she said.         Reared in Manhattan and educated at the Lincoln School, Miss Clarke was the eldest of three daughters of the former Florence Rosenberg and Samuel N. Brimberg, a wealthy manufacturer.         ''Daddy was of the school which felt that men didn't talk about important matters to women,'' Miss Clarke once said. ''I guess I always had an enormous need to show him I wasn't the dope he thought I was.''         She said she attended seven different colleges without graduating. ''I studied anything as long as I could keep on dancing,'' she said.         For several years, she studied and danced with Martha Graham and Hanya Holm and was 17 when she offered her first work as a choreographer.         Her marriage in 1943 to Bert Clarke ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Dundy, who lives in Los Angeles, she is survived by another sister, Betty Lorwin of Brooklyn, and a daughter, Wendy, a video artist who also lives in Los Angeles.         As Miss Clarke lay dying, she was visited in her hospital room by her daughter and a group of friends, all film and video makers, who sipped Champagne as they reminisced about her and her work and how it paved the way for the MTV generation.         The next day, Ms. Dundy described the gathering to their sister Betty, who replied, ''It's so like a film Shirley would make.''         Correction:  September 29, 1997, Monday         An obituary on Friday about the filmmaker Shirley Clarke referred imprecisely to a documentary she directed. The film, ''Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel With the World,'' won an Academy Award in 1963 not for her but for its producer, Robert Hughes.       
         Nancy Dickerson, who in the 1950's and 60's combined network television reporting with her role as a sought-after Washington partygiver and insider, died yesterday in New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and maintained homes for many years both in Washington and New York.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke she suffered in January 1996, said a son, John Dickerson. Ms. Dickerson suffered from declining health after being stricken by a heart attack, and then the stroke. She seemed to be making progress but then began to regress, said her husband, John C. Whitehead. Ms. Dickerson was given final rites of the Roman Catholic Church last Thursday.         In 1960, as Nancy Hanschman, she became the first woman to be hired as a network correspondent by CBS News and was a mainstay there and in the Washington bureau of NBC, in which she worked from 1963 to 1970. After that, she formed her own company and devoted herself to producing and appearing in syndicated television productions. One project was ''784 Days That Changed America -- From Watergate to Resignation,'' which won the Peabody Award. Another of her programs was ''Being With John F. Kennedy,'' a documentary co-produced with Robert Drew. She also served as a commentator for Fox News.         Among the stories of which she was most proud were her 1980 interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The interviews were presented by the Public Broadcasting System.         She also produced for PBS a documentary on the role of women in the Arab world titled, ''Islam: The Veil and the Future.''         Ms. Dickerson often acknowledged over the years that her success came partly from knowing people.         ''My social life always seems to revolve around business,'' she said.         The people on her ''A'' list who attended her parties included Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Averell and Pamela Harriman, Walter Annenberg, Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Edward Bennett Williams, Joseph Califano, Elliot Richardson and other prominent figures in administrations from John F. Kennedy's to Mr. Reagan's.         She entertained them at her townhouse in Washington's Kalorama Triangle or at Merrywood in McLean, Va., the estate where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Princess Lee Radziwill grew up. Merrywood was acquired in 1965 by her husband then, C. Wyatt Dickerson, a real-estate investor, and it was where some of Ms. Dickerson's most lavish parties were held.         It was an indication of her place in the capital's social firmament that when she married Mr. Dickerson in 1962, a party was given in her honor, hosted by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Justice Arthur Goldberg of the Supreme Court and Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut.         In her memoirs, published as ''Among Those Present'' by Random House in 1976, Ms. Dickerson revealed that in the 1950's, she had dated John F. Kennedy when he was a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York and had been propositioned at least once by Lyndon B. Johnson. (She turned him down, she said.) Left unfinished at the time of her death was a sequel to this book.         Ms. Dickerson used her contacts to get many scoops in Washington. One of them was Mr. Johnson's decision, in 1964, to ask Senator Hubert H. Humphrey to be his running mate. Another was a rare interview with Speaker Sam Rayburn (who did not like to be interviewed on camera) and an exclusive interview with Senator Barry Goldwater, who wanted to explain to her why he had voted against the Civil Rights Bill.         Not all her exclusives came from Washington. In 1963, she was first to learn that an airline crash near San Francisco had been caused because a deranged passenger had shot the pilot.         She was born Nancy Conners Hanschman to Frederick R. and Florence Conners Hanschman on Jan. 27, 1927, in Wauwatosa, Wisc., a suburb of Milwaukee. She attended Clark College, then a Catholic school for women in Dubuque, Iowa, then entered the University of Wisconsin, where she concentrated in English, Spanish and Portuguese, earning her bachelor's degree in 1948.         She taught school for a time in Milwaukee but in 1951, came to New York in search, she said, of an interesting job. When she could not find something suitable, she went to Washington, where she became a registrar in the Institute of Languages at Georgetown University. She soon found a more desirable job, doing research for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.         She heard that CBS was looking for somebody to produce a radio show about the political scene in Washington called ''The Leading Question,'' and talked her way into it. She did well as a producer, although she had never done it before, and as a result was named associate producer of ''Face The Nation,'' when CBS started that successful interview program in the middle 50's. One of her coups was to persuade the Speaker of the House, Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, to make his television debut on CBS.         She wanted to be on the air herself but in those days, the national reporting staff of CBS was a male preserve. In order to break into it, she used her 1959 vacation to go to Europe to do a radio feature on the peacetime activities of the Women's Army Corps. CBS officials liked it so much, they used it on ''The World Tonight,'' then a mainstay of CBS Radio.         In 1960, CBS decided it would expand its staff to cover the Presidential elections and named her its first woman correspondent in February of that year. The other two networks, NBC and ABC, already had named women to their news staffs, but Miss Hanschman was certainly in the vanguard of women in the ranks of network correspondents. She first covered Senator Humphrey's campaign, but when he lost the West Virginia primary to Mr. Kennedy and dropped out of the primary, she covered Senator Lyndon Johnson all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in July of 1960, where he became Mr. Kennedy's running mate,         Later that year, CBS gave her own weekday radio show, ''One Woman's Washington,'' in which she discussed Washington topics that she thought might be of interest to women around the country. But she did not want to be involved only in women's programming and in the next few years, covered Mr. Kennedy's funeral and the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington.  In 1963, she left CBS and joined NBC News in Washington, where she remained until 1970, covering general national news and politics.         She married C. Wyatt Dickerson,  in 1962. That union ended in divorce in 1983. In 1989, she married John C. Whitehead, chairman of AEA Investors, an investment concern in New York, and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He is also a former senior partner and co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and was a Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. She maintained a home in New York on Sutton Place and was active in various philanthropic efforts, including serving on the boards of Covenant House, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the New York Public Library. She was also a member of the Central Park Conservancy. In Washington she was active in the White House Endowment Fund, among other causes.         Survivors in addition to her husband include three daughters, Elizabeth Earls and Jane Dickerson, both of Washington, and Ann Pullion of Villanova, Pa.; and two sons, Michael Dickerson of Atlanta, Ga., and John Dickerson of Washington, and a sister, Mary Ellen Phillip of Milwaukee.         Correction:  October 20, 1997, Monday         An obituary yesterday about Nancy Dickerson referred incorrectly to Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a host at a party for her when she was married in 1962. Johnson was Vice President, not President, at the time.       
         Jane Warner Dick, an early social welfare advocate who later served on a United Nations panel, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Lake Forest, Ill. She was 91.         Mrs. Dick's social work began in 1926 with Hull House, founded by Jane Addams in 1889. A friend of Ms. Addams, Mrs. Dick volunteered in the Immigrants Protection League, an arm of Hull House that provided legal services and helped immigrants adjust to life in the United States.         She later served on the Illinois Social Welfare Foundation as well as the Illinois Board of Public Welfare, where she established volunteer services for the state's mentally ill.         Mrs. Dick was active in Democratic politics in Illinois, where she was an early supporter of Adlai Stevenson. She urged Mr. Stevenson to run for governor in 1948 and served as the state chairwoman of his successful gubernatorial campaign. She also worked on his Democratic Presidential campaigns in 1952 and 1956.         In 1961, Mrs. Dick was appointed as the United States representative to the Social Commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council by President John F. Kennedy, on the recommendation of Mr. Stevenson, then Ambassador to the United Nations.         In her time with the United Nations, Mrs. Dick played a pivotal role in a raucous debate over a proposed resolution condemning racial discrimination. The United States maintained that the resolution, which called on nations to outlaw any organization that promoted discrimination, was too sweeping.         ''The United States' legal system does not permit censorship or punishment for the expression of ideas, even ideas we loathe,'' she said at the United Nations in 1963. ''We do not believe it is necessary to restrict freedom of thought in order to overcome discrimination.''         A version of the resolution was eventually adopted, with the United States and several Western nations abstaining from the vote.         Mrs. Dick was the author of a book about Mr. Stevenson, ''Volunteers and the Making of Presidents,'' published by Dodd, Mead Inc. She was a trustee of the Menninger Foundation, an advocacy group for the mentally ill; the Children's Home and Aid Society of Illinois, and the Newberry Library in Chicago. She was also a governing member of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.         Her husband, the Chicago industrialist Edison Dick, died in 1994. She is survived by a daughter, Titia Dick Ellis of Santa Fe, N.M.; a son, Edison W., of Washington; a sister, Marion Hodgkins of Lake Forest, Ill.; 9 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Dawn Steel, the first woman to head a major movie studio and who played a prominent role advancing other women to top jobs in Hollywood, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center here. She was 51 and lived in Los Angeles.         Charles Roven, Ms. Steel's husband, a film producer, said Ms. Steel had been suffering from a malignant brain tumor.         ''When I got the call 21 months ago from the doctor about Dawn's condition,'' said Mr. Roven, ''I was told that 97 percent of the people who had this die within the first six months. It goes to show what spirit she had.''         Ms. Steel, who came to Hollywood in the 1970's to take a merchandising job at Paramount, rose quickly to become president of production at that studio, where she oversaw development of such films as ''Flashdance,'' ''Footloose,'' ''Top Gun,'' ''The Untouchables,'' ''Fatal Attraction'' and ''The Accused.'' She became the first woman to head a major studio when she held the top job at Columbia Studios from October 1987 until January 1991. During her reign, the studio's films included ''Awakenings,'' ''Flatliners,'' ''Ghostbusters 2'' and ''Casualties of War.''         Ms. Steel produced several movies in recent years, among them ''Cool Runnings,'' a highly successful comedy about a Jamaican bobsled team. She and Mr. Roven have produced ''Fallen,'' starring Denzel Washington, and ''City of Angels,'' with Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage, both to be released next year.         Ms. Steel's career and life were marked by a powerful, even outsize, personality that helped her succeed in a business dominated by men.  ''She was highly opinionated, extremely self-confident, had a fantastic sense of humor and was someone of enormous style and taste,'' said Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the partners of Dreamworks SKG, and an early mentor of Ms. Steel's at Paramount, along with Michael Eisner and Barry Diller. He added, ''Maybe under the facade she was scared and intimidated by it all, but I didn't see a scintilla of that.''         Nora Ephron, the writer, who was given her first directorial job by Ms. Steel, said: ''Dawn certainly wasn't the first woman to become powerful in Hollywood, but she was the first woman to understand that part of her responsibility was to make sure that eventually there were lots of other powerful women. She hired women as executives, women as producers and directors, women as marketing people.         ''The situation we have today, with a huge number of women in powerful positions, is largely because of Dawn Steel,'' said Ms. Ephron.         Ms. Steel was one of President Clinton's earliest supporters in Hollywood. In the last year, Mr. Clinton had phoned her several times, and Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Ms. Steel at her home in the Coldwater Canyon area of Los Angeles.         Characteristically, Ms. Steel often laughed with friends when recalling her first meeting with Mr. Clinton.         ''You're not as bad as I thought you'd be,'' Mr. Clinton told her.         Ms. Steel's skill as an executive was sometimes overshadowed by a reputation for an abrasive, take-no-prisoners style. She was called Steel Dawn and the Tank. ''It hurt me deeply, this reputation as tough, hard, mean,'' she said in 1993, following the publication of her autobiography ''They Can Kill You, but They Can't Eat You: Lessons From the Front.'' She added: ''It was very painful, it came from guys who wanted to kill me. In some ways I was curt because there's an unbelievable amount to accomplish in a day.''         ''Look, I'm not Mary Poppins,'' she said at another point, ''but I think I functioned with integrity.''         The films that Ms. Steel most enjoyed seeing and making -- such as ''Flashdance,'' about a female welder who wants to dance, and ''Cool Runnings'' -- were personal to her. These are stories of outsiders with outlandish ambitions who overcome numerous obstacles to get what they want. ''She had a formula for many of her movies that carried a simple truth: You want something, you work incredibly hard, you get it,'' said Lucy Fisher, vice chairwoman of the Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group, and a close friends.         Although Ms. Steel often said that she was just ''an ordinary middle-class girl from New York,'' the story of her life was far from ordinary and, like those of many other wealthy and successful moguls in Hollywood, self-invented.         She was born in the Bronx on Aug. 19, 1946, and grew up in Manhattan and ''in a crummy neighborhood on the wrong side of the tracks'' in Great Neck, N.Y., according to her autobiography. Her father, Nat, was a zipper salesman to the military who had a nervous breakdown when she was a child; her mother, Lillian, was a formidable businesswoman compelled to work to support the family. (The family's name was originally Spielberg, but her father changed it to Steel to reflect his prowess as a semiprofessional weight lifter).         Ms. Steel ran out of money after a year at Boston University, and attended New York University's School of Commerce for two years, studying marketing. By 1968 Ms. Steel was working as a receptionist in the garment district and soon found a low-level marketing job at Penthouse magazine devising X-rated products. (She initially told her parents she was working at Mademoiselle.)         Answering phones at Penthouse, Ms. Steel noticed that amaryllis plants took on a phallic look just before blooming. As she recalled, she hired an artist to exaggerate the effect and wrote her own copy for the ad: ''Grow your own . . . All it takes is $6.98 and a lot of love.'' The plant was so popular that Penthouse could not keep it in stock.         Ms. Steel's tenacity, and flair for theatrics, was made evident in 1975 while she was traveling through Europe looking for gimmicky gift ideas. She came up with the notion of poking fun at the Gucci label by stamping it on toilet paper. She solicited orders from boutiques and formed her own company, Oh Dawn! Inc., she said, ''because when I said I was in the toilet-paper business, people would say, 'Oh Dawn!' ''         Soon enough, the Gucci family sued her for copyright infringement. Sid Davidoff, a lawyer and former administrative assistant to Mayor John V. Lindsay, agreed to take her case even though, he later recalled, she ''didn't have a dime, she was living by her wits.'' Mr. Davidoff, building a First Amendment defense, made sure the New York tabloids heard about the case, which was quickly headlined ''the toilet-paper caper'' and led to an editorial cartoon showing the Gucci family as Goliath and poor Dawn Steel as David. The case was settled out of court.         By 1978, Ms. Steel had ended a 10-month marriage, sold her business to her ex-husband and asked Mr. Davidoff to place a call to his friend Mr. Katzenberg about a marketing job for her at Paramount. She was hired and quickly impressed her bosses.         Asked in 1993 why men like Mr. Eisner and Mr. Katzenberg had rapidly advanced her career, Ms. Steel replied: ''One was that I was funny. I wasn't heavy furniture. I made them laugh and entertained them. And the other thing was that I could identify a good idea. Not a lot of people can do that. That was my gift.''         She was once compared to a tank by the producer Dan Melnick. ''She would just lower her head and charge through all the red tape and bureaucracy,'' he said. ''She's the most determined woman in the business.''         Her early advocacy of ''Flashdance'' (1983), an unlikely blue-collar musical that turned into a huge hit grossing $95 million in the United States, solidified her position at Paramount. ''Flashdance'' was followed by ''Footloose,'' another hit.         By 1985, Paramount's president, Ned Tanen, appointed Ms. Steel president of production, making her one of the highest-ranking female executives in Hollywood. She had already developed a celebrity persona that made photographers take as many pictures of her at a premiere as a movie actress. She prided herself on her crown of leonine hair -- Ms. Ephron once introduced ''Dawn Steel and her hair'' at an awards luncheon for women -- and her romantic relationships with such figures as the actor Richard Gere and Martin Scorsese, the director.         Ms. Steel's dismissal from Paramount remains one of the more unusual in recent Hollywood history. Having married Mr. Roven in 1985, she was in the hospital after the birth of her only child, Rebecca, in March 1987, when she learned that Frank Mancuso, chairman of Paramount, and Mr. Tanen, chairman of the Motion Picture Group, had ousted her. Exactly why they did was unclear.         As Ms. Steel told Playboy years later, her husband walked into the hospital room with a newspaper under his arm and said, ''I don't know how to tell you this, babe, but you got fired while you were in labor.'' Ms. Steel said. ''I remember thinking, 'I will not cry, I will not let them make me cry.' ''         In addition to her husband and daughter, she is survived by a brother, Larry, of Manhattan.         Within six months of her ouster at Paramount, Ms. Steel was offered the job of running Columbia Studios, which was owned by Coca-Cola. Lynda Obst, a producer who was given her early producing jobs by Ms. Steel, said that one of the personal high points of her tenure at Columbia was the decision to restore and reissue the David Lean classic ''Lawrence of Arabia.'' ''It was something that she was extraordinarily proud of,'' said Ms. Obst.         Ms. Steel left the job in 1991, following Sony's purchase of the studio. Her settlement was reportedly in excess of $6 million.         Ms. Steel, in reviewing her career a few years ago, recalled that her commitment to helping women in Hollywood was a slow one. ''I must tell you, I did feel threatened by other women in those early years,'' she said. ''I was so busy climbing up this ladder, staying above the water. If there was only room for one woman in a room, I wanted to be her. I'm not proud of it. I certainly don't feel that way now. It was an absolute evolution for me.''       
         After Shira A. Scheindlin was appointed to the Federal District Court in Manhattan a few years ago, she told an interviewer for a legal newspaper that she expected to be more of a ''settling judge than a brilliant opinion writer.''         But in case after case these days, Judge Scheindlin seems to be making a name for herself through the incisive, often witty opinions she writes as well as the striking decisions they contain.         On Monday, in a major ruling against the Giuliani administration, she found that city officials had violated New York magazine's free speech rights when they pulled satirical advertisements from buses. The ads tweaked the Mayor for taking credit for most of the city's virtues.         Her 30-page decision was full of meticulous constitutional analysis, but it was also tinged with sarcasm and humor. ''Who would have dreamed that the Mayor would object to more publicity?'' Judge Scheindlin wrote, going out of her way to cite Mr. Giuliani's daily presence in the local newspapers and his appearance in drag last month on ''Saturday Night Live.''         Then, on Thursday, she found herself in the middle of another contentious dispute, between the two most powerful prosecutors in New York City: Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau and United States Attorney Mary Jo White.         Mr. Morgenthau's senior aides had asked Judge Scheindlin to block Ms. White's prosecutors from completing a plea agreement in a stock trading case that Mr. Morgenthau had initiated. ''This is a dispute between your bosses,'' the judge said, ruling against Mr. Morgenthau's prosecutors. ''They should sit down for coffee some day and talk about it.''         The judge behind these rulings is a 51-year-old with a master's degree in Chinese history from Columbia University and a law degree from Cornell. She acknowledged that she has ''been doing more on the opinion side'' than she thought she would when President Clinton named her to the Federal bench in 1994.         ''The only answer I can say is that there have been wonderful issues that just begged to be addressed,'' said Judge Scheindlin (pronounced SHEND-lin) during an interview in her 10th-floor chambers in the Federal courthouse in lower Manhattan. ''And I like to write. It's fun.''         But her rulings have drawn the ire of the Mayor and others. For two straight days this week, Mr. Giuliani attacked her decision in the New York magazine case, saying she had ''tortured her interpretation to get where she is.''         Last January, after she suppressed evidence in a case and questioned a program in which the police stopped and searched taxicabs, Mr. Giuliani declared that Judge Scheindlin did not care as much for ''the rights of victims and potential victims as accused criminals.''         And recently, the Federal Court of Appeals overturned another decision, in which she found unconstitutional a law allowing the Government to ban the sale of sexually explicit magazines on military bases.         Nonetheless, other legal experts defend her work. Floyd Abrams, the noted First Amendment lawyer, said of her New York magazine opinion: ''The idea that this is some sort of torturous reach by her is simply inaccurate. What is unusual here is not the judicial ruling that the First Amendment has been violated, but the Mayor's conduct, which led to the violation.''         As for the taxicab search ruling, Matthew E. Fishbein, a senior Federal prosecutor at the time, said that although Judge Scheindlin rejected the Government's position in the case, ''the degree of criticism directed at her was in my view excessive and unfair.''         In the opinion, he said, ''she went out of her way to suggest ways for the department to conform its policy so that it would pass constitutional muster, something that the department ultimately did.''         Judge Scheindlin will not discuss individual cases, but says she can live with the criticism. ''I realize that some of the decisions are not immediately popular,'' she said. But she believes there is a balance. The long-term benefit, she says, ''is that we keep our constitutional rights.''         Judge Scheindlin, the daughter of a Russian immigrant and his American wife, was born in Washington.  She grew up in Detroit and graduated from the University of Michigan.         She had never even met a ''real live lawyer,'' she said, until she entered law school in 1972. After graduating, she was a clerk for Judge Charles L. Brieant in Federal District Court in Manhattan, who remembers her as someone who ''got to the point.''         ''Her logic and her thinking are just without parallel,'' Judge Brieant said.         She was in private practice, and served as a United States magistrate and a Federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, before being named to the Federal bench. Now, as then, she says she believes that lawyers and judges can make a difference in society.         In personal conversations, the judge laces her comments with a puckish humor and a bright laugh. From the bench, though, she does not waste words. She can seem brusque, and will cut off a lawyer who is rambling. Several lawyers say they have been the target of her withering glance and her admonition that they make their case more clearly.         A week ago, as the oral arguments in the New York magazine case came to a close, one of the city's lawyers rose. ''May I just have half a minute?'' he asked, with apparent trepidation in his voice.         ''I doubt that it is really going to take half a minute,'' Judge Scheindlin said. ''If you let me cut you off in 30 seconds, go ahead.''         One half-minute later, she interrupted him: ''That was 30 seconds. Is that the point?'' In six words, she then summarized it, asking, ''Was that the point?''         ''Yes, Your Honor,'' the lawyer replied.         Ronald L. Kuby, the criminal defense lawyer known for his passionate advocacy and, at times, his loquaciousness in the courtroom, said he had been chastised by Judge Scheindlin, but rightly so.         ''In court, she's brilliant,'' he said. ''Incisive. Suffers fools not at all.'' He said she pays attention to what a lawyer says and ''she gets very upset when you repeat it. Because she actually heard it the first time.''         The judge, in an interview, acknowledged that her style can be quite direct.         You like to get to the point, she was told.         ''Yes,'' she replied.         Do you realize that about yourself?         ''Yes.''         It is part of your style?         ''Yes.''         You do it with everybody?         ''Yes.''         ''People could talk endlessly around and around an issue,'' she went on. ''Let's get to the heart of the matter. I try to be very direct.'' She added: ''I often say to lawyers, what do you want? Focus yourself. Then I get a much better answer.''         The demands she makes of lawyers, she imposes on herself. As arguments ended in the New York magazine case, on a Friday afternoon, she said she would rule ''as soon as humanly possible.''         She worked through the weekend in her chambers, a court staff member said, and when she had not finished by Sunday evening, worked throughout the night. The opinion was ready for release on Monday morning.         ''I felt the urgency of the parties' needs -- both sides,'' she said.
