         Lucile Powell Singleton, one of the first female executives at CBS Radio, died last Wednesday at the South Roanoke Nursing Home in Virginia. She was 98 years old.         She died of influenza, said her nephew, George Lightfoot Singleton of Birmingham, Ala.         Miss Singleton joined CBS Radio, then in its infancy, in 1929, after working for the Federal Railroad Administration during World War I. At CBS, she was in charge of auditioning vocalists and supervising staff singers.  Among the performers Miss Singleton, herself an opera singer, introduced to the network were Eileen Farrell, the soprano, and Perry Como. From 1946 until her retirement in 1961, she was the manager of the CBS Radio Record Library and wrote and managed contracts for the network's performing artists.         In addition to Mr. Singleton, she is also survived by another nephew, Alexander Edward Singleton 4th of McLean, Va., and a niece, Melinda Singleton Robinson of England.       
         Jane Pickens Hoving, a popular singer on Broadway, radio and television for 20 years and later an organizer in numerous philanthropies and society events, died on Friday at her home in Newport, R.I.         She was 83 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Hoving was the musical leader of the Pickens Sisters, a trio born on a Georgia plantation that reached national stardom in the 1930's with its own radio show, concert tours and records.         The group earned $1 million in five years but dissolved when two sisters dropped out to get married and a fourth, who was the group's manager, also departed.         Mrs. Hoving pursued her music career alone and had wide-ranging success, from musical comedy to opera and nightclub engagements as well as her own shows on NBC radio and ABC television. The World-Telegram said in 1940: "She's probably the most beautiful woman on Broadway with a voice."         She frequently performed benefits for charitable causes, including events for orphans, hospitals, youths, veterans and the disabled. When her career tapered off in the late 1950's, she turned to running hundreds of fund-raising affairs. Among her favorite causes were the Salvation Army and research on heart disease and cerebral palsy, a condition that afflicted her daughter.         She became a noted figure at balls and other society events in New York City, Long Island and Newport. After her career peaked she was married twice to prominent businessmen. First was William C. Langley, a Wall Street broker. After he died, she married Walter Hoving, who had owned Tiffany & Company and Bonwit Teller. He died three years ago.         In 1972 she ran as the Republican-Conservative challenger to United States Representative Edward I. Koch in the Silk Stocking district on the East Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Hoving also painted. Flowers were her favorite subject, roses in particular. She exhibited in galleries and sold dozens of paintings for charity.         The Pickens sisters were born in Macon, Ga., and grew up there and in Atlanta. Their parents taught them to harmonize. Their father, a cotton broker, played the piano and their mother sang.         At first the sisters sang for friends, then at churches and schools. The family moved to Park Avenue in Manhattan in 1932, and a test recording for Victor made such an impression with radio executives that they hired the sisters unseen. Promoted as Three Little Maids From Dixie, they appeared in "Thumbs Up" on Broadway and in a movie, "Sitting Pretty." Serious About Her Music         Mrs. Hoving, who arranged the group's numbers, was the most serious about music. She studied at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and the Fontainbleau in France and won fellowships at the Juilliard School. Several times she dropped out of public appearances to resume formal training.         She sang in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 in a cast that included Fanny Brice and Gypsy Rose Lee. In 1940 she played opposite Ed Wynn in "Boys and Girls Together" on Broadway. Brooks Atkinson's review said she had "a most attractive voice."         A turning point came in the 1940's when, unsatisfied with her career, she consulted Robert Alton, a music arranger. He told her that she came across as aloof, which he attributed to her feeling defensive. His analysis was a revelation. "I woke up the next morning absolutely healed," she said. "That wall was just gone."         In 1949 she won raves for starring in the lead of "Regina," the musical version of "The Little Foxes." One review said her performance was "in every way admirable." Jack Gould wrote that she "sings and acts with the ferocity of a poisonous snake."         An early marriage to Russell Clark ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, Marcella Clark McCormack of Newport and Manhattan, and a sister, Patti Shreve of Bethlehem, Pa.

         Susan Kaplan Hopwood, a marketing and sales executive in New York City, died on Feb. 8 at her home in Newtonville, Mass. She was 55 years old.         She died of a pulmonary embolism, her family said.         Mrs. Hopwood was advertising sales manager of Barron's, the business weekly, in the 1970's. Advertising lineage doubled in three years under her direction, and she helped initiate the overseas distribution for the publication. Moving to the parent of Barron's, Dow Jones & Company, she helped start "The Wall Street Journal Report" programs on radio and television.         From 1982 to 1988 she headed public relations for Advertising Age magazine. She ran its annual creative workshop, attracting marketing and advertising agencies from 47 countries, and helped institute annual awards for the best television commercials.         She also helped the International Advertising Association organize its annual conferences from 1986 to 1989, including its first gathering in Beijing. Recently she worked on marketing for the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, Art News magazine and World Paper, an international news supplement for other publications.         For several years she worked on the board of the Manhattan Theater Club.         She was born in Brooklyn. Mrs. Hopwood was an alumna of Finch College and earned a master's degree in business from New York University.         Her marriage to Seymour N. Kaplan ended in divorce. Surviving are her husband, David J. Hopwood; a daughter, Kari E. Kaplan of Manhattan; a son, Kenneth N. Kaplan of Queens; her mother, Claire Nossiter of Manhattan; a brother, Robert Singer of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and three stepchildren.       
         Nancy Walker, who played Rhoda's mother, McMillan and wife's housekeeper and a paper-towel-promoting waitress in television commercials, along with a string of brassy, loudmouthed cutups on Broadway, died yesterday at her home in Studio City, Calif. She was 69 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said Frank Liberman, a family spokesman.         A long-faced, red-haired, petite actress, Miss Walker said she was never able to play what she called a "gray character."         "I don't understand it myself," she said in 1976, "but I have this effect on people, so when I walk onstage, they start laughing."         That is pretty much what happened when through a case of mistaken identity she got her big break on Broadway at age 19. Her father, who was an acrobat, asked his agent to send her to see the producer George Abbott, who was auditioning actors for a new comedy, "Best Foot Forward."  Genesis of a Comedian         She was introduced as Miss Walker -- Mr. Abbott and Richard Rodgers had been expecting a singer named Helen Walker -- and began belting out a song called "Bounce Me Brother With a Solid Four." Mr. Abbott built up the "blind date" role in "Best Foot Forward" from five lines to a leading role, making her an instant success.         She knew from age 10, she said, that she wanted to be a performer. But she said she did not realize that she could be a comedian until she started getting laughs in "Best Foot Forward."         "After that," she said, "people just kept writing parts for me."         But she said it was not a case of art imitating life. "Not so talkative" was how she once compared herself with the chatty characters she played onstage and on television.         "I've always thought people who are on, offstage, save very little for onstage," she said in 1976. "You can't keep the mask on all the time: it flakes."         Miss Walker, whose name originally was Anna Myrtle Swoyer, was born on May 10, 1922, in Philadelphia. Her father changed his name to Dewey Barto when he joined a vaudeville act called the Three Bartos. When Miss Walker was 3 weeks old, her mother went back on the vaudeville circuit herself, and Miss Walker slept backstage. She crawled out into the spotlight one night when she was 10 months old and stole the show.         After her success in "Best Foot Forward," M-G-M flew her to Hollywood and signed her to a seven-year contract. She appeared in the movie version of the play and in "Girl Crazy" and "Broadway Rhythm," playing variations of the blind-date character she had mastered on Broadway. She also appeared in "Lucky Me," which starred Doris Day and Robert Cummings.         On Broadway, she also starred as the jaded cabdriver Brunnhilde Esterhazy in "On the Town" in 1944 and later appeared in "Pal Joey," "Wonderful Town," "Look, Ma, I'm Dancin"' and "Do, Re, Mi," a spoof of the jukebox industry in which she played Phil Silvers's long-suffering wife. 'The Quicker Picker-Upper'         She was also the face that launched a million rolls of paper towels in television commercials beginning in the 1970's, saying: "Bounty. It's the quicker picker-upper."         She was not defensive about making commercials. "One minute's work done well is just as important as one hour," she said. "Look, if it were a bad minute, I'd feel terrible, because I get paid very well, and that would be cheating. I'm not cheating anybody. I mean, an artist is an artist no matter what he does. Besides, if I weren't doing those commercials well, I'd not have gotten on the Mary Tyler Moore show."         On "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," she played Rhoda Morgenstern's overbearing mother, and went on to a regular role when Valerie Harper, as Rhoda, got a series of her own. In 1974, when Rhoda was finally married after a long run as Miss Moore's unmarried best friend, all Rhoda and Joe wanted was a small ceremony before a justice of the peace. But as Rhoda's mother, Ida Morgenstern, Miss Walker was determined to have a slightly more elaborate ceremony in her Bronx apartment. Rhoda wanted no more than a dozen guests. Ida invited 79.         Miss Walker's most recent work was a starring role in "True Colors," a sitcom on Fox.         Miss Walker is survived by her husband, David Craig, and their daughter, Miranda Craig who lives in Los Angeles.

The show "Rhoda" ended in 1978, after a five-year run. Miss Walker also appeared in the series "McMillan and Wife" from 1971 to 1976, playing a sassy housekeeper. She was also the host of "The Nancy Walker Show," which had a brief run in 1976.         Miss Walker's most recent work was a starring role in "True Colors," a sitcom on Fox.

         La Lupe, a singer who was known during the late 1960's as the Queen of Latin Soul, died on Feb. 28 at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. She was 53 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, a hospital spokesman said.         La Lupe had a raspy voice and an uninhibited stage presence; she shook her long hair, shimmied in low-cut dresses and tossed her beads and shoes to the crowds. A string of hits she made with the bandleader Tito Puente in the mid-1960's established her as one of the most popular performers in Latin music.         La Lupe was born Lupe Victoria Yoli in Santiago, a village in Oriente Province in Cuba. At her parents' insistence, she earned a teaching degree, but she had also been winning local singing contests, and decided to go into performing. She married a singer in the trio Los Tropicuba; after her first performance, he said he thought she was having an epileptic fit. She soon divorced him and began working on her own, and by 1960 she was a leading performer in Havana nightclubs. She bought her own club, but after difficulties with the Fidel Castro Government -- "Castro take my club, my money, my car," she told Look magazine in 1971 -- she emigrated to the United States, and settled in New York in 1962. The Making of a Star         Soon after she arrived, she began singing with orchestras led by Mongo Santamaria and Mr. Puente, with whom she recorded a number of hit singles, including "Que Te Pedi." By the end of the 1960's, she was a star in her own right, working with Mr. Puente and with other bandleaders, and touring the United States and Latin America.         In the mid-1970's, her jobs in New York City dwindled, and she moved to Puerto Rico, where she played concerts and television programs. She returned to New York, but her career had declined and her second husband's medical expenses depleted her savings. By the early 1980's she was living on welfare. In 1984, while hanging a curtain, she fell, injured her spine and was paralyzed; not long afterward, an electrical fire burned down her house. She sang with Mr. Puente for the last time in 1985, from a wheelchair, at a concert to help pay her expenses.         According to Vernon Boggs's "Salsiology," a history of salsa in New York published by Excelsior and Greenwood, La Lupe regained her ability to walk after being blessed by an evangelical Christian preacher. She began singing Christian music, performing regularly at Iglesia Pentecostal el Fin Se Acerca (Pentecostal Church: The End is Near) in the Bronx. She also recorded a series of albums in salsa and Mexican styles with devotional lyrics.         She is survived by her son, Rene Camano, and her daughter, Rainbow Garcia, both of the Bronx.       
         Phyllis Q. Blundell, a British sculptor and ceramist, died on March 24 at the A. O. Fox Hospital Nursing Home in Oneonta, N.Y. She was 102 years old and had lived at the nursing home for six years.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Jeanine Peterson, a friend.         Miss Blundell came to the United States in 1928 and worked in New York City until 1970. In the 1930's she was commissioned to do busts of Anna Roosevelt, the daughter of Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt; Lily Pons, the opera singer, and Rubin Goldmark, a composer who taught in the 1930's at the Juilliard School. In the 1950's she was president of the New York Society of Ceramic Arts and her work was exhibited widely in New York galleries and at the Cooper Union Museum.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Molly Picon, the comedic actress and singer who lightened and brightened the often dolorous themes of Yiddish theater with shows that were sprightly operettas, died yesterday in Lancaster, Pa. She was 94 years old.         She died in her sleep at the home of her sister, Helen Silverblatt, said Seymour Rexite, president of the Hebrew Actors Union.         Miss Picon, who was an indefatigable performer well into her 80's, had a stage career that dated from first efforts when she was 5 years old. With her sparkling         ganayvishe oygen,         or mischievous eyes, and her sturdy delivery of Yiddish songs with appropriate gestures and intonation, she reigned supreme in more than 200 productions along the Yiddish theater row that was lower Second Avenue during the 1920's.         She also appeared on Broadway, achieving her most notable success in a two-season run of "Milk and Honey," a hit musical that opened in 1961, when she was in her mid-60's. When she co-starred with Robert Morley in a London production of "A Majority of One," she was acclaimed by critics.         But it was in Yiddish theater, where audiences often measured their enjoyment by the volume of tears on both sides of the footlights, that Miss Picon established an international reputation by playing for laughs. An Idol in Jewish Neighborhoods         To millions of Jews in major cities of the United States, Europe, South America, Africa and Australia, "our Molly" meant the slender, vivacious comedian with the dark, dancing eyes and elfin face whose songs, dances and mimicry provided hilarious joy. Among the songs she helped turn into hits were "The Story of Grandma's Shawl" and "The Working Goil." She was idolized in Jewish neighborhoods, where children and clubs were named after her during her heyday in the 1920's.         Hers was the expansive, emotional style that would have been restricted by the colder performances tailored to the realism of Broadway. When she performed her first English-speaking starring role, in 1940 in Sylvia Regan's drama "Morning Star," Brooks Atkinson, who did not care for the show itself, wrote about Miss Picon in The New York Times, "To coin a phrase, she is a darling."         This was the universal sentiment that she aroused in critics and audiences alike with her talent for generating warmth and rapport. Miss Picon loved the uninhibited audiences of the Yiddish theater.         She had a flair that averted staleness and repetition. On the Yiddish stage, she used Broadway dance routines as much as possible and flooded the dialogue with English. Jacob Kalich, her husband and colleague from 1919 until his death in 1975, wrote more than 40 scripts for her, and Joseph Rumshinsky, the well-known composer, did most of her music. Mr. Kalich wrote for her one of her most sustained presentations, the play "Yankele," a sort of Yiddish Peter Pan story in which she portrayed a little boy. She later said she had appeared in it 3,000 times, a figure that might be taken merely to mean that it went on quite often. Her Yiddish Was Acquired         Curiously, Miss Picon had to develop her knowledge of Yiddish. She was born on Broome Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, on June 1, 1898, to an immigrant couple. They moved to Philadelphia when she was a child, a migration that made her English sound a bit alien in later years to Jews with the accent of East Side New York.         At the age of 5, Miss Picon won a teddy bear in a burlesque-house amateur program. Her mother recognized her talent and encouraged her, and young Molly started singing for 50 cents a night.         At age 15 she joined a Yiddish repertory company and toured as Topsy in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," switching languages -- English or Yiddish -- to suit the ears of the audience. Because she thought of a future in English-language theater, Miss Picon drifted into the cross-country vaudeville circuits, where she perfected her timing and her uncanny instinct for audience response. Made a Film With Sinatra         Her career changed suddenly when her vaudeville troupe was stranded in Boston. There Mr. Kalich persuaded her to join the Yiddish company he managed. After their marriage she went with him, in 1919, to Eastern Europe, where she perfected her Yiddish. Upon their return in 1923, she made her stage debut as the star of "Yankele."         In more recent decades, Miss Picon did less Yiddish theater, of which there was less to do. After "Milk and Honey" she worked mostly in English-language undertakings, in such plays as "Paris Is Out" in 1970 and "Something Old, Something New" (later called "The Second Time Around") in 1977 with Hans Conried. She appeared in the films "Come Blow Your Horn," which starred Frank Sinatra, and "For Pete's Sake," with Barbra Streisand.         In 1959, after an interval of many years, she returned to Second Avenue to star in a Yiddish vehicle, "The Kosher Widow." She wrote the lyrics to the music by Sholom Secunda, and the book was by Mr. Kalich and Louis Freiman. She had two roles in it, and the audience determined the story's outcome with an applause meter.         Miss Picon was particularly touched in 1946 when she and her husband were among the first entertainers to visit European camps for displaced people.         As she recalled in an interview years after the visit, "A woman came up with a child and said, 'My child is 2 years old and she has never heard the sound of laughter.' "         Her husband told Miss Picon: "Molly, that's our job. Make them laugh!"         In 1960, "Molly!," an autobiography written with Jean Bergantini Grillo, was published by Simon & Schuster.         Miss Picon is survived by her sister.         Correction:  April 8, 1992, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the actress and singer Molly Picon misstated the publication date of her autobiography, "Molly!" It was 1980.       
         Marlene Dietrich, the magnetic movie star and singer who was an international symbol of glamour and sex for more than half a century, died yesterday at her home in Paris. She was 90 years old.         In her films and record-breaking cabaret performances, Miss Dietrich artfully projected cool sophistication, self-mockery and infinite experience. Her sexuality was audacious, her wit was insolent and her manner was ageless. With a world-weary charm and a diaphanous gown showing off her celebrated legs, she was the quintessential cabaret entertainer of Weimar-era Germany.         The Dietrich image, personified by Lola-Lola, the seductive cabaret singer in top hat and silk stockings whom she portrayed in "The Blue Angel," was that of a liberated woman of the world who chose her men, earned her own living and viewed sex as a challenge. Audiences were captivated by this creature out of no one's experience but out of everyone's imagination. 'Most Vulnerable Fantasies'         Her manner, the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, was that of "a serpentine lasso whereby her voice casually winds itself around our most vulnerable fantasies."         "She has sex but no positive gender," Tynan wrote. "Her masculinity appeals to women and her sexuality to men."         Her friend Maurice Chevalier said: "Dietrich is something that never existed before and may never exist again. That's a woman."         The Dietrich image was born in the Berlin of the 1920's, when she appeared in plays, cabaret, and film roles of varying importance (she was an extra in G. W. Pabst's 1925 "Joyless Street," which featured Greta Garbo). Her mentor, the American director Josef von Sternberg, made her an international star with "The Blue Angel," which was filmed in 1930 in both German and English. Although in the movie's offstage scenes her 5-foot-5-inch frame seemed a bit blowzy and her manner a bit too Teutonic, her portrayal of Lola-Lola, who degrades and destroys an infatuated elderly professor (Emil Jannings), won her a Hollywood contract. She shed 30 pounds, and in six more von Sternberg movies the director and his star molded the legend.         Her hair became a golden blond, makeup and lighting made her cheekbones and nose appear patrician, and her dreamy blue eyes were framed by thinly penciled, sweepingly arched brows.         Perhaps the best description of her face was provided by Erich Maria Remarque, her longtime friend, in his novel "Arch of Triumph":         "The cool, bright face that didn't ask for anything, that simply existed, waiting -- it was an empty face, he thought; a face that could change with any wind of expression. One could dream into it anything. It was like a beautiful empty house waiting for carpets and pictures. It had all possibilities -- it could become a palace or a brothel." A Lifelong Task Of Creating an Image         Working with von Sternberg, the actress became a thorough professional and perfectionist, expert in makeup, lighting, clothes and film editing. In later decades, she repeatedly had cosmetic surgery to keep her face taut, and adroitly had herself filmed with soft-focus, gauze-covered lenses.         "Glamour," she observed, "is assurance. It is a kind of knowing that you are all right in every way, mentally and physically and in appearance, and that, whatever the occasion or the situation, you are equal to it."         In clothes, she was a trend setter. Both on screen and off, she often wore trousers and mannish costumes. By proving that a woman could still look feminine in such clothes, she established "the Dietrich silhouette," emphasizing trimness and inconspicuous hips and bust.         The Dietrich-von Sternberg collaboration produced "Morocco" (1930), in which Miss Dietrich, again a cabaret singer, spurns and then pursues a French legionnaire (Gary Cooper) in the Sahara; "Dishonored" (1931), about a spy who betrays her country for love of a worthless man (Victor McLaglen), and "Shanghai Express" (1932), a melodrama in which she is a China Coast prostitute who offers herself to a warlord (Warner Oland) to save the life of a former lover (Clive Brook).         The last three Dietrich-von Sternberg films were "Blonde Venus" (1932), a mother-love soap opera; "The Scarlet Empress" (1934), an opulent and visually stunning melodrama about a lascivious Catherine the Great, and "The Devil Is a Woman" (1935), an erotic tale about a soldier-corrupting vamp in turn-of-the-century Seville.         Because it displayed her beauty most effectively, "The Devil Is a Woman" was her particular favorite. But it angered Spanish officials, at whose demand Paramount Pictures soon withdrew it and destroyed the master print. Miss Dietrich gave her own print of the film to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it is shown frequently.         The von Sternberg movies were increasingly self-indulgent, lyrical, exotic romances with pallid plots that trapped the actress in elaborate decor and special effects. They were losing a fortune, so Paramount's top executives, to protect their big investment in Miss Dietrich, barred von Sternberg from directing her again.         Seeking variety, she made her first comedy, "Desire," in 1936. It was a satire about an urbane jewel thief who steals a choice necklace from a Parisian jeweler and, in efforts to keep it, becomes involved with a hayseed Detroit engineer (Gary Cooper).         A second comedy, "Destry Rides Again," a 1939 spoof of the Old West, was even more successful. The actress, as a freewheeling saloon entertainer, seduces a valiant sheriff (James Stewart) and has a hair-pulling, face-pummeling brawl with a competitor (Una Merkel).         Miss Dietrich was a Berliner who was an early and passionate opponent of Nazism. When Hitler started arresting Jews, she financed the escape of several friends. Rejects Germany; Films Are Banned         In 1937, while filming the melodrama "Knight Without Armour" in England, she was approached by agents of Hitler offering her an almost blank check to return to Germany to star in movies of her choice. She angrily rejected the offer, and her films were banned in Germany. Soon after, she applied for American citizenship, which was granted in 1939.         During World War II, Miss Dietrich became somewhat of a symbol of free Germany. She made anti-Nazi broadcasts in German, took part in many war-bond drives and, in three years, entertained half a million Allied troops and war prisoners across North Africa and Western Europe.         Tirelessly and good-humoredly, she roughed it with the G.I.'s, standing patiently in food lines, washing with snow and sleeping in dugouts and ruins, often near the front lines. She sang her movie songs, the international wartime ballad "Lili Marlene" and some current songs, and even played a musical saw, a skill she had mastered for the Berlin stage. The troops loved her.         After the war, she was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor the United States Government bestows. France named her a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor and Belgium dubbed her a Knight of the Order of Leopold.         Her most noteworthy movie roles after the war were as an exotic gypsy in Mitchell Leisen's "Golden Earrings" (1947), with Ray Milland; a manipulative Berlin cabaret singer in Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair" (1948); a saloon manager hiding outlaws in Fritz Lang's "Rancho Notorious" (1952); a duplicitous wife in Mr. Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution" (1958); a cynical brothel-keeper in Orson Welles's "Touch of Evil" (1958) and an aristocratic widow in Stanley Kramer's "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961).         "Touch of Evil" provided Miss Dietrich with one of her most memorable lines. She admonished the character played by the corpulent Welles to "lay off the candy bars."         Her last film was a small part in the forgettable 1979 melodrama called "Just a Gigolo." In 1986, Maximilian Schell made a documentary about her, entitled "Marlene"; she did not appear on screen because of vanity, but she was interviewed and her voice is heard almost continuously.         Miss Dietrich began her cabaret performances in 1954, and for more than two decades, for fees up to $30,000 a week, she hypnotized audiences in such disparate cities as London, Las Vegas, Paris, New York, Montreal, Johannesburg and Tokyo and Tel Aviv (where she sang in German with some apprehension, but with stunning success). Her manner matched her movie image: at once intimate and elusive.         In 1960, also with trepidation about wartime animosities, she sang in Berlin. There were a few hecklers, but the vast majority of Berliners welcomed her home.         To keep her shows up to date, she interspersed the nostalgia with new songs, and in 1963 she performed in London with -- or perhaps against -- the youthful Beatles.         Marie Magdalene Dietrich was born in Berlin on Dec. 27, 1901. Her father, Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, who was a police lieutenant and a former cavalry major, died when she was 9 years old.         Her mother was Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine Felsing, the daughter of a well-to-do watch merchant, who soon after being widowed, married Edouard von Losch, a cavalry lieutenant. He was killed on the Russian front in 1918.         The young Marie Magdalene and her elder sister, Elisabeth, were brought up strictly in an upper-middle-class Prussian home. Marie Magdalene attended a private school in Weimar, studied French and took violin lessons, hoping for a concert career. But when she was 18, a hand injury threatened that dream and she decided to try dramatics, contracting her two given names to Marlene because her family disapproved of acting.         She failed an audition with Max Reinhardt and joined the chorus of a touring musical revue. A year later, she passed a second audition and was admitted to Reinhardt's drama school.         Soon after, she won small roles on the stage and in German films. Her only substantial role was in the film "Tragedy of Love" (1923). She was assigned the part by Rudolph Sieber, a young Czechoslovak production assistant. They were married on May 17, 1924, and the next year had a daughter, Maria.         After the early years of their marriage, Mr. Sieber was rarely seen with his wife. He held movie jobs in New York and Hollywood and, in 1953, became a chicken farmer in California in the San Fernando Valley. They never divorced, but lived apart for most of their remaining years. He died in 1975.         In the late 1920's, Miss Dietrich won increasingly important leading roles on the German stage and was likened in the German press to Greta Garbo. A Director's Search For a Cruel Temptress         In early 1930, von Sternberg arrived in Berlin to make "The Blue Angel," based on the Heinrich Mann novel "Professor Unrat." The director had been searching for an actress who could exude the electric eroticism of the movie's cruel temptress. He saw Miss Dietrich in a play and knew his search was over.         Two decades later, the actress was referred to by the press as "the world's most glamorous grandmother." Her daughter, also an actress, married William Riva, a scenic artist, in 1947, and had four sons. Miss Dietrich was often seen with her grandsons in Manhattan, wheeling their carriages in Central Park, later seeing them off to camp at Grand Central Terminal and even carrying their laundry.         She was deeply devoted to her family, worked hard to advance her daughter's career and helping her daughter and son-in-law financially. To be with her family, Miss Dietrich lived in Manhattan when not touring, but in 1972 she moved her chief residence from Park Avenue to Paris, where she lived in a four-room apartment on Avenue Montaigne, in the Eighth Arrondissement.         She was a close friend of many famous people, including Ernest Hemingway and Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. She also had widely reported love affairs with the writer Erich Maria Remarque and the actors Jean Gabin, Michael Wilding and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. "I've always been attracted to intelligent men," she once said. "I can pick 'em in a full room, just like that. I don't care what age they are."         Miss Dietrich kept in touch with friends around the world by telephone and letter. She often cooked delicacies for friends, as well as for stagehands and doormen. Her specialties included goulash and apple strudel. She was also knowledgeable about antiques, and owned paintings by Delacroix, Cezanne, Utrillo and Corot. A Faith in Astrology, For Herself and Others         Deeply influenced by astrology, she regularly had horoscopes prepared for friends. On that subject, she once remarked: "Astrology! Of course. After all, everyone knows that the moon pulls the sea away from the land, and farmers don't plant when the moon is wrong.         "Why should humans escape?"         She granted occasional interviews to friendly journalists, but over the years she grew impatient with those who asked questions she regarded as stupid or pointless.         In her memoirs, "Marlene Dietrich's ABC," published in 1962, she wrote: "Once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast."         Miss Dietrich, who stopped performing in the mid-1970's, lived the last years of her life as a virtual recluse in her Paris apartment.         A photograph of her in "Shanghai Express" was chosen to publicize this year's Cannes International Film Festival, which starts Thursday. The poster adorns billboards all over France.       
         Sylvia Syms, one of the most admired pop-jazz singers of her generation, died of a heart attack in Manhattan early yesterday morning after a performance in the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel. Moments after she had finished singing a program of songs associated with her longtime friend Frank Sinatra, the 74-year-old singer and actress collapsed and was taken to St. Clare's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.         "It was at the very end of the second show, and she was getting a standing ovation," said Steve La Spina, her bass player. "She put her right hand up, and the next thing we knew she fell back and hit the ground."         With her deep, grainy contralto, I've-been-through-it-all air of sophistication, and sinuous phrasing that echoed her idol, Billie Holiday, Miss Syms was a quintessential saloon singer, a term she said she preferred to cabaret singer. In the saloon tradition of Mr. Sinatra, she treated everything she sang as an intimate personal communication.         "When you perform it's a one-to-one love affair with the people out there," she once said. "That's how it has to be."         Although she enjoyed only one bona fide pop hit, "I Could Have Danced All Night," from the musical "My Fair Lady," in 1956, among musicians and a coterie of admirers she had a stature that was matched by perhaps only a dozen other veteran popular singers.         Foremost among those admirers was Mr. Sinatra, who produced and conducted her 1982 album of standards, "Syms by Sinatra," for Reprise Records. Not long after they met in the 1940's, Mr. Sinatra gave the plump, moon-faced singer the nickname "Buddha." She in turn referred to him by his full name, Francis Albert. Miss Syms took credit for giving Billie Holiday her trademark gardenia as camouflage after the legendary jazz singer had burned her hair with a curling iron.         Miss Syms was born on Dec. 2, 1917, in Flatbush, Brooklyn. She was only 15 years old when she discovered the jazz clubs of West 52d Street and became friendly with many of the musicians who performed in them. She inaugurated her nightclub career at Kelly's Stable in 1941. Five years later, she made her first recording, "I'm in the Mood for Love," with the Freddie Greene Band. The Clubs and the Labels         It was while appearing at the Cinderella Club in Greenwich Village in 1948 that she was discovered by Mae West, who gave her the part of Flo the Shoplifter in a revival of "Diamond Lil." Favorable notices from the show helped propel her into a dual career in nightclubs and the theater. Her musical comedy roles included Bloody Mary in regional productions of "South Pacific" and Dolly Gallagher Levi in a regional production of "Hello, Dolly!" Her favorite stage role was Gypsy in Tennessee Williams's "Camino Real," which she performed at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and later at Lincoln Center.         In a nightclub career that spanned 51 years, the New York rooms in which she performed included the Bon Soir, the Ruban Bleu, the Living Room, the Village Vanguard, the Cafe Carlyle, Freddy's, Michael's Pub, the Cookery, Marty's, and Eighty-Eight's.         Miss Syms recorded 15 albums for Decca, Columbia, Atlantic and Prestige, among other labels. Her most recent recording, "Along Came Bill," a tribute to the jazz pianist Bill Evans, was released in 1990 on DRG. She recently completed her final recording, "You Must Believe in Spring: The Words of Alan and Marilyn Bergman," which Cabaret Records is to release next month.         She is survived by a brother, Burton Blagman, of Wyckoff, N.J., and a sister, Muriel Bailey of Chesterfield, Mo.         A funeral service is to be held today at 2:30 P.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.       
         Joan Merrill, a nightclub singer and actress, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74 years old.         She died of a stroke, said her husband, Israel Seeger.         Miss Merrill was a featured actress and singer in several movies, among them "Time Out for Rhythm" (1941) and "Iceland" (1942), in which she introduced the song "There Will Never Be Another You," which became a pop standard.         Miss Merrill was born in Baltimore. She began her career in the 1930's on radio and later sang in nightclubs across the country, including the Copacabana in New York, the Thunderbird Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., and the Rio Cabana in Chicago.         She is survived, in addition to her husband, by two sons, William and Michael, both of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.       
         Geraldine Delaney Harris, a dancer and singer who appeared in several Broadway musicals in the 1950's, died on Friday at her home in Pomona, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died after a short illness, her family said.         Mrs. Harris, who was known professionally as Geraldine Delaney, appeared in "Where's Charley?," the original production of "Guys and Dolls," "Wonderful Town" and "Silk Stockings."         She is survived by her husband, Joseph, a theatrical producer and manager; three sons, James, of Pomona, Jeremiah, of New York City, and Joseph Jr., of Teaneck, N.J., and a daughter, Jennifer, of New York City.       
         Georgia Brown, a gravelly voiced singer and an earthy actress who originated the role of Nancy in the musical "Oliver!," died yesterday in London. She was 57 years old and lived in Hollywood.         She died at Charing Cross Hospital, The Associated Press reported, saying her death was after a brief illness. She was in London to appear in a tribute to Sammy Davis Jr. at the Drury Lane Theater.         She was named Lillian Klot at her birth in the East End of London, and she took her professional name from "Sweet Georgia Brown" and "Georgia on My Mind," two of the standards she belted out night after night as she made the rounds of dance halls and cabarets in the 1950's. She was also known for performing bluesy ballads and dancing with a neighbor, Vidal Sassoon. (She was his first customer when he opened his first salon in 1954.)         "The nightclub floor is such an incredible teacher," she said in 1963. "It gives you contact with an audience; the legitimate theater rarely talks back to you. Nightclubs teach you discipline, concentration, control." Even Lenya Was Pleased         From jazz, she turned to acting, appearing on British television in "Mother Courage and Her Children" and, in 1955, in "The Threepenny Opera," by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht, in London. In New York, she succeeded Lotte Lenya at the Theatre de Lys in Greenwich Village. Referring to Weill's widow and a role in the Brecht-Weill classic, Miss Brown boasted that "even Lotte Lenya thinks I can do Jenny."         But she was best known for a role that grew out of an unexpected moment at a 1960 audition. The producer of "Oliver!," Lionel Bart, had grown up in the same neighborhood and recognized her when she walked in, shouting the name he knew her by. Flustered, she took a moment to respond, since she was no longer Lily Klot. But after seeing her perform, he decided she was just what he needed and wrote "As Long As He Needs Me" and "It's a Fine Life" for her.         "I don't know anything about acting yet, but I keep studying as much as I can," she said after performing the role both on Broadway and in London.         She was nominated in 1963 for a Tony Award as best actress for her role in "Oliver!," but lost to Vivian Leigh for "Tovarich." Stint as BBC Producer         In the 1970's Miss Brown was a producer for the BBC. She produced and appeared in "Shoulder to Shoulder," a history of the women's movement at the turn of the century that was shown in this country as a six-part "Masterpiece Theater" series on public television.         In 1979, she starred as a volcanic Italian heroine opposite Cesare Siepi in the Alan Jay Lerner-Joseph Stein-Burton Lane musical "Carmelina." It closed after 17 performances. Steven Berkoff's "Greek," in which she also appeared, did not last much longer, though she received generally good reviews, as she did in "Roza" on Broadway in 1987. She also appeared in a solo show, "Georgia Brown and Friends."         Miss Brown is survived by a son, Jonathan.       
         Jean T. Chorley, a former professional singer and a civic leader, died on Saturday at her home in Skillman, N.J. She was 88 years old.         She had a history of heart disease and died in her sleep, her family said.         From 1934-41 she sang professionally as a mezzo-soprano under the stage name of Jean Travers. She performed at Radio City Music Hall, with the St. Louis Opera Company, on the Rudy Vallee and Chase & Sanborn radio shows and in concerts nationally and in Canada and Europe.         She was born Jeanette Baumohl in Manhattan. Her first husband, Morris Treistman, died in 1937. She remarried in 1941, to Kenneth Chorley.         Mr. Chorley, a close associate of Laurance S. and John D. Rockefeller Jr., served for 23 years as president of the Colonial Williamsburg restoration project and was an officer of several nonprofit organizations.         During that period, Mrs. Chorley and her husband entertained foreign officials and royalty. In the 1950's they restored an old brick farmhouse in Hopewell, N.J., and filled it with 18th-century antiques and English pottery. Mr. Chorley died in 1974.         Mrs. Chorley served as the board president of the Old Barracks Association, an American Revolution historical organization in Trenton, and also coached the lay readers at the Trinity Episcopalian Church in Princeton.         Surviving are a stepson, Edward C. Chorley of White Plains, 5 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Laurie E. Colwin, a novelist and writer of short stories on modern urban romance and life, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 48 years old.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Ms. Colwin's writing won praise for its intelligence, wit and style. Critics said she displayed a keen ear and eye for the ways of the middle- and upper-class New York characters she portrayed. Her stories were noted for refreshingly happy endings in tales of love, both in and outside of marriage.         A New York Times review said she "uses her elegant, delicately colored prose to explore the effects of a relationship on a psyche." The Village Voice said her work "conjures up Manet's picnic painting as it might be reinterpreted by Koren," the cartoonist.         Judith Rascoe said in Rolling Stone: "I can't give you plot summaries that you can retell at your next party. But when you've read the stories, your next party might may seem to you as if Laurie Colwin had written it."         Ms. Colwin's four novels were "Goodbye Without Leaving" (Poseidon, 1990), "Family Happiness" (Knopf, 1982), "Happy All the Time" (Knopf, 1978) and "Shine On, Bright and Dangerous Object" (Viking, 1975). A Focus on Food         Her three collections of short stories were "Another Marvelous Thing" (Knopf, 1986), "The Lone Pilgrim" (Knopf, 1981) and "Passage and Affect" (Viking, 1974). Some of her work was adapted for stage and television.         She also worked as a translator for Isaac Bashevis Singer and wrote for The New Yorker, Mademoiselle and Redbook.         In 1987 Ms. Colwin won a Guggenheim fellowship.         Food was also a focus of her life.  During the campus uprisings at Columbia University in 1968, she cooked forstudent protesters occupying buildings. Later she was a volunteer and a cook for the Coalition for the Homeless and the Antonio Olivieri Shelter for Homeless Women.         She was also a food columnist for Gourmet magazine and wrote two volumes of essays and recipes, "Home Cooking" (Knopf, 1988) and "More Home Cooking" (HarperCollins, 1990).         Born in Manhattan, Ms. Colwin grew up in Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., Chicago and Philadelphia. She attended Bard College and Columbia University.         She worked for literary agents and on publishers' editorial staffs at Viking, Putnam, Pantheon and Dutton.  Then she began trying her own hand at writing and sold her first story to The New Yorker.         Surviving are her husband of nine years, Juris Jurjevics, the editor in chief of the Soho Press, and the couple's daughter, Rosa Audrey. She is also survived by her mother, Estelle Snellenberg, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Leslie Friedman, of Philadelphia.

         Dorothy Kirsten, an American lyric soprano who sang leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera for 30 years and was particularly renowned for her performances of Puccini heroines, died yesterday morning at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of complications from a stroke she suffered on Nov. 5, said Peter Gravina, her longtime press representative.         At the height of her career, in the 1950's and 60's, Miss Kirsten appealed not only to opera fans, who knew her as an attractive, intelligent, thoroughly musical singer and a fine actress, but also to a broader public that knew her from her frequent radio and television appearances or from her performances in the films "The Great Caruso," with Mario Lanza, and "Mr. Music," with Bing Crosby.         On the opera stage, her repertory ran from staples like Mimi in Puccini's "Boheme" to comparative rarities like the title role in Charpentier's "Louise." In her concert and television appearances, she sang not only opera arias but theater and popular songs as well, and she co-starred with Frank Sinatra on the radio show "Your Hit Parade." Musical Heritage         Miss Kirsten was born into a musical family in Montclair, N.J., on July 6, 1910 (although she gave her birth year variously as 1917 and 1915). Her mother was an organist and music teacher. Her great-aunt, Catherine Hayes, had an operatic career and was known as "The Irish Jenny Lind." Her grandfather was a conductor and an early president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians.         She was drawn to music and acting early in life, but did not set her sights on an operatic career until she had achieved some modest success as a popular singer. After leaving high school when she was 16 years old, Miss Kirsten worked as a demonstrator of Singer sewing machines and as what she called a trouble-shooter at New Jersey Telephone, while studying voice in New York City at night. When she had made some progress and wanted more frequent lessons than she could afford, she agreed to work for her teacher, Louis Darnay, as both secretary and maid in exchange for lessons.         By 1937, she was singing professionally on radio, both as a member of the Kate Smith Chorus and in her own solo spots with several dance orchestras. The soprano Grace Moore heard her in 1938 and became her mentor and benefactor, sending her to Rome for a year of study with Astolfo Pescia, who was Beniamino Gigli's vocal coach. She had planned to spend a second year in Italy and then a year in France, but returned to New York at the start of World War II.         Upon her return in 1939, Miss Kirsten made her professional concert debut in a stage show at the New York World's Fair. She was also reunited with Miss Moore, who recommended her to the Chicago Grand Opera, where Miss Kirsten made her operatic debut as Pousette in Massenet's "Manon" in 1940. Miss Kirsten sang 15 minor roles during her first season and the following year shared the stage with Miss Moore in a Chicago performance of "La Boheme," singing Musetta to Miss Moore's Mimi.         In 1942, Miss Kirsten began to sing leading roles with the San Carlo Opera Company, in Washington and New York City. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1943, and by 1945 had performed with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras. Starting in September 1943, she had her own radio program, "Keepsakes," which ran for a year.         Miss Kirsten's Metropolitan Opera debut, as Mimi in "La Boheme" on Dec. 1, 1945, was a critical success, and was the start of a 30-year association with the house. In 1971, when she celebrated her 25th anniversary with the company, she reminisced about that debut, and recalled that Miss Moore sat in the first box, at the side of the stage, and threw roses to her. When Miss Moore died in a plane crash in Denmark in 1947, Miss Kirsten sang Schubert's "Ave Maria" at her funeral.         Miss Kirsten's career was centered in the United States, but she did tour Europe and, in 1962, the Soviet Union. There, besides giving recitals, she sang Violetta in a Bolshoi Opera performance of "La Traviata," to considerable acclaim, even though, as she said later, she had to go on without the benefit of a stage rehearsal. Worked With Composers         During her years at the Met, Miss Kirsten sang most of the important Puccini roles, including the title roles in "Manon Lescaut," "Tosca" and "Madama Butterfly," and she starred as Minnie in a revival of "La Fanciulla del West" that helped restore the work to the repertory. She prepared for the title role in "Louise" by going to France to study it with the composer. She also worked with the composer Italo Montemezzi on "L'Amore dei Tre Re" before she performed it in San Francisco and at the Met.         In addition to the Puccini heroines, her repertory included the female leads in Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette" and "Faust," Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Verdi's "Traviata." She sang in the American premieres of Walton's "Troilus and Cressida" and Poulenc's "Dialogue des Carmelites," both in San Francisco.         Miss Kirsten's voice was not huge, but she used it gracefully throughout her long career. When she gave her farewell performance at the Met, on Dec. 31, 1976, Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times that "she sang and acted the part of Tosca with the vocal control and dramatic acuity of a prima donna in mid-career."         In an article she wrote for Opera News just before that performance, Miss Kirsten attributed her vocal longevity to her refusal to accept roles that she felt were too heavy for her voice.         "I've always believed in the principle of protection, and I never sang a role I felt was not right for my voice," she wrote. "This took courage and drew some criticism along the way, but after 30 years of preserving Puccini's legato and tessitura I don't have to apologize to anyone, do I?"  Video Releases         Miss Kirsten's autobiography, "A Time to Sing," was published in 1982. Recently, several of her television performances on the "Voice of Firestone" program, including the Poker Scene from "Fanciulla," "Vissi d'Arte" from "Tosca" and several popular songs, have been released on tape by Video Arts International. And her recordings of several Romberg operettas have been reissued by Angel Records.         Miss Kirsten's first marriage, to Edward MacKayes Oates, ended in divorce in 1949. In 1951 she married Dr. Eugene Chapman, who died in 1954. In 1955, she married Dr. John Douglas French, a neurosurgeon who was director of the Brain Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. When Dr. French developed Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980's, Miss Kirsten testified at a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and in 1983 she set up the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research. Dr. French died in 1989.         She is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Parker of Tucson, Ariz., and Ethel Anderson of Lenoir, N.C., and a brother, George, also of Lenoir.
