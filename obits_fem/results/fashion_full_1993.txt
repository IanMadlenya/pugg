         Patricia Brooks Mann, a lyric soprano who helped fashion the modern standard for opera performers, died on Friday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 59.         She died of complications of multiple sclerosis, said her husband, Theodore D. Mann, the artistic director and co-founder of Circle in the Square Theater.         In an era when audiences and critics began demanding that opera performers display dramatic as well as musical talent, Ms. Brooks, who performed under her maiden name, arrived with a non-operatic training that fit the bill.         Her distinctive style drew on her earlier career in the theater and dance. Her opera performances won praise for her beauty, acting ability and graceful movements, as well as for her voice. Some classified her as a singing actress rather than an opera singer.         "The public was clamoring that opera performers had to look and act the part, not just sing it, and she was the new wave," said Beverly Sills, her famed contemporary at the New York City Opera. Command Performance         Ms. Brooks starred in numerous City Opera productions in the 1960's and 1970's, when she was in her 30's and 40's. She also sang with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and was a soloist at Carnegie and Alice Tully Halls, Covent Gardens in London and in concerts across the United States. She gave a White House command performance for President John F. Kennedy.         In an early review, Raymond Ericson of The New York Times wrote that as Gilda in "Rigoletto" in 1963, "Miss Brooks was attractive to both eye and ear, a musicianly artist and an intelligent actress." When she co-starred with Placido Domingo in "La Traviata" in 1966, Harold C. Schonberg's review praised her for "acting with a delicacy of detail rare in opera."         Her performances proved popular with audiences. An account of her appearance in "La Boheme" in 1961 said she "very nearly stopped the show." A review of "Tales of Hoffmann" in 1966 said she "brought down the house." And a report of her singing of Bellini with Marilyn Horne in 1971 said listeners were driven "into a frenzy." Studied Dance         Ms. Brooks was born in Manhattan. As a youngster she took lessons in music, ballet and acting and at the age of 10 won a WQXR-radio piano competition. She attended the High School of Music and Art and at 14 began studying dance with Martha Graham.         But a knee injury from a fall turned her from dance to theater. She auditioned for Mr. Mann, who was smitten and confided to his partner, Jose Quintero, that he intended to marry the aspiring actress.         Mr. Quintero cast her in Truman Capote's "The Grass Harp" and in "The Iceman Cometh," with Jason Robards and Peter Falk, and she studied acting under Uta Hagen.         Ms. Brooks began folk singing and appearing in musicals, encouraged by her mother, Eda, a voice coach. While singing in the chorus of nuns in "The Sound of Music" in 1960, Ms. Brooks decided to leave that Broadway hit and switch to opera.         Maturing rapidly in her new medium, she won an enviable array of praise. Critics hailed her performances as charming, bewitching and dazzling. Her voice was described as sweet, velvety, free-floating, delicate, warm and rich. Her acting was called nuanced, subtle, sensitive, elegant, expressive and exciting.         Although it was undisclosed, eventually multiple sclerosis limited her breathing, so she retired from performing in 1977. But she began teaching voice and directing productions at the State University of New York at Purchase and gave private lessons for several years.         When illness forced an end to her teaching, she turned her creative energies to oil and water-color painting.         Besides her husband and mother, Ms. Brooks is survived by two sons, Jonathan and Andrew, both of Manhattan and Mount Kisco; a stepbrother, Alan Brooks, and a sister, Joan Brooks Palermo, both of Manhattan.         A memorial service will be held at noon on Feb. 1 at Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway at 50th Street.       
         Hannah Troy, an influential women's fashion designer and manufacturer who invented the petite size and introduced modern Italian styles to the United States, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Miami Beach, where she lived. She was 93.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Her two major contributions to fashion resulted from chance and keen observation.         "I was at a May Company store in California when I noticed women pulling at their shoulders and waistlines and saw that most dresses didn't fit properly," she recalled from the late 1940's. Alterations were troublesome and sometimes spoiled the design.         On a hunch that the long-waisted ideal female form was more myth than reality, she studied measurements the military had made of women who volunteered in World War II. The statistics confirmed that the typical woman was short-waisted.         So Mrs. Troy introduced the petite size, saying, "The word had a nice ring." The concept proved a popular success. The Italian Look         Her next innovation came in 1951. After the annual Paris fashion shows, she took a side trip to Florence. Impressed with its fashions, she bought samples and returned home promoting the Italian look.         The following season, 300 American fashion representatives showed up in Italy and a new era began.         In the mid-1960's she advocated the tent dress so "the woman who is a little plump can look stylish."         Mrs. Troy described her fashions as "elegant, somewhat classic, timeless, the kind a woman can add to from year to year." She produced blouses, dresses, gowns and suits, favoring silk, wool, tweed, linen, taffeta and satin.         Her career was at its peak from the late 1940's until her retirement in 1968. She supplied top Manhattan stores like Saks, Bergdorf Goodman, Bonwit Teller, Henri Bendel, Lord & Taylor, B. Altman and Bloomingdale's. Pat Nixon and Mamie Van Doren were among her customers.         Mrs. Troy, a Brooklyn native, grew up in the garment industry.         "I started sewing as soon as I could thread a needle," she said. By 12 she was making dresses for her sisters. As a teen-ager, she was a model. After graduating as the valedictorian at Erasmus Hall High School, she worked at a blouse company, then opened her business.         She supported charities and made a personal cause of the Mazzini School in Florence after learning that some poor students took turns going to class because their families had only one coat and one pair of shoes to share among the siblings.         Mrs. Troy had three marriages, to Aaron Hartman, Theodore Troy and Max Meyer, all deceased.         She is survived by a son from her first marriage, William J. Troy, and a sister, Shirley Stern, both of Miami, and two grandchildren.       
         Irene Sharaff, who designed costumes for Hollywood and Broadway, winning five Academy Awards and a Tony, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The immediate cause was congestive heart failure, said Jean B. Angell, a close friend who was also her lawyer. Ms. Angell said Ms. Sharaff had had emphysema.         In a career of more than half a century, Ms. Sharaff designed costumes for actors including Yul Brynner, Gertrude Lawrence, Gypsy Rose Lee, Judy Garland, Mary Astor, Pearl Bailey, Anouk Aimee, Gene Kelly, Sidney Poitier, Sammy Davis Jr., Elizabeth Taylor and Rex Harrison. 60 Shows, 40 Films         She also worked in television, ballet, nightclubs and fashion illustration.         Her last Broadway show was "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," a 1989 musical that won six Tonys. She recreated costumes for several scenes from "The King and I" and "West Side Story."         Ms. Sharaff (pronounced SHAR-eff) designed costumes for more than 60 stage productions, including "As Thousands Cheer," "Lady in the Dark," "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" and "Idiot's Delight." Sometimes she designed the sets as well. She won two Donaldson Awards and a Tony.         She also worked on 40 films and received 15 Oscar nominations. She often designed clothes for both stage and screen productions of the same work, as with "Funny Girl," "Flower Drum Song," "West Side Story" and "The King and I."         Her sumptuous array of vibrant Thai silk costumes for "The King and I" in 1951 created a sensation in the world of high fashion and interior decoration, and she won her Tony for her designs. Within a few years of the show, silk became Thailand's best-known export. Seeing Blocks of Color         Ms. Sharaff, who once wanted to be a painter, said she saw everything in blocks of color, "rather like painting a picture." Speaking of her work, Ms. Sharaff said in a 1970 interview, "If I have a leitmotif, a logo, I suspect it is associated with the colors I prefer -- reds, pinks, oranges -- and with a certain cut which seems to reappear in many of the shows and films I've worked on."         "You can acquire chic and elegance, but style itself is a rare thing," Ms. Sharaff said in a 1967 interview. "The only theater people I can think of who have it are Audrey Hepburn and Betty Bacall. The one who had it to the greatest degree was Gertie Lawrence. She could make a sackcloth tied with a belt look stylish."         She first attracted attention in 1932, as designer of scenery and costumes for Eva Le Gallienne's "Alice in Wonderland." Two years later, the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo shattered its nationalist tradition by hiring her to design the scenery and costumes for "Union Pacific" and Stravinsky's "Poker Game." She also designed costumes for American Ballet Theater and the New York City Ballet.         Her first Oscar honored her scenery and costumes in the ballet sequence in M-G-M's 1951 production of "An American in Paris." In 1956, she won another for her work on Samuel Goldwyn's 1956 film of "The King and I."         Her other Oscars were for "West Side Story" in 1961, "Cleopatra" in 1963 and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" in 1966. She also worked on "Madame Curie," "The Best Years of Our Lives," "Meet Me in St. Louis," "Guys and Dolls," "Brigadoon," "Justine," "Porgy and Bess" and "Hello, Dolly!" Began as Fashion Illustrator         Ms. Sharaff was born in Boston and studied at the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts, the Arts Students League and the Grande Chaumiere in Paris. For a time she did fashion illustrations for American Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and other magazines.         After her debut with "Alice in Wonderland," she was regularly represented on Broadway with one or more productions a season until 1972. In 1976, she designed the costumes and scenery for a new production of "Fanfare" by the New York City Ballet. Her last films were "The Other Side of Midnight" (1977) and "Mommie Dearest" (1981).       
         Nadia Stark, a founder and president of the Stark Carpet Corporation in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital. She was 81.         The cause was cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Stark, who was a fashion model in the 1930's, designed women's hats for several years before helping her husband, Arthur Stark, found Stark Carpets in 1935. The company caters primarily to decorators and their clientele, and has provided carpet designs for the White House, the Smithsonian Institution and Gracie Mansion.         Mrs. Stark was active in the operation of the company until her illness forced her to retire early this year. Her sons, Steven and John, now run the company, which also imports rugs and manufactures other types of floor coverings.         After Mr. Stark died in 1968, Mrs. Stark married Dr. David Anderman, an eye surgeon. He died in 1978. Mrs. Stark then married Theodore Silbert, chairman of the board of Sterling National Bank, who died last year.         Mrs. Stark is survived by her sons, both of Manhattan; a sister, Bea Zolt of Manhattan; two brothers, Mitchell and Bernard Snitkim, both of Miami, and five grandchildren.       
         Joan Sibley, a fashion designer whose work is included in the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Tuesday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. She was 52.         The cause was Burkitt's lymphoma, a rare form of cancer, said her husband, Peter Powell.         Ms. Sibley started her career in a small design studio she established on East 58th Street in Manhattan. She founded Sibley Coffee Ltd. with a fellow designer, Dory Coffee, in 1966. The company's popular silk jersey body dresses were sold in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, and private customers included Jacqueline Onassis, Babe Paley and Candice Bergen.         Born in Gipsy, Pa., she attended the Moore College of Art in Philadelphia and received a fellowship to travel and study in Europe, where she attended design classes at the Sorbonne.         Sibley Coffee was made a part of the Bendel's Studio Group in 1973 and closed in 1977. Ms. Sibley went on to work as associate designer for Ellen Tracy until 1980, when she left to work as a display designer and sales representative for Yale Burg, an antiques importing company in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband and a son, Gus Powell, who attends Oberlin College in Ohio.
