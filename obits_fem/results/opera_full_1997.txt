         Katharine Homer Fryer, an artist, teacher and writer who devoted much of her later life to the mentally disturbed, died Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 89 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         At her death, she was president of the Schizophrenia Foundation of New York, which provides information on alternative treatments for the illness. She headed the foundation since 1969, shortly after its creation.         She also was director emeritus of the Fryer Research Center, an outpatient clinic in the former Murray Hill Hospital on East 40th Street in Manhattan. It offers a biochemical-nutritional approach to emotional and mental conditions, like schizophrenia and depression, as well as physical disorders.         She founded the nonprofit center in 1971 to help people who could not otherwise afford such treatment, and remained its director until a few months ago. Her daughter and successor, Dr. Kathy Fryer, estimated yesterday that the center had served more than 10,000 people and their families.         Mrs. Fryer's dedication stemmed in large part from living with mental illness in her immediate family. One of her five daughters, Barbara, committed suicide in 1968 at age 31, after spending 10 years in a succession of treatments for schizophrenia.         In a new book, ''The Story of Barbara,'' Mrs. Fryer wrote of her daughter's condition, which might have had a different outcome with the alternative treatments for schizophrenia emerging then. The book is to be published by Rivercross Publishing later this year.         An earlier book was ''Kathy: A Mother's True Story of a Young Girl's Fight to Regain Health'' (Dutton, 1956). It told of her daughter Kathy's successful emergence from a mysterious ailment that befell her at 13 and a mother's years of searching for the right diagnosis and cure.         Mrs. Fryer wrote of the ''unexpected, miraculous'' deliverance when Kathy's condition was recognized and swiftly overcome. It proved to be a complex case of severe thyroid deficiency aggravated by psychological problems.         Mrs. Fryer published a second book in 1994, ''Till Death Do Us Part,'' on life with her husband, Dr. Douglas Fryer, a pioneer in industrial psychology and a prolific author, whom she married in 1934. A former head of the Department of Psychology at New York University, he died in 1960.         Katharine Homer was born in New York City to two well-known parents, Sidney Homer, a composer of chamber music and songs, and Louise Homer, a Metropolitan Opera contralto. In the 1920's, she studied piano, singing and painting under distinguished teachers at the Curtis Institute of Music, Mannes College of Music and the Arts League in New York, and at l'Ecole Julienne in Paris.         For several years, she traveled as her mother's accompanist before touring on her own as a solo pianist and with chamber music groups. She exhibited her paintings in New York and Paris.         In 1932, she organized a 50-member girls' choir in Scarsdale, N.Y., and directed it until 1951. She also organized and directed an adult choir in Rye, N.Y., in the 1960's.         All along, until her work at the foundation and center became a primary occupation, she privately taught piano, singing and painting. She also served stints as a piano teacher at the Manhattan School of Music in the 1930's, and more recently at the Brearley School.         Besides Dr. Fryer, a Manhattan resident, she is survived by three other daughters, Dr. Judith Shedden, Anne Eddis and Dr. Sarah Leibowitz, all of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Ardis Krainik, who in 15 years as general director rescued the Lyric Opera of Chicago from financial peril and established it as a company renowned for its forward-looking programming, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 67.         Ms. Krainik, who had been ill in recent years, announced last June  that she would retire in April. But when her health took a turn for the worse in November, her successor, William Mason, took over as director.         Ms. Krainik was an imposing figure who knew what she wanted for her company and how to get it through inspiration rather than force, although she was not averse to making bold decisions. She made international headlines in 1989, for example, when she announced that Luciano Pavarotti was no longer welcome at the company after he dropped out of a ''Tosca'' production on three weeks' notice. Pointing out that Mr. Pavarotti had bowed out of 26 of his last 41 scheduled appearances at the Lyric, Ms. Krainik said  she was afraid Mr. Pavarotti's unreliability would offend subscribers.         In a way, Ms. Krainik was the personification of the Lyric Opera. She joined the company as a secretary to its founder, Carol Fox, during its first season, and she spent her entire career there. There was little in the company's operation with which she did not have firsthand experience.         A mezzo-soprano who had performing aspirations early on, she sang small roles during her first five years at the company but gave up the stage in 1960 when she was appointed assistant manager. In that job, and later as artistic administrator, she had a hand in everything from pitching in to solve production problems to negotiating artist fees and helping plan seasons. When Fox resigned in 1981, Ms. Krainik was her logical successor.         When she took over the company, it was on the brink of financial collapse. Its endowment had shriveled to $6,000 from nearly $3 million, and cost overruns on an adventurous production of Krzysztof Penderecki's ''Paradise Lost'' in 1978 and on the  elaborate 25th-anniversary celebration in 1979, left the Lyric Opera with a $1.2 million deficit. Ms. Krainik's first task was to restructure the company's operations, cutting $500,000 from its budget in the process.         ''One of the things I did was say no, which had not been done enough in the past,'' Ms. Krainik said in a 1982 interview. ''We gave up space in our building, allowed attrition to run its course, cut back on orchestra rehearsals and did away with all nonessentials. We began to recycle products and borrow stage sets instead of designing all our own.''         She restored the company's fortunes quickly, and by 1993 she had raised much of the money required for a $100 million project to purchase and restore the company's home, the Civic Opera House.         Artistically, too, Ms. Krainik undertook a crucial renovation project. Although the company had always presented contemporary work, she made its commitment to modern opera formal in 1989, when she announced ''Toward the 21st Century,'' a decadelong series that would include two 20th-century operas every season: 10 by American composers, 10 by Europeans, with newly commissioned works along the way.         William Bolcom's ''McTeague,'' Bright Sheng's ''Song of Majnun'' and Bruce Saylor's ''Orpheus Descending'' had their premieres in the series; Shulamit Ran's ''Between Two Worlds'' and Anthony Davis's ''Amistad'' are scheduled for 1997. Other works presented as part of the project include Samuel Barber's ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' John Corigliano's ''Ghosts of Versailles'' and Carlisle Floyd's ''Susannah.''         Ardis Joan Krainik was born in Manitowoc, Wis., in 1929. She began taking singing lessons when she was 14 and became interested in theater when she got a part in a school play. She continued her musical and theatrical studies at Northwestern University, but her degree was in speech pedagogy.         She taught briefly after her graduation in 1951, but when the Lyric was founded, originally as the Lyric Theater, she joined it as a secretary, chorister and occasional soloist. Her first role was as Rossweisse, a minor Valkyrie in ''Die Walkure,'' in 1956.  She became assistant manager in 1960 and artistic administrator in 1975.         By 1980 Ms. Krainik had grown restless at the Lyric Opera, where her further career prospects seemed limited, and where the dire financial situation had made the company itself unstable. She considered an offer to become general manager of the Australian Opera, in Sydney, and in December 1980 she informed the Lyric Opera board that she would be leaving. But at the same time, Fox resigned because of poor health, and the Lyric Opera board offered the general directorship to Ms. Krainik.         Under her leadership, the company typically presented seven productions each season, but covered a great expanse of the repertory, from Handel operas through newly commissioned works, as well as a complete Wagner ''Ring'' cycle, staged between 1993 and 1996.         She hired fashionable directors and designers, from David Hockney, who designed a production of Puccini's ''Turandot,'' to Robert Wilson, who directed Gluck's ''Alceste'' and Peter Sellars, who presented a controversial, high-tech staging of Wagner's ''Tannhauser'' in which different sets of supertitles conveyed both the actual libretto and Mr. Sellars's notions of the characters' inner motivations.         And although the company always attracted great singers -- Maria Callas sang there during its first season -- Ms. Krainik raised the level of the company's casting. Marilyn Horne, Placido Domingo, Jessye Norman, Kiri Te Kanawa, Jon Vickers, Samuel Ramey, Renee Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky frequented her productions. Many of the opera world's biggest stars turned up to sing at a gala concert in her honor in October.         She is survived by her niece, Barbara Baule of Cedarburg, Wisc., a brother-in-law, J. Edward Mueller, of Dubuque, Iowa, and two nephews, Stephen Mueller of Dallas and Scott Mueller, of Dubuque.         Ms. Krainik was particularly proud of her ''Toward the 21st Century'' series, a program that proved that opera audiences were not thwarted by new works. Every season since the series began, Ms. Krainik proudly reported, was entirely sold out.         ''I want American opera to reach its zenith,'' she said in 1990. ''I think it can blossom in the next 10 years. We have to have our own unique American opera, not just a hashed-over European art form. I think now is the time, and I want to be behind making it flower.         ''I want my audience to be happy with what I do; I want them to have a good time. That's the only hope for American music -- that audiences will love it.''       
         Myfanwy Piper, an English art critic and the librettist for three of Benjamin Britten's operas, died last Saturday at Fawley Bottom, the farmhouse home near Henley, England, that was a center of artistic activity in the 1940's and 50's. She was 85.         Ms. Piper's most enduring work is the deftly written libretto she supplied for Britten's ''Turn of the Screw'' in 1954. It was, in fact, Ms. Piper's suggestion that Britten base on opera on the Henry James novella about a governess who wrestles with a pair of ghosts she believes are corrupting the children in her care.         Ms. Piper had known Britten since the mid-1940's, when her husband, the artist John Piper, designed the sets for several operas, including ''The Rape of Lucretia'' and ''Billy Budd.'' But when she suggested ''The Turn of the Screw'' as a subject, Ms. Piper did not expect to write the libretto herself.         ''I think he turned to me,'' she told Britten's biographer, Humphrey Carpenter, ''because, with the 'Lucretias' and 'Herrings' and the various things which John and I had been through with Ben, he often talked to us about the words. He'd say, 'What am I to do here? I don't like this,' and I was very much aware of the kind of things he didn't like. So although I hadn't got any qualifications for writing a libretto, it didn't disturb me.''         But Ms. Piper did, by then, have ample qualifications as a writer. Ms. Piper, whose name was originally  Mary Myfanwy (pronounced mih-VAHN-wih) Evans in London in 1911, she was educated at St. Hugh's College, Oxford, where she pursued interests in art and literature. After discovering the works of Mondrian and Kandinsky during a visit to Paris in 1934, she founded and edited Axis, an English review of abstract art that promoted the British and French avant-garde. She edited the journal from 1935 to 1937.         It was also in 1934 that she met John Piper at a summer painting party in Suffolk. The two married in 1937 and settled at Fawley Bottom, a flint-and-brick farmhouse that quickly became the regular meeting place of a circle of artists, musicians, architects and poets, including Alexander Calder, Kenneth Clark and John Betjeman. Betjeman wrote two poems about Ms. Piper, ''Myfanwy'' and ''Myfanwy at Oxford,'' both published in 1940. Mr. Piper died in 1992.         Besides editing Axis, Ms. Piper edited a book of essays, ''The Painter's Object,'' and wrote a biography of Frances Hodgkins for the Penguin Modern Painters series. From the late 1930's through the early 50's, she worked mainly as her husband's assistant and brought up their four children, of which one son and two daughters survive.         There was a long hiatus between ''The Turn of the Screw'' and Ms. Piper's next libretto for Britten, but in 1968, when Britten was commissioned to write an opera for television, he settled on another Henry James story, ''Owen Wingrave,'' and revived the collaboration that had worked so well in ''The Turn of the Screw.''         Soon after ''Owen Wingrave'' had its premiere, in 1971, Britten invited Ms. Piper to write a libretto for what would be his final opera, ''Death in Venice,'' based on the Thomas Mann novel.         Ms. Piper also wrote a play, ''The Diary of a Seducer,'' based on Kierkegaard, as well as the librettos for Malcolm Williamson's ''Easter'' and several operas by the Welsh composer Alun Hoddinot, including ''What the Old Man Does Is Always Right,'' ''The Rajah's Diamond'' and ''The Trumpet Major.''       
         Lois Marshall, a leading Canadian soprano in the 1950's and 60's, died on Feb. 19 at Women's College Hospital in Toronto. She was 72 and lived in Toronto.         The cause was complications from exploratory cancer surgery, her family said.         Ms. Marshall was born in Toronto and began studying voice there at age 12 with Weldon Kilburn.         After winning prestigious awards in Canada, she made her New York City debut in 1952 at Town Hall as a Naumburg Foundation prize winner. She embarked on an international career as a lieder and oratorio singer, appearing with such conductors as Arturo Toscanini, Sir Thomas Beecham and Leonard Bernstein. She also toured extensively with the New York-based Bach Aria Group.         Although she often sang operatic arias in recitals, the lasting effects of polio made it nearly impossible for her to perform in staged opera productions. She gave her farewell recital in 1982 but continued teaching voice at the University of Toronto.         She is survived by three sisters, Patricia Mason, Rhoda Scott and Rita Duckworth, all of Toronto.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice.         She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.         In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.         Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.         Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, ''Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer''.         While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.         During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.         An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.         A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled ''A World to Live In'' from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published ''Twice a Year,'' a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were ''The Selected Writings of John Marin'' (1949); ''Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend'' (1985) and ''Encounters: a Memoir'' (1987). In 1965 she published ''Nehru: The First Sixty Years,'' a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.         In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.         Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died Saturday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection, and despite those comforts, developed an early sense of social justice.

As she later put it, her life developed around a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.       
         Bessie Schonberg, one of America's most influential teachers of dance composition and a mentor to several generations of dancers, died yesterday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 90.         Few dance educators were as respected as Miss Schonberg and because of the devoted attention she gave to students, few were as beloved. In recognition of her importance to dance, Dance Theater Workshop in 1984 named its annual New York Dance and Performance Awards the Bessies; it also dedicated its theater in Chelsea to her.         Miss Schonberg had an abiding interest in all forms of dance and taught choreographic fundamentals with equal sensitivity to modern dancers and ballet dancers and to traditionalists and experimentalists. She often told students and interviewers that the only thing dance should never be is dull.         She first attracted national attention for her dance composition classes at Sarah Lawrence College, where she began teaching in 1938. Her students there included such diverse dancers and choreographers as Lucinda Childs, Meredith Monk, Elizabeth Keen and Carolyn Adams. Although she retired from Sarah Lawrence in 1975, she never retired from teaching, and at the time of her death she was offering courses at the Juilliard School and New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.         In recent years she had also taught at Dance Theater of Harlem and Dance Theater Workshop. This summer she had planned to be choreographic adviser for Dancing in the Streets at Wave Hill and to teach at the Yard on Martha's Vineyard and at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Massachusetts. She was named this year's recipient of the American Dance Festival's Balasaraswati/Joy Ann Dewey Beinecke Award for Distinguished Teaching.         Miss Schonberg was born in Hanover, Germany. Her mother, an American opera singer, worked in Europe before World War I and married in Germany. After the war, Miss Schonberg's parents separated and her mother returned with her children to the United States and taught music at the University of Oregon in Eugene. Miss Schonberg attended that university and met Martha Hill, a dance teacher there who later founded such major institutions as the Bennington School of the Dance and the American Dance Festival.         With Miss Hill's encouragement, Miss Schonberg moved to New York in 1929, studied with Martha Graham and was briefly a member of the Graham company until an injury ended her performing career in 1931. She then studied at Bennington College, joining its faculty in 1934. Over the years she also taught at the American Dance Festival and many colleges and dance centers in the United States and Britain.         Miss Schonberg was on advisory panels for the New York State Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1988 she received a Bessie Award of her own for lifetime service to dance.         She is survived by a sister, Helga Hadsall, of Eugene.       
         Thelma Biracree Schnepel, who danced with Martha Graham in 1926 in her first concert, died on May 12 at the Harborside Health Care center in Fort Wayne, Ind. She was 93 and lived in Fort Wayne.         Known professionally by her maiden name, Miss Biracree danced early in her career with the Eastman Theater Ballet in Rochester, where she grew up. She also performed in Paris before becoming a member of Graham's first company, which consisted of the choreographer and a trio of young women. Miss Biracree continued as an assistant to Graham for several years.         In 1931 she created an evening of ballets to music by American composers for the first Festival of American Music in Rochester, and choreographed and danced for the festival for the next two decades. Miss Biracree also provided dances and performers for productions by the Eastman School Opera Department in Rochester, and was a regional representative for the Lincoln Kirstein-George Balanchine School of American Ballet.         After the festival was discontinued, she helped found the Mercury Ballet Company of Rochester, taught at her own ballet school and choreographed for the Rochester Music Theater. In 1967 Miss Biracree moved to Fort Wayne, where she choreographed for the Fort Wayne Ballet Company and created liturgical dances.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Alexandra Danilova, an internationally popular ballet star known for her vivacity and theatrical flair, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Beloved by audiences in a performing career that extended from the Imperial Russian Ballet of St. Petersburg to Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes of the 1920's and the various Ballets Russes companies that succeeded it, Miss Danilova was also a noted teacher and for many years a faculty member of the School of American Ballet, the New York City Ballet's school.         She was known to friends by the nickname Choura, and admired for her Champagne-like sparkle and a stage presence so intense that she could command attention even when she was not moving. With her heart-shaped face and dark brown hair, she was striking to behold. She was also celebrated for possessing what were considered the most beautiful -- and photogenic -- legs in ballet. Lincoln Kirstein, the New York City Ballet's director, once called them ''legs like luminous wax.''         Yet Miss Danilova did more than personify glamour. Extraordinarily versatile, she danced roles that ranged from the passionate Swan Queen in ''Swan Lake'' to the mischievous Swanilda in ''Coppelia'' and the worldly heroines of Leonide Massine's balletic comedies, ''Le Beau Danube'' and ''Gaite Parisienne.'' Although she particularly enjoyed dramatic roles, she also danced abstract ballets. George Balanchine, her schoolmate from St. Petersburg, created ''Danses Concertantes'' in 1944 for her and for Frederic Franklin, the English-born dancer who was her partner at the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from the late 1930's through the 50's.         She appeared in many experimental productions, including, in the Soviet Union, Fyodor Lopukhov's ''Dance Symphony'' of 1923, among the first abstract symphonic ballets. Artistically inquisitive, Miss Danilova once said: ''I have been so lucky. All my life I have worked with the avant-garde. That developed me enormously as an artist, much more than if I had danced just 'Swan Lake' and 'Giselle.' ''         She was born in Peterhof, Russia, near St. Petersburg, on Nov. 20, 1903, and orphaned when she was a small child. She was brought up by relatives and foster parents. When they discovered that the little girl loved to dance, they wondered if there might be a career in ballet for her, and she was accepted by the Imperial Ballet School in 1911. In 1920, she entered the Maryinsky Ballet, the company now known as the Kirov Ballet.         As a young dancer, she was caught up in the artistic ferment after the Bolshevik Revolution. Not only did she appear in the experiments of Lopukhov, but she also became a friend of Balanchine, at that time an experimental young choreographer. Along with several other dancers, she and Balanchine left the Soviet Union in 1924 on what was intended to be a tour of Western Europe. But that same year, she and Balanchine were accepted by Diaghilev: Miss Danilova as a dancer, Balanchine as a choreographer.         Until 1931, she and Balanchine lived together as husband and wife, although they were never married. Balanchine was still officially married to another dancer, Tamara Geva, and he told Miss Danilova that because his marriage papers had been left behind in Russia, he feared it might be difficult to arrange a legal separation.         When Diaghilev died in 1929, Miss Danilova said she felt as if the ground had collapsed beneath her feet. A few years later, however, she danced with the Ballets Russes, which Col. W. de Basil organized in 1933 as a successor to the Diaghilev company. In 1938, she became prima ballerina of a rival company, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, in part because its resident choreographer was Massine, whom she admired only slightly less than Balanchine. The coming of World War II turned the Ballet Russe into an American company and, often partnered by Mr. Franklin, she toured across the country until the early 1950's, appearing in the classics, in ballets by Massine and in works by other choreographers, including Balanchine.         Miss Danilova, who became an American citizen in 1946, was twice married, to Giuseppe Massera in 1934 and to Casimir Kokitch in 1941. Both marriages ended in divorce, and Miss Danilova said in ''Choura,'' her autobiography, which was published in 1986: ''I sacrificed marriage, children and country to be a ballerina, and there was never any misunderstanding on my part: I knew the price.''         She also wrote, ''In a way I regard American audiences as my children, because I helped to educate them.''         Many dancegoers who saw her with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo would agree to that. Miss Danilova gained the reputation of being an artist who was never slack and who gave one-night appearances in tiny villages the same loving care that she bestowed upon seasons at the Metropolitan Opera House.         ''I never danced for an audience that I thought was unworthy of my performance,'' she once declared. She said she believed that a ballerina should always be glamorous, onstage or off. In her autobiography, she wrote: ''Every woman has an image -- mother, princess, ballerina -- that she must uphold. I was privileged to be a ballerina and I, therefore, had a duty to my audience. They must never be disappointed in me.''         Miss Danilova was often in demand as a guest teacher around the country. She also coached works from the classical repertory, and in 1974, she and Balanchine staged ''Coppelia'' for the New York City Ballet. She appeared on Broadway in ''Song of Norway'' in 1944 and ''Oh, Captain'' in 1958 and in the movie ''The Turning Point'' in 1976. In 1958, she received the Capezio Award.         No immediate family members survive. A funeral service for Miss Danilova will be held at 5 P.M. on Thursday at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.         Although she was long reluctant to return to Russia, Lewis Ufland, her former manager, said yesterday that Miss Danilova did go back several years ago. She visited St. Petersburg as part of the trip, and was able to attend graduation performances at the Kirov School, the former Imperial Ballet School she had attended as a child. The faculty enthusiastically welcomed her as one of that institution's greatest alumnae.       
         Jeanne Calment, born a year before Alexander Graham Bell patented his telephone and 14 years before Alexandre Gustave Eiffel built his tower, died today in a nursing home in Arles. At 122, she was the oldest person whose age had been verified by official documents.         Jean-Marie Robine, a public health researcher who is one of the authors of a book about Mrs. Calment, said she had been in good health, though almost blind and deaf, as recently as a month ago.         The French, who celebrated her as the doyenne of humanity, had their own theories about why she lived so long, noting that she used to eat more than two pounds of chocolate a week and treat her skin with olive oil, rode a bicycle until she was 100, and only quit smoking five years ago.         Longevity ran in the family; Mrs. Calment's mother lived until she was 86 and her father until he was 93. But Mr. Robine said her great strength was her unflappability.         ''I think she was someone who, constitutionally and biologically speaking, was immune to stress,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''She once said, 'If you can't do anything about it, don't worry about it.' ''         Jeanne Louise Calment's claim to fame is the Feb. 21, 1875, listing in the birth register in Arles, the southern French city where she began her days and ended them.         She was 12 or 13 when she saw Vincent Van Gogh in Arles, and she said later that he was ''very ugly, ungracious, impolite, sick -- I forgive him, they called him loco.''         She married a cousin, Fernand Nicolas Calment, in 1896. As the prosperous owner of a store in Arles, he was able to support her in style, and she never had to work. She played tennis, took up roller skating, bicycling and swimming and took great pleasure in joining the hunting parties he organized. She also studied the piano and enjoyed the opera.         Her husband, 46 when World War I broke out, was too old for military service. His business survived the Depression, but a dessert of spoiled preserved cherries killed him, but not his wife, in 1942.         They had one child, a daughter, Yvonne, whose marriage to Joseph Billot produced a single child, Frederic Billot, in 1926. Eight years later, Yvonne died of pneumonia, and Mrs. Calment raised her grandson in the family home. He became a medical doctor and died before her, in an automobile accident in 1960.         Mrs. Calment rode a bicycle until she was 100 and walked all over Arles to thank those who congratulated her on her birthday that year.         At age 110 her increasing frailty forced her to move into a nursing home. ''She complained about the food in the nursing home, which was sort of like baby food,'' Mr. Robine said today. ''She said it always tasted the same.''         At the age of 115, she fell and fractured two bones, and her memory began to fail. But she retained a tart wit. ''When you're 117, you see if you remember everything!'' she rebuked an interviewer five years ago. When somebody took leave by telling her, ''Until next year, perhaps,'' she retorted: ''I don't see why not! You don't look so bad to me.''         By the time she turned 122, she was so hard of hearing that it was difficult to communicate with her.         The name of the person who has taken Mrs. Calment's place as oldest living human was a topic of considerable international confusion today. Philip Littlemore of the Guinness Book of World Records in London said the oldest known person whose date of birth was as well documented as Mrs. Calment's was Lucy Askew, a British woman who turned 104 last Sept. 8. But several others may also have claim to the title, including at least one in the United States.         Mrs. Calment left no heirs. She also outlived Andre-Francois Raffray, a lawyer who 32 years ago, when she was merely 90, bought the apartment she used to live in on a contingency contract. He would pay her 2,500 francs (now about $400) a month until she died, and then the apartment would become his.         Mr. Raffray died a year ago at 77, after paying Mrs. Calment more than $180,000, better than double the apartment's market value. His family was still paying when she died.         ''In life, one sometimes makes bad deals,'' Mrs. Calment said.         Mr. Raffray's widow, Huguette, told French radio tonight: ''She was a personality. My husband had very good relations with Mrs. Calment.''         Michel Vauzelle, the Mayor of Arles, said: ''She was Jeanne the Arlesienne, one whose picture went around the world. But above all, she was the living memory of our city.''         She may be most famous in France for her many bons mots. One of them was: ''I've never had but one wrinkle, and I'm sitting on it.''       
         Joyce Ebert, a versatile character actress for more than 30 years with the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, died on Thursday at Southport Manor, a rest home in Southport, Conn. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said Kimberly Sewright, a spokeswoman for Long Wharf.         Ms. Ebert was a dedicated company actress, playing cameo roles as well as starring ones, and and unlike many actresses she never stopped working. She performed in 81 plays at Long Wharf, many of them directed by her husband, Arvin Brown, the company's longtime artistic director. She is survived by her husband.         In a highly productive career she appeared in diverse plays, from ''Arsenic and Old Lace'' to ''The Trojan Women.'' She was equally comfortable in the czarist Russia of Gorky and Chekhov and in the rustic American environment of ''Tobacco Road,'' although she seemed especially at home in the world of Lillian Hellman. Sometimes she would appear in several plays in one season. She also appeared on Broadway and Off Broadway and at other regional theaters.         She acted in revivals of plays by Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller, Thornton Wilder and John Osborne, while also performing in new works (''The Shadow Box'') and, occasionally, musicals (for 10 years she studied opera). Ms. Ebert often played less than glamorous roles. But with her comic touch she could capture the flamboyance of such vivid characters as Carlotta Vance in ''Dinner at 8'' by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, in a stylish revival directed by Mr. Brown.         Among the other highlights of her career was her title role in D. H. Lawrence's ''Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd.'' Mr. Brown's production was later shown on ''Theater in America'' on WNET, on Channel 13 in New York.         In 1996, the Connecticut Critics Circle gave her a special achievement award for 30 years of ''outstanding contribution to a theater in Connecticut.''         She was born in Homestead, Pa., and graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Later she studied with Uta Hagen and Lee Strasberg. She began her New York theatrical career playing Julie in ''Liliom'' at the Equity Library Theater, and continued to work Off Broadway in the late 1950's and early 60's.         For her performance in ''The Trojan Women'' at Circle in the Square in 1963, she won an Obie and the Clarence Derwent Award. In 1961, she was Ophelia to Donald Madden's Hamlet at the Phoenix Theater. A decade later she played Gertrude to Stacy Keach's Hamlet at Long Wharf.         Her first Long Wharf performance was in ''Misalliance'' in 1966. In 1996, she played opposite Fritz Weaver in the full-length version of Noel Coward's ''Song at Twilight,'' and gave her last performance in ''The Show Off'' by George Kelly, a play she had done 21 years before, also at Long Wharf.         Interviewed by the Times in 1982, she said: ''I really had a spectacular career and it's been in a quiet way. I'm not a star and never wanted to be one.'' She added, with evident pride, ''I work constantly.''       
         Joanne Tree Winship, a former actress who played an active role in many New York City charity benefits, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 73 and lived in midtown Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, her husband, Frederick Winship, said.         Mrs. Winship served for some years in the 1970's as the American chairwoman of Girls Town of Italy, an international organization based in Rome that cared for children who had been abandoned.         The organization's annual fund-raiser, which included a fashion show, featured several European designers who later became well known in this country, including Gianni Versace and Valentino.         She also played a leading role in organizing dinner dance benefits for the New York City Opera and the School of American Ballet. Her fund-raising efforts for the Museum of the City of New York's theater collection included such events as ''A Celebration of Jule Styne on Broadway'' in 1987.         She appeared in a number of movies as a child, including ''Mad About Music'' in 1938 and ''Cheers for Miss Bishop'' in 1941, as well as the Nancy Drew mystery series. While in her teens, she began a stage career under contract to J. J. Shubert.         Her television credits included ''Robert Montgomery Presents,'' ''Studio One'' and ''Broadway TV Theater,'' as well as the serialization of ''Junior Miss.''         A native of New York City, she was the daughter of John and Anna Tree of Lawrence, N.Y. In 1956, she married Alexis Thompson. Mr. Thompson died the next year. She married Mr. Winship in 1967.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a brother, George Tannenbaum of Montgomery, Ala., and a sister, Ruth Deroux of San Diego.         Correction:  September 26, 1997, Friday         An obituary on Aug. 11 about Joanne Winship, who was active in many charity benefits in New York City, misstated the year of her marriage to Alexis Thompson. It was 1953, not 1956. The error was pointed out in a letter to The Times last week.       
         Kaaren Erickson, a soprano who was on the roster of the Metropolitan Opera for the last 12 years and whose repertory ranged from Handel oratorios to Philip Glass's most recent opera, died on Saturday at her home in Maryville, Tenn. She was 44.         Lawrence Wasserman, her manager, said the cause was cancer.         Ms. Erickson was born in Seattle and studied with Marshal Singher at the Santa Barbara Academy of Music, in California. She made her San Francisco Opera debut in a production of Massenet's ''Cendrillon'' in 1982. The same year she won first prize at the Munich International Competition. In 1984, she made her New York City Opera debut as Pamina in Mozart's ''Magic Flute,'' and the next year she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Susanna in ''Le Nozze di Figaro.''         At the Met, Ms. Erickson also sang Zerlina in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' and Alice Ford in Verdi's ''Falstaff,'' as well as roles in Wagner's ''Gotterdammerung'' and ''Das Rheingold,'' Strauss's ''Elektra,'' Poulenc's ''Dialogues des Carmelites'' and John Corigliano's ''Ghosts of Versailles.''         She also performed regularly as a soloist in performances of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Mahler's Fourth Symphony, Strauss's Four Last Songs, the Mozart Requiem and Handel's ''Messiah.'' She recorded ''Messiah'' with Robert Shaw (for Telarc Records), and sang on recordings of ''Parsifal'' (with James Levine, on Deutsche Grammophone), Dvorak's Stabat Mater (with Zdenek Macal, on Delos), and ''The White Election,'' a collection of Emily Dickinson settings by Gordon Getty, (also on Delos).         She is survived by her husband, Edward Sooter; a daughter, Esther Sooter; her mother, Annette Herr of Seattle, and two sisters, Jennifer and Heidi Herr, of Chlan, Wash.       
         Helen Jepson, a soprano who sang at the Metropolitan Opera and with other American companies in the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at the Blake Memorial Hospital in Bradenton, Fla. She was 92 and lived in Bradenton.         Ms. Jepson's attractive lyric soprano, preserved on recordings of excerpts from Verdi's ''Otello,'' and her radiant good looks -- she had blond hair and dark eyes -- made her a favorite of opera fans who wanted to see an American soprano sing beside the more prominent European stars of the day.         She was the first soprano to record the female lead in Gershwin's ''Porgy and Bess,'' and she sang popular songs with Paul Whiteman, the band leader, on his radio show.         She had roles in several Hollywood films, including ''The Goldwyn Follies.''         Miss Jepson was born in Titusville, Pa., in 1904 and grew up in Akron, Ohio, where she studied voice and sang leading roles in high school productions of ''I Pagliacci'' and ''H.M.S. Pinafore.'' Using the money she saved from jobs in a church choir and at a record store, where she also listened closely to recordings by Rosa Ponselle and other stars of the day, she moved to Philadelphia to continue her studies at the Curtis Institute. While still a student, she sang with the Philadelphia Civic Opera, and organized a student troupe that spent a summer performing in small towns across the country. She made her debut with the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company in 1930.         After that company disbanded in 1932, Miss Jepson moved to New York, where she sang in choruses and as a soloist on several radio programs before auditioning for the Metropolitan Opera. She made her Met debut in 1935, in the premiere of John Laurence Seymour's ''In the Pasha's Garden.''         In the nine seasons that followed, she sang 10 more roles, including Violetta in ''La Traviata,'' Nedda in ''I Pagliacci,'' Desdemona in ''Otello,'' Melisande in ''Pelleas et Melisande,'' and the title role in ''Thais.''         After Miss Jepson retired from the stage in 1947, she became a speech therapist in New Jersey schools, and taught speech therapy at Fairleigh Dickinson University. She moved to Bradenton in 1976, and was on the board of the Sarasota Opera Association and the Bradenton Opera Association.         She is survived by a daughter, Sallie Tennant, of Bradenton; a son, Ricardo Dellera, of Hawaii; a sister, Josephine Staral, of Barrington, Ill., two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Shirley Clarke, an Academy Award-winning filmmaker, a champion of independent filmmaking and a missionary for video as a force in communications, died on Tuesday at the Palliative Care Center of Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston. She was 77 and lived in Carlisle, Mass.         Her sister Elaine Dundy, the novelist and biographer, said Miss Clarke entered the center, a hospice, after a stroke two weeks ago. She also suffered from Alzheimer's disease.         As a filmmaker, Miss Clarke was probably best known for the three pictures she made between 1960 and 1963. ''The Connection,'' filmed in cinema verite style in 1960 and taken from Jack Gelber's Off Broadway play, was a frank study of drug addiction that was banned on grounds of obscenity by the motion picture division of the New York State Board of Regents.         Her 1962 documentary, ''Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel With the World,'' a portrait of the poet, won an Oscar.         Her gritty 1963 film, ''The Cool World,'' adapted from a novel by Warren Miller and filmed on the streets of Harlem, tracked the life of a young man who rises briefly to the leadership of a juvenile gang.         ''Right now,'' Miss Clarke said in 1962, ''I'm revolting against the conventions of movies. Who says a film has to cost a million dollars and be safe and innocuous enough to satisfy every 12-year-old in America?''         In 1962 Miss Clarke and the filmmaker and critic Jonas Mekas founded the Film-Makers Cooperative, a nonprofit company for the distribution of independent films.         ''There must be 40 or 50 others like me in the country, with a desire for self-expression and no urge to move to Hollywood and make soap opera,'' Miss Clarke said.         ''We're creating a movie equivalent of Off Broadway, fresh and experimental and personal. The lovely thing is that I'm alive at just the time when I can do this.''         In 1967, Miss Clarke attracted attention with the release of ''Portrait of Jason,'' filmed during a single 12-hour session in her Manhattan apartment. The documentary, shown at the New York Film Festival, was a 105-minute interview with a gay black male prostitute.         ''The result, I'm convinced, is a portrait of a guy who is both a genius and a bore,'' she said.         By the 1970's, Miss Clarke was turning to video. ''Videotape is going to teach Americans to play with each other,'' she said then. ''The fight of the 1980's will be the battle for access to communications media.''         Released in 1986, her final movie, ''Ornette: Made in America,'' a portrait of the great modern jazz composer and saxophonist Ornette Coleman, mixed film and video.         From 1975 to 1983, Miss Clarke was a professor of film at the University of California at Los Angeles.         She came to her life in film and video after a career in dance. Her concern with movement led her to motion pictures, and among her earliest films were dance-related shorts. ''I became more interested in people than abstractions,'' she said.         Reared in Manhattan and educated at the Lincoln School, Miss Clarke was the eldest of three daughters of the former Florence Rosenberg and Samuel N. Brimberg, a wealthy manufacturer.         ''Daddy was of the school which felt that men didn't talk about important matters to women,'' Miss Clarke once said. ''I guess I always had an enormous need to show him I wasn't the dope he thought I was.''         She said she attended seven different colleges without graduating. ''I studied anything as long as I could keep on dancing,'' she said.         For several years, she studied and danced with Martha Graham and Hanya Holm and was 17 when she offered her first work as a choreographer.         Her marriage in 1943 to Bert Clarke ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Dundy, who lives in Los Angeles, she is survived by another sister, Betty Lorwin of Brooklyn, and a daughter, Wendy, a video artist who also lives in Los Angeles.         As Miss Clarke lay dying, she was visited in her hospital room by her daughter and a group of friends, all film and video makers, who sipped Champagne as they reminisced about her and her work and how it paved the way for the MTV generation.         The next day, Ms. Dundy described the gathering to their sister Betty, who replied, ''It's so like a film Shirley would make.''         Correction:  September 29, 1997, Monday         An obituary on Friday about the filmmaker Shirley Clarke referred imprecisely to a documentary she directed. The film, ''Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel With the World,'' won an Academy Award in 1963 not for her but for its producer, Robert Hughes.       
         Pilar Miro Romero, a pioneering female director of movies and television who also fostered Spain's film industry by introducing state aid for promising young filmmakers when she served in the Socialist Government of the 1980's, died at her home here on Sunday. She was 57.         She collapsed from a heart attack, doctors said. She had undergone surgery in 1975 to be outfitted with two heart valves, and they were replaced in a second operation in 1985.         King Juan Carlos, a friend of Ms. Miro's since they were law students in Madrid 40 years ago, paid condolences at the city morgue on Sunday. Just two weeks ago, she directed Spanish state television's coverage, beamed worldwide, of the wedding in Barcelona of the King's daughter Princess Cristina.         Ms. Miro's film ''Beltenebros,'' a tale of intrigue about the resistance during Franco's dictatorship, won a Silver Bear award at the Berlin Film Festival in 1992. Her movie ''El Perro del Hortelano,'' an adaptation of a 17th-century Spanish comedy about palace romance, garnered seven prizes, including best director, at this year's Goya Awards, Spain's top film honors.         Ms. Miro, who became the first woman to direct dramas for Spanish television in 1966, was known for her link to progressive causes like the fight against racism. She won respect even from many leading conservatives, who attended her funeral today.         As the Culture Ministry director of cinema from 1982 to 1985, she began Government subsidies to cash-starved young filmmakers. Among the directors who acknowledged the benefit were Pedro Almodovar, nominated for an Oscar in 1989 for ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' and Fernando Trueba, who won the foreign-film Oscar in 1994 for ''Belle Epoque.''         Born on April 20, 1940, in Madrid, Ms. Miro studied law at the University of Madrid but switched her interest to cinema and began working at state television in 1960. She directed her first feature-length film in 1975, and her 1979 movie ''El Crimen de Cuenca'' was censored for almost two years in Spain for depicting a torture scene by Civil Guards. When it finally opened, it was a top box office attraction.         In 1982, she was a media adviser to Felipe Gonzalez when he was elected for the first time as Prime Minister, starting nearly 14 years of Socialist Party rule. Ms. Miro served in his administration, first in the Culture Ministry, then as Director General of state television and radio. She resigned from that post in 1989 during a controversy over her spending some $30,000 in Government funds for her personal wardrobe. She paid back the money and was cleared of wrongdoing by a court in 1992.         Her subsequent projects included directing television coverage, in 1995, of the royal wedding in Seville of Princess Elena, the King's eldest daughter.         Mr. Gonzalez attended the funeral today, as did the Spanish tenor Placido Domingo, whom Ms. Miro had seen perform at the Royal Theater opera house in Madrid the night before she died. The large crowd also included Princess Cristina and her husband, making their first public appearance since their wedding, and NATO's Secretary General, Javier Solana, formerly a Socialist minister under Mr. Gonzalez.         Ms. Miro is survived by a son, Gonzalo, and a brother, Carlos.       
         Margaret Harshaw, an American soprano and mezzo-soprano who was best known as a Wagnerian singer but whose performances in Mozart and Verdi operas were also highly regarded, died on Friday at Condell Memorial Hospital in Libertyville, Ill. She was 88 and lived in Lake Forest, Ill.         Ms. Harshaw sang at the Metropolitan Opera for 22 seasons, from November 1942, when she made her debut as the Second Norn in Wagner's ''Die Gotterdammerung,'' until March 1964, when she gave her final performance as Ortud in ''Lohengrin.'' Because she spent the first nine years of her Met career as a mezzo-soprano and then switched to soprano roles, she sang more Wagner roles than any other singer in the Met's history.         These include 14 roles in the ''Ring'' operas, in which she began as a Rhinemaiden and eventually sang all three Brunnhildes, as well as both Senta and Mary (in the same season) in ''Die Fliegende Hollander,'' Isolde in ''Tristan und Isolde,'' Magdalene in ''Die Meistersinger,'' Kundry in ''Parsifal'' and Elisabeth and Venus in ''Tannhauser.''         Miss Harshaw was born in Philadelphia in 1909 and began singing in church choirs as a child. From 1928 to 1932, she sang alto with the Mendelssohn Club, a chorus that performed with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra. A series of competition victories in the early 1930's led to performances in Philadelphia, Washington and New York City, all before she enrolled at the Juilliard Graduate School to begin her formal studies with Anna Schoen-Rene in 1936.         In March 1942, Miss Harshaw won the Metropolitan Opera's Auditions of the Air, and she began her career at the house at the start of the next season. In 1950 Rudolf Bing, the Met's general manager, was looking for a dramatic soprano to succeed Helen Traubel, particularly in Wagner roles, and persuaded Ms. Harshaw to switch to the higher range. She did so with notable success: her recordings as a soprano show her to have a clear timbre and considerable power.         All told, she sang 375 performances of 39 roles in 25 works at the house and was heard in 40 of the Met's weekly live broadcasts. Her non-Wagner roles at the Met included four in Verdi works -- Amneris in ''Aida,'' Ulrica in ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' Mistress Quickly in ''Falstaff'' and Azucena in ''Il Trovatore'' -- as well as Donna Anna in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' Gertrud in Humperdinck's ''Hansel und Gretel,'' Genevieve in Debussy's ''Pelleas et Melisande'' and Herodias in Strauss's ''Salome.''         Ms. Harshaw also sang at Covent Garden, Glyndebourne, the San Francisco Opera, the Paris Opera and with companies in Philadelphia, Cincinnati, New Orleans, San Antonio, Pittsburgh and Houston. She also made several Latin American tours and was a soloist with many of the major American orchestras. Roles she sang outside the Met include Dalila in Saint-Saens's ''Samson et Dalila,'' Leonore in Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' and the title roles in Puccini's ''Turandot'' and Gluck's ''Alceste.''         In 1962, Miss Harshaw became a professor of voice at Indiana University, where she taught until 1993. She is survived by a son, Oskar L. Eichna Jr., of East Northport, N.Y.       
         Janet Annenberg Hooker, whose many philanthropies ranged from the support of musical organizations to the redecoration of The White House and the diplomatic rooms of the State Department in Washington, died Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 93 and had homes in Manhattan, Palm Beach, Fla., and Newport, R.I.         Mrs. Hooker was one of the principal benefactors of the National Museum of Natural History, the largest of the Smithsonian Institution's family of museum buildings on the Mall in Washington. She contributed $5 million for the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems and Minerals, which opened this fall. The $10 million gallery has a walk-through mine, interactive exhibits and high-resolution videos of earthquakes and volcanic action.         A spectacular gem collection housed in the new building includes several other gifts from Mrs. Hooker, among them the Hooker Starburst Diamonds, which she donated  in 1994 in honor of her two sons, Gilbert S. Kahn and Donald P. Kahn. The dazzling set of rare yellow diamonds, cut in a starburst pattern, includes a 245-carat necklace with 50 rectangular diamonds, a 61-carat diamond ring and earrings. Each earring is a 25-carat yellow diamond surrounded by four pear-shaped and 16 baguette white diamonds.         In 1977, Mrs. Hooker also gave the Smithsonian a 75-carat emerald brooch. The half-million-dollar brooch, set with diamonds, was once owned by the Sultan of Turkey, who sported it on his belt buckle. Mrs. Hooker's son, Gilbert S. Kahn, said that his mother's total contribution to the Smithsonian, in cash and jewels, was about $9 million.         When the diplomatic reception rooms of the State Department building were rebuilt in the mid-1980's, Clement Conger, the curator at the time, described Mrs. Hooker as the project's ''staunchest supporter.'' The almost $8 million renovation, paid for with private funds, included the $3.5 million, 47-by-102-foot Benjamin Franklin Dining Room and the Secretary of State's $1.95 million, 10-room suite.         ''Mother was always interested in the decorative arts,'' Mr. Kahn said. He noted that during her winters in Palm Beach, she met and became friendly with a number of ambassadors who were guests at the annual Red Cross Ball, and this heightened  her interest in the effort to enhance the State Department building.         Mrs. Hooker also contributed $250,000 to renovate the Blue Room in the White House and contributed to the fund for the redecoration of the private quarters there. Her interest in the White House Preservation Fund extended through the administrations of six Presidents -- John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.         Mrs. Hooker, her brother, Walter Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James, and Mr. Annenberg's wife, Lenore, jointly contributed $200,000 in 1987 to the renovation of Blair-Lee House. The gift was for a garden room in a new wing of the government's guest house.         Mrs. Hooker was also an active presence on the social scene in both New York and Florida. One of her principal activities on the charity circuit was the fashionable April in Paris Ball in New York, a benefit affair for French and American organizations. For many years, she not only underwrote the cost of the decorations but also planned and assisted in their placement.         A number of musical institutions also were the recipients of Mrs. Hooker's beneficence. She donated a section of the lobby of the Metropolitan Opera House in Lincoln Center in honor of her mother, Mrs. Moses L. Annenberg, and she contributed over the years to the New York Philharmonic, the Musicians Emergency Fund and to various outdoor concert programs.         Although Mrs. Hooker bought a house in Newport, R.I., in 1992, her health began deteriorating and she never lived in it. ''You finish it and enjoy it,'' she told her son Gilbert. She and her son, however, gave a suite of Louis XV-style furniture to The Elms, one of Newport's famed ''cottages,'' built in 1901 and modeled after the Chateau d' Asineres near Paris. The suite consisted of 12 chairs, a small sofa and a fire screen, covered with 18th-century Beauvais tapestry and framed in gilt carved with trailing garlands and scallop shells. Janet Hooker's name is also on a plaque listing the major donors to the restoration of the house and gardens of the painter Claude Monet in Giverny, France.         Mrs. Hooker was born in Chicago on Oct. 13, 1904, one of seven daughters of Moses Annenberg, the founder of Triangle Publications, and Sadie Annenberg. Three of the publications -- T.V. Guide, The Daily Racing Form and Seventeen Magazine -- were sold to Rupert Murdoch for $3 billion in 1988.         According to a 1990 article in Forbes Magazine, Mrs. Hooker and two of her sisters, Esther Simon and Lita Hazen, both now deceased, were major beneficiaries of the sale. The magazine reported that two sisters, Enid Haupt and Evelyn Hall, had previously cashed in most of their stock. The other two sisters, Pearl (Polly) Levee and Harriette Ames, were deceased. The surviving sisters, and families of the deceased, were also reported to have shared in the proceeds of the sale of General Motors stock valued at $825 million.         Mrs. Hooker was educated at Kemper Hall, an Episcopal school in Kenosha, Wis. An outgoing woman with a determined will and a quiet sense of humor, she tapped into the family tradition of charity as a young bride. Her early grants were primarily in the field of music. Later, her major contributions reflected her interest in the decorative arts.         In 1924 she was married to L. Stanley Kahn, a publisher in the Annenberg communications empire. The couple divorced in 1937 and in the same year Mrs. Hooker, under the name of Janet Kahn, began a brief stage career. She appeared as a school trustee in ''Honor Bright,'' a play produced by Lee Shubert that was mounted in Detroit and Rhode Island but never came to New York. The following year, she married Joseph A. Neff of Lincoln, Neb., who had been in the clothing business in the West and later was involved in the sale of the Cleveland Plain Dealer to S.I. Newhouse. Mr. Neff died in 1969.         Her marriage to James Stewart Hooker took place in 1974. Mr. Hooker was head of labor relations for the Philadelphia Inquirer, an Annenberg newspaper at the time. Her son Gilbert said that the two met at business meetings and that the friendship evolved into a love match. Mr. Hooker died in 1976.         In addition to her two sons, Gilbert Kahn of Newport, R.I., and Miami, and Donald Kahn of Salzburg and London, she is survived by her two sisters, Enid Haupt of New York and Evelyn Hall of Palm Beach; her brother, Walter Annenberg of Philadelphia and Palm Springs, Calif.;  five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 17, 1997, Wednesday  A picture yesterday with an obituary of the philanthropist Janet Annenberg Hooker was published in error. It showed her sister Lita Annenberg Hazen, a patron of medical research and cultural institutions who died in 1995.         Correction:  December 19, 1997, Friday  An obituary of the philanthropist Janet Annenberg Hooker on Tuesday misstated the ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1974, when Ms. Hooker married James Stewart Hooker, an executive there. The paper was owned by the Knight chain, which merged that year to form Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc.; it was not an Annenberg paper at the time.       
         Kathy Acker, a child of Sutton Place who rose to prominence as a willfully abrasive novelist and performance artist in the post-punk East Village of the 1970's and 80's, died on Sunday at an alternative cancer treatment center in Tijuana, Mexico. She was 53 and lived in San Francisco.         Ms. Acker, who left New York for London in 1984 before moving to California in recent years, had battled breast cancer for 18 months and had been at the Tijuana center for three weeks, friends said.         The author of 10 novels, dozens of stories and essays, an opera libretto and a screenplay, she began as a writer by publishing her own books and peddling them from bookshop to bookshop, once working as a stripper on 42d Street to support herself.         Scenes of disturbing violence and sexuality peppered her works, as did her penchant for characters who would change gender and identities without warning and her habit of taking scenes from classic novels and injecting them with erotic scenes and raw, raging language.         One of her books, ''Blood and Guts in High School'' (1984), was banned in Germany and South Africa.         Michiko Kakutani described Ms. Acker's style in a 1987 review in The New York Times: ''Characters exchange identities with the ease of snakes shedding their skins; and bits of myths, folk tales and older novels also turn up transformed -- juxtaposed, in a sort of post-modernist collage, with political screeds, dream-like hallucinations and strange, comic exchanges. The language is nervous and skewed; the authorial stance, adversarial and abrasive; the world view, cynical verging on the nihilistic.''         In her performance pieces, done at clubs in Britain and America, Ms. Acker often read from her novels. She also collaborated on numerous musical and theatrical projects.         Ms. Acker cut a well-known figure in the East Village scene of the early 80's, favoring leather clothes, spiky hair styles, red lipstick and stiletto heels. She told interviewers that she also considered her body a work of art, and was a devotee of piercing, tattooing and bodybuilding.         Her other novels include ''Great Expectations'' (1983), ''Don Quixote'' (1986), ''Literal Madness'' (1987), ''My Mother: Demonology'' (1993) and ''Pussy, King of the Pirates'' (1995).         Her opera libretto, ''Birth of a Poet,'' on which she collaborated with the composer Peter Gordon, was performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1985. A film based on her screenplay, ''Variety,'' was released the same year.         Ms. Acker once said she drew her greatest inspiration from the novelist William Burroughs. ''He was my model,'' she said. ''For me, he was the first writer, the only one who was working politically in the field of language as power. He was questioning language. Everybody else was just thinking about it.''         She is survived by a half-sister, Wendy Bowers of Belchertown, Mass.       
         Marion Bell, who created the leading role of Fiona MacLaren in the original Broadway production of the Alan Jay Lerner-Frederick Loewe musical ''Brigadoon'' in 1947 and then married Mr. Lerner, died on Dec. 14 at the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, Calif. She was 78 and lived in Culver City.         As the innocent young woman in the mysterious Scottish town that comes back to life one day in every 100 years, Ms. Bell captivated critics as well as theatergoers. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson was so taken with the show as ''a singing pattern of enchantment'' that he hesitated to write about individual performers.         He did say, however, that ''Almost Like Being in Love'' was ''sung rapturously'' by David Brooks and Ms. Bell. The musical historian Miles Kreuger, who saw the show in its premiere engagement and later became a friend of Ms. Bell's, said this week that as Fiona ''she had the most wondrous, doe-like, ethereal quality.''         For her role in ''Brigadoon,'' she won many awards, including the Donaldson Award for best debut performance by an actress in a musical. Subsequently she made record albums for RCA Victor, including the original cast album of ''Brigadoon.''  It was to be her only New York musical.         She was born in St. Louis. By the age of 8, she was singing on radio. After the family moved to California, the director Robert Z. Leonard heard her singing at a party and was instrumental in having her signed by Metro Goldwyn Mayer.         She appeared with the Marx Brothers in ''A Night at the Opera.'' She studied voice both in Rome and in California and later sang a duet with the Metropolitan Opera tenor James Melton in the movie, ''Ziegfeld Follies.''         Mr. Lerner and Mr. Loewe apparently wanted her to play a role in their musical, ''The Day Before Spring,'' but MGM held her to her contract. Several years later, she auditioned for ''Brigadoon,'' and acted in the show for a year.         She married Mr. Lerner in 1947 and they were divorced two years later. Ms. Bell was the second of his eight wives.         In 1948, she was in the world premiere of Kurt Weill and Arnold Sundgaard's folk opera, ''Down in the Valley,'' at Indiana University and repeated her role on television. Later she sang at the St. Louis Municipal Opera, the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera and the Sacramento Music Circus. In recent years she taught voice in Culver City.         She is survived by a son, Tom Charlesworth of Portland, Ore., and two sisters, Evelyn Lewis of Hawaii and Veronica McKinley of New Castle, Pa.
