         Marian Cowles Botsford, a former executive in the fabric-design and  women's wear fields, died on Dec. 27 at her home in Santa Fe. She was 79.         She had a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Botsford was born in Buffalo to Edwin Cowles, an engineer and inventor, and Marian Tomkins Cowles. She was a great-granddaughter of an earlier Edwin Cowles,  who founded The Cleveland Leader newspaper.         She graduated in 1937 from Chatham Hall, a boarding school in Chatham, Va., and in 1941 from Smith College. She became a designer and executive with Jack Lenor Larsen Inc., a Manhattan-based designer and manufacturer of fabrics for interior design, and an executive at B. H. Wragge, also in Manhattan, which made women's wear.         She married Stephen B. Botsford, The New Yorker magazine's president from 1956 to 1961, in 1966. He died in 1967.         She is survived by a son from an early marriage, James E. Mitchell of Philadelphia; a sister, Jeanne C. Fleischmann of Manhattan, who is the widow of Peter F. Fleischmann, a chairman of The New Yorker; and two grandchildren.       
         Jane B. Davies, an independent architectural historian whose devotion took her from reference librarian at Columbia University to pre-eminent authority on the 19th-century American architect Alexander J. Davis, died on Feb. 9. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Although she never received a degree in art or architectural history, Ms. Davies was a constant presence  at universities, libraries and museums that harbored information on  her chosen subjects, A. J. Davis and the romantic movement in American 19th-century architecture.         With no more than her interest and a librarian's salary, she also became an important collector of Davis's prints, drawings and Gothic-style furniture. Some of the pieces are now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the rest of her collection will go to the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University.         ''She was the person who published the most articles on A. J. Davis,'' said Amelia Peck, an associated curator in the department of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''If anyone wanted to know about any facet of Davis's career, Jane was the authority to call.''         Ms. Davies was born in 1913 in Amboy, Ill. The daughter of a small-town banker, Ms. Davies told her niece that she had ''always felt a hankering to go to New York.''         After receiving her B.A. at Wellesley College in 1935 and teaching for several years at girls' preparatory schools in Illinois and Colorado, she earned degrees in German history and library science at Columbia University in 1942 and 1944. Ms. Davies became a reference librarian and rare books cataloguer at Columbia.         In 1942 she married a musician, Lyn Davies, against her father's wishes. Her brother, Warren H. Badger, a lawyer, gave the couple money that they quickly spent on acquiring an architectural print by Piranesi. Mr. Davies became an organist and choirmaster and in his free time a composer. He died in 1994.         Ms. Davies's interest in Davis began in the late 1950's. At the time, nobody else was studying Davis, a  prolific contributor to Victorian picturesque architecture and the designer of landmarks including the Wadsworth Atheneum (with Ithiel Town) in Hartford; Lyndhurst in Tarrytown, N.Y., and the United States Customs House in Manhattan (with Town and others).         Ms. Davies, who friends described as a tiny woman with a quiet but commanding presence, was soon a familiar figure poring over Davis documents at Avery Library, the New-York Historical Society, the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Museum.         When financial problems led the the New-York Historical Society to sell some Davis drawings, Ms. Davies bought several and donated them to Avery Library. She wrote frequently about Davis for scholarly journals and exhibition catalogs and contributed the article on Davis to the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects.         Her introduction to the 1980 reprint of Davis's Rural Residences, the first American pattern book of architectural house plans, was hailed by the Journal of Architectural Historians as ''a herculean task'' prepared by ''a scholar known to every historian of American architecture.''         The greatest recognition of her achievement came with the 1992-93 exhibition ''Alexander Jackson Davis, American Architect,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for which she was the consulting curator.         She is survived by her brother, of Dixon, Ill.         For more than 30 years, Ms. Davies worked on a critical biography of the architect, which she may not have completed; other architectural historians did not produce such a biography, leaving the field to her.         ''We were all rooting for her to get her book, the definitive study on Davis, done,'' said Richard Jenrette, the financier and collector of 19th-century American houses. ''I wouldn't be surprised if she had it hidden away somewhere.''       
         Suzanne Gallo, a designer who created costumes for many of Merce Cunningham's major recent works, died on Feb. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 46.         The cause was cancer, said David Vaughan, the archivist for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company.         In a relatively short career in design, Ms. Gallo became known for handsome, sometimes luminously pretty costumes that allowed the body to move and captured the often intangible qualities of Mr. Cunningham's dances without intruding on the choreography itself. Robert Greskovic, writing in The Wall Street Journal last year about Ms. Gallo's costumes for Mr. Cunningham's ''Pond Way,'' described her work as ''consistently inspired.''         Born in Brooklyn, Ms. Gallo received a bachelor's degree in theater and textiles from the State University of New York. She joined the Cunningham company as a wardrobe superviser in 1982 and worked as a costume builder -- constructing the costumes from the designs -- before creating her first design for Mr. Cunningham in 1993. Among the Cunningham works for which she designed costumes were ''Ground Level Overlay,'' ''Windows'' and ''Biped.''         Ms. Gallo also worked as a costume builder or designer with such choreographers as Neil Greenberg, Meredith Monk, Lucinda Childs and Trisha Brown and with companies like the White Oak Dance Project, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and Ballet Hispanico.         She is survived by her parents, Frank and Joan Gallo of Lakewood,  N.J., and three brothers, Steven, of Lindenhurst, N.Y., Anthony, of Levittown, N.Y., and Philip, of Manhattan.       
         Bonnie Cashin, one of the first designers to create and popularize that uniquely American approach to dress called sportswear, died Thursday after open heart surgery at New York University Medical Center. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Cashin was one of a handful of women in the 1940's and 1950's who made an important contribution to American fashion, at a time when Parisian couturiers dominated the runways and supplied most of the original fashions for manufacturers to copy. The breakthroughs achieved by Ms. Cashin and designers like Claire McCardell, Vera Maxwell, Anne Klein and Anne Fogarty still influence the way women dress, and paved the way for the success of American designers like Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein.         Renowned for her loose-fitting sportswear, Ms. Cashin described her unstudied, casual designs as ''articulating with the body.'' She was an early proponent of layering -- using several layers of light, fluid clothes, rather than one heavy garment. She pioneered the use of grommets in place of buttons and was the first important designer to make ponchos for women, introducing lightweight capes and ponchos that, she explained, ''didn't look like a horse should wear them.''         As far back as 1943, she showed boots with tweed suits and included them in almost every subsequent collection. Her ''pocketbook'' pocket, with a snap closing, was another feature that long distinguished Cashin designs. She was ahead of her time when she introduced canvas raincoats in 1952, industrial zippers in 1955, jumpsuits in 1956 and suede Indian dresses with fringes in 1957.         She opened her own business, Bonnie Cashin Designs, in 1952 and for the two ensuing decades also designed leather, jersey, canvas and tweed clothes for Philip Sills. In addition, she created handbags for Coach Leatherware, gloves for Crescendoe-Superb and rainwear for Modelia. In the early 1970's, she branched out into knitwear with styles knitted to shape, rather than cut and sewn, and with welt hems instead of traditional hems or ribbed cuffs. A popular innovation was a roomy turtleneck that did not require a zipper to get over the head.         Although her themes were often adopted by other designers, Cashin clothes had a look of their own. Her tweed ponchos were bound in leather, and her coats had a special, supple swing. For several years, there were Cashin departments in chic Paris and London stores.         ''Women buy Cashin clothes because they are cozy and comfortable, not because they bowl people over,'' the fashion writer Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times in 1968.         Her gloves had many of the same features as her clothes. Grommets were arranged in the back of one style so that the glove could almost have served as a set of brass knuckles. Brass toggles not only were ornamental but also held a pair of gloves together or attached them to a belt. Some had drawstrings at the top that could be tightened to keep out the wind.         Her classic designs for Coach in the early 1960's were the shoulder bag and what was called the Basic, a smaller clutch style with a removable shoulder strap. The first bag she designed, a leather carryall modeled after paper shopping bags, was later discontinued but has since become ubiquitous in the collections of numerous handbag companies.         She was intolerant of anything ugly, in appearance or design. When she traveled, she draped lengths of Thai silk in her hotel rooms and ordered quantities of flowers. She was also generous on the road, dispensing items in her wardrobe to anyone who admired them. She usually returned with a different wardrobe from the one she had packed, not only because she had given away her clothing but also because she was interested in acquiring fashion ideas from other countries.         ''Travel is my education,'' she said in a 1961 interview with Charlotte Curtis in The Times. ''Even if I don't use an idea right away, it's there.'' The idea of layering came from time she spent in Asia. ''The Japanese refer to cold weather as a nine-layer day,'' she explained in 1950. ''Hot is a one-layer day.''         One of her best-known innovations was the ''dog leash'' skirt, which came about because she was constantly holding her skirt going up steps in her country home in Briarcliff, N.Y. The long wool skirt could be instantly shortened by latching a small brass ring sewn near the bottom to a small brass clasp at the waistline.         Ms. Cashin was born on Sept. 28, 1915, in Oakland, Calif., the daughter of Carl Cashin, a photographer and inventor, and Eunice Cashin. The family lived in several towns in northern California during Ms. Cashin's early years, and in each her mother would open a custom dress shop. As a child she was given fabric scraps as playthings and soon began sewing and designing.         Shortly before her graduation from high school, she showed some of her sketches to the director of a Los Angeles ballet company and was hired to make costumes for the next performance. After graduation, she joined the company as its designer and in 1934 accompanied the manager to New York when he took over the Roxy Theater. Not yet 20, she created three costume changes a week for each of the variety theater's 24 dancers.         She often called her Roxy experience her ''formal schooling in design'' and credited it with her later ability to create clothes that looked good on figures in motion. The theater also propelled her into designing street clothes, initially a collection of sportswear for Adler & Adler, a manufacturing concern.         After the United States entered World War II, she was appointed to a committee to design uniforms for women in the armed forces. But the war also imposed restrictions on the civilian use of fabrics and trim. She returned to costume design, which had more leeway with fabrics, and moved to Hollywood. There, she joined 20th Century Fox and created the clothes for some 60 films, including ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' ''Laura'' and ''Anna and the King of Siam.''         Ms. Cashin enjoyed the work in Hollywood, explaining: ''I wasn't designing for fashion, but for characteristics, which is the way I like to design clothes for daily wear. I like to design clothes for a woman who plays a particular role in life, not simply to design clothes that follow a certain trend, or that express some new silhouette.''         She remained in Hollywood until 1949, when she returned to New York. Her casual, layered clothes struck a responsive chord in American women. Within three years, she had won the first of her Coty Awards and organized Bonnie Cashin Designs.         Ms. Cashin was also chosen the first designer for Patterns of The Times, American Designer Series, a monthly feature in The New York Times during the 1950's that made designer patterns available for home sewing.         She was inducted into the Coty American Fashion Critics Hall of Fame in 1972 after receiving her second Coty Award in 1968. Her designs are in more than a dozen museums and some 30 university collections.         She was among the designers highlighted in the 1998 Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute exhibition ''American Ingenuity: Sportswear 1930's-1970's.'' A retrospective of her work is scheduled to open in September at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.         In 1979, she established the Innovative Design Fund awards, a nonprofit organization based in New York that gave up to $10,000 to designers with original ideas in home furnishings, textiles and fashion so they could transform their sketches into marketable products.         During her early design years, she was married briefly to Robert Sterner, an art director. They were later divorced. She is survived by her longtime companion, Curtis Kellar.         Bernadine Morris summed up Ms. Cashin's fashion philosophy and appeal in a 1968 article in The Times: ''In a day when most fashions seem stamped out by cookie cutters, hers look as if they had been touched with human hands.''         ''They have an uncompromising integrity, freedom and joy,'' Mrs. Morris wrote.         Her own career philosophy was summed up in a framed unsigned cartoon of trapeze performers she had hanging in her Manhattan apartment. One high-wire performer is advising the other, ''You've got to know when to let go.''       
         Janet Reed, whose comic gifts and sparkling technique made her one of American dance's most beloved ballerinas in the early years of American Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, died in Seattle last Monday. She was 83 and lived in Seattle.         She suffered a stroke one week earlier, said Maren Erskine, her daughter-in-law.         A petite redhead whose vivacious energy delighted audiences in both story ballets and pure-dance works, Ms. Reed was San Francisco Ballet's leading ballerina from 1937 to 1941 before joining Ballet Theater in 1942 and City Ballet in 1949.         She was a member of Eugene Loring's experimental chamber company, Dance Players, in 1942. In 1974 she helped found the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, remaining for two years as its first artistic director.         A member of the original cast of Jerome Robbins's first ballet, ''Fancy Free,'' Ms. Reed became associated with a memorable role and the kind of all-American image that audiences identified with her dancing. When Robbins created ''Fancy Free'' for Ballet Theater in 1944 he cast her as the young woman who dances a romantic duet with a sailor in a bar during World War II and then wipes her lipstick off his face.         By then Ms. Reed had also performed the ballerina roles in the 19th-century classics in San Francisco. These included Willam Christensen's 1940 staging of ''Swan Lake,'' the ballet's first full-length American production. As Lincoln Kirstein noted in his book ''Movement and Metaphor,'' Ms. Reed was an excellent comedian but also a classical dancer.         Kirstein and George Balanchine founded City Ballet in 1948 and Balanchine invited Ms. Reed into the company a few months later. He quickly cast her in his signature Neo-Classical ballets, including ''Symphony in C'' and ''Serenade.''         In 1949 he choreographed ''Bourree Fantasque,'' whose final exuberant section exploited the vitality and virtuosity that made up Ms. Reed's trademark style.         In the 1940's and 50's City Ballet was a very different company than it is today. Balanchine continued to develop a plotless Neo-Classical genre, but the repertory was eclectic, drawing upon a variety of choreographers. Robbins, like Ms. Reed, had transferred from Ballet Theater and become associate artistic director in 1949. Ms. Reed had danced in the 1945 premiere of ''Interplay,'' Robbins's enduring mix of bravura and blues, and he continued to use her.         Comic ballets, even by Balanchine, were not a rarity at City Ballet and in this realm Ms. Reed was queen. In Balanchine's ''A la Francaix,'' Ms. Reed was a belle who lost her swain, Andre Eglevsky, to a sylph, Maria Tallchief. In ''The Pied Piper,'' by Robbins, Ms. Reed led a jiving pack after a clarinetist onstage. She was the droopy Hortense, queen of the Waterlilies in Ruthanna Boris's ''Cakewalk,'' a comic gloss on minstrel shows.         In City Ballet's 1953 revival of Lew Christensen's ''Filling Station,'' a bit of 1938 Americana, Ms. Reed danced opposite the young Jacques d'Amboise as a gas station attendant. She was in her element as a tipsy debutante. When Balanchine created ''Western Symphony'' Ms. Reed made his satire of a classical adagio a lesson in strong technique and projection.         John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, devoted an article to Ms. Reed in 1954: ''Janet Reed is adorable, all right, and that unquestionably brings a great many customers to the box office; but she is also an artist of very high attainments, and a performer among performers.''         Ms. Reed was born in Tolo, Ore., and studied ballet with Willam Christensen in Portland, Ore., and San Francisco.         Although repeatedly praised for her comic timing and engaging characterization, Ms. Reed had an extensive dramatic range that she displayed in Antony Tudor's psychological ballets and Michael Kidd's ''On Stage!'' at Ballet Theater.         After marrying Branson Erskine, an interior designer, she appeared in the Robbins musical ''Look Ma, I'm Dancing'' in 1947. She is survived by a son, Reed Erskine of New York, and a daughter, Jane Erskine of Seattle.         Ms. Reed returned to Ballet Theater briefly before joining City Ballet, where she danced until 1958 and then was its ballet mistress until 1961. She taught in several colleges before moving to Seattle, where she also staged dances for the Seattle Opera. In 1983 she and Gene Kelly were the hosts of a gala celebrating the San Francisco Ballet's 50th anniversary.       
         Carmen Dillon, the first female art director in British film, whose set design for Laurence Olivier's ''Hamlet'' brought her an Academy Award in 1948, died on April 12, The Daily Telegraph of London reported. She was 91.         Ms. Dillon regarded her role as interpretive rather than creative. ''It is no good trying to impose my own idea of taste on the set,'' she said of the job that required her to translate a director's two-dimensional concept into three-dimensional reality.         By working closely with the writer, cameraman and costume designer, Ms. Dillon would draft 30 or 40 sketches to determine the movie's final set. In addition to overseeing a construction and props budget, she ensured that period details were correct, right down to the drab, cheap curtains she had specially printed for ''The Prince and the Showgirl,'' starring Olivier and Marilyn Monroe, and the tankards she thought appropriate for a wine shop during the Terror in ''A Tale of Two Cities.''         Though influenced by the Continental designers of the time, she preferred to work on films with a decidedly British feel. None proved a better fit than Olivier's adaptations of Shakespeare, and the partnership between Olivier and Ms. Dillon flourished. They worked on several Shakespeare stage productions, as well as on Olivier's 1954 film of ''Richard III.''         Ms. Dillon was educated at Newhall Convent in Essex. At 16 she won a scholarship to the Architectural Association, but was too young to accept it and instead attended North London Collegiate School for a year.         After spending the next six years training as an architect, she worked briefly in Dublin and London before turning her talents, through a friend's offer, to the burgeoning movie-studio system in England, where she earned a place in the art department at Fox Studios.         In 1938 she moved to the new Pinewood Studios, where she assisted Paul Sheriff in designing the sets and 750 costumes for ''The Mikado,'' the first film to be shot there in Technicolor. She later worked with Frank Wells on Anthony Asquith's ''French Without Tears'' (1939).         Among the first films for which she was sole art director was Asquith's 1943 work, ''The Demi-Paradise,'' in which Olivier played a Russian engineer observing life in England. The next year she returned to Sheriff's studio to help design ''Henry V'' for Olivier.         In the years after World War II, Ms. Dillon designed such films as Asquith's ''Way to the Stars'' (1945), ''The Browning Version'' (1951) and ''The Importance of Being Earnest'' (1952), Betty E. Box's ''Doctor in the House'' (1954), Joseph Losey's ''Accident'' (1967) and the 1976 horror film ''The Omen.''         Among the art directors she trained were John Box, Terence Marsh and Roy Walker, all of whom won Academy Awards.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Joan Stoliar, a freelance book designer otherwise known as the den mother of New York fly-fishers, who took her love of pristine trout streams into city classrooms, died on June 18 at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said her husband, Arthur.         Mrs. Stoliar's talents were in demand for books requiring special treatment for their illustrations or instructional materials. She also supplied the graphic designs for trade books by Richard Bach, James Clavell, Johnny Carson and the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska, among others.         For Mr. Bach she designed his best sellers ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' (Macmillan, 1970), ''Illusions'' (Delacorte, 1977) and ''The Bridge Across Forever'' (Morrow, 1984). ''Illusions'' was the first book design to be copyrighted in its entirety.         At the behest of the mayor's office she created a commemorative volume in 1989 to mark the 200th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration. Later, she designed New York City's souvenir parade program for troops returning from the Persian Gulf war.         In her angler's incarnation, Mrs. Stoliar was a board member of the Manhattan-based Theodore Gordon Flyfishers and the founding director of their Trout in the Classroom program. It helps to outfit and maintain artifical tanks in a number of public schools in which children raise hatchling brown trout.         The students then release the fish in the streams of the city's upstate watersheds. The program was created to help make the children aware of the clear brooks and rivers in the Catskills and Hudson Valley.         Mrs. Stoliar also inspired the club's Project Access, a volunteer effort to build trails and access ramps at two trout streams in the Catskills. She enlisted the Department of Environmental Conservation and other interested parties to make selected fishing holes accessible to the disabled and elderly.         Born Joan Kramer in Brooklyn, Mrs. Stoliar graduated from Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh in 1950 and worked as an art director at various publications before turning freelance. She frequently lectured on book design at publishers' seminars.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Stoliar is survived by a daughter, Lee Stoliar Dufresne of Charlotteville, N.J.; a son, Evan, of Manhattan; a sister, Dr. Virginia Stein of Somerville, N.J.; and a granddaughter.       
         Nija Battle, who brought a swaggering sense of sophistication to the furs she designed for the music world's most tireless clotheshorses, died last Thursday while on a business trip in Montreal. She was 37.         The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her sister, Saddiya Battle.         For a designer who did not have a store, who often met her future clients at clubs or outside restaurants, and who, until the editor Andre Leon Talley wrote about her in Vogue last year, was almost unknown in the fashion world, Ms. Battle had a large following. Her custom-made furs were worn by entertainers like Whitney Houston, Lil' Kim, Kid Rock and Puff Daddy, who had her make trousers for him in black sheared mink.         And although much of the attention at the Costume Institute's ''Rock Style'' gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last December was focused on fashion nabobs like Tom Ford of Gucci and Donatella Versace, it was Ms. Battle of Brooklyn who designed the wraps worn by Naomi Campbell, Iman, Lynn Whitfield and Mary J. Blige, who had on a turquoise fur chubby.         Ms. Battle began making furs about 10 years ago, though in a sense, she started as a child when she and her sister would take skins given to them by their father, an avid hunter, and turn them into blankets and doll clothes. The family lived in Brooklyn but had relatives in North Carolina, and Ms. Battle, who was part Tuscarora Indian, often visited a grandmother there who raised minks.         After getting experience with Orchard Street furriers, Ms. Battle started her own business and gradually gained a following among rap and hip-hop stars who saw her out wearing her own designs.         ''When people like Puff Daddy were photographed for magazines, they'd say to the stylists, 'I'm wearing my own coat,' '' recalled her sister. They meant, of course, Ms. Battle's furs. She also created coats for a number of sports stars, and, on occasion, made identical styles for their wives and children.         Her custom-made designs, often dyed in colors like champagne, burgundy and green, projected a high urban style -- what Mr. Talley called ''a ghetto fabulousness'' -- that not only appealed to Ms. Battle's celebrated clientele but also evoked the 1970's in fashion. She was certainly among the first designers to recognize the appeal of reviving that era.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by her mother, Gladys, and her brother, Saleem Muhammad, both of Brooklyn.       
         Thea Porter, one of the earliest  among British fashion designers who rode hippie chic to high visibility, if not always to enduring commercial success, died on Monday in London. She was 72.         Well before globalization became a fashion cliche, Ms. Porter was deploying the concept in her own canny rendition of it. Beginning in 1967, from a series of shops located in unlikely quarters of London and Paris, and later at I. Magnin in San Francisco and Giorgio of Beverly Hills, she made and sold clothes whose inspiration was drawn from her far-ranging travels and a childhood spent as the half-French, half-English daughter of a missionary posted to the Middle East.         Ms. Porter dressed Elizabeth Taylor for the souk, put the socialite Dalitha Getty in caftans and created Symbolist-inspired costumes for a perpetual party centered on the Rolling Stones and their newly made friends from the British aristocracy.         Her specialty was in finding exceptional fabrics -- Swiss chiffons, Indian handprints, 1930's French voiles uncovered in warehouses -- and deploying them voluminously for a clientele undaunted by the extravagance of both her silhouettes and her fees. A gypsy costume Ms. Porter made for Begum Aga Khan to wear to a fancy dress ball given by Baron Alexis de Rede was lavish enough that her fellow Briton, the designer Hardy Amies, described it as ''pre-guillotine.''         Born in Jerusalem on Dec. 24, 1927, Dorothea Noelle Naomi Porter was raised in Damascus, Syria, and briefly attended the Royal Holloway College in London, until she was expelled because, she once explained, ''I wanted to study art.'' Although her art studies were equally short-lived, a job as a librarian in Beirut eventually resulted in her marriage, in 1953, to Robert Porter, an economist attached to the British Embassy in Lebanon. As a diplomat's wife in the early 60's, Ms. Porter traveled to Iran and Jordan, spent holidays in Italy and France and, as she once said, ''went to nightclubs every night and had millions of clothes.''         The marriage dissolved in 1964, and Ms. Porter began a fashion career with textiles collected during her travels. By good fortune, the prevailing style of the moment was High Ethnic. Clients at her Moroccan-inspired shop on Greek Street in London included not only rock stars but also members of a nascent jet set whose style reflected their newfound nomadism. She attired both Jayne Wrightsman, the wife of the oil industrialist Charles Wrightsman, and the actress Jane Fonda as if for a visit to a caravanserai in Kabul.         ''Her real contribution was introducing ethnic clothes for that late 60's, rich hippie period,'' said the fashion designer Zandra Rhodes. It was a period, Ms. Rhodes said, ''of shawls and prints and unusual textiles that you might have seen on the Beatles or the Mamas and Papas,'' or the titled people who indulged their escapist fantasies with what one critic referred to as Ms. Porter's ''peacockerie.''         In 1971 Michael Butler, the producer of ''Hair'' on Broadway, financed a shop for Ms. Porter in New York. When the enterprise failed, Ms. Porter returned to England and turned her hand to decoration. Her store, Thea Porter Decorations, eventually went into receivership; she later formed a brief partnership in a smaller store with Princess Dina of Jordan. ''Sadly, one didn't hear of her after that,'' said Ms. Rhodes.         After a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, Ms. Porter moved from her Mayfair apartment to a nursing home in Kensington, where she died.         She is survived by a daughter, Venetia.       
         Loretta Young, the Academy Award-winning actress whose high cheekbones, pale skin and luminous eyes made her a reigning Hollywood beauty of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday in Los Angeles. She was 87 and lived in Palm Springs, Calif.         Miss Young, who won an Oscar as best actress for her performance in ''The Farmer's Daughter'' in 1947, later became a favorite of television viewers as the glowing star who twirled onto the stage in a designer gown each week to introduce an uplifting drama on ''The Loretta Young Show.'' She retired almost 40 years ago and never returned to the big screen.         Miss Young died at the home of her sister, Georgiana Montalban, the wife of the actor Ricardo Montalban, said Norman Brokaw, the chairman of the William Morris agency and her agent for 50 years. The cause was ovarian cancer, he said.         Hers was an art learned early in life. She first appeared on screen at age 4 as a fairy in the silent film ''The Primrose Ring.'' In 1928, she became a leading lady, starring opposite Lon Chaney in ''Laugh, Clown, Laugh.'' In addition to ''The Farmer's Daughter,'' in which she played an effervescent Swedish-born maid who runs for Congress, she appeared in nearly 100 films, often in the arms of such matinee idols as Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Tyrone Power or Cary Grant.         Her movies included ''Taxi'' with James Cagney in 1932; ''Zoo in Budapest'' with Gene Raymond in 1933; ''Man's Castle'' with Tracy, also in 1933; ''Call of the Wild'' with Gable in 1935; ''The Stranger'' with Orson Welles and Edward G. Robinson in 1946; and ''The Bishop's Wife'' with Grant in 1947.         Miss Young's screen image suggested a blend of virtuous poise, sensuality and vulnerability, and in fact, she once admitted to having had ''crushes'' on all of her leading men and to being ''susceptible'' to men in general. Reflecting on her appeal to moviegoers, she told Edward J. Funk, co-author of an unpublished autobiography:         ''My appeal wouldn't have been to the intellectuals or the neurotics. Nor to the shop girls and secretaries -- that would have been Joan Crawford's market. But there were an awful lot of women out there who were like me -- who were willing to play by the rules, didn't sleep around and were very aggressive. A Loretta Young movie had a happy ending; that's what it was geared to: a nice husband, nice lover, no abuse of any kind -- that's what the heroes and heroines were in those days.''         While Miss Young said she considered herself more of a ''movie star'' than an actress, she achieved her greatest popularity as the ''first lady'' of dramatic television, with ''The Loretta Young Show.'' In the half-hour anthology series, which ran on NBC from 1953 to 1961, Miss Young played characters from Queen Nefertiti to a nightclub singer. A trademark of the show was her glamorous entrance.         ''I did that to mollify the show's designer, Marusha,'' Miss Young said in a 1995 interview. ''I initially just walked through the doors, and Marusha was upset because no one would see the wonderful back of the dress.''         So Miss Young, who had studied ballet as a child, asked for a retake in which she entered the set and pirouetted before walking toward the camera. Viewers loved it.         The show at first was an audacious step for her, since at the time a fearful Hollywood was attacking television, a new medium and a formidable rival. Miss Young said friends and advisers warned her that if she appeared on television regularly she would be ''blackballed out of this business'' and ''never get another job.'' But she saw television as the ''wave of the future,'' and signed a contract with NBC and Procter & Gamble to produce and star in the dramatic series.         Miss Young appeared in 165 episodes. A devout Catholic, she ended each show by delivering a homily to the audience. Her show extolled ''respect for law and order and for disciplined deportment and character-building standards,'' she said in her 1961 memoir, ''The Things I Had to Learn,'' written with Helen Ferguson. ''Above all, we want to prove the strength, the good, really, of people.''         Although critics derided the moralistic melodramas as ''Sunday night soap opera,'' the series became one of the most popular on television, earning Miss Young millions of dollars and a reputation as one of the best businesswomen in Hollywood.         In 1972, she was awarded $559,000 by a jury in a breach-of-contract suit against NBC in which she contended that the network had humiliated her through the overseas release of introductory and closing segments of the show showing her in outmoded gowns and hairstyles.         She won the first of three Emmy Awards in 1953, which made her the first actress to win both an Oscar and an Emmy. The annual poll of TV-Radio Mirror readers earned her six consecutive gold medals as their favorite actress, and an episode of the series received the first television Grand Prix at the 1959 Cannes International Film Festival. The series was revived in 1962 as ''The New Loretta Young Show'' and ran for a year.         In 1995, Nostalgia Television, a national cable network, began reruns of the original show, the rights to which Miss Young had turned over to her son, Christopher Lewis, and his wife, Linda, who are film producers.         Perhaps the biggest controversy in her long career arose years after she left the screen. In 1994, her adopted daughter, Judy Lewis, maintained in an autobiography, ''Uncommon Knowledge,'' that she was the daughter of Miss Young and Clark Gable and that she was conceived during the making of ''Call of the Wild,'' in which the two starred.         In 1935 when the film was made, Miss Young was single and Gable was married to Ria Langham. Miss Lewis said that Miss Young was terrified that a scandal would end her career and Gable's, and that she had arranged to give birth in secret, taking more than a year off from work and citing an unspecified illness. Later, Miss Lewis asserted, Miss Young arranged her ''adoption,'' retrieving her from an orphanage where she had been temporarily placed.         For years, Miss Young refused to confirm or deny her daughter's account, dismissing it as ''a rumor from a bygone era.'' After the book's release, mother and daughter did not speak to each other for months.         Mr. Brokaw said yesterday, ''She didn't want to ever publicly acknowledge it.''         Miss Young, whose given name was Gretchen Michaela, was born on Jan. 6, 1913, in Salt Lake City. When she was 2 her parents separated, and her mother moved with her daughters and son, Jack, to Hollywood. She borrowed $1,000 from a Roman Catholic bishop, persuaded a department store to let her have furniture on credit and opened a boardinghouse.         Miss Young attended a convent school and began appearing as a child extra in movies, often working with her older sisters, Polly Ann and Betty Jane.         First National Studio signed her to a contract at age 14, put braces on her teeth and renamed her Loretta, a change she gladly accepted as evidence that she was on her way to becoming a star.         In 1930, at 17, Miss Young eloped with Grant Withers, her co-star in the film ''The Second-Story Murder.'' The marriage was annulled the following year. In 1940, she married Thomas H. A. Lewis, an advertising executive who later became a producer of her television series. The couple, who divorced in 1969, had two sons, Christopher, a producer, and Peter, a guitarist and songwriter.         Strong-willed, independent and rebellious, Miss Young was among the first female stars to command a six-figure salary. In 1939, when she rejected a five-year, $2 million contract with 20th Century Fox to try working as a freelance actress, she was blackballed by the studios. She made only one film, ''Eternally Yours,'' with David Niven, during the next two years.         She owned the rights to ''The Loretta Young Show'' and had control over its content, casting and final editing. And she paid strict attention to the show's moral tone.         During the filming for one episode, ''Come to the Stable,'' about two nuns who come to the United States from France to build a hospital for children, Miss Young became so disturbed by swearing on the set that she came up with the idea of a ''swear box.'' Cast and crew had to contribute up to 25 cents for each offense, and the money was donated to a home for unmarried mothers.         In 1963, at age 50, with movie offers still coming her way, Miss Young left show business. She later acknowledged that her retirement was perhaps premature and that she had always intended to resume her career. Although she was offered more than 150 parts, her last major role was that of an owner of a fashion magazine in ''Lady in the Corner,'' a 1989 television drama.         She lived an almost reclusive life and was rarely interviewed or photographed, although she occasionally appeared in public to promote one of her favorite charities. Her later years were quietly shared with her third husband, Jean Louis, a designer for Columbia Pictures, whom she married in 1994. Mr. Louis won an Oscar of his own in 1956 for his designs for ''The Solid Gold Cadillac.''         Mr. Louis died in 1997. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Montalban, Miss Young is survived by her three children.         Miss Young said that her faith sustained her through the difficult times in her life and that her mother had given her an invaluable sense of worth, independence and flair. In her memoir, she wrote: ''I believe that if we have lived our lives fully and well, and have accomplished, at least in part, the things which we were put here to do, we will be prepared -- mentally, spiritually and physically -- for our separation from this world.''

         Pat Hearn, one of the leading art dealers of the last two decades, a founder of the Gramercy International Art Fair and a pioneer of the art scene in the East Village, SoHo and Chelsea, died on Friday at her vacation home in Provincetown, Mass. She was 45 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, Colin de Land.         In her 17 years as a dealer, Ms. Hearn was widely respected as unusually empathetic to artists, open to new art and willing to share artists and ideas with other dealers. When her cancer was first diagnosed and it seemed that her insurance company would not cover her treatment (although it eventually paid for some of it), her friends organized a benefit to which hundreds of artists and dealers donated work and money.         Her gallery was in some ways a continually evolving artwork in which everything, from the 1950's-ish cursive letterhead to the furniture and design of her different spaces, expressed a distinct personality and sensibility. Yet none of this competed with the art on view, which reflected an eclectic mix of artistic generations and media -- painting, Conceptual Art and video art -- and a viewpoint that evolved from somewhat kitschy neo-pop to neo-geo to an ecumenical feminism.         The artists to whom Ms. Hearn gave first shows, or first New York shows, included the painters Philip Taffee, Milan Kunc, Peter Schuyff, Jutta Koether, Monique Prieto and, most recently, Jeff Elrod, and the Conceptualists Susan Hiller, Renee Green, Lincoln Tobier and Simon Leung. She showed artists she knew from her school days in Boston, including the painter George Condo, the installation artist Jack Pierson and the photographer Mark Morrisroe, and fostered the careers of such older artists as the painter Mary Heilmann, the video artist Joan Jonas and the Conceptualist Lutz Bacher. She was especially proud that she was able to mount posthumous shows of the work of Eva Hesse and Ana Mendieta.         Behind all this was a very complex woman, at once sophisticated and wholesome, stringent in her taste, yet extremely generous. Slim, dark-haired and usually dressed in a stylish mixture of designer and vintage clothes, Ms. Hearn resembled a bohemian Holly Golightly. In the early years she was usually trailed around her gallery by a nervous, adoring Chihuahua named Chi-Chi. She liked to give Easter Sunday parties and in the late 90's she held an annual Christmas party, complete with decorated tree, in her Chelsea gallery.         Ms. Hearn was born in Providence, R.I.. She studied painting and video at the Boston Museum School, sang with a band called Wild and Wonderful, and had a brief encounter with performance art before becoming an art dealer. She spent a year in Paris on a travel grant from the museum school in 1981, and while working at an alternative space called Usine Pali Kao began to realize that she was more interested in other artists' work than in her own. She returned to Boston, and while living on unemployment insurance, started a performance space in her home -- a ground-floor room in the Hemenway Hotel -- that she and her friends called the Poly Cow. A few months later she left for New York and a few months after that, in November of 1983, she opened her first gallery.         In terms of location, Ms. Hearn tended to be the first art dealer on the block. When most East village galleries were situated between First Avenue and Avenue A, she opened on Avenue B and Sixth Street and then expanded to a big SoHo-style space with polished wood floors on Ninth Street near Avenue D. In 1988 she moved to the relatively gallery-free southwest corner of SoHo, on Wooster Street near Grand, which soon teemed with new, experimental galleries. And in 1995, hers was one of three galleries to open on a deserted stretch of West 22nd Street in the wilds of west Chelsea on the same snowy February night. The other two were the Matthew Mark Gallery and the Morris-Healy Gallery, and the joint opening signaled a radical reshuffling of the downtown art scene that would eventually bring nearly 150 new galleries to Chelsea.         The year before, Ms. Hearn, Mr. Marks and Paul Morris of Morris-Healy had begun to explore the idea of a New York art fair for younger dealers. The result was the Gramercy International, a lively, live-in fair that took place at the Gramercy Hotel on Lexington Avenue and 21st Street for five years before graduating to larger spaces. The 2001 Gramercy International will be held on Pier 90 and will include 160 participants, nearly double the number of last year's fair at the Javits Center.         Ms. Hearn's first marriage ended in divorce. She and Mr. de Land, whose SoHo gallery, American Fine Arts, is as much an art piece as her own, were married last year after almost 10 years together.         In addition to Mr. de Land, Ms. Hearn is survived by her mother, Alice Darcy Hearn of Cranston, R.I.; two sisters, Marie, of Providence, and Marion, of Warren, R.I.; and two brothers, John, of Providence, and William J., of Cranston.       
         Miki Denhof, one of the first women to be the art director of a magazine, and a noted mentor of fashion photographers, died on Wednesday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 88.         In 1945, when Ms. Denhof joined Conde Nast, its fashion and lifestyle magazines were widely influential for their use of elegant typography and conceptual photography, approaches in which she, too, excelled. The executive art director, Alexander Liberman, installed Ms. Denhof as promotion art director of Vogue. There, ''she was a creative force and arbiter of quality,'' said a friend and colleague, Estelle Ellis.         ''She also developed a keen ability to edit pictures into narrative sequences and was deft with type,'' Ms. Ellis continued. ''She transcended the conventions of advertising design at that time.''         Later named the editorial art director for House and Garden and Glamour magazines, Ms. Denhof collaborated with Mr. Liberman, refining the typographic and photographic styles that characterized those publications.         But she was not simply a stylist. ''Miki always had a sense of the big picture,'' said Don Wise, who was art director of the Glamour promotion art department in the 1950's. ''She designed in an intellectual way, using words as integral parts of her pictures. Now designers routinely integrate type and image, but she did it before most others.''         In the 60's, at Glamour, she nurtured and mentored many American and European-emigre photographers, including David Bailey, Frank Horvat, Jeanloup Sieff, Louis Faurer and Saul Leiter.         ''She was the only art director I wouldn't question,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''She could put 22 pictures on a spread and I wouldn't worry. She'd always do it right.''         Ms. Denhof was born in 1912 in Trieste, Italy, raised in Austria and educated in Vienna and Berlin. She left Germany for New York with her family in 1938.         One of her earliest design jobs was as an assistant to the Modernist designer Paul Rand at Esquire and Apparel Arts magazines. She was also art director of Conde Nast Books, responsible for such titles as ''Vanity Fair: Photographs of an Age 1914-1936'' with Diane Edkins, and ''The Successful Face'' with Amy Green.         After leaving Conde Nast in 1977 she designed exhibitions, catalogs and a documentary book for the Guild Hall in East Hampton, which also mounted an exhibition of her editorial layouts.         She spent the last few years archiving the photo albums and diaries of her father, Bernhard Bardach, a doctor in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. Recently she donated 900 of the photographs to the Leo Baeck Institute in New York. Some were used in the 1999 exhibition ''Fighting for the Fatherland: The Patriotism of Jews in World War I.''         Ms. Denhof was divorced from Hans Denhof, who is deceased. She has no immediate survivors.       
         Alice Recknagel Ireys, one of the most prominent landscape architects of the second half of the 20th century, with more than 1,000 public and private projects to her name, died Tuesday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.         A bridge between the 19th-century tradition of gracious landscaping for grand estates and elegant modern design for postwar suburban homes, she also created many major public garden spaces. Important projects can be seen in both the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.         One of her famous designs was for the Fragrance Garden at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which became a prototype internationally for gardens used by people with disabilities.         Born in Brooklyn on April 24, 1911, as Alice Recknagel, Mrs. Ireys lived all her life in the Brooklyn Heights town house occupied since 1835 by five generations of her family.         Her serious gardening began in a youth program at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which was founded in 1910, a year before her birth.         ''The Burpee company provided the seeds, and after we planted them and followed their growth, we were allowed to take the plants home,'' she recalled in an interview not long before her death.         In 1935, she completed her formal training as a landscape architect at the Cambridge School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture in Massachusetts when it was affiliated with Smith College.         Before setting up her own practice in 1947 in her home, she worked in Manhattan with other landscape architects, mostly women, on public housing projects, public playgrounds, college campuses and lakeside plantings at the 1939 New York World's Fair.         Mrs. Ireys traveled to England and France and worked in 17 states, but it was her native Brooklyn, with its famous botanic garden, that commanded her attention and affection over a lifetime.         She was one of the remaining links to a golden age of landscape architecture as a profession for women, beginning around the end of the 19th century. Her principles formed a critical transition in American garden history between the great estate era and the explosion of suburban and town gardens that followed World War II.         By scaling down and reconfiguring broad terraces, flower walks and parterres, she conferred on modest properties the same sense of privilege and gracious outdoor living that had once been reserved for country estates. She made a great virtue of the serpentine line to give the illusion of length and breadth.         She emphasized the simple pleasures of walking around flower beds, sitting under the dappled shade of a tree or dining with friends on a terrace. Achieving this, however, required underlying construction and a sophisticated selection of plants and trees compatible with the climate and the care that could be supplied.         ''To produce a living functional picture as well as a beautiful one'' was how Mrs. Ireys defined garden design in the first of her four books, ''How to Plan and Plant Your Own Property'' (1967). Her books, with their accessible prose, site plans and photographs, have served as basic training for many in the next generation of professional landscape architects and for amateurs as well.         She also wrote ''Small Gardens for City and Country'' (1978) and two books published in 1991 for W. Atlee Burpee & Company, ''Designs for American Gardens'' and ''Garden Designs,'' which included her popular planting plans, originally published in Burpee catalogs.         Mrs. Ireys considered it a challenge to design a garden of any size. ''Once,'' she reminisced, ''I met a woman who wanted a garden but could not afford one, so we made a deal. I designed and planted her garden, and she delivered two loaves of homemade bread to us once a week for two years. My children were thrilled.''         Galen Williams, a landscape designer in East Hampton, N.Y, who assisted her, recalled: ''Her eye was so finely tuned that once after appraising a mock-up for a front and side fence, Mrs. Ireys requested that one section be lowered by an inch and the other by a half-inch. The next time it was perfect.''         After a major planting of evergreens was completed by Mrs. Ireys, Ms. Williams recalled, ''the trees instantly looked as if they had been there for 50 years.''         The way her gardens settled into the landscape gave them a sense of timelessness, even though they had to be carefully monitored.         ''If you do well in people's gardens, they keep coming back,'' was Mrs. Ireys's summation of her long career. But she could also bluntly tell one client to remove a row of azaleas because ''it looks like motel planting.''         In later years, she inspected large gardens from the vantage of a golf cart, using her cane as a pointer.         In Manhattan, Mrs. Ireys's public work can be seen in the colonial-style garden behind the Mount Vernon Hotel Museum and Garden, the former Abigail Adams Smith Museum on East 61st Street, a 1799 carriage house that became a popular hotel on the East River.         In 1988, at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, she designed two gardens, the Mae L. Wien Cutting Garden and Helen's Garden of Fragrant Plants, a memorial to Helen Goodhart Altschul, who was blind for the last 20 years of her life. Both demonstrate an array of visual tricks that make small plots appear larger.         In 1978, Mrs. Ireys was elected a fellow in the American Society of Landscape Architects. In 1991, she received the Liberty Hyde Bailey Award from the American Horticultural Society. Recently, she gave her professional papers to Smith College. A documentary film about her life and work, ''The Living Landscapes of Alice Recknagel Ireys,'' by Malcolm MacDougall, was released this year.         Mrs. Ireys is survived by a sister, Catherine Ropes of Hartsdale, N.Y.; two daughters, Catherine Gandel of Los Angeles and Dr. Anne Lennon of Green Harbor, Mass.; a son, Dr. Henry T. Ireys of Baltimore; and five grandsons. Her husband, Henry T. Ireys, whom she married in 1943, died in 1963.         Next June, Mrs. Ireys was to receive the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Better Earth Award, recognizing people who are engaged in important environmental work in the community that benefits the planet. As a lecturer and designer at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden for more than 50 years, Mrs. Ireys considered the garden her true home and did her most important community project for it.         The Fragrance Garden she designed there was completed in 1955 and later extensively restored. It is accessible to the blind and to visitors who use wheelchairs. An oval garden with raised perimeter beds that can be easily touched and smelled, the Fragrance Garden is divided into four sections with Braille labels: fragrant flowers, plants for touch, plants with scented leaves and kitchen herbs. The flagstone walk around the central lawn makes it easy to move around the edges.         ''At night when I can't sleep,'' Mrs. Ireys said, ''I think about my different jobs and what fun they all were.''       
         Emily Wilkens, an award-winning fashion designer who rejected the idea that young girls should be dressed as if they were their mothers in miniature, died in the Bronx on Saturday. She was 83.         Beginning in the early 1940's and drawing on references as diverse as Russian peasant dresses, mid-19th-century pinafores and the paintings of Thomas Gainsborough, Ms. Wilkens designed clothes for preteen and teenage girls that belied the formality and fussiness apparel makers had tended to force upon them.         ''She was the first to really recognize that this was a growth area,'' the fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert said.         Ms. Wilkens's sensibility ran toward the unconstricted; even her party dresses were made of washable cottons. With developing adolescent figures in mind, her dresses featured adjustable waistlines; her full skirts allowed for widening hips.         In a 1944 collection produced for Bonwit Teller, she surprised her audience by using black in dresses for teenage girls. But, as The New York Times wrote at the time, ''Black that no mother could object to, for it was made with snug bodice and as full a dirndl as the law permits.''         The fashion historian Richard Martin once wrote, ''Long before rock 'n' roll and James Dean movies, Emily Wilkens invented the American teenager, pegging her sensibility to young, playful, energetic women.''         Ms. Wilkens came to the world of children's wear rather by accident. While vacationing in Hollywood in the early 1940's, Ms. Wilkens, then an illustrator, was erroneously introduced at a party as a children's fashion designer. Soon after, she was asked to design a wardrobe for Ann Todd, a child star, who needed to be outfitted for a new movie. As a result, Ms. Wilkens began designing clothes for the progeny of celebrities like Jack Benny and Gracie Allen.         Born in Hartford in 1917, Ms. Wilkens studied fashion illustration at Pratt Institute. After graduating in 1938, she began sketching dresses for department store newspaper advertisements. She married Judge Irving L. Levey in 1947.         By 1948, Ms. Wilkens had started a concomitant career as a writer with the book ''Here's Looking at You: The Modern Slant on Smartness for the Junior Miss.'' She wrote four more books on beauty and grooming and served as a trustee of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York from 1966 to 1976.         After receiving a diagnosis of dementia nine years ago, Ms. Wilkens was moved to the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale in 1991, where she died. She is survived by a daughter, Jane Wilkens Michael, a son, Hugh Levey, and five grandchildren.
