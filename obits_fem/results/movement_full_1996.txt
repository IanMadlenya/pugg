         Olga Marie Madar, who rose to the top echelon in the United Automobile Workers and fought for women's rights in the labor movement, died on Thursday at her home in Detroit. She was 80.         The cause was heart failure, the union said.         Ms. Madar achieved several firsts for women in a union career that spanned 62 years. With pressure from restive female members and the support of Walter P. Reuther, the union's president, she was in 1966 the first woman to take a seat on the union's board.         She was also the first woman to be elected an international vice president of the union, in 1970. And she was the founding national president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women in 1974. She retired as an officer of the union in 1974 but remained active in retiree affairs until last year.         She was born in Sykesville, Pa., one of 12 children of a coal miner and grocer who moved the family to Detroit in search of work when she was 15. In 1933, she found a summer job on a Chrysler assembly line.         Years later she recalled that the line moved so fast she could "never keep up" and had nightmares about it. She said she was apparently kept on the job because of her citywide reputation as a terror on the women's softball team.         "There was no union at the plant then," she said, "and the fact that they would hire me when other workers were being laid off -- just because I could play softball -- was incredible. It was my first indication that a union was badly needed."         She remained an advocate for women, aware that women rarely worked more than  two or three days a week and were the last hired and first fired. Working summers, she graduated from Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti in 1938 with a degree in physical education.         She reached her first milestone as a unionist in 1947 when she became the director of the recreation department at the auto workers union. She was elected to the policy-setting board at the union convention in 1966.         She joined Reuther in squashing a notion that labor should chart its own political course rather than stick to its alliance with the Democrats. .         Unhappiness among female union members with their lack of power within the unions led to the formation in 1974 of the Coalition of Labor Union Women.         Ms. Madar was also active in civic affairs, working with national organizations with programs to improve parks and recreation centers in the inner cities. She also acted to give citizens access to decision-making in that area.         The union said it had no immediate word on survivors.       
         Betty Meredith-Jones, a dance educator and a pioneer in the field of movement rehabilitation and community dance in Britain, died last Sunday at her home in Rhosili, Wales. She was 87.         Ms. Meredith-Jones, born in Wales in 1908, trained as a young dancer with Rudolf Laban, a movement theorist. She taught physical education and dance before coming to the United States in 1952. In the late 1950's she came to Manhattan, where she began teaching movement classes for the elderly. In the early 60's, at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, she established a pilot program in the rehabilitation through movement of patients with Parkinson's disease.         Ms. Meredith-Jones received a master's degree from Columbia University and taught at Teachers College of Columbia University and the New School for Social  Research.         She is survived by a sister, Georgina Meredith-Jones.       
         Jane Howard, a writer whose works included a widely praised biography of Margaret Mead and a close look at the dynamics of families, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 61.         Ms. Howard, who also had a home in Sag Harbor, L.I., had been suffering from  cancer, friends said.         Although she once described herself as "just a garden-variety English major" at the University of Michigan, Ms. Howard had been bitten by the journalism bug  as a girl in Winnetka, Ill. Her father was a political reporter for The Chicago  Tribune.         After graduating from the University of Michigan, where she was a reporter and editor on the campus newspaper, she came to Manhattan at the age of 21 as an editorial trainee at Time-Life. Her superiors noticed her drive and intelligence, and by 1958 she was doing profiles for Life magazine.         Insatiably curious about why people do what they do, and why relationships work or don't work, Ms. Howard specialized in profiling writers, including Saul  Bellow, John Updike and Truman Capote. She once celebrated New Year's at Capote's home at Sagaponack, L.I., "eating baked potatoes and caviar," as she put it.         Her most acclaimed work was the 1984 biography "Margaret Mead: a Life." Her account of the anthropologist's long life and career was a critical and commercial triumph. Ms. Howard interviewed about 300 people and traveled as far  as Australia and New Zealand to cull fact from legend.         Her first trip to Australia produced one embarrassing and, in retrospect, humorous exchange. While in Sydney, a city of some three million, she happened to mention to an Australian sociology professor that she had never seen a live kangaroo.         The professor told her not to feel bad. In his trips to Manhattan, he said, he had never seen a live buffalo.         Ms. Howard's earlier books were "Please Touch: A Guided Tour of the Human Potential Movement" (1970), "A Different Woman" (1973) and "Families" (1978).         "A Different Woman" was an examination of the feminist movement. For "Families," Ms. Howard visited dozens of households and concluded that, contrary to superficial wisdom, families were not dying but "in flamboyant and dumbfounding ways they are changing their size and their shape and their purpose."         At her death, Ms. Howard was under contract to Simon & Schuster for a nonfiction book, tentatively titled "Heartland," on the Midwest.         Between books, she taught writing at several universities, including the University of Georgia and Yale. She participated in the Writers Workshop at the  University of Iowa. Most recently, she taught a graduate class in nonfiction at  Columbia.         She once described her religious upbringing as "knee-jerk Congregational" and said she felt most intensely religious in the presence of nature, "where the air is fresh and there's something to look at other than rectangles."         She is survived by a sister, Ann Condon of Seattle.       
         Mollie H. Beattie, who resigned as director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on June 6 because of failing health, died on Thursday at Grace  Cottage Hospital in Townsend, Vt. She was 49 and lived in Grafton and Alexandria, Va.         The cause was brain cancer, said a friend, Alexandra M. Marks.         A forester by training, Ms. Beattie was the first woman to head the agency.  In three years as director, she defended the Endangered Species Act against attacks from many Republicans in Congress and fought efforts to reduce the agency's budget, not always successfully.         "In the Clinton Administration, she was probably the strongest single voice for wildlife conservation," said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of the Defenders of Wildlife, a nonprofit group that works to protect and preserve species.         Ms. Beattie was a strong proponent of the effort to have gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park for the first time since the 1920's. Mr. Schlickeisen  said one of his most vivid memories of her was seeing her rub cold water on the  belly of a wild wolf at Yellowstone in April to cool it so the animal could be moved to another site for release. Despite the rain in her face, he recalled, she smiled broadly and said, "Any day I can touch a wild wolf is a good day."         As director, she was responsible for the wildlife service's 7,000 employees and an annual budget for resource management of $501 million in the current fiscal year, down from $511 million the previous year. The agency, part of the Interior Department, enforces wildlife laws, administers the Endangered Species  Act and carries out wetland protection and management. John Rogers has been serving as acting director.         Ms. Beattie sought to conserve species by managing entire ecosystems rather than waiting until individual species became endangered, and presided over the addition of 15 national wildlife refuges to a system that now has 508.         The agency said that under her direction 140 habitat conservation plans were  established and 300 more were being developed. These plans are formal agreements between landowners and the Fish and Wildlife Service that allow the owners to harm individual members of a species listed as endangered or threatened if they  take steps to help the species as a whole to recover.         She argued that such plans demonstrated that the Endangered Species Act, under which they are carried out, has the flexibility to conserve species while  allowing economic development. In fact, she said, the act "has been one of the biggest success stories of the conservation movement in America," contending that many myths had been spread about the act's supposedly onerous effects.         Just before she resigned, she led efforts to resume the listing of endangered species after a 13-month moratorium imposed by Congress, which sharply cut the agency's money for such listings in the current fiscal year.         Earlier this month, Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, introduced legislation in the House and Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, in the Senate to name an eight-million-acre wilderness in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge after her.         Mollie Beattie was born on April 27, 1947, in Glen Cove, L.I. She earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., in 1968 and a master's degree in forestry at the University of Vermont in 1979. She also received a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University in 1991.         She was program director and lands manager for the Windham Foundation, a nonprofit organization that conducts seminars on critical issues facing Vermont, from 1983 to 1985; commissioner of the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and  Recreation from 1985 to 1989, and deputy secretary of the state's Agency of Natural Resources from 1989 to 1990. She left to become executive director of a  public policy institute, the Richard A. Snelling Center for Government in Vermont, before taking her post at the Fish and Wildlife Service.         She is survived by her husband, Rick Schwolsky of Grafton; her mother, Patricia Beattie of Ketchum, Idaho, and a sister, Jane Beattie, also of Ketchum.       
         Catherine S. East, a little-known Government researcher who became the quiet inspiration for the National Organization for Women and a persistent goad to the nascent feminist movement, died on Saturday at Kendal at Ithaca, a retirement community in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 80.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Elizabeth R. East, her daughter.         Betty Friedan, whose 1963 book ''The Feminine Mystique'' is credited with helping to spark the modern women's movement, said yesterday that Ms. East was a ''prime mover'' in the 1966 birth of NOW.         ''She and others kept saying how what we needed is an N.A.A.C.P. for women,'' Ms. Friedan said. ''I thought of myself as a writer, not an organizer, but Catherine kept emphasizing that what was needed was outside pressure on the Government.''         Characteristically, Ms. East worked without public acknowledgment and was often so far in the background that friends in the movement started calling her ''Deep Throat.''         As a longtime researcher for the Labor Department and later as executive director for various Federal commissions and task forces on the status of women, she came to know scores of accomplished, professional women, in and out of Government, who were concerned about sex discrimination and became important in the feminist movement.         Moreover, she had an access to and command of facts on employment practices, workplace discrimination and other matters that she often used to disarm critics who opposed feminist legislation. But as a Government employee, she felt she could never take a public, vocal role, friends and colleagues said.         Vera Glaser, a journalist, recalled that at a news conference early in the Nixon Administration, she pointedly asked the new President whether he would appoint more women to his Administration. Ms. Glaser was surprised to get a letter later in which Ms. East wrote, ''I gather from the tone of your question, you might be interested in a few statistics.'' It was the beginning of a fruitful relationship that helped Ms. Glaser write a widely noted five-part newspaper series on discrimination against women. ''A lot of the facts came from Catherine,'' Ms. Glaser said.         In 1963, Ms. East helped write and research a Government report titled ''American Women,'' which called for the establishment of Federal and state commissions on women. It was at a conference of these commissions in June 1966 that a group of women came to Betty Friedan's hotel room to urge the formation of the group that, four months later, became NOW. Although Ms. East was not present in the hotel room, she had urged most of the women there to lobby Ms. Friedan.         ''Catherine would just persist and persist until it happened,'' recalled Mary Eastwood, a retired staff lawyer for the Justice Department and a friend of Ms. East.         The daughter of Ulysses Grant Shipe, a bank president in Huntington, W.Va., and Bertha Woody Shipe, a homemaker, Ms. East was educated at Marshall University in Huntington, where she received a bachelor's degree in history in 1943.         In addition to her daughter Elizabeth, of Ithaca, Ms. East is survived by another daughter, M. Victoria East of Seattle; a brother, Charles D. Shipe of Great Falls, Va., and a granddaughter.       
         Kathleen Carlin, a social service executive who devoted her professional life to the proposition that men can learn to get along quite well without beating up their wives and girlfriends, died on Sept. 20 at a hospice near her home in Atlanta. She was 57 and had been a leading voice in the movement to stop violence against women.         Colleagues said the cause was cancer.         Ms. Carlin, a native of Maywood, Neb., who graduated from the University of Nebraska and received a master's in social work there, married right after college and began raising a family, first in Atlanta and later in Houston. She did not begin her career until the mid-1970's, when she and her family returned to Atlanta and settled there for good.         But once she got started, taking a job in suburban Atlanta as director of Georgia's first shelter for battered women, Ms. Carlin became so outraged by what she viewed as society's indifference to the problem that she was soon in the forefront of national efforts to curb domestic violence.         Although Ms. Carlin held high positions in the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, helped found the National Women's Abuse Prevention Project and was keynote speaker at national conferences, her major contribution came as the executive director of Men Stopping Violence, an organization based in Atlanta that she helped establish in 1982.         With a $5 million annual budget, the group seeks to effect change  across the spectrum of what Ms. Carlin described as a continuum of sanctioned abuse of women. In addition to running programs of intensive behavior modification for men with a history of abusing women and training instructors to operate similar programs across the country, the organization works to change the social norms of male supremacy and control that Ms. Carlin came to see as the underlying causes of abuse.         Although the organization has shown some promise -- for example, winning contracts with the military and religious denominations to help them change their organizational cultures to take the issue seriously -- Ms. Carlin did not need to be reminded that her efforts were barely a beginning.         After all, as she was quick to point out, an estimated 3 million to 4 million women suffer some degree of physical abuse at the hands of men each year, and surveys indicate that women in two-thirds of American marriages are battered at least once by their husbands.         And Ms. Carlin, who saw physical violence as just one extreme measure men use to control women, had an answer for anyone who might suggest that in the vast majority of those marriages the violence was so rare as to be inconsequential. She would be ready with a case history to show that a single beating was often all it took for a man to establish domination.         The case involved a woman whose husband beat her severely one Thanksgiving and never laid a hand on her after that -- because he did not have to. As Ms. Carlin recalled, after that all he had to do when his wife balked at bowing to his wishes was to say ''remember Thanksgiving,'' and the terrified wife would submit.         Just as that wife had learned to conduct herself to avoid the serious consequences of displeasing her husband, Ms. Carlin felt that men would decide not to beat their wives at the exact moment that society came to regard domestic abuse as a serious criminal offense to be dealt with swiftly, surely and severely.         And that, she argued, will never happen until society abandons the notion of across-the-board male domination that tends to justify violence against women in the first place. That may be a tall order, but Ms. Carlin was not one to shrink from a challenge. In 1990, for example, she joined a group of women who scaled Mount Kenya, and for all her frustrations in trying to reform an entire society, she knew how to have a good time.         Indeed, her annual high-spirited Christmas parties made such an impression on her staff and friends that they provided an antidote of sorts to the grim ''remember Thanksgiving'' tag line of Ms. Carlin's anecdote of domestic abuse. Or, as those who vowed to continue her work might put it, ''remember Christmas.''         Ms. Carlin is survived by her husband, John; two daughters, Suzanne Rianhard of San Francisco and Elizabeth Carlin of New York; her mother, Arlene Hough of Atlanta, and a sister, Janet Allen of Dallas.       
         Magda Trocme, a French parson's wife who opened her door to a single shivering refugee in 1940 and helped inspire a movement that saved thousands of Jews and others from the Nazis in World War II, died on Oct. 10 a hospital in Paris. She was 94 and lived in Paris.         Although she was a heroine to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Memorial Authority, to her dying day Mrs. Trocme could not comprehend a world that regarded it as in any way remarkable that she, her husband, and thousands of other residents of the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in the plateau region of southern France had risked their lives to feed, clothe, hide and protect those who would have died without their help.         But then Mrs. Trocme was an anomaly, a free-thinking woman whose life was dedicated to the curious principle that just as food is the answer to hunger the only rational antidote to violence is nonviolence.         Mrs. Trocme owed her own prominence in the rescue movement in part to the fact that her husband, Andre Trocme, was the charismatic pacifist pastor of the French Reformed Church in Chambon, a founder of the Cevenol boarding school there and a recognized leader of the rescue effort, which has been credited with saving some 5,000 refugees, about 3,500 of them Jewish, many of them children.         But as scores of refugees who came to her own door discovered, Mrs. Trocme was more than her husband's shadow; she was a highly organized, tireless and practical woman who knew how to find food when there was no food and just which door to knock on to find room and welcome for those her own overburdened household could not accommodate.         The almost unanimous support the rescue movement enjoyed in the area around Chambon is generally attributed to the mostly Protestant peasant population's identification with the victims of persecution.         But neither her husband nor Mrs. Trocme were natives of the region. Mrs. Trocme, whose paternal grandfather was a refugee from Czarist Russia and whose father was an engineer who had been a colonel in the Italian cavalry, was born in Florence, where she had an unconventional reaction to a conventional Catholic upbringing. While a convent student, she rejected the Church and embraced Protestantism.         While studying on a scholarship at the old School of Social Work in New York in 1925, she met Mr. Trocme, a  Protestant from northern France who was studying at the Union Theological Seminary. They were married in 1926.         After his ordination, Mr. Trocme, who was something of a free-thinker himself (he had renounced violence and become a conscientious objector in World War I) was regarded as so much of a rebel in the French Protestant church that he was sent in 1934 to Chambon in southern France, a region with a long history of tolerance since the days it had become a refuge for Huguenots fleeing the purges of Catholic France.         Like her husband, Mrs. Trocme, who taught Italian at the Cevenol school, was a thoroughgoing pacifist. But many of the villagers and farmers of the region were not. Under the rule of the collaborationist Vichy Government and the later German occupation many of them took part in the Resistance activities that were common throughout France, but what set the Chambon area apart was its role as a place of refuge.         Although her open-hearted welcome to the Jewish woman who knocked on her door one snowy night in 1940 has been considered the beginning of the Chambon movement, Mrs. Trocme's daughter, Nelly Hewitt of Minneapolis, stressed yesterday that in an area where secrecy was a way of life and virtually every home eventually harbored one or more refugees, it is impossible to know whether her mother had been the first.         Mrs. Trocme's initial effort almost backfired, her daughter recalled, when she placed her visitor's soaked shoes next to the hearth to dry and they caught fire.         After the war, Mr. Trocme became the European secretary for the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an American-based pacifist group, and during the 1950's he and his wife made fund-raising tours of the United States. He later became pastor of a church in Geneva, and after his death in 1971, Mrs. Trocme retired to Paris.         There she wondered at the attention her efforts had received over the years, including a 1989 book by Philip P. Hallie, ''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed,'' and a television documentary, ''Weapons of the Spirit.''         To her mind, at least, she had done nothing more than provide the obvious help to those in obvious need. She no more understood the fuss over her efforts to rescue Jews than the consternation she caused her neighbors  when policemen came to arrest her husband (he was later released) and she served them dinner.         ''I don't understand,'' she said. ''It was dinner time.''         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Trocme is survived by a son, Jacques, of Paris, 10 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 9, 1996, Saturday         An obituary on Oct. 19 about Magda Trocme, a Frenchwoman who helped shield Jewish refugees from the Nazis in World War II, misspelled the name of her daughter and misstated the daughter's hometown. She is Nelly Hewett, not Hewitt, of St. Paul, not Minneapolis.       
         Marion Durham Cuyjet, a pioneering teacher of black dancers, died on Oct. 22 at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. Mrs. Cuyjet was 76 and lived in Philadelphia.         She had been suffering from cardiopulmonary disorders, according to her son, Stephen Cuyjet Jr.         Mrs. Cuyjet's most famous pupil was Judith Jamison, artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Ms. Jamison began training in ballet at the age of 6 with ''Miss Marion,'' as everyone called Mrs. Cuyjet (pronounced soo-zhay).         In addition to teaching classical ballet and other dance techniques,  Mrs. Cuyjet taught her students that ''dancers were not hybrid creatures dropped down from the clouds with no relation to earth,'' as Ms. Jamison noted in her autobiography, ''Dancing Spirit.''         Mrs. Cuyjet also provided subliminal lessons in determination and race relations. ''She looked Caucasian and rented studio space that landlords would not rent to a person they thought was black,'' Ms. Jamison wrote. ''She broke the color barrier and was constantly evicted once black children were discovered on the premises; she had to move her school seven times.''         Born in Cheswold, Del., Mrs. Cuyjet studied ballet in Philadelphia with Essie Marie Dorsey, herself a student of Michel Fokine and Mikhail Mordkin, and opened the Judimar School in 1948. Mrs. Cuyjet created dances for public events in the city, and in the late 1950's was the principal choreographer for the annual Christmas Cotillion sponsored by Heritage House, a leading black cultural organization in Philadelphia.         From 1958 into the 1970's, Mrs. Cuyjet was on the dance faculty at Maryland State College (now the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore) and also taught at Delaware State College in Dover, and Cheney State University in Cheney, Pa. She closed her studio in 1971 and trained as a movement therapist, working at the Philadelphia State Hospital for 11 years. She was also a dance panelist on the Pennsylvania State Arts Council.         Mrs. Cuyjet's husband, Stephen, died in 1980. In addition to her son, Stephen Jr., of San Diego, she is survived by a daughter, Judith Coldvin, of Marlton, N.J.; a son, Mark, of Philadelphia; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Jessie Bernard, a sociologist whose wide-ranging research and writings on women's issues provided scholarly foundation for the modern feminist revolution, died on Oct. 6 at a nursing home in Washington. She was 93.         By rights, Dr. Bernard should have been content to observe the reawakening of feminism benignly from the far side of a long and completed career.         Indeed, when Betty Friedan revived feminist fervor with the publication of her landmark ''Feminine Mystique'' in 1963, Dr. Bernard was a 60-year-old Penn State professor a year away from retirement. And, with the exception of ''Academic Women,'' a 1961 work derived from her own experiences in academia, the dozen or so works on subjects like community organization that had gained her reputation as a respected scholar seemed remote from the suddenly urgent issues raised by the Friedan treatise.         But like many professional women of a certain age who had balanced a successful career with marriage and motherhood, Dr. Bernard came to the realization that she had been a feminist all along and, as it turned out, had a lot to say on the subject.         So much so, in fact, that within a decade after her formal retirement in 1964 she had turned out a torrent of books -- among them ''The Sex Game,'' ''The Female World,'' ''The Future of Marriage'' and ''The Future of Motherhood'' -- that established her as a premier scholar of the women's movement.         It is in part a tribute to her scholarship that many of the ideas she advanced, like the notion that marriage generally benefits men more than women, seem commonplace today.         Although her works were based on meticulous research, as a feminist scholar Dr. Bernard had an edge. For when it came to writing about women as wives, mothers and breadwinners, she had not only been there and done that, she had also done it with uncommon flair.         On the surface, she had led the most conventional of lives. The daughter of immigrant shopkeepers from Romania, Dr. Bernard, whose original name was Ravitch, was born in Minneapolis, attended the University of Minnesota, married her college sweetheart and followed her husband from job to job, serving variously as his assistant and collaborator while holding a series of lower-level jobs, and not beginning her own academic career in earnest until she was in her 40's, an age when a woman's children are generally old enough to fend for themselves.         But surfaces can be deceiving, and there was very little conventional about Dr. Bernard.         For one thing, the college sweetheart she married was not a classmate, but one of her professors, Dr. Luther Lee Bernard, a founder of the modern study of sociology and a man more than twice her age when they met in a classroom and felt such a powerful mutual attraction that neither looked back.         She then accelerated her education, graduating at 20 and receiving a master's degree the next year. After marrying her professor she began a peripatetic life, following him band from academic post to post, including a sojourn to Argentina, where she helped him with the research that would win him wide acclaim.         Dr. Bernard did not obtain her own doctorate, from Washington University in St. Louis, until she was 32, and did not begin her teaching career, at the Lindewood College for Women, near St. Louis, until she was 37.         Then, at a time when many women's children are beginning to leave home, Dr. Bernard started having children, the first when she was 39, another when she was 42 and the last when she was 47, three years after she and her husband had joined the Penn State faculty and six months before his death at the age of 69.         By the time she retired from Penn State and began writing about women's issues, Dr. Bernard knew what it meant to be both a wife and a single mother.         She moved her family to Washington and became a central figure in the feminist revolution, studying subtle forms of sex discrimination as scholar in residence for the United States Commission on Civil Rights, for example, and becoming a founding board member for the Center for Women in Policy Studies.         In her later years Dr. Bernard, who was known for her beaming smile and generosity in helping younger scholars, exerted a magnetic attraction at conferences and other gatherings, her colleagues at the center said, and was regarded by some scholars as a founding mother of sociology.         Dr. Bernard is survived by a daughter, Dorothy Jackson of Washington; two sons, Claude, of Laurel, Md., and David, of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.       
         Ruth E. Moskowitz of Brooklyn, a justice of the New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, died on Nov. 2 at Mount Sinai Medical Center. A native and lifetime resident of Brooklyn Heights, she was 60.         Her family said the cause was scleroderma, a rheumatological disorder.         Judge Moskowitz first won election to the State Supreme Court in 1982 and was assigned to Criminal Term, Kings County. She was re-elected posthumously this month to a second 14-year term.         She received a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's from the University of Connecticut, then joined the civil rights movement in the summer of 1961. On a mission to integrate a Jackson, Miss., lunch counter, she was arrested and charged with trespassing.         While in solitary confinement in a Mississippi state prison, she made a decision to go into law. She graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1964 and went to work for the Legal Aid Society. She was in private practice when she first ran for Civil Court in 1976.         Over the years, she presided over many cases of Medicaid fraud and official corruption. In 1988, one of her cases produced a memorable encounter with Mayor Edward I. Koch.  At issue was the forbearance she had shown to a score of former parking-meter collectors who had pocketed thousands of dollars. Because they had no prior records, she had accepted their guilty pleas and given them sentences that involved no jail time, fines or restitution. Mayor Koch was moved to appear in person to support the demand for such penalties by the Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman.         The judge scolded the Mayor for his trouble, pointing out that he was lavishing his attention on a case involving ''little people.'' She also faulted what she called the administration's sloppy supervision.         Yes, she told the Mayor, little people become malefactors, too, but they have rights. She added that the defendants ''are going to be treated just the way the big boys are being treated,'' alluding to politically connected officials involved in recent corruption scandals. She declined to amend her decision.         Justice Moskowitz served on professional panels, in the Office of Court Administration and the New York Task Force on Women in the Courts.         She is survived by her husband, Martin Gershon; a daughter, Leah, and two sons, Joel and Robert, all of Brooklyn Heights; a sister, Anne Lyons of Manhattan, and her mother, Gussie Moskowitz, also of Brooklyn.       
         Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a psychologist who defied conventional wisdom and greatly emboldened the fledgling gay rights movement in the 1950's by finding there was no measurable psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men, died on Monday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 89.         Dr. Hooker, who spent 30 years teaching at the University of California at Los Angeles, began studying homosexual men in the late 1940's, a period in which they were considered maladjusted -- at best -- and generally ignored or anathematized by the medical and mental health professions.         ''She never treated us like some strange tribe,'' recalled the writer Christopher Isherwood, who knew her at the time, ''so we told her things we never told anyone before.''         Her most significant work was a paper delivered in 1956 to the American Psychological Association in Chicago and published the next year as ''The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual'' in The Journal of Projective Techniques.         Dr. Hooker administered three standard personality tests, including the Rorschach ink-blot test, to two groups of 30 men, one heterosexual, one homosexual, who had been matched in I.Q.'s, age and education levels.         She then asked a panel of expert clinicians to assess the results without knowing the subjects' sexual orientation. To their surprise, the judges were unable to discern between the two groups on the basis of the test.         ''The most striking finding of the three judges,'' Dr. Hooker wrote, ''was that many of the homosexuals were very well adjusted. In fact, the three judges agreed on two-thirds of the group as being average to superior in adjustment. Not only do all homosexuals not have strong feminine identification, nor are they all 'somewhat paranoid,' but, according to the judges, some may not be characterized by any demonstrable pathology.''         Her study was criticized in many quarters, not least because it upended psychological orthodoxy. Among other objections was that she recruited her gay subjects through the assistance of ''homophile'' groups like the Mattachine Society, meaning that the men might be more content with their lives than the average homosexual and eager to prove that they were well adjusted.         Moreover, the study was published in a journal that did not reach a wide public audience. Nonetheless, it was considered a precursor to the decision 17 years later by the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its list of disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.         ''Her work in the 1950's really provided the framework within which the American Psychiatric Association could rethink its viewpoint,'' said Dr. Richard A. Isay, clinical professor of psychiatry at the Cornell University Medical College.         And 36 years after Dr. Hooker addressed the American Psychological Association, the organization gave her its award for distinguished contribution to psychology in the public interest, saying, ''This revolutionary study provided empirical evidence that normal homosexuals existed and supported the radical idea then emerging that homosexuality is within the normal range of human behavior.''         Evelyn Gentry was born in North Platte, Neb., in 1907 and grew up in northeastern Colorado. She earned her bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Colorado and her Ph.D., in 1932, from Johns Hopkins University.         Her exposure to the rise of Nazism while in Berlin on a fellowship in the late 1930's intensified her desire to make ''her life count in helping to correct social injustice,'' said a 1992 article in American Psychologist.         She joined the faculty at U.C.L.A. in 1939 and, outside of one year at Bryn Mawr, remained there until 1970. It was at U.C.L.A. in the 1940's that she befriended a gay student, Sam From, who introduced her in turn to his circle of friends. It was Mr. From who said, ''We have let you see us as we are, and now, it is your scientific duty to make a study of people like us.''         At the peak of the McCarthy period, in 1953, she applied for and received a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. ''They talk about all this courage I'm supposed to have had,'' she recalled four decades later, in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. ''I don't get that. Curiosity and empathy were what compelled me to do my study.''         In 1967, Dr. Hooker was appointed to head a study group on homosexuality for the National Institute of Mental Health. That panel recommended a repeal of sodomy laws and better public education about homosexuality.         After retiring from U.C.L.A., Dr. Hooker had a private practice until the late 1970's. She reviewed articles for professional journals and helped establish the Placek Fund of the American Psychological Foundation, which provides money for research into homosexuality.         She was also the subject of a 1992 documentary, ''Changing Our Minds: The Story of Dr. Evelyn Hooker,'' by David Haugland and Richard Schmiechen.         Her second husband, Edward Niles Hooker, died in 1957. She is survived by two sisters, Mildred Haugh, of Downey, Calif., and Myrtle Fisher, of Colorado.         In recent years, Dr. Hooker was frequently approached by strangers wanting to express their gratitude, such as a young woman who told her that she had been committed to a psychiatric hospital when her parents learned she was a lesbian.         ''The standard procedure for treating homosexuals in that hospital was electroshock therapy,'' Dr. Hooker recalled in the book ''Making History'' (HarperCollins, 1992) by Eric Marcus.         ''Her psychiatrist was familiar with my work and he was able to keep them from giving it to her. She had tears streaming down her face as she told me this. I know that wherever I go, there are men and women for whom my little bit of work and my caring enough to do it has made an enormous difference in their lives.''       
         Leonor Fini, an Argentine-born artist and theater designer who was as well known for her eccentric lifestyle as she was for her erotic and fantastic paintings, died on Jan. 18 in a Paris hospital. She was 87.         Miss Fini, whose father was Argentine and mother was Italian, was born in Buenos Aires on Aug. 30, 1908. While she was still a child, the family moved to  Milan, where at 17 she had her first exhibition as a painter. In 1932 she settled in Paris, where she was drawn into the Surrealist movement, quickly joining a circle of artists that included Andre Breton, Paul Eluard, Max Ernst and Giorgio de Chirico.         She always insisted on going her own way as an artist. "I could never support the dogmatic and inquisitional way that the group approached its work,"  she once said of the Surrealists. Her work was nonetheless represented at the show "Fantastic Art: Dada Surrealism" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1936.         Later she translated her idea of the fantastic into the female form, creating a whole population of young women in strange and exotic attires, sometimes with  their heads shaven, sometimes resembling fairies or witches, often exuding a kind of Joan of Arc mystique. The erotic memoir "The Story of O" was one of many books she illustrated.         Some of her most important work, though, was done for the theater, and included both sets and costumes. She was the designer for George Balanchine's ballet "The Crystal Palace" at the Paris Opera in 1945 and she worked at the Comedie Francaise, for Jean-Louis Barrault's theater company, and at La Scala opera house in Milan. She did the sets for plays by Jean Genet and Jean Anouilh  in the 1960's.         A very public figure with her own loyal circle of admirers, Miss Fini always  insured that she stood out in a crowd. In recent years she was frequently seen at art-show openings wearing heavy makeup, unusual clothes, wide-brim hats and ample jewelry. She never married, and filled her home with cats that she often used as models for her illustrations.       
         Olga Havel, a human rights campaigner and wife of President Vaclav Havel, died on Saturday. She was 62.         Mrs. Havel died at her home here after suffering from cancer, the President's office said.         She was born in a Prague to a working-class family and met her husband, the  oldest son of a Prague industrialist impoverished by Communist nationalization in 1948, when he was a theater stage hand in the 1950's. They married in 1964.         Mrs. Havel was a signer of the Charter 77 human rights manifesto and worked in the dissident network led by her husband.         Charter 77, signed by intellectuals and others in January 1977, started a human rights offensive against Soviet control in what was then Czechoslovakia. Ultimately, it led to the formation of Civic Forum, a democratic movement that toppled Communist rule in 1989 and catapulted Mr. Havel, a dissident playwright, into the presidency in late 1989. Mrs. Havel later formed a committee known for  its charity work.         She is survived by her husband.
