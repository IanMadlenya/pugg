Elizabeth Hartman, who was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress in 1966 for her role in ''A Patch of Blue,'' died in a fall from her fifth-floor apartment in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.         According to the Pittsburgh police, Miss Hartman, who was 45 years old, had called her doctor a short time earlier, saying she was depressed. They listed her death as a possible suicide.         Miss Hartman enjoyed sudden success as a film actress following her ''Patch'' role and Academy Award nomination, but her career declined in succeeding years.         ''That initial success beat me down,'' Miss Hartman, a tense, fragile-looking redhead, said in a 1969 interview. ''It spiraled me into a position where I didn't belong. I was not ready for that. I suddenly found myself failing.''         She said she sat around her East 68th Street apartment for two years doing nothing but reading and brooding. Her mood finally lifted with her debut on Broadway in the role of Emily in a revival of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town.''         She had major roles in ''The Group,'' ''You're a Big Boy Now'' and ''The Fixer.'' She co-starred with Clint Eastwood in ''The Beguiled'' in 1971 and was in ''Walking Tall'' in 1973..
