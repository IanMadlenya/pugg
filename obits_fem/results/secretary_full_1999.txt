         Pearl Bernstein Max, who played a central role in melding the New York City municipal colleges into today's City University of New York, died Thursday in her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 94.         In 1938, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia appointed Mrs. Max -- known as Pearl Bernstein for much of her career -- as the first administrative director of New York City's Board of Higher Education. That job, the chief administrator, was a predecessor of the office of Chancellor in the current system.         Mrs. Max helped lay much of the groundwork for fitting City, Hunter, Brooklyn and Queens Colleges into CUNY, as it came into being in 1961. She drafted the first master plan and the financing formula for the system and served as liaison to its Administrative Council of College Presidents.         She was the founding coordinator of CUNY's Office of Institutional Research in 1967. From there, she initiated pioneering studies of teacher education, admissions procedures and other issues of vital importance to the growing university.         Thus, Mrs. Max was one of the principal shapers of CUNY, the nation's largest municipal university system. It now comprises 11 senior colleges, 6 community colleges, a graduate division, a law school, a medical school and an affiliated school of medicine. It has nearly 200,000 students working toward degrees and 155,000 adult and continuing education students throughout the five boroughs.         Mrs. Max also served as secretary and administrative head of the New York City Employees Retirement System, one of the country's largest pension funds. She taught courses on state and local government at Barnard College, and retired from CUNY in 1969.         A native of Manhattan, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Barnard in 1925 and pursued postgraduate studies at Columbia University and Fordham Law School. She joined the League of Women Voters of New York City in 1926 as its municipal representative and the group's first paid executive.         The league monitored the policies and procedures of the city's Board of Estimates and Apportionment. Her reputation for clear and evenhanded analyses drew the attention of Mayor La Guardia, who named her secretary of the board in 1934.         She was the first woman in that post, which she held until the Mayor moved her to the Board of Higher Education. Over the years she served as an officer of the Women's Club of New York, Ethical Culture Schools, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, New York Metropolitan Council and American Society of Public Administrators, among other organizations.         Her husband, Dr. Louis W. Max, died four years ago after 66 years of marriage. Mrs. Max is survived by a daughter, Dr. Claire Max of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Dr. Betty Bernstein of Manhattan and Hilda Morris of Huntington, N.Y.; two brothers, Ira Bernstein of Fairfield, Conn., and Seymour Bernstein of Manhattan, and one grandson.       
         Peggy Cass, a brassy-voiced comedian best known for her portrayal of the pregnant, unwed secretary in ''Auntie Mame,'' died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 and had homes in Manhattan and Westhampton, N.Y.         The cause was heart failure, Eugene Feeney, her husband and only survivor, said.         Born in Boston, Mary Margaret  Cass succumbed to the lure of Broadway and moved to New York at 19 after spending three years in the Cambridge Latin School drama club without winning a single speaking role.         After turns as a stenographer, telephone operator, advertising solicitor and model, she finally convinced a producer that she was an actress. She was cast in a U.S.O. tour of ''The Doughgirls'' and spent seven months in Australia without stepping into costume because the United States Army had by then moved to the Philippines.         Her break came when, as an understudy, she took over for Jan Sterling in Chicago in the national tour of ''Born Yesterday.'' Soon after, the producer George Abbott hired her for the 1949 Broadway musical ''Touch and Go.''         But it was the role of the dimwitted secretary, Agnes Gooch, in the 1956 Broadway show ''Auntie Mame'' with which Ms. Cass was most associated. Her performance earned her a Tony Award for best supporting actress. She was nominated for an Academy Award for her work in the  1958 film version.         By the late 1950's, Ms. Cass's facility for brash repartee landed her regular appearances on the television quiz show ''Keep Talking.'' She also appeared often on ''The Jack Paar Show'' in the late 50's and early 60's.         The possessor of an encyclopedic mind, she could be seen during the 60's as often as seven times a week on the quiz shows ''Match Game,'' ''Password'' and ''To Tell the Truth.''       
         Adele Woodhouse Erb Sullivan, who was president general of the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution in the 1960's, died on April 22 in Wilton, Conn., at the home of her daughter, Nancy E. Thorne. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Scarsdale, N.Y.         Mrs. Sullivan was probably best known for her well-publicized trip to Vietnam, at the invitation of Gen. William C. Westmoreland, in 1968. At one point during her tour, two American soldiers spied her getting out of a helicopter in a central highlands combat zone. ''Look, Mom is coming up the hill,'' one of the soldiers was reported to have quipped.         ''That trip to Vietnam meant a great deal to the national society,'' said Sarah King of Murfreesboro, Tenn., who was president general of the D.A.R. from 1983 until 1986. ''Membership grew to 188,000 because of her special leadership and knowledge of public relations.''         The organization's membership peaked at about 212,000 in the mid-1980's, and is now about 175,000, according to Mrs. King. ''We will never again have a leader like her,'' she said. ''She was dynamic, articulate and interested in everything in American life.''         Adele Woodhouse, who was born in Trenton, was a descendant of early Colonial Pennsylvania settlers. The direct lineal ancestor who gave her entry into the Daughters of the American Revolution was Israel Matson of Philadelphia. She was educated in Quaker schools and at Rider College.         She joined the D.A.R. in 1930, and during World War II, she was a leader in the organization's war work, maintaining a service booth in the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan for the armed forces.         In 1953, she became a state regent, directing 177 D.A.R. chapters with 15,000 members.         In 1956, she was elected recording secretary general of the national society, and in 1959, she was elected first vice president general. She was elected president general in 1965, serving one term until 1968, when she was made an honorary president general for life.         Her first husband, Harold E. Erb of Garden City, N.Y., died in 1957, and her second husband, William H. Sullivan Jr. of Scarsdale, died in 1985.         Besides her daughter, Mrs. Sullivan is survived by two granddaughters and two great-grandchildren.       
         Gina Berriault, an award-winning writer of short stories and novels, died on July 15 at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, Calif. She was 73 and lived in Sausalito, Calif.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         With her terse prose, emotional precision and deft storytelling, Ms. Berriault was often heralded as ''a writer's writer.''         Her 1996 collection of 35 short stories, ''Women in Their Beds,'' received critical acclaim and won the 1997 National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner Fiction Prize and the Rae Award for the Short Story. Tobin Harshaw, reviewing it in The New York Times Book Review, wrote: ''One struggles to find a sentence that is anything less than jewel-box perfect.''         Born Arline Shandling in Long Beach, Calif., to parents who had emigrated from Latvia and Lithuania, Ms. Berriault spent much of her childhood in Los Angeles, where her father wrote and edited trade magazines. After his death when she was a teen-ager, she took over his work to help support her family.         She married John Berriault and settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, writing stories and magazine articles while raising a daughter. By the late 1950's, she had collected a bevy of awards in the short-story field, among them the Paris Review's Aga Khan fiction prize and two O. Henry awards.         Her first novel, ''The Descent,'' was published in 1960. Set in America in 1964, the story described the conflict between the Secretary for Humanity, a newly created Cabinet post, and a group of people who believed that moving to underground shelters would manifest ''prepared togetherness.''         Her second novel, ''Conference of Victims,'' about the suicide of a Congressional candidate, was published two years later, and was revised and republished in 1998 as ''Afterwards.''         Her other novels include ''The Son'' (1966), about an incestuous relationship between a mother and her son; ''The Lights of Earth'' (1984), about a woman and her married lover. She also published two other  short-story collections, ''The Mistress'' (1965) and ''The Infinite Passion of Expectation'' (1982).         Her short story ''The Stone Boy,'' which she adapted for the screen, was made into the 1984 film starring Robert Duvall and Glenn Close. She had recently completed a fable, ''The Great Petrowski,'' that was to be published with her own illustrations.         She is survived by a daughter, Julie Berriault of Mill Valley, Calif., and her companion, Leonard Gardner of Sausalito.       
         Sola Sierra, who campaigned to bring to justice those responsible for the death of her husband and hundreds of other Chilean dissidents during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, died on July 1 at a hospital in Santiago, Chile, where she lived. She was 63.         She died of a heart attack during surgery for a back injury suffered in a fall several months ago, according to Jim Foster, a spokesman with the United States Embassy in Santiago.         Mrs. Sierra spent 23 years doing human rights work in Chile after her husband disappeared in 1976. Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Washington, said,  ''Anyone who was involved in human rights work at that time in Chile, especially taking the lead, was courageous.''         In 1984 she became president of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared, an organization that seeks an accounting of those who vanished under General Pinochet and prosecution of those involved in their deaths.         In the past year, she led protests in London in support of General Pinochet's house arrest there on a Spanish extradition warrant. An extradition hearing is scheduled for Sept. 27. The general, now 83, is charged with ordering torture and other crimes during his years in power, from 1973 to 1990.         ''The most important thing, the most crucial thing, was her perseverance, her unwavering dedication to this cause,'' said Apolonia Ramirez Caballero, who from 1976 to 1981 was one of the coordinators of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         Mrs. Sierra was born on Dec. 1, 1935, in Santiago and grew up in poverty, leaving school in her teens to help support her family. She worked for several years as a community worker for the Ministry of Social Development and Planning. She married Waldo Pizarro in 1962 and settled into a life as a working-class wife and, later, mother of three children.         In 1973, in a right-wing coup backed by the American Government, General Pinochet overthrew the Government of Salvador Allende Gossens, a democratically elected Marxist. And on Dec. 15, 1976, Mr. Pizarro, a Communist and labor activist, disappeared. It is presumed that he was taken prisoner and killed by agents from the DINA, a secret police run by the Chilean armed forces.         More than 1,100 Chileans who disappeared under General Pinochet are still unaccounted for.         Two days after Mr. Pizarro vanished, Mrs. Sierra and her children moved in with a sister, Adrina Sierra, whose support allowed her the time to search for her husband and work with the Association for the Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         In addition to her sister, Mrs. Sierra is survived by her son, Waldo Pizarro Jr. of Santiago; two daughters, Lenia Pizarro and Lorena Pizarro, both of Santiago, and eight other brothers and sisters.         Mrs. Sierra was often seen at human rights demonstrations in Chile, a black-and-white photograph of Mr. Pizarro hanging around her neck.         Over the years, the group she led discovered about 180 bodies of Pinochet prisoners, but no one has been convicted in connection with the deaths and disappearances. Since 1978, an amnesty has given members of the DINA and military leaders immunity from prosecution .         Mrs. Sierra was uncompromising in seeking not only the fate and bodies of the disappeared but also the revocation of the amnesty.         Mrs. Sierra was both a sympathetic and controversial figure in Chile, where many would prefer to forget about the dark side of General Pinochet's rule. Prominent foreign visitors, however, eagerly met with her. The rock star Sting wrote a song about her organization called ''They Dance Alone.''         The current democratic Government in Chile issued a statement mourning Ms. Sierra's death.         Secretary General Carlos Mladinic, who represented the Government at her funeral, said he understood the pain she must have felt. ''Unfortunately, people continue dying in Chile without knowing the truth,'' Mr. Mladinic said. 'I hope that in the near future this pain will end.''       
         Sandra B. O'Leary, an economic adviser in three White House Administrations and a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, died on Aug. 9 at her home in McLean, Va. She was 50.         The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, James.         Ms. O'Leary served as an economic adviser from 1986 to 1992 to Secretaries of State George P. Shultz and James A. Baker 3d in the Reagan and Bush Administrations.         Her duties included helping former Communist countries make the transition to capitalist systems. She also worked during the Persian Gulf war securing international financial support and on developing economic policies for the Middle East in the aftermath of the war.         Ms. O'Leary stayed on at the State Department as an economic adviser when the Clinton Administration took over in 1993, and in 1995 she became a deputy assistant Secretary of State for economic policy, serving until 1996. Her focus was East Asian and Pacific affairs.         More recently, she was a professor at the Foreign Service Institute and the National Defense University.         Ms. O'Leary was born in Hackensack, N.J., on June 16, 1949, and graduated from Smith College. She received a master's degree in international affairs from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a doctorate in political science from Johns Hopkins University.         Before joining the State Department, Ms. O'Leary worked in various positions at the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the Treasury Department and the Department of Commerce.         Besides her husband, Ms. O'Leary is survived by two daughters, Glynis O'Leary and Abigail O'Leary, both of McLean; her father, Boniface Brazaitis, and a sister, C. B. Lovell, both of Columbia, Md.       
         Joan Braden, a former State Department official who was a hostess and friend to high-ranking Washington figures and whose eight children inspired the ABC television series ''Eight Is Enough,'' died on Monday in Alexandria, Va. She was 77 and a longtime resident of the Washington area.         The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported. Mrs. Braden collapsed at Sutton Place Gourmet, a food store in Alexandria,  and was pronounced dead at a local hospital.         For two years beginning in 1976, Mrs. Braden was the State Department's coordinator of consumer affairs and special assistant to the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. She had also been an aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller and had worked in political campaigns for  John and Robert Kennedy.         The 1975 book ''Eight Is Enough,'' by her husband, Tom Braden, tells of their family of eight children. In 1977 the book was adapted as the ABC series, starring Dick Van Patten, which was broadcast by the network until 1981.         In the book, Mr. Braden, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate from 1968 to 1986, described his wife's personality: ''She's blithe. That's what it is about her, and that is why she is so everlastingly cheerful.''         By 1976, when Mrs. Braden took up her State Department posts, her friends included Vice President  Rockefeller, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and many other powerful figures, who would assemble at the Bradens' large yellow clapboard house in Chevy Chase, Md., a Washington suburb.         According to those who dined there, the food was simple but good,  and the furniture pleasant and necessarily childproof. There were always flowers and candles and, if the weather was right, a fireplace ablaze.         But it was not those things that made Mrs. Braden's dinner parties special, and her invitations a status symbol.         Rather, it was said in Washington, the main magnet was Mrs. Braden herself, a slight woman (5 feet 5 inches tall, admittedly too thin at 103  pounds) with short auburn hair and a wide smile -- blithe, as her husband said, and everlastingly cheerful.         Mrs. Braden herself wrote a book, ''Just Enough Rope: An Intimate Memoir'' (1989). Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Maureen Dowd said, ''Joan Braden has taken a lot of heat for this book, which has been criticized as a vapid kiss-and-sell by a Washington society hostess with the capital's most notorious 'open' marriage.''         ''The title refers to the amount of freedom the author has received from her husband,'' Ms. Dowd wrote.  ''Washington insiders, however, sniff that it also alludes to the fact that she has hanged herself with this 'intimate memoir.' ''         But ''this reviewer does not take such a harsh view,'' Ms. Dowd continued, adding that after all, how can a book be all bad that features ''a shower scene with Nelson Rockefeller, a bedroom scene with Bobby Kennedy, a toe-tingling lunch with Kirk Douglas and an account of Frank Sinatra singing 'High Hopes' without his toupee?''         Mrs. Braden was born Joan Ridley in Indianapolis, and was reared in the nearby town of Anderson and in Washington. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Northwestern University, and  worked in the Pentagon during World War II.         From 1946 to 1951, she was an assistant to Mr. Rockefeller, who was then in the middle of a succession of Federal posts he filled before becoming Governor of New York in 1959. She went on to be a special assistant for public relations to  Oveta Culp Hobby, the Eisenhower Administration's Secretary of  Health, Education and Welfare.         Later she and her husband moved to California, where Mr. Braden -- with the assistance of a $100,000 loan from Mr. Rockefeller, whom he had known for years -- bought a small daily newspaper, The Oceanside Blade-Tribune. Mr. Braden published the paper for more than 13 years before selling it to South Coast Newspapers for $1.6 million.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Braden's survivors include five daughters, Mary Poole of Alexandria, Joan Ridder of Denver, Susan Zarker of Takoma Park, Md., and Nancy and Elizabeth Braden, both of Denver; two sons, David, who lives in Taiwan, and Nicholas, of Alexandria, and 12 grandchldren. One of the Bradens' sons, Tom, died in 1994.       
         Louise Alone Thompson Patterson, an advocate of civil rights and leftist causes, a participant in the Harlem Renaissance and a longtime associate of one of its leading figures, the poet Langston Hughes, died on Friday at the Amsterdam Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 97.         The 1920's and 30's saw an artistic and literary flowering in Harlem and an outpouring of social criticism examining the position of blacks in American society. Soon after her arrival in 1928, Mrs. Patterson, then Louise Thompson, gravitated toward that intellectual ferment, which became known as the Harlem Renaissance.         Born in Chicago on Sept. 9, 1901, she had experienced racism while living in a succession of predominantly white towns in the Pacific Northwest, before entering the University of California at Berkeley, where she was inspired by a lecture on racism given by W. E. B. DuBois.         After graduating from Berkeley in 1923 with a degree in economics, she taught at Hampton Institute in Virginia, which had a black student body but a predominantly white and paternalistic administration. She supported a student strike there, then went to New York to study at the New School for Social Research under a scholarship from the Urban League.         Louise Thompson entered Harlem Renaissance circles through a friendship with the painter Aaron Douglas and his wife, Alta, and she married the writer Wallace Thurman. They separated six months later. In the late 1920's, she became a secretary to Hughes, and a long professional association and friendship began.         In 1932, after helping found a Harlem branch of the Friends of the Soviet Union, she became a leading organizer of a trip to the Soviet Union by 22 black intellectuals, journalists and writers who were to make a Soviet-sponsored movie called ''Black and White,'' about white supremacy in America.         She enlisted Hughes's participation in the trip, but the film project was canceled by Soviet authorities after the group's arrival, ostensibly because of inefficiency on the part of the Soviet film company. The real reason may have been Soviet fears that the film would create enmity in the United States and jeopardize diplomatic recognition.         Louise Thompson enjoyed her experience of Soviet society and told how ''the Russians would push us to the front of the queue line for a bus or ticket, or offer us seats in a crowded streetcar.''         ''For all of us who experienced discrimination based on color in our own land, it was strange to find our color a badge of honor, our key to the city, so to speak,'' she said.         The group eventually split into two factions. Those who saw Louise Thompson as too trusting of the Russians nicknamed her Madame Moscow.         After returning to the United States, she organized a march to Washington to speak out on the ''Scottsboro Boys'' -- nine black youths wrongly convicted of raping two white women in Scottsboro, Ala. She later traveled to Spain on behalf of the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War.         She was an organizer of Vanguard, a left-wing salon organized at her Harlem apartment in the 1930's for cultural presentations and discussions of Marxist theory. In 1938, she helped Hughes start the Harlem Suitcase Theater, where he presented his play with music ''Don't You Want to Be Free?'' Hughes dedicated his 1942 collection of poems, ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' to her.         In 1940, having moved to Chicago, Louise Thompson married William Patterson, a figure in the American Communist Party. He died in 1980. She is survived by a daughter, MaryLouise Patterson of Manhattan, two granddaughters and a great-grandson.       
         Raisa Maksimovna Gorbachev, who broke Kremlin tradition by sharing the spotlight with her husband, the former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and did so with bold self-assurance and flair, died today in Munster, Germany. She was 67.         The cause was leukemia, aides to Mr. Gorbachev said. She had been under treatment in University Hospital in Munster since late July.         Mr. Gorbachev's rise to the leadership of the Communist Party in 1985 was the first sign of a seismic shift in the Soviet Union's calcified politics and economy. But it was Raisa Gorbachev who, both at home and abroad, soon came to embody the changes to come. She emerged as a First Lady who had her own mind, her own style and according to reports of a secret videotape that circulated after one of her foreign trips, her own American Express card.         None of this endeared her to the Soviet public, who began to grumble early in her husband's tenure that she was too pushy, too flashy and too influential. Her appearances on foreign trips and her cultural projects at home stirred debate in many Russian kitchens over whether the proper place for Kremlin wives was -- as it had always been -- at home, or at least in the background.         But since the beginning of this month, when Russians first learned that their former First Lady had been hospitalized in Germany with an advanced and rare case of leukemia, sentiments toward her in Russia began to shift. Favorable articles began to appear in the press, and thousands of letters and telegrams of sympathy arrived at the hospital in Munster, where her husband kept a faithful vigil that touched many Russian hearts. ''It must be in the Russian character -- to run somebody into the mud, and them laud them to high heavens after a tragedy strikes,'' said Vladimir Polyakov, a Gorbachev spokesman.         President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev's bitter rival in the early 1990's, sent a message of condolence today, and in a statement he said that a ''wonderful person, a beautiful woman, a loving wife and mother is no longer with us.''         In his autobiography, published in 1996, Mr. Gorbachev acknowledged that the resentment over his wife's high profile surfaced in letters written to the Communist Party's Central Committee. ''Who does she think she is, a member of the Politburo?'' he quoted one as saying. ''The simplest answer would have been: 'No, she is my wife.' ''         She first became known in the West in 1984 when she accompanied her husband, then a ranking member of the Soviet Politburo, to Britain, where they were received by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Diplomats and reporters, scanning the couple for clues about the next generation of Soviet leaders, quickly focused up on her wardrobe -- in particular her gold lame sandals with chain straps, a far cry from the dowdy shoes worn by other Kremlin wives. On a later trip to France, the French press labeled her clothes ''elegant, but not chic.''         On her foreign travels, she also became known for a haughty conversational style that bordered on the pedantic. During the 1986 summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, she needled her tour guides with persistent questioning, adding didactic commentary of her own. Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, she irked Nancy Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American President's wife to quip, ''Who does that dame think she is?''         As she became more comfortable in her role as the Soviet First Lady, she loosened up and her wardrobe became more subdued. On a visit to Washington in 1990, she established more friendly relations with Barbara Bush, from whom she got a recipe for blueberry pie.         Born in the Siberian city of Rubtsovsk, Raisa Titarenko grew up as the daughter of a railway engineer. She graduated from school with a gold medal -- top honors in the Soviet system -- and went on to the prestigious University of Moscow. She was studying philosophy there when she met Mr. Gorbachev, then a law student. According to his book, he was smitten, but she was aloof.         ''Our first meeting had not impressed Raisa at all,'' he wrote. ''She seemed calm and indifferent -- judging by the look in her eyes.'' Not much later, at an impromptu party staged by Mr. Gorbachev's roommates for Raisa and her friends, ''I wanted to impress her,'' he wrote, but ''I think I made a terrible fool of myself. She was reserved and was the first to suggest breaking up the gathering.''         After an intense courtship, the two penniless students were married in 1953, the year of Stalin's death. They had one daughter, Irina, born in 1956, who survives her along with Mr. Gorbachev and two granddaughters.         After the couple completed their college work in 1955, the family returned to Mr. Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol in southern Russia. There Mrs. Gorbachev completed a doctoral dissertation, entitled ''The Emergence of New Characteristics in the Daily Life of Collective Farm Peasantry,'' based on an unusual amount of field research, which was accepted by the Lenin Pedagogical Institute in Moscow.         When her husband, then first party secretary in Stavropol, was promoted to Moscow as a Central Committee secretary in charge of agriculture, she returned to academics, taking a job as lecturer in philosophy at Moscow University, a position which she gave up when he became General Secretary of the Communist Party.         As the wife of the Soviet leader, she was enlisted as a board member of the Soviet Cultural Foundation, headed by Dmitri S. Likhachev, one of Russia's most distinguished academicians, which was created to promote the arts and to restore the country's cultural heritage.         In this role, she became one of her husband's conduits to the Russian intelligentsia, which was then rallying to his call for more ''glasnost,'' or openness. As Soviet censorship eased, the Soviet people rushed to rediscover books and parts of their own history that had been buried under a rigid Communist ideology.         Mrs. Gorbachev's most traumatic moments came during the August 1991 coup, when the Gorbachevs were held hostage at a seaside villa in the Crimea while a group of Communist hard-liners tried to seize control in Moscow. The coup failed, and Mr. Gorbachev and his family returned to Moscow, visibly shaken. ''Raisa Maksimovna took it very hard,'' said Mr. Gorbachev at a news conference after their return to Moscow.         In 1991, Raisa Gorbachev published a book of reminiscences, entitled in English, ''I Hope,'' which she decided to write after a visit with Mrs. Bush in 1990 to Wellesley College where, she said, ''the girls showered me with questions.'' Reviewers found the book self-serving in parts but also informative about the couple's intellectual journey as, together, they came to realize the flaws in the Soviet system.         In her last years, Mrs. Gorbachev started a club that drew together a dozen well-known and high-powered Russian women for conferences, charitable projects and informal debates. She described the group as an attempt to promote a civil society in Russia. Against her wishes, the club became known as the Raisa Maksimovna Club.         Lyudmila Telen, a deputy editor at the newspaper Moscow News and a member of the club, said her impressions of Mrs. Gorbachev changed as she got to know her better. ''She set herself very high goals -- she felt she had to improve herself,'' said Ms. Telen. ''Going from wife of a provincial first secretary to First Lady was a big jump.         ''She wanted to represent the country in a new way. She understood that what Mikhail Sergeyevich was doing was a revolution, but she had many complexes, too -- a natural reserve and a Soviet way of behavior that she tried to overcome.''         Ms. Telen said Mrs. Gorbachev was well aware of the resentment against her felt by many Russians. But she herself was never bitter. ''She realized that people had been used to different women, different traditions, different leaders,'' said Ms. Telen. ''She understood it. It hurt her of course, but I never heard her be mean or bitter about it.''         As a couple, the Gorbachevs shared interests in philosophy and literature, theater and politics. Mr. Gorbachev on several occasions acknowledged that he often turned to his wife for advice. In his book, he recalled how the two would have their most serious discussions in the garden of their Government-provided apartment, beyond the earshot of K.G.B. eavesdropping devices.         Their close relationship was the envy of their friends. At a dinner in Paris in the fall of 1985, her host said she confided: ''I am very lucky with Mikhail. We are really friends, or if you prefer, we have great complicity.''         After the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, when Mr. Yeltsin took over Mr. Gorbachev's office in the Kremlin, he became a political pariah in Russia, widely blamed for ushering in reforms that led to a decade of political and economic instability.         After a disastrous run for the presidency in 1996, he maintained a low profile at home, while Mrs. Gorbachev, who accompanied him on the international lecture circuit, became practically invisible until her recent illness.         With a diagnosis of acute lukemia, Mrs. Gorbachev was rushed to the hospital in Munster on July 25. News of her hospitalization became public only in early August.         According to Russian news reports, Mr. Gorbachev remained at her side day and night. ''Dear God,'' the former Soviet President, visibly exhausted, told a Russian television reporter on Aug. 9, ''for her to undergo such a drama these two days before my very eyes.''       
         She had not even known exactly what the word ''philanthropy'' meant, but the elderly washerwoman who gave away practically every dollar she ever made to endow a scholarship fund for poor students in Mississippi would become a symbol of selfless giving.         Oseola McCarty, who gave away a life savings of $150,000 to help complete strangers get a college education at the University of Southern Mississippi here in her hometown, died late Sunday afternoon in the frame house where she took in laundry and ironing and made her small fortune a dollar or two at a time.         Miss McCarty was told that she had liver cancer three weeks ago, about a year after she underwent surgery for colon cancer. She wanted her last days to be spent in the little house where she spent most of her life. She was 91.         ''I don't want to close my eyes because I don't know if I'll open them again,'' the tiny, frail woman told a visitor recently. ''But I am not afraid.''         In anticipation of her death, she decided in the summer of 1995 to give away most of her life savings, saying there was nothing in particular she wanted to buy and no place in particular she wanted to go. An only child who had outlived her relatives, she lived a solitary existence, surrounded by rows of clothes she made pretty for people who knew her only as the washerwoman.         ''I'm giving it away so that the children won't have to work so hard, like I did,'' she said in July 1995.         She did not want any monuments, any proclamations, said people who  knew her. But the selflessness of her gift would bring her worldwide attention. The woman who had gone out only for some preaching at the Friendship Baptist Church in Hattiesburg and to buy groceries would be honored by the United Nations, would shake hands with President Clinton and would receive more than 300 awards. People all over the world knew who she was and what she did.         The woman who acted in anticipation of death found a life she could have never imagined. She flew on a plane for the first time in her life and laughed out loud when the food did not fall off the tray as the plane rumbled through the sky. She stayed in a hotel for the first time in her life, and before she checked out, she made the bed.         ''People treated her like a monument,'' said Jewel Tucker, the secretary to the president of the university and Miss McCarty's traveling companion in those almost giddy years after the gift. ''But she was really a movement. It will keep moving.''         Contributions from more than 600 donors have added some $330,000 to the original scholarship fund of $150,000. After hearing of Miss McCarty's gift, Ted Turner, a multibillionaire, gave away a billion dollars.         ''He said, 'If that little woman can give away everything she has, then I can give a billion,' '' Ms. Tucker said.         If anyone can say they felt adoration in their life, Ms. Tucker said, Miss McCarty could. People would see her in airports and flock to her. Some people just wanted to touch her, as though she was good luck.         Along with all the plaques and trophies or other honors -- she received the Presidential Citizen's Medal, the nation's second-highest civilian award, and an honorary doctorate from Harvard University -- she was awarded other things that were pure fun.         In 1996, she carried the Olympic torch through part of Mississippi. Later that year, hers was the hand on the switch that dropped the ball in Times Square in New York's New Year's Eve celebration. In fact, she said at the time, it was the first time she had stayed up past midnight.         Miss McCarty will lie in state in the rotunda of the university's main building on Saturday.         Friends like Aubrey K. Lucas, president emeritus of the University of Southern Mississippi, said it warmed him and others that came into contact with her to know that a lifetime of loneliness had been pushed aside by all the positive attention that her gift brought.         Horace Fleming, the university's president, said he sometimes wondered if all the attention that came her way was really welcome. But he believes now that it was.         Her traveling companion, Ms. Tucker, knows that Miss McCarty did enjoy it.         Although she never asked for it, ''She loved every minute of it,'' Ms. Tucker said.         In time, people came to see her almost like an oracle and listened closely for pearls of wisdom at the little woman's knee.         But her friends know that Miss McCarty's wisdom was really a mix of common decency and common sense.         ''There's a lot of talk about self-esteem these days,'' she once said. ''It seems pretty basic to me. If you want to feel proud of yourself, you've got to do things you can be proud of. Feelings follow actions.''         The university's president said that a New York reporter once asked him out of earshot of Miss McCarty to tell him the true story of her gift.         ''How did it really happen?'' the reporter asked him.         The president told the reporter that it happened just as Miss McCarty said, that she had wanted to do something good with the money she had made. It is not any more complicated than that, Mr. Fleming said.         In a world in which people are suspicious of things too good to be true, he said, Miss McCarty really was good and true.       
         Marion Zimmer Bradley, a science fiction writer and the creator of the Darkover series of fantasies, died on Saturday at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif. She was 69 and lived in Berkeley.         The cause was a heart attack, said Elisabeth Waters, her cousin and secretary.         Ms. Bradley rose to fame in 1958 with the publication of ''The Planet Savers,'' the first of her top-selling Darkover novels. The series eventually comprised 21 books, written almost exclusively by Ms. Bradley, which told the story of a planet discovered at the end of the 21st century  and colonized by Earth.         She later worked primarily in the fantasy genre, often adding a feminist spin to well-known myths. In 1983, she published her most famous work, ''The Mists of Avalon,'' a retelling of the legend of King Arthur  from the vantage point of its principal women, Viviane, Gwynyfar, Morgaine and Igraine. Hailed by Maureen Quilligan in The New York Times as ''a massive narrative that is rich in events placed in landscapes no less real for often being magical,'' the novel remained on The Times best-seller list for four months. In her 1987 work ''The Firebrand,'' she retold the story of the Trojan War from the perspective of the prophet  Cassandra, whom she renamed Kassandra.         Born in Albany, N.Y., Ms. Bradley began to write as a teen-ager and by the age of 17 had created a magazine for science-fiction fans. Two years later she began writing for pulp magazines. In 1964 she graduated from  Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Tex., and then did graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley from 1965 to 1967.         Though she continued to write until her death, Ms. Bradley's poor health in the early 1990's limited her activities. She devoted much of her time to editing magazines, including her own, Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine, which she started in 1988. She also edited an annual anthology called ''Sword and Sorceress'' from Daw Books in New York.         Ms. Bradley's marriage to Robert Alden Bradley ended in divorce in 1964. She is survived by three children, David Bradley of Oakland, Calif.; Patrick Breen of Denver, and Moira Stern of Sparks, Nev.; a brother, Leslie Zimmer of East Greenbush, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Frances Knight, who ran the United States Passport Office for 22 years with efficiency and conservative zeal, denying passports and entrance visas to those she regarded as enemies of the nation and surviving efforts to remove her and even mandatory retirement at 70, died on Sept. 11 in a hospital in Bethesda, Md. She was 94.         Frances Knight Parrish, who used her maiden name of Knight while working at the State Department rather than her married name, lived at the Carriage Hill Bethesda nursing home in Bethesda, Md., for the last three years.         The conviction that guided Ms. Knight as she supervised the Passport Office was that the Government had a legal right and moral responsibility to protect American citizens from ideas and philosophies she found abhorrent, especially Communism. To people who represented such forces, she denied passports and visas, and sometimes, when she was not permitted to do so by her superiors in the State Department, she went over their heads and complained to Congress.         Ms. Knight inherited her sense of mission, she said, from her predecessor, Ruth Shipley, a staunch conservative who ran the office with unchallenged authority and who hand-picked Ms. Knight as her successor in 1955. She served until 1977, when she was 72.         Ms. Knight's convictions and fearlessness attracted powerful friends and allies like J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. Director, and powerful members of Congress like Representative Francis E. Walter of Pennsylvania, who headed the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization.         She drew fire from liberals who accused her of practicing thought control and perpetuating many of the strict travel regulations imposed in the most bitter days of the cold war.         But Ms. Knight won praise from both conservatives and liberals for running a highly efficient agency at a time when Americans were traveling overseas in previously unimaginable numbers.         In a 1960 interview, she said, ''I was determined to prove that a Government agency could be made efficient; that business management and standards could be instituted and sustained; that Government employees could provide the public with interested, friendly and personalized public service.''         Ms. Knight was also outspoken on equal rights for women. She often complained about the lack of women in high-ranking management positions in the State Department.         She raised a furor in Congress in 1963 when it came to light that she had told a closed meeting of the Senate Internal Security subcommittee that she had been ordered by Secretary of State Dean Rusk to approve passport applications by ''dangerous undercover Communists engaged in espionage, sabotage and sedition.''         She testified that Mr. Rusk's order and departmental regulations ''in effect forbids us to protect ourselves,'' and she questioned ''whether there exists the will'' to defend the country from ''the inroads of Communism.''         In 1966, Abba P. Schwartz, the liberal-minded head of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, a Kennedy appointee, tried unsuccessfully to force her to resign because of their political differences.         Ms. Knight called a news conference in which she declared: ''Some creeps are out to get me.''         She also sought the help of J. Edgar Hoover and powerful members of Congress, and in the end it was Mr. Schwartz who was forced to resign.         After that, her critics in Congress referred to her as ''the ogress'' and the columnist Mary McGrory likened Ms. Knight to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.         But her friends in Congress twice permitted her to remain on the job at the Passport Office after she had reached mandatory retirement age.         Ms. Knight was born in Newport, R.I., and grew up in New York City. She attended Hunter College and New York University. She moved to Washington when her husband, Wayne Parrish, a magazine publisher, was offered the editorship of a Washington-based aviation magazine.         Mr. Parrish soon became a multimillionaire and the couple lived on Embassy Row in Washington.         He later started his own publication, with his wife dealing with the bookkeeping and circulation.         Mr. Parrish died in 1984. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Bernadette O'Farrell, an actress best known for her role as Maid Marian in the 1950's television series ''The Adventures of Robin Hood,'' died this week at 75, The Daily Telegraph of London reported on Wednesday.         Ms. O'Farrell was often seen in cinematic roles written by her husband, Frank Launder, the British screenwriter and director whose boisterous ''St. Trinian's'' movies, created with Sidney Gilliat and set in a girls' school, amused filmgoers during the 1950's and 60's. But it was her role as Maid Marian in the long-running Robin Hood series that catapulted her to stardom.         The series became one of the first British television programs to succeed in the United States, and at the height of its popularity more than 30 million viewers in Britain and North America watched its weekly episodes. Essentially a traditional version of the legend, the series, which ran from 1955 until 1958 and starred Richard Greene in the title role, proved popular with younger viewers, partly because of its catchy theme song sung by Dick James. It also had a high standard of script writing, some of it by Ring Lardner Jr., who had been blacklisted in Hollywood for his suspected Communist sympathies.         But after two years and 78 episodes, Ms. O'Farrell feared that she was becoming typecast, and in 1957 she left the series despite receiving thousands of letters begging her to stay.         Born in Birr, County Offaly, Ireland, to a bank manager and a gifted amateur actress, Ms. O'Farrell nevertheless showed no interest in the stage. After being educated at a local convent, she was working as a lawyer's secretary when she was invited  to an audition by the film director Sir Carol Reed, who knew her father.         There she met Launder, who gave her a small part in his 1947 film ''Captain Boycott,'' with Stewart Granger. In 1949 she appeared as a glamorous gym teacher in Launder and Gilliat's ''Happiest Days of Your Life,'' with Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford. She married Launder the next year; he died in 1997.         In the early 1950's, Ms. O'Farrell combined stage work with small parts in her husband's films, including ''The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan''; ''The Genie,'' with Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and ''The Square Ring,'' a boxing tale in which she divorced her husband because she could not bear to see him battered. She last appeared in 1959 in Launder and Gilliat's ''Bridal Path'' before retiring to spend more time with her young family on their farm in Buckinghamshire, England.         Later, she and Launder moved to Monaco, where they were active in local stage productions and charities.         She is survived by two daughters.       
         Doreen Valiente, a self-proclaimed witch who in the mid-1950's wrote part of the liturgy now used by witches around the world, died in Brighton, England, on Sept. 1. She was 77.         Through lectures and her many books, Ms. Valiente became the chief proselytizer of the white witch movement, which espouses use of magic, defined as Divine energy, for beneficial purposes.         She was held by many to be the ''mother of modern paganism,'' according to The Times of London, which reported her death on Monday. As a coven of today's witches gather in a circle, it is her version of the Charge of the Goddess, a witches' liturgical text, that the priestess recites.         ''Over the course of her life she witnessed -- and helped generate -- a sustained revival of witchcraft and paganism in Britain, despite repeated protestations by evangelical Christians,'' The Times said in its obituary.         Phyllis W. Curott, president emeritus of Covenant of the Goddess, a New York-based umbrella organization for witches, said that in recent years millions of people had been drawn to witchcraft, but that the words written by Ms. Valiente remain central in virtually every ceremony.         ''A common chord, uniting all, is a real love and appreciation for the Charge of the Goddess,'' she said.         For Ms. Valiente, witchcraft became ever more inclusive, ultimately embracing feminism, environmentalism and a host of New Age concepts, including native American spirituality.         ''It was an idea whose time had come,'' Ms. Valiente said in a 1991 interview, ''and these other things are also things whose time has come.''         Ms. Valiente became a guiding force in the wicca movement, which derives its name from an old Anglo-Saxon word for witch, or the wise one.         In the United States, Ms. Curott said, the number of wicca devotees now numbers three million to five million, making it one of the country's fastest growing beliefs.         Ms. Valiente was born Doreen Dominy in London in 1922. She was brought up as a Christian and sent to a convent school, which she walked out of at 15, refusing to return.         Biographers say that she experienced psychic episodes in her youth, and that by her late teens she was a practicing clairvoyant. She worked as a secretary by day.         In 1944, she married Casimiro Valiente, a refugee from the Spanish Civil War who went on to fight with the Free French.         In 1952, shortly after Britain had repealed its Witchcraft Act, which had outlawed witchery, she approached Cecil Williamson, then owner of the Museum of Witchcraft on the Isle of Man.         Mr. Williamson put her in touch with Gerald Gardner, who headed a group of witches called the New Forest Coven. Mr. Gardner initiated her as a witch in 1953. Ms. Valiente became the coven's high priestess and collaborated with Mr. Gardner in putting an up-to-date spin on what was billed as the witches' ancient liturgy, ''Book of Shadows,'' written in segments during the 1950's         The book was actually an eclectic mix, based principally on Charles Leland's ''Gospel of the Witches,'' published in 1899, but drawing also on Freemasonry, theosophy and the works of the Golden Dawn, a magical tradition of England and Ireland embraced by George Bernard Shaw and William Butler Yeats.         Wicca began to be practiced with its new ritual and with Ms. Valiente in a prominent position. ''She became a high priestess during an era when witchcraft was still very much in the broom closet,'' Ms. Currot said.         She was tapping into a rich and quixotic tradition. Witchcraft had persisted and sometimes been tolerated, despite laws against it going back to the seventh century.         ''The story of witchcraft in Britain is unique, in both its form and mildness, when compared with the rest of Europe,'' wrote Ronald Holmes in his book, ''Witchcraft in British History'' in 1974.         Ms. Valiente broke with Mr. Gardner in 1957 when he ignored the coven's vows of secrecy by aggressively seeking publicity. After the deaths of her mother in 1964 and husband in 1972 (neither of whom had approved of her career choice) she began to take a much more personal and active role in what witches simply call the craft.         Her most important contribution to the movement was a stream of books, including ''An A B C of Witchcraft,'' published in 1973; ''Witchcraft for Tomorrow'' (1978), and ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft,'' (1989).         A gauge of the growth of her movement is that 1964, when she gave the opening speech at the inaugural dinner at the Witchcraft Research Association, it was attended by 50 subscribers. In November 1977, she addressed an audience of 1,500 at the Pagan Federation Congress.         Ron Cooke, a fellow believer who was her companion for most of the last two decades of her life, died in 1997. She left no close relatives, but made the Center for Pagan Studies in Surrey, England, principal beneficiary.         ''She was a wise and wild woman, who definitely ran with the British equivalent of wolves,'' said Ms. Curott, who in 1985 won the case allowing witch clergy to perform weddings in New York City.       
         Amalia Rodrigues, the Portuguese singer who was considered the queen of fado, died yesterday at her home in Lisbon. She was 79.         Her recording company, Valentim de Carvalho, said she was found dead in her bed by her secretary.         Fado, which means fate in Portuguese, is a passionate, volatile, haunted style that originated in the cafes and taverns of Lisbon. Played on the round, bright-toned 12-string Portuguese guitar, with Arabic elements that make it kin to Spanish flamenco, fado is filled with the quality called saudade in Portuguese: a mixture of sadness and nostalgia, longing and resignation. Its lyrics are bleak and fatalistic, with their suffering described in the first person. Ms. Rodrigues performed in the black clothes of mourning, with her head thrown back and her face like a mask of tragedy, singing in a voice that was at once tearful and fierce.         ''I have so much sadness in me, I am a pessimist, a nihilist, everything fado demands in a singer, I have in me,'' Ms. Rodrigues once said. ''When I am on my own, alone, tragedy comes, and solitude.''         During more than 50 years as a performer, Ms. Rodrigues was acclaimed as the definitive voice of fado, revered in Portugal and acclaimed as its musical representative around the world. When her death was announced, Portugal's radio stations dropped regular programming and began broadcasting tributes. The Prime Minister of Portugal, Antonio Guterres, ordered three days of national mourning. Reuters reported that Mr. Guterres said: ''It is a moment of great sadness. She was the voice of Portugal.''         Amalia Rodrigues was born in 1920 in the Alfama district of Lisbon, the cradle of fado. She was one of 10 children in a working-class family and was reared by her grandmother. She sold fruit in the streets and worked as a seamstress before she began to perform as a tango dancer.         As a teen-ager her renditions of tangos built a reputation, and she began singing professionally in 1939. At first her family did not approve of her singing tango and fado, songs associated with the lower classes and the underworld.         She made her first recordings in 1945 in Portugal and in Rio de Janeiro. In 1952 she signed to the Valentim de Carvalho label and began to reshape the tradition. She combined the urban and rural styles of Lisbon and Coimbra; she chose lyrics that reached beyond stories of heartbreak to muse on God and destiny.         Ms. Rodrigues began to tour beyond Portugal after World War II. She performed regularly in Brazil, Spain, France and Britain and eventually gave concerts in the United States, Japan, Mexico and the Soviet Union. She recorded more than 170 albums that were released in 30 countries, and appeared in a dozen films, notably ''Les Amants du  Tage'' (''Lovers of the Tagus''), by the French director Henri Verneuil.         Fado fell from its commercial peak during the 1960's, and after 1974, when a revolution removed the dictator Antonio Salazar, fado was associated by many Portuguese with the authoritarian regime. ''I always sang fado without thinking of politics,'' Ms. Rodrigues said. ''I never had the support of any government.''         By then, Ms. Rodrigues was known around the world. At her concerts, including her last New York City performance at Town Hall in 1990, rapt listeners sang along to her songs of love and death. In the 1990's she had heart surgery and retired from singing because of poor health. She made her last public appearance in 1998 in Lisbon, singing at the opening of Expo 1998.       
         Carol Berlin Manzoni, a Chicago lawyer whose knack for recruiting clients propelled her rapid rise in the legal profession, died on Oct. 9 at her home in Chicago. She was 52.         The cause was heart disease, the Blake-Lamb Funeral Home said.         Ms. Manzoni was a leading player at Ross & Hardie, a Chicago-based firm with about 180 lawyers and offices in Washington and Manhattan. She specialized in cases involving labor and employment, litigations and higher education law, and was known for her energetic leadership style.         She was a senior partner in the firm and served two consecutive terms as co-chairwoman of its executive committee from 1995 to 1998. A colleague at Ross & Hardie, Richard E. Lieberman, said she would probably have been in line for a third turn as co-chairwoman next year.         Ms. Manzoni's swift professional rise began when few sizable law firms counted women among their policy makers. She joined Ross & Hardie in 1989, bringing with her enough clients to become an instant equity partner.         Ms. Manzoni, a native New Yorker, received a bachelor's degree from Bucknell University in 1969 and a doctorate in law from Catholic University of America in 1977. She recalled that when she first presented herself at law firms, her interviewers usually assumed she was applying for a secretary's job.         She handled sexual discrimination suits for a Chicago firm for a year, as she told The New York Times in 1996, ''writing briefs for senior partners, and fuming a lot.'' Then, at a party, she met the president of a local college who opened the way for her to give labor seminars and thereby build her reputation.         Ms. Manzoni is survived by her husband, Michael G. Hron; two stepsons, Benjamin and Jonathan, and a sister, Susan Klimpl, also of Chicago.       
         Rose E. Bird, who became the first woman on California's Supreme Court and whose resolute opposition to the death penalty later led voters to remove her as chief justice, died of complications from breast cancer on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 63.         Almost from the moment she was appointed to head the state's highest court by Gov. Jerry Brown in 1977, Ms. Bird, a pioneering liberal lawyer who had never been a judge, became one of the most controversial figures in California politics. She led a liberal majority that strengthened environmental laws and consumer rights. But in 1986, voters angry at her opposition to the death penalty removed her and two other Brown-appointed justices by refusing to extend their terms. They were the first such removals in California history.         Ms. Bird, who came of professional age at a time when major law firms still resisted hiring women, held a succession of path-breaking jobs. She was the first woman hired by the Santa Clara County public defender's office in Northern California, and she became the first woman to hold a cabinet-level post in state government when Mr. Brown named her his secretary of agriculture in 1975. Many of her detractors were forced to acknowledge her administrative skills, while even her admirers among judges and lawyers conceded the brittleness that made her a lighting rod for criticism.         Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who had known her for years, said Ms. Bird had ''a total passion for, and commitment to, justice.''         ''In some ways, she was just too good to be a judge, he said. ''She had a total passion and commitment, and that's not always the best way to function and get along in this world, in a political environment. From the day she got to the Supreme Court, she never really had a chance.''         After the death penalty was reinstated in California in the late 1970's, Judge Bird never upheld a death sentence, voting to vacate such sentences 61 times. She survived repeated efforts to recall her, but was ousted after Governor George Deukmejian, a Republican, led an aggressive campaign against her.         To this day, Ms. Bird's name remains a kind of reflexive shorthand in California for ''soft-on-crime liberal.'' In last year's election, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, sought to tar his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, by association, because Mr. Davis had been Governor Brown's chief of staff at the time of Ms. Bird's appointment.         ''I appreciate that some people within our state are impatient, impatient to see executions,'' Ms. Bird said after her removal. ''I don't think anybody in this state will sit easy if, in fact, this becomes a court that ensures nothing but executions to appease the overweening and insatiable attitude of ambitious politicians.''         Today, in part because of long-running arguments over capital punishment, California has the largest death row in the nation, with more than 500 inmates sentenced to die. But virtually the entire state political establishment, Democratic as well as Republican, now favors the death penalty, and the pace of executions is widely expected to increase.         Rose Elizabeth Bird was born on Nov. 2, 1936, in Tucson, the youngest of three children whose parents ran a chicken farm. Her parents separated in 1941, and her father died soon after. Ms. Bird's widowed mother, Anne, moved the family to New York, her home state.         Young Rose was a standout scholar in high school, earning a scholarship to Long Island University, where she majored in English in preparation for a career in journalism. She later enrolled as a graduate student in political science at the University of California at Berkeley, but an internship in the State Legislature in Sacramento persuaded her to switch to law school, because lawyers seemed to have the most influence on public policy.         After working as a public defender and teaching a seminar in criminal defense at Stanford University's law school, Ms. Bird became a volunteer in Mr. Brown's 1974 campaign for governor, serving as his frequent chauffeur on his trips to her area and later as a trusted adviser on his transition team. On taking office, Mr. Brown broke precedent by naming Ms. Bird secretary of agriculture, a post traditionally held by a grower. Ms. Bird emphasized consumer protection and worker health and safety, moving to ban the use of a short-handled hoe that forced farm laborers to spend hours stooped in the fields. She also drafted a landmark farm labor bill guaranteeing workers' rights to hold secret-ballot union elections and shepherded it through the legislature.         The controversy she generated in the agriculture post was nothing compared to the criticism that greeted her nomination as chief justice in 1977. Police groups and politicians around the state opposed her on the grounds that she would favor defendants, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, then a bishop and head of the state Agricultural Relations Board, questioned her ''emotional stability'' and her ''vindictive approach to dealing with all persons under her authority.''         Just a year later, conservatives outraged by her decisions on school busing, taxes and other issues began a campaign to remove her. Under California law, supreme court justices appointed by the governor must be approved by the electorate in the next gubernatorial election, and periodically thereafter.         She survived the opposition that year. But on the morning of election day, The Los Angeles Times published an article, citing anonymous sources, suggesting that the Supreme Court had deliberately delayed issuing a split decision overturning a law mandating prison sentences for those convicted of using a gun in certain crimes, so as not to hurt Judge Bird's chances at the polls.         That led to public hearings by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, which portrayed the court as riven by personal conflicts and political infighting. No formal charges of misconduct were brought against any justice, but the controversy generated by the investigation lingered on.         After her ouster in 1986, Ms. Bird, who never married, retreated into semi-seclusion. She cared for her aged mother in Palo Alto and surfaced occasionally as a television commentator or a public speaker, but dropped even some old friends and associates. She had battled breast cancer intermittently since 1976. Her mother died in 1991, and she is survived by two brothers, Philip, of Hawaii, and Jack, of Arizona.         ''If you have never experienced life under a microscope, you need to understand that those who live a public life are no longer seen as real persons -- human beings,'' Ms. Bird wrote in a 1996 newspaper column. ''Rather, they are objects to be examined, manipulated, ridiculed and sometimes even hated.''       
         Margaret A. Greenfield, a founder and officer of the Independent Journalism Foundation and a dealer in art, antiques and real estate, died yesterday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 74.         She had cancer, said her husband, James L. Greenfield.         Beginning in the 1950's, Mrs. Greenfield was an art and antiques dealer in London, Washington and finally Manhattan, where for about the last 25 years she owned and ran an antiques shop, Marco Polo, on Madison Avenue between 84th and 85th Streets. It closed about a year ago.         She also renovated and resold brownstones on the Upper East Side.         Mrs. Greenfield was active in the Independent Journalism Foundation from its inception in 1991. The foundation, based in Manhattan, teaches citizens of former Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe about working as journalists in newly democratic societies.         She was the foundation's treasurer and one of its founders, along with her husband and Donald M. Wilson, a former vice president of Time Inc. Mr. Greenfield, a former foreign correspondent for Time magazine and former assistant secretary of state, is now a consulting member of the editorial board at The New York Times, where he has also been foreign editor and later an assistant managing editor.         Mrs. Greenfield created and furnished the foundation's four centers in Eastern European capitals -- in Prague, Bratislava, Bucharest and Budapest.         Margaret Ann Schwertley Greenfield was born in Gooding, Idaho. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Idaho and worked as a stewardess for United Airlines and then for Pan American World Airways.         She met Mr. Greenfield when she was based in Hong Kong in the early 1950's, while she was Pan Am's first stewardess based in the Far East. They were married in 1954.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Anne Schwertley of Manhattan and Jane Schwertley of Gainesville, Fla.
