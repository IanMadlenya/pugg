         Reva Rubin, who was among the first specialists in maternity nursing, died on Saturday at her home in Harrisville, Pa. She was 76 and also lived in Panama City, Fla.         The cause was a heart attack, said officials at the University of Pittsburgh, where Professor Rubin had taught for 21 years before retiring in 1981.         In scores of case studies she observed and documented as a nurse, midwife and teacher, she examined how mothers use a variety of senses -- sight, smell and touch -- to become familiar with their newborns.  To encourage the bonding that she observed, she was an early proponent of keeping the mother and the newborn together as much as possible during the first days after birth.         By the 1980's, the concept that there is a special time right after birth during which mothers become emotionally attached to their babies began to receive criticism from some researchers, although the changes in hospital practice that the research wrought were never questioned.         She was the author of "The Maternal Identity and the Maternal Experience" (Springer, 1984). In 1972, she was a founder with her companion and longtime professional colleague, Dr. Florence H. Erickson of the Maternal Child Care Nursing Journal, the first research journal in the field. Together, they also established master's and doctoral programs in nursing at the University of Pittsburgh.         A graduate of Hunter College in 1941, she went on to Yale to receive master's degrees in nursing in 1946 and in mental health in 1954. She taught at Yale and the University of Chicago before joining the University of Pittsburgh in 1960.         Besides Dr. Erickson of Harrisville, she is survived by a brother, Harry, of Cape Coral, Fla.       
         Margaret Chase Smith, a flinty, independent Maine Republican who made history as the first woman to win election to both houses of Congress and the first whose name was advanced for the Presidency at a national convention, died yesterday at at her home in Skowhegan, Me. She was 97 years old.         A spokeswoman from the Margaret Chase Smith Library in Skowhegan said she had died of complications from a stroke eight days earlier that had left her in a coma.         A red rose was Mrs. Smith's trademark, a stalwart conscience, her beacon. She was known as the "conscience of the Senate."         In four terms in the House, from 1941 to 1949, then four in the Senate through 1975, Mrs. Smith won friends and earned foes across a wide political spectrum. She could number among her enemies such polar opposites as the Communist-hunting Joseph R. McCarthy and the leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita S. Khrushchev. The formidable Mr. McCarthy referred sneeringly to Mrs. Smith as a "Snow White," and Mr. Khrushchev saw her as "the devil in the disguise of a woman."         Mrs. Smith said her life in politics was her only life. "I have no family, no time-consuming hobbies," she said late in her Senate career. "I have only myself and my job as United States Senator."         But she also had a sense of humor.  In 1952, when asked by a reporter what she would do if she woke up one morning and found herself in the White House, she replied: "I'd go straight to Mrs. Truman and apologize. Then I'd go home."         Though Mrs. Smith seemed to many people a champion of women's rights, she said she did not regard herself as a feminist. "I was treated fairly in the Senate, not because of equal rights but because of seniority," she said in a 1975 interview.         In her dedication to her work, she answered 2,941 consecutive Senate roll-calls, a series broken only when she underwent a hip operation in 1968. In time, she became the ranking Republican on the Armed Services and Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committees, and served as well on the Appropriations Committee.         Never anything but a Republican, Mrs. Smith was hardly the dyed-in-the-wool variety. Party regulars could never take her vote for granted. She voted as she saw fit.         In the 1950's, Mrs. Smith alienated McCarthy by joining with six other Republican senators in making a "declaration of conscience" in which she took the measure of McCarthy's sensationalist, inquisitorial methods in trying to suppress Communism.  "I don't want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the four horseman of calumny -- fear, ignorance, bigotry and smear," Mrs. Smith said. McCarthy responded by referring to her and the six other senators as "Snow White and the Six Dwarfs."         Khrushchev was understandably restrained when Mrs. Smith, a consistent advocate of a strong military, criticized President John F. Kennedy because she thought he lacked the will to use nuclear weapons and concluded that such restraint weakened America's struggle against the Soviet Union. When Mr. Khrushchev heard of Mrs. Smith's stance, he said he thought it had beaten "all records of savagery."         But Mrs. Smith replied: "Mr. Khrushchev isn't really mad at me. I am not that important. He is angry because American officials have grown more firm since my speech."         Shortly before his assassination, President Kennedy called Mrs. Smith a "formidable political figure" against whom he would not like to campaign. The morning after his death, she went into the Senate chamber before it convened and laid a red rose on Kennedy's old desk.         As a member of Congress she supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, much to the dismay of her more conservative colleagues. Over the years, she angered fellow Republicans by supporting Federal aid to education in 1948, by voting against Lewis L. Strauss, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's nominee for Secretary of Commerce in 1959, and by opposing President Richard M. Nixon's unsuccessful nominees to the Supreme Court, Clement F. Haynsworth in 1969 and G. Harrold Carswell in 1970.         She was a strong supporter of civil rights and, again irritating some Republican colleagues, an early advocate of Government-financed medical care for the elderly.         Margaret Madeline Chase was born on Dec. 14, 1897, in Skowhegan on the Kennebec River in central Maine. Her father, George Emery Chase, was the town barber and her mother was the former Carrie Murray.         As the eldest of six children in a family of modest means, Margaret was expected to work -- and that she did even as a schoolgirl; she was skillful enough to shave her father's customers when he was busy or away from the shop.         After graduating from Skowhegan High School in 1916, she held jobs for which a college education was not always required: telephone operator, circulation manager for a weekly newspaper, grade-school teacher and eventually a woolen mill executive.         In 1930, at the age of 32, she married Clyde H. Smith, who was 22 years her senior and co-owner of the local newspaper. Mr. Smith, who was prominent in local Republican circles, ran for office and in 1937 was elected Representative from Maine's Second Congressional District.         In 1940, seriously ill after suffering a heart attack, Mr. Smith asked Maine voters to continue his policies by electing his wife to succeed him. After his death, she was chosen to fill his unexpired term in a special election and was elected in her own right later that year.         In 1948 Mrs. Smith entered the Republican senatorial primary and received more votes than her three male opponents combined. In the general election she easily defeated her Democratic rival, Dr. Adrian Scolten.         She said she considered taking her maiden name back after her husband's death, adding: "My name was Chase. It's a good New England name. I liked it. But legally I was Smith."         She quickly grew in stature as a senator and was mentioned as a Vice Presidential candidate in 1952 and again in 1968. In 1964 Mrs. Smith announced her candidacy for President and ran in the New Hampshire primary that year. She drew more than a dozen votes at the Republican National Convention, which was controlled by the conservative forces backing Barry Goldwater.         She seemed unstopable until 1972, when William D. Hathaway, a 48-year-old Democrat and former member of Congress, defeated her in her campaign for a fifth Senate term. She was 74 at the time and seemed increasingly frail, riding the Capitol corridors on a small yellow cart and carrying a cane. There were rumors that her health was fragile, but she remained robust for many years.         In her later years she was no less independent but grew weary and wary of militants.         In 1970, 20 years after she had denounced McCarthy's scare tactics, she said that those on the radical left who advocated violence were easily the equal to the menace she had perceived from the radical right two decades earlier. "We had a national sickness then from which we recovered," she said. "We have a national sickness now from which I pray we will recover."         But, true to form, she also attacked those in the Government who, she believed, had overreacted to the anti-war demonstrators.         Mrs. Smith did not remarry after the death of her husband. She is survived by a sister, Evelyn Williams of Skowhegan, and several nieces and nephews.       
         Rochelle Pittman, whose legal battle in a tainted blood scandal led to a continuing national inquiry into the state of Canada's blood supplies, died Wednesday at her home in Toronto. She was 57.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said her son Tom Pittman.         Mrs. Pittman is credited with putting a human face on the struggle for redress waged by the more than 1,000 people in Canada who contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through tainted blood and blood products.         "She made a difference in a lot of people's lives," said her lawyer, Ken Arenson. "She got calls from perfect strangers asking her how to deal with this  or that problem."         Her husband, Ken Pittman, a store chain executive, died in 1990 of H.I.V.-related pneumonia without knowing he was infected. He had received a tainted transfusion after cardiac surgery at Toronto General Hospital in 1984.         Dr. Stanley Bain, the family doctor, knew that Mr. Pittman was infected, but  never told the couple because, as the doctor later testified, he feared the information would send Mr. Pittman into a depression. He also said he had mistakenly believed that the couple was no longer having sex.         Five months after her husband died, Mrs. Pittman, who had worked as a jewelry saleswoman in Toronto, was told she also had the virus.         At a news conference in January 1992 at the Ontario legislature, Mrs. Pittman, a tiny, stylish, retiring woman, announced the start of what became a rocky three-year legal battle for redress.         In March last year an Ontario judge awarded her $375,000 in compensation. Dr. Bain, a former President of the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons, was  held 40 percent liable. The Canadian Red Cross and Toronto General Hospital split the remaining amount equally.         In addition, the same institution Dr. Bain had headed found him guilty of misconduct and suspended him from the practice of medicine for two months.         In her decision, an Ontario judge, Susan Lang, wrote that had Mr. Pittman been told, he might have lived two more years and avoided infecting Mrs. Pittman.         For Canada it was a heart-wrenching story, followed in all its intricate twists on newspaper front pages and on national television. At a news conference at the time of the award, Mrs. Pittman observed that while she was happy with the judgment, "No amount of money can compensate me and my family for the loss of a husband and a father. Nor will it change the fact that I will likely experience the same fate."         Her son Tom said that over the last four to six weeks her health went into a  significant decline. "Last Thursday she announced she didn't want to fight any longer. She was determined to have the end come on quickly. But she lingered until Wednesday. The last day she was in a sort of coma."         He said she had been reconciled to the cruelty of her fate. "Anger and bitterness were there, but they didn't consume her in the end. She rose above that."         Mrs. Pittman is survived by her four children: Tom, of Toronto; Mrs. Kelly Blackwood of Kincardine, Ontario; Mark Pittman of Newmarket, Ontario; and Mrs. Kathy Fenton of Toronto; her mother, Mrs. Evelyn Borden, of Toronto; a sister, Mrs. Gail Stanzel of Toronto; and a brother, Dave Winaut, of Liverpool, Nova Scotia, and six grandchildren.       
         Esther Rome, co-author of the best seller "Our Bodies, Ourselves" and women's health advocate for more than 25 years, died at her home in Somerville, Mass., on Saturday. She was 49.         The cause was breast cancer, said a friend, Judith Norsigian.         Ms. Rome argued that issues of cosmetic surgery, eating disorders, body image and sexually transmitted diseases as they affected women belonged in the social- and economic-policy arena as much as in the medical world. She was instrumental in fostering the public debate over toxic shock syndrome and its link to the use of tampons in the early 1980's.         A decade later, she served as a consumer advocate on the Food and Drug Administration committee that investigated the potential hazards of silicone breast implants. The committee's work led to a partial ban on implants and Ms. Rome led a support group for women with implants who had health problems.         Until days before her death, she was working on her latest book, "Risking Health for Love," with her co-author, Jane Hyman, that examines the health risks of choices that women make, covering breast implants, sexually transmitted diseases and domestic violence.         Ms. Rome was among 12 young professional women who were not medical experts but who were concerned about health issues who gathered in a lounge at M.I.T. in 1969 to exchange the information about doctors and other health topics. The group later formed the Boston Women's Health Book Collective.         A year later, the women published a collection of papers challenging long-held approaches to medical treatment of women. The papers addressed a range of topics including childbirth and rape. Called "Women and Their Bodies," it was a 75-cent newsprint guide to the physical and psychological makeup of women. In 1971 they changed the name to "Our Bodies, Ourselves" and the book inspired a grass-roots, consumer-advocacy movement, becoming a bible to a generation of young women.         In college dormitories and apartments across the country groups of female baby-boomers, hungry for the kind of information their mothers did not always have, gathered to discuss the book. They formed support groups and grappled with women's health issues made more immediate by the availability of birth-control pills and the legalization of abortion.         The book was attacked as pornographic by the Moral Majority and other conservative groups and it was banned from some schools. By 1973 it had sold more than 350,000 copies. Now in its third edition, it has sold nearly three million copies in the United States and has been translated into 14 foreign languages, including Hebrew, Swedish and Greek, said a spokeswoman for its publisher, Simon & Schuster.         Ms. Rome was born in Norwich, Conn. She graduated from Brandeis University in 1966 and received a master's degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1968.         She is survived by her husband, Nathan; two sons, Judah and Micah, both of Somerville; two brothers, Aaron Seidman of Brookline and Abe Seidman of Beverly Hills, Calif., and a sister, Sara Levine of Dallas.       
         Roberta Church, an official in the Eisenhower and Nixon Administrations who was the first black woman to be elected to the Tennessee Republican State Executive Committee, died on Saturday at Baptist Memorial Hospital East in Memphis. She was 81 and lived in Memphis.         She had suffered a brief illness, said Ronald A. Walter, the co-author of one of her books.         Miss Church was the last survivor of a family of black Tennesseans who were prominent in business and Republican politics when few Southern blacks were active in either business or the party.         With her aunt, Annette E. Church, she wrote a biography of her grandfather and father, "The Robert R. Churches of Memphis: A Father and Son Who Achieved in Spite of Race" (Burke's, 1974). She also wrote, with Mr. Walter, "Nineteenth-Century Memphis Families of Color, 1850-1900" (Burke's; 2d ed., 1989).         Miss Church, whose full name was Sara Roberta Church, was born in Memphis and received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Northwestern University. Her grandfather, Robert R. Sr., founded Memphis's first black bank and was believed to be the first black millionaire in the South.         Her father was an early civil rights leader; in 1916 he formed the Lincoln League to register and organize voters, and in 1917 he founded Tennessee's first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         He died in 1952 while campaigning for a seat on the Republican State Executive Committee. Miss Church took over the campaign and was elected in his stead to represent Memphis and surrounding Shelby County.         In 1953 she was named by the Eisenhower Administration to promote equal employment opportunities as a Labor Department consultant. In 1961 she started a Civil Service career as an administrator of Federal-state programs in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, later the Department of Health and Human Services. She retired in 1982.         Miss Cook also served two terms under President Richard M. Nixon as a member of his Advisory Council on Adult Education.       
         Dr. Ethel Emerson Wortis, a physician long active in civic affairs, died on Sunday at the San Simeon Nursing Home in Greenport, L.I. A former resident of New York City, she was 93 and lived in Southold, L.I.         For nearly three decades, she was associated with the Women's City Club of New York, holding various offices, including that of president in the 1950's. She was a past president of the Women's Medical Association of New York City and was active in the League of Women Voters, the Women's Prison Association and the Society of Friends.         Dr. Wortis was born in New York City, the daughter of Dr. Haven Emerson, a former City Commissioner of Health. She graduated from Radcliffe College and, in 1927, from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.         Early in her career, she worked as a doctor at the Bronxville School in Bronxville, N.Y. She was later visiting physician at Goldwater Memorial Hospital, on Roosevelt Island, and, in the 1970's, a doctor in the Suffolk County Outreach Unit's mobile health clinic. She retired just over 10 years ago.         Dr. Wortis is survived by two sons, Michael, of Burnaby, British Columbia, and Ethan, of Huntington, L.I.; a sister, Ruth Cooke of Kennett Square, Pa.; a brother, John H. Emerson of Arlington, Mass., and four grandchildren. Her husband, Dr. S. Bernard Wortis, died in 1969 after 35 years of marriage.       
         Mary Polak Oenslager, a philanthropist who supported the city's cultural institutions and helped causes from women's health to the visually impaired, died last Sunday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 98.         She endowed programs at several institutions that provide health care for women, like the Maternity Center Association on East 92d Street and Long Island College Hospital. The victim of an eye condition that left her nearly blind in midlife, she recovered her sight in one of the first cornea transplants and became a founder of Recordings for the Blind and a sponsor of blind university graduates.         Among her beneficiaries were the New York Philharmonic and its Free Concerts in the parks program, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Opera, the Metropolitan Museum, the Brooklyn Museum and the American Museum of Natural History.         She was the widow of Donald M. Oenslager, a theatrical designer, who died in 1975. She and her husband gave their collection of prints of theaters, costumes and stage sets to the Pierpont Morgan Library, of which she was a Fellow in Perpetuity. She also was a Conservator of the New York Public Library.         Mrs. Oenslager is survived by her brother-in-law, Malcolm G. Chace Jr. of North Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Oveta Culp Hobby, the creator of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps in World War II, the first Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and a longtime executive at the recently closed Houston Post, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 90.         Mrs. Hobby, whose media holdings made her one of the nation's richest women, suffered a stroke in April, her family said.         She went from being a small-town lawyer's well-read daughter to being a regular on fashion magazines' lists of well-dressed women, with her trendy designer gowns and hats from Bergdorf Goodman. She took lessons that erased the drawl from her conversations about the Picasso paintings she collected or the Bartok concertos she heard at the Houston Symphony. She also reorganized the business department of The Houston Post from top to bottom, and she later developed a reputation as a hard-working administrator who prized efficiency in government.         But she was not one to demand the credit.         "Everything that ever happened to me fell in my lap," she once said. "And nothing in my life would have been possible without Governor."         "Governor" was William P. Hobby, an easy-going newspaperman who was the top elected official in Texas from 1917 to 1921; his most notable action as Governor was to call out the state militia to crush a dock strike.         He was hired as publisher of The Houston Post-Dispatch at about the same time that Miss Culp, a friend of Florence Sterling, whose millionaire brother owned the paper, got a job in the circulation department.         Mr. Hobby's first wife died a year later. A couple of years later, after Miss Culp lost a campaign for a seat in the State Legislature, they were seen socializing around Houston. In 1931, when she was 26 and he 53, they were married.         "Will, she'll embarrass you," one of her husband's friends warned. "She doesn't give a hang about clothes."         But she learned to; in the 1950's her name appeared regularly on the lists of best-dressed women. She also learned about newspapers. The Hobbys eventually acquired ownership of The Post and she worked as a book reviewer, copy editor and editorial writer.         Their first child, William P. Hobby Jr., was born on Mrs. Hobby's 27th birthday, and her daughter, Jessica, on her 32d. As the publisher's wife, she became president of the Texas League of Women Voters, a member of the board of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, a member of the Houston Symphony Orchestra Committee and regional chairman of the Mobilization for Human Needs, all before she was 35.         Mrs. Hobby was born on Jan. 19, 1905, in Killeen, Tex., the daughter of Isaac and Emma Hoover Culp. Her first name was an Indian word that her parents chose because it rhymed with with Juanita, the name of one of her sisters.         Oveta soon demonstrated her independent-mindedness. A temperance campaign swept Killeen when she was 5, and her Sunday school class was asked to sign a pledge. She politely refused. Her grandmother heard about her refusal and had a switch ready. Not until afterward did her grandmother ask why she had refused. "I did not sign because I did not know what that word means -- temperance," she said. Her grandmother apologized.         She was her father's favorite; at 10 she read the Congressional Record in his office, and when he won a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1919 she went with him to Austin.         She briefly attended Mary Hardin Baylor College at Belton, Tex. Miss Culp was soon on the state payroll, in a job codifying statutes for the State Banking Committee. In 1925, when she was 20, a year shy of being old enough to vote, she was appointed parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature. Later she wrote a handbook on parliamentary procedure, "Mr. Chairman," which was used as a textbook throughout the state.         "If I hadn't been parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature, other things would never have been sparked," she said later. "Twenty is a wonderful age for things to be sparked."         One of the things sparked by her duties in Austin was an interest in politics. The 1928 Democratic National Convention was held in Houston, and she worked on senatorial and mayoral campaigns. She later ran for a seat in the State Legislature. Her opponent whispered that she was "a parliamentarian and a Unitarian." She lost. It was the last time she ran for office.         Mrs. Hobby was in Washington in 1941 for a meeting at the Federal Communications Commission -- the family owned radio station KPRC-AM -- when Gen. David Searles asked her to organize a section on women's activities for the Army. The War Department had been receiving 10,000 letters a day from women who wanted to serve their country. But Mrs. Hobby turned him down, saying that she had a husband, two children and a job.         General Searles asked her to draw up an organization chart with recommendations on ways that women could serve, and she did. He repeated his request that she go to work in Washington. She repeated her refusal. Then she told her husband.         "You shouldn't have made him have to ask you a second time," Mr. Hobby reportedly said at the time. "Any thoughtful person knows that we are in this war, and that every one of us is going to have to do whatever we are called upon to do." Mrs. Hobby went to Washington.         Her job was completely new in American military history, and she had to write her own rules. The idea of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps -- the name was changed to Women's Army Corps in 1943 -- was not well received by male commanders. Sergeants had jeeps, but Mrs. Hobby, who held the rank of colonel, had to call for a car from the War Department motor pool.         Members of the WACs enlisted for noncombat duty as medical technicians, cartography clerks, secretaries and similar types of jobs in the United States and in every war theater. By the end of World War II, about 100,000 women had joined the WAC. The organization was dissolved in 1978.         Mrs. Hobby received the Distinguished Service Medal in January 1945 for outstanding service "without guidance or precedents in United States military history.         Back in Houston, she renewed her political contacts and expanded the circulation of The Post, where she was an executive vice president and a director of KPRC, which came to include not only the AM station but also FM and television outlets.         Although she considered herself a conservative Democrat, she backed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, a Republican, when he ran for President in 1948, and Dwight D. Eisenhower in his successful Presidential campaign in 1952.         In return for her support, Mrs. Hobby was appointed to succeed Oscar E. Ewing as head of the Federal Security Agency. Her post did not have full Cabinet status when she was sworn in, but it was soon elevated to that rank and its name was changed to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mrs. Hobby was the nation's second woman to hold a Cabinet post; the first, Frances Perkins, was Secretary of Labor under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945.         In 31 months in charge of the department, which had a $1.7 billion annual budget, she oversaw the development of nurses training programs and a hospital reinsurance plan. She was also involved in the announcement of the Salk polio vaccine, and was praised at the time for having the patience to hold the announcement until the vaccine had been properly tested.         When Mrs. Hobby resigned, Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey was so dismayed that he said, "What? The best man in the Cabinet?"         Mrs. Hobby's reason for leaving Washington was straightforward: "Nothing is as important as Governor."         Her husband had been ill, but he improved once she was back in Houston. For the next nine years, until his death in 1964, they worked out of adjacent offices at The Post or a single large room in their home.         Mrs. Hobby sold The Post to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company in 1983 for about $130 million. The paper changed hands again a few years later, and was finally closed earlier this year.         In 1992, H&C Communications Inc., another family enterprise, sold its five television stations. The sale left H&C with only one broadcast outlet, the Hobby's original station, KPRC-AM in Houston.         Besides her son, who was the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991 and was recently named chancellor of the University of Houston, and her daughter, Jessica Catto, of San Antonio, she is survived by a sister, Mrs. Loy Loving, of Weslaco, Tex., 8 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Niuta Titus, whose philanthropy fostered culture and medical research, died on Tuesday in Gstaad, Switzerland, while on vacation. Mrs. Titus, who lived in Manhattan, was 82.         With her husband, Roy V. Titus, the former chairman of the Helena Rubinstein cosmetics empire, who died in 1989, Mrs. Titus supported endeavors like the film program at the Museum of Modern Art, biochemistry at Duke University and ophthalmological research at the Wilmer Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.         She was the president of the Roy and Niuta Titus Foundation, an honorary trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, a director of the Children's Blood Foundation, president of the Zion Orphanage in Jerusalem, a member of the international board of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and honorary director of the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, which is devoted to the health, education and welfare of women and children.         Many film buffs in New York have pursued their passion at institutions supported by Mr. and Mrs. Titus. Among them were the Film Society of Lincoln Center, the Film Forum as well as the Museum of Modern Art. In 1976, at a time of pressing financial problems for the museum, Mr. Titus and his wife donated $1 million to renovate its 37-year-old auditorium and for its endowment. Six years later, the couple sponsored a second theater, and the auditoriums are named for them.         Despite her high-visibility projects, Mrs. Titus was not a public figure. She enjoyed the company of friends and, in particular, liked a good game of bridge.         She was a member of the Regency Whist Club and the Cavendish Club, a private bridge club, where she met Mr. Titus after she had been widowed twice. They were married in 1960. Twenty years later, they were both still playing bridge at the club.         Mrs. Titus was born in Lithuania, where she grew up. Before World War II, she lived in Paris with her first husband, Benno Slesin, the general manager for Europe for Warner Brothers.         She came to the United States in 1940, and after Mr. Slesin died in an airplane crash in 1947, she marriedBernard Miller, a cutlery manufacturer in England. He died in 1953.         Mrs. Titus is survived by two children of her first marriage, Louis E. Slesin of Manhattan, and Suzanne Slesin Steinberg of Manhattan, an assistant editor in the Home section of The New York Times; and three grandchildren.       
         Thelma Griffith Haynes, a former co-owner of the Minnesota Twins, died Sunday in Orlando, Fla. She was 82.         She had been in poor health since suffering a stroke about 18 months ago, her son, Bruce, said.         Mrs. Haynes and her brother, Calvin Griffith, were raised by their uncle, Clark Griffith, because their parents were struggling financially and were later adopted by Griffith, a Hall of Fame pitcher who owned the Washington Senators.         Calvin Griffith became president of the franchise after Clark Griffith died and moved the team to Minnesota in 1961. Mrs. Haynes served as an executive vice president and assistant treasurer and each owned 26 percent of the team before it was sold to Carl Pohlad in 1985.         In addition to Calvin Griffith and her son, Mrs. Haynes is survived by two brothers and one sister.       
         Marilyn J. Morheuser, the lawyer at the center of a 13-year court struggle to make New Jersey's school-financing system more equitable for the state's poorest districts, died on Sunday at her home in Newark. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, according to the Education Law Center, a Newark-based public-interest organization of which she had been executive director since 1979.         Ms. Morheuser was the agency's lead counsel for the plaintiffs in Abbott v.  Burke, a class-action suit brought in 1981 to challenge the state's Quality Education Act of 1980. Arguing on behalf of pupils of the poorest urban schools, the suit asserted that the state had inadequately responded to a State Supreme Court ruling on school financing in 1973. That ruling said that New Jersey's method of school financing violated the State Constitution by failing to guarantee parity between the poorest and the most affluent districts.         The court -- the state's highest -- agreed with the center, ruling in 1990 that the law was still unconstitutional because it did not meet the educational  needs of disadvantaged city children. It ordered that those needs be met.         The law center returned to court the next year, this time to obtain a compliance order, which the Supreme Court in Trenton handed down in 1994. In it, the judges decided that the state must increase the financing of the 30 poorest  districts to a level where their per-pupil outlays would equal the average of the wealthiest districts by fiscal year 1996-97.         The judges demanded that schools in hard-pressed cities like Newark, Camden and Paterson be provided preschool programs, health services and smaller class sizes. The state has the responsibility to provide them rather then leave it up  to the impoverished districts, they wrote.         Ms. Morheuser did not start her professional life at the bar; a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Webster College, she first was a nun. She spent 16 years teaching high school and college around the country, wherever her teaching Roman Catholic order, the Sisters of Loretto, sent her.         Being of a rather radical bent on social issues, she decided that she could achieve more on the outside. She quit the order in 1963 and became an advocate for racial equality in Milwaukee.         In 1973, she received her J.D. at the Rutgers-Newark School of Law. Before she joined the Newark law center she represented such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, the Urban League and the National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Her work attracted many honors, including a Special Achievement Award from the New Jersey Education Association in 1993, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Award from the National Education Association last year. Last May, she was cited as Woman of the Year in Education by the New Jersey League of Women Voters.         Ms. Morheuser is survived by a sister, Marie Casey of St. Louis.       
         Georgia Neese Clark Gray, whose signature -- as Georgia Neese Clark -- appeared on some $30 billion in paper money while she was the first woman to serve as Treasurer of the United States, died on Thursday at the Brewster Place retirement community in Topeka, Kan. She was 95.         President Harry S. Truman chose Mrs. Gray to be Treasurer in 1949, a year the Democratic Party promised a New Deal for women aspiring to high office. She had been a small-town Kansas banker and a Democratic National Committeewoman since 1936. Her confirmation by the Senate was unanimous.         As the nation's 29th Treasurer, she was in charge of all the bills and coins along with Government securities held in the vaults in Washington. The office is a division of the Treasury Department. When Dwight D. Eisenhower became President in 1953 he selected another woman to succeed her, Ivy Baker Priest, a Utah Republican.         Mrs. Gray was a highly visible figure in Democratic Party affairs, including its national conventions. She was an associate of Eleanor Roosevelt, with whom she often shared the speakers' platform.         After serving as a National Committeewoman for 28 years, Mrs. Gray resigned in 1964 to devote herself full time to banking and other business and farming interests.         Georgia Neese was born in Richland, a rural community of about 200 people 15 miles southeast of Topeka, where her father, Albert, had founded the Richland State Bank in 1892.         She received a bachelor's degree in economics from what is now Washburn University of Topeka in 1921. She then studied acting in New York and toured the country with stock companies for 10 years.         Her stage career ended when her father's health faltered and the arrival of talking pictures diminished the appeal of traveling stage troupes. By then she had married George M. Clark, her manager. They were divorced in the mid-1940's.         At her father's death in 1937 she became president of the bank; in 1964 she moved it to Topeka and renamed it the Capital City State Bank.         Her friend and mentor, Harry Truman, helped to dedicate the new bank. "Mrs. Gray is the only United States Treasurer since the Civil War who really worked at her job," he told the crowd. "She knows money affairs as well as any man, and anyone who brings their money here will know it is in charge of someone who knows how to take care of it."         Mrs. Gray was remarried in 1953 to Andrew J. Gray, a former New York and Washington newspaperman and press agent. He died last year. She is survived by a nephew, Ward Keller of Manhattan.       
         Dame Ruth Nita Barrow, the first woman to serve as Governor General of Barbados, died on Tuesday night after a stroke, officials said on Wednesday. She was 79.         Dame Nita was the older sister of the late Prime Minister Errol Barrow, who led Barbados to independence from Britain in 1966. In 1990 she was appointed Governor General, serving as the representative of Queen Elizabeth II.         Before her appointment, Dame Nita, who was a nurse and public health expert, served as the Barbados representative at the United Nations and was previously president of the World Y.W.C.A. as well as the World Council of Churches. She was knighted in 1980.         Dame Nita is survived by two sisters, Sybil Barrow and Ena Comma.         Correction:  December 23, 1995, Saturday         An obituary headline yesterday about Dame Ruth Nita Barrow misstated her position. She was the current Governor General of Barbados, not a former one.       
         Mildred Barry Hughes, who in 1965 was the first woman elected a state senator in New Jersey, died on Jan. 11 at the Cranford (N.J.) Health and Extended Care Center. She was 92 and had lived for many years in Union, N.J.         The cause was a heart attack, said a son, Peter L. Hughes 3d of Annandale, N.J.         First elected to the New Jersey Assembly in 1957, she represented Union Township for four terms before running for the Senate in 1965. In that victory, she also was the first Democrat from Union County to be elected to the State Senate in 75 years.         After writing a handbook for the Elizabeth League of Women Voters, she was persuaded to run for the Assembly. Defeated in her first attempt in 1955, she won in 1957 and rose to become assistant majority leader in 1960 and 1961. She served one term in the Senate.         Her husband, Peter L. Hughes Jr., died in 1971. Besides her son Peter 3d, she is survived by two other sons, W. Barry of Greenwood, S.C., and David J. of Short Hills, N.J.       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy's church, children and grandchildren today celebrated the enduring Catholic faith of the founding mother of a political dynasty at funeral services in the church where she was baptized 104 years ago.         Her last living son, Edward M. Kennedy, eulogized the mother of a President, two Senators and an Ambassador and the grandmother of two United States Representatives and the Lieutenant Governor and a state representative in Maryland, saying, "She was ambitious not only for our success, but for our souls."         "She sustained us in the saddest times -- by her faith in God, which was the greatest gift she gave us -- and by the strength of her character, which was a combination of the sweetest gentleness and the most tempered steel," he said.         Bernard Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston, celebrated the Mass of Resurrection at St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church and said, "Surely, as she herself expressed it, her greatest gift was the gift of faith."         "She treasured it beyond all others," he continued, "and we honor that gift in her as we bring her here to this church."         The Cardinal read a letter of condolence from President Clinton and an apostolic blessing from Pope John Paul II, and called Mrs. Kennedy "a woman of great strength and deep faith, who is unequaled in the way her life was at the service of the commonweal."         "Few lives," he said, "have been so intertwined with the joys and sorrows of our nation's life as have hers."         Mrs. Kennedy, whose sons John and Robert were assassinated, whose son Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. died in a wartime plane explosion, and whose daughter Kathleen was killed in a plane crash, was quoted by her grandson Edward M. Kennedy Jr. as saying in her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974):         "The most important element in human life is faith. If God were to take away all His blessings, health, physical fitness, wealth, intelligence and leave me with but one gift, I would ask for faith -- for with faith in Him and His Goodness, mercy and love for me, and belief in everlasting life, I believe I could suffer the loss of my other gifts and still be happy."         Along with personal friends of Mrs. Kennedy and her children, the congregation of more than 700 included Tipper Gore, the wife of the Vice President, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston and Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, all Democrats. The two most prominent Republicans were Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who has preceded Senator Kennedy in one Senate chairmanship and followed him in another, and Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts.         One absentee who was frequently recalled was Mrs. Kennedy's oldest living daughter, Rosemary, who resides in an institution for the mentally retarded in Wisconsin. Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the next oldest, said, "Mother's intelligence was always informed and directed by the strength and compassion of the heart," exemplified when "she never forgot or let us ignore the company of our sister, Rosemary." Mrs. Shriver told of Rosemary's going with her on her first trip to Europe and of their forging a friendship that became the basis of her work for the disabled and the mentally retarded.         The grandmother's determined jaw was recognizable on many of the dozens of descendants who attended. The service was occasionally punctuated by cries from the youngest of her great-grandchildren who were here.         Mrs. Kennedy's 104 years amounted to just more than half the history of the Republic, and Senator Kennedy said she "was born in 1890, the year of the Battle of Wounded Knee, when Benjamin Harrison was in the White House."         "And she never let us forget that she had lived so much of the history that we only read about," he said.         Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald was baptized in St. Stephen's Church on July 23, 1890, just a day after her birth. She graduated from Dorchester High School and received her diploma in 1906 from her father the Mayor, John F. Fitzgerald, who was known as Honey Fitz. She was courted and wed in 1914 by an ambitious banker, Joseph P. Kennedy.         Both Senator Kennedy and Mrs. Shriver called their mother "our greatest teacher." Mrs. Shriver told of geography quizzes and bedtime stories, and said, "She taught us to listen to Dad's dinner table conversations about politics, which seemed too boring to a small child but later became the basis for our life's work."         This morning Massachusetts drivers stopped in the cold at highway overpasses to watch the motorcade bring her body from her home at Hyannis Port. This afternoon, after the church service, she was buried next to her husband, who died in 1969, in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline.       
         Nora Dunfee, an actress who taught for many years in the graduate acting program of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, died on Dec. 23 at St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was complications after a brief illness, the university's press office reported in a statement.         Ms. Dunfee was born in Belmont, Ohio. She began her professional acting career at the Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Me. Her stage credits included "Madam, Will You Walk?" (1953), "The Midnight Caller" (1958), "The Visit" (1960), "The Last Days of Lincoln" (1961) and "Crowbar" (1990).         She also taught privately in New York and California and coached many actors over the years, including Julie Haydon, James Earl Jones, Raul Julia, Diane Keaton, Mel Gibson and Keanu Reeves. In theater, she was a vocal consultant for "The Real Thing," "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "A Lie of the Mind."         Ms. Dunfee also appeared in films, including "Lorenzo's Oil." Most recently, she was seen in "Forrest Gump," as the Southern Lady who sympathetically advises Tom Hanks at a bus stop.         Ms. Dunfee met her future husband, David Clarke, in an acting class. The couple appeared together in a number of stage productions, including "Portrait of a Lady," "The Visit" and "The Gin Game."         She is survived by her husband; two daughters, K. C. Ligon of New York City and Susan Bennett of Seattle, and two grandchildren.       
         Ada Lublin Goldberg, for many years an advocate for the poor and homeless on Long Island, died Sunday at Hospice-by-the Sea in Boca Raton, Fla. A resident of North Bellmore, L.I., she was 67.         The cause was renal failure stemming from kidney cancer, said her son, Lawrence A. Goldberg.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. Goldberg became active in the League of Women Voters 40 years ago when she joined its Nassau County chapter. At her death, she was the chapter's director of social policy.         In conjunction with her work for the league, she served on the board of the Health and Welfare Council of Nassau County, a coalition of social-welfare agencies and service organizations serving the poor. She received the council's Community Service Award last year.         She also served on the executive board of the Nassau / Suffolk Coalition for a National Health Care Plan. In addition, she was active in the Child Care Council of Nassau County and the Nassau / Suffolk Coalition for the Homeless.         Besides her son, a resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Goldberg is survived by her husband, Stanley; a daughter, Helene of New Haven; two brothers, Howard Lublin of Manhattan and Seldon Lublin of Newburgh, N.Y., and a granddaughter.

         Loyce Houlton, a leader in American regional dance and a choreographer whose works were performed by companies in the United States and Europe, died on Tuesday at United Hospital in St. Paul. She was 70 and lived in Minneapolis.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter, Lise Houlton Gilliland, a former member of American Ballet Theater and the Stuttgart Ballet.         Mrs. Houlton favored a rhapsodic choreographic style that combined ballet with various modern-dance techniques. She created more than 90 works, many of them to contemporary music, and her Minnesota Dance Theater became known for its experimental productions. Ballets by her have also been presented by Dance Theater of Harlem, the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Deutsche Oper Ballet of Berlin.         A tiny and perpetually restless woman, Mrs. Houlton liked to say to students: "Explode! Be voracious in space." Yet for the last two decades of her life, she was in chronic ill health. Undaunted, she once said in an interview that her illness had significantly changed her choreography. "I have more courage now," she declared.         Mrs. Houlton, a native of Duluth, Minn., studied dance at Carleton College and New York University and at several New York ballet and modern-dance schools. After settling in Minneapolis, she founded the Contemporary Dance Playhouse in 1962; seven years later, it was renamed Minnesota Dance Theater. Financial problems in 1986 forced the company to disband. But in the last few years, Mrs. Houlton had attempted to reorganize it, and last summer, it revived two of her important works: her version of Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring," and "Ancient Air," to music by George Crumb, an American composer she particularly admired.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Dr. William Houlton; three sons, Laif, Joel and Andrew, and four grandchildren, all of Minneapolis, and two sisters, Jewell Kraemer of Wausau, Wis., and Ardeth Becher of St. Paul.       
         Marjorie Kahn Unterberg, a philanthropist and volunteer in the health care field, died yesterday at Lennox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan and Tinton Falls, N.J.         The cause was complications after surgery, said her daughter, Mary A. DeBare of Manhattan.         Until her death, Mrs. Unterberg was active in a nursing scholarship program at Monmouth College in Long Branch, N.J. She was former president of the School of Nursing at Monmouth Medical Center, where she established the Center for Nursing Excellence, an educational program. She was also a former vice president of the board of governors at the medical center.         Mrs. Unterberg was the widow of Clarence E. Unterberg, founder of the Wall Street brokerage firm of C. E. Unterberg, Towbin. He died in 1987.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Thomas I. Unterberg of Manhattan, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Maggie Kuhn, who called herself a little old woman and celebrated her forced retirement in 1970 by founding the Gray Panthers, died yesterday at the home she shared in Philadelphia with a like-minded coterie. She was 89.         "She died peacefully in her sleep," said her personal assistant, Sue Leary, who could not say which of Miss Kuhn's many ailments, from arthritis to osteoporosis, had caused her death.         For all Miss Kuhn's ailments, none had slowed her down. She spent the last 25 years leading people young and old in the fight against age discrimination and other forms of what she saw as social injustice and stereotypical thinking and just two weeks ago she had joined striking transit workers on their picket line.         Even so, there was some evidence that Miss Kuhn knew that the end was coming. Although she had made it her goal to live until her 90th birthday, in August, she had allowed her friends and admirers to celebrate it on April 1. And in a recent issue of the Gray Panthers' publication, The Network, she had lectured the organization's 40,000 members in 32 states on the need to prepare for the 21st century.         It was hardly the first time Miss Kuhn had been ahead of her time.         It was in 1970 that Miss Kuhn, who had worked 25 years for the United Presbyterian Church in New York, commuting daily from her home in Philadelphia, reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 and was forced to leave her job.         "They gave me a sewing machine," she once recalled, "but I never opened it. I was too busy."         Within months of her retirement, she joined several friends in founding an organization quickly dubbed the Gray Panthers, a name derived from the radical Black Panthers.         Despite the name and the initial emphasis on championing the elderly, as conceived by Miss Kuhn the organization knew no age boundaries. Its credo described it simply as an advocate for "fundamental social change that would eliminate injustice, discrimination and oppression in our present society."         For example, in addition to seeking a ban on mandatory retirement, which was eventually enacted into law, the group called for "publicly owned and democratically controlled" utilities.         No one who knew Miss Kuhn was surprised that in last year's health care debate her organization championed what was widely seen as the most radical of the various proposals: health insurance paid totally by the government, a position that had been on the Gray Panthers' official agenda since 1977.         A tiny woman who wore her hair in a prim bun that gave her the look of an ideal candidate to be helped across the street by a Boy Scout, Miss Kuhn, who detested the term "senior citizen," made no apologies for her looks or her age.         "I'm an old woman," she told The New York Times in 1972. "I have gray hair, many wrinkles and arthritis in both hands. And I celebrate my freedom from bureaucratic restraints that once held me."         Miss Kuhn, whose opposition to the war in Vietnam made her a hero to many young protesters, had a disarming argument in recruiting younger people to her cause: "Everyone of us is growing old."         Known as an inspirational speaker, Miss Kuhn was just as persuasive in private conversation, combining honey with the hammer.         "Forceful, yet gracious" is the way Miss Leary put it yesterday.         Miss Kuhn was a champion of social causes long before the Gray Panthers.         As she noted in her 1991 autobiography, "No Stone Unturned," (Ballantine) she was conceived in Memphis, where her father, a traveling district manage for Dunn & Bradstreet, was working at the time. But her mother, refusing to deliver a child into a racist society, insisted on returning to her home in Buffalo to give birth.         As a student at Flora Stone Mather College of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Miss Kuhn helped organize a college chapter of the League of Women Voters.         And in a succession of jobs as a manager of social programs for the Young Women's Christian Association in Cleveland, Philadelphia and Boston and in similar work with the Presbyterian Church in New York, Miss Kuhn took what were then unconventional positions on issues like peace and social justice.         Miss Kuhn, who could also be somewhat unconventional in her private life, attributed the fact that she had never married to "sheer luck."         According to her book, she had many love affairs, including one in her 70's with a student in his 20's. Miss Kuhn did not identify him, but Christina Long, who helped her with the book, said the man, now in his 40's, was at the recent birthday gala. "He seemed very proud of the romance," she said.         Miss Kuhn leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Marion Lounsbury Foster, who was for many years a social services administrator with the Disaster Staff of the American Red Cross, specializing in public and private emergencies, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, Conn.         She was 97 and a longtime resident of New York City.         Beginning in 1917, Mrs. Foster was for 40 years the director of the Home Service Department of the Red Cross's Brooklyn chapter, finding help in times of need for the families of men and women in the armed forces and aid for people in distress after floods, storms, train wrecks and much smaller crises.         In 1931, her office provided Easter dresses to wives of disabled World War I veterans. And in 1938, she directed case workers in aiding victims of a disastrous hurricane that struck Long Island, providing services and financial relief to thousands of families.         Mrs. Foster, who retired in 1957, was also a founder and treasurer of the Brooklyn Association for Mental Health.         She was born in New York City and graduated from the Brearley School, Columbia University and the New York School of Social Work.         Her husband, William Jenkins Foster, died in 1958. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Isabel Leighton Bunker, whose long career as an actress and writer embraced theater, journalism and television, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.         The cause was a stroke, said Evan H. Rhodes, her son-in-law.         Miss Leighton began her career in the theater, appearing in several Broadway productions in the early 1920's. She went on to collaborate on six plays that were produced on Broadway, including "Mercenary Mary" (1925) and "Spring Again" (1941). The latter, which she wrote with Bertram Bloch, starred Grace George, C. Aubrey Smith and Joseph Buloff.         In the 1930's and 40's she wrote for various magazines and for the North American Newspaper Alliance, and served as a naval correspondent in World War II. She was the author or co-author of several books, including "My Boy Franklin," about Franklin D. Roosevelt, written with Gabrielle Forbush, and "Where Away," written with George Sessions Perry, the story of the World War II cruiser Marblehead.         She was the editor of "The Aspirin Age, 1919-41," a best-selling collection of articles -- by John Lardner, Howard Fast and others -- about life in the United States between the World Wars.         In the early 1950's she was moderator of a popular television program called "How Did They get That Way?," which dealt with psychiatry and mental health. She also served on the boards of several civic and philanthropic organizations, including the World Federation for Mental Health and the Menninger Foundation.         Miss Leighton's husband, Arthur H. Bunker, died in 1963. No immediate family members survive.       
         Vita R. Ostrander, a former president of the American Association of Retired Persons who helped make the health care system a major national issue a decade before last year's debate on overhauling it, died on Tuesday at Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta. She was 72 and lived in suburban Decatur.         Her family said she had a heart attack while recovering from back surgery.         Mrs. Ostrander was a member of the A.A.R.P.'s board from 1976 to 1988 and its president for two of those years, 1984-86. She had earned those unpaid positions through her volunteer work in Georgia as an advocate for the elderly, and during her dozen years on the board gained a reputation as an effective advocate both inside and outside the huge organization, which now claims 33 million members.         "She really brought us into health care," the current president, Eugene Lehrmann, said yesterday, recalling that she had often built support for her views even as she formed them, in informal chats with fellow board members.         When the association, under her prodding, spoke out in favor of fee controls and a combination of private insurance and Government subsidies to pay for prescription drugs and catastrophic illnesses, it was often Mrs. Ostrander who did the speaking.         In an organization that likes to precycle as well as recycle its executive talent, Mrs. Ostrander was a representative at news conferences during her two years as president-elect, testified at Congressional hearings during her two years as president and continued to speak out during her two years as "immediate past president," an official association position.         Not one to shrink from confrontation, she once told a meeting of the American Medical Association that high costs had created a form of rationing of health care. And when she served on a Federal advisory panel that made only a vague reference to a need for Government subsidies in a report stressing the role of private insurance in protecting Americans against catastrophic medical costs, Mrs. Ostrander issued a stinging dissent, chiding her fellow panelists for obscuring a need for Government participation.         A native of Utica, N.Y., where her father operated a bakery, Mrs. Ostrander, whose maiden name was Romano, received a nursing degree from the University of Buffalo and spent 10 years as a Red Cross executive before settling in Atlanta and becoming a full-time volunteer on issues involving the elderly.         She is survived by her husband, Gladding, a retired Red Cross executive; a daughter, Sylvia Lucas of Columbia, S.C., and three grandchildren.

         Ellen Hermanson, a crusader in the battle against breast cancer, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 42 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         The disease was diagnosed in Ms. Hermanson in 1989, six months after the birth of her only daughter, Leora. She became actively involved in breast cancer issues by organizing survivor groups and speaking at national conferences and regional workshops.         Last November, Ms. Hermanson delivered a paper on the struggle to live with cancer pain to the annual National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship assembly in Washington. It was at this assembly that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the United States Supreme Court spoke for the first time about her own experience with breast cancer.         In 1991, Ms. Hermanson helped found the Jewish Healing Center in New York, an organization that provides spiritual assistance to people coping with serious illnesses. As editor of the center's quarterly newsletter, The Out-Stretched Arm, Ms. Hermanson published articles on breast cancer, support groups and health-care workshops. The center now has offices in New York and San Francisco.         In 1992, Judith Kaye, Chief Judge of New York State, appointed Ms. Hermanson the first executive director of the Judges and Lawyers Breast Cancer Alert. The group promotes breast cancer awareness and provides education and legal services.         Ms. Hermanson was also an active member of the national board of the National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship, which provides support to cancer survivors, their friends and families and health care providers. She edited the coalition's quarterly newsletter, Networker.         Ms. Hermanson was most recently working on a project to let breast cancer survivors and their families communicate over the Internet. She was also editor of the Sloan-Kettering Annual Report.         Ms. Hermanson was born in Belmont, Mass., in 1952. She graduated from Connecticut College with honors in 1974 and received a master's degree in journalism from New York University in 1978.         She is survived by her husband, Hugo Mareno and her daughter of Manhattan; her parents, Harlow and Roslyn Hermanson of Belmont, and two sisters, Emily Hermanson Levin of Great Neck, L.I., and Julie Hermanson Ratner of New York City.         Correction:  April 13, 1995, Thursday         An obituary yesterday about Ellen Hermanson, an advocate for survivors of breast cancer, misspelled her husband's name. He is Hugo Moreno, not Mareno. The obituary also misstated her residence. She lived in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The article also misstated the name of a group whose board she served on. It is the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, not the National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship.
