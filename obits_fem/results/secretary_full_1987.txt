        Margaret Scolari Barr, an art historian and teacher who was the wife and assistant of Alfred H. Barr, the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, died of cancer of the colon yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Margaret Scolari Barr, an art historian and teacher who was the wife and assistant of Alfred H. Barr, the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, died of cancer of the colon yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The diversity of Mrs. Barr's talents and the force of her personality made her a presence in the New York art world for half a century.         She was the author of ''Medardo Rosso (1858-1928),'' a monograph on the Italian modernist sculptor that was published by the Museum of Modern Art in 1963.         She taught art history for 37 years at the Spence School, where she inspired many future scholars, including Joan R. Mertens, curator of Greek and Roman art at the Metropolitan Museum.         Mrs. Barr was fluent in French, Italian, Spanish and German and was crucially involved in her husband's curatorial activities and in the wartime effort to provide refuge in the United States for European artists. 'An Essential Partner'         ''Marga was a remarkable person who was an essential partner in the achievements and legacy of Alfred Barr,'' said Richard E. Oldenburg, the director of the Modern. ''A gifted art historian with a fine sense of quality, she was also very intelligent, strong-willed and intensely honest about everything and everyone, including herself.''         ''The book on Rosso is still the best work on him in English,'' said Hilton Kramer, the editor of The New Criterion, whose issue last summer, ''Our Campaigns,'' was devoted to Mrs. Barr's biographical chronicle of the years 1930 to 1944, the turbulent period when Mr. Barr helped shape the Museum of Modern Art. Mr. Barr died in 1981 at the age of 79.         ''She was a very gifted linguist, and Alfred was not,'' Mr. Kramer said. ''So all of his dealings with Picasso, Matisse, Miro and virtually all non-English-speaking European artists were done with her as the interpreter. Neither of his two most important books, on Picasso and Matisse, could have been possible without her.''         Mr. Barr's monograph ''Picasso: Fifty Years of His Art,'' published in 1946, was dedicated to her.         ''I grew up in awe of Alfred and Margaret,'' said Anne d'Harnoncourt, the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, whose father, Rene d'Harnoncourt, was director of the Museum of Modern Art from 1949 to 1968. ''I think the remarkable thing about Margaret was her emphasis. She made everyone else, including me, feel fuzzy and vague. She had a real gift for drawing your attention and not letting it go.'' Born in Rome         Margaret Scolari was born in Rome in 1901. Her mother, Mary Fitzmaurice, was Irish. Her father, Virgilio Scolari, was an Italian antiques dealer. At the University of Rome from 1919 to 1922, she specialized in humanistic and linguistic studies.         She came to the United States in 1925 and taught Italian at Vassar, from which she also received a master's degree in art history.         In September 1929 she moved to New York City, where she studied art history at New York University. Late in the year, at the inaugural exhibition of the Museum of Modern Art, she met Alfred Barr.         They were married in Paris in 1930. In a profile on Alfred Barr in The New Yorker in 1953, Dwight Macdonald wrote: ''The day after the wedding, Barr started out to borrow pictures for a forthcoming Corot-Daumier show, with Mrs. Barr acting as his translator and secretary. They continued the arrangement through the thirties, going abroad almost every summer to beg and borrow pictures for the next year's exhibitions.''         During World War II, Mrs. Barr was involved in the Emergency Rescue Committee (now the International Rescue Committee), which was responsible for helping artists like Jacques Lipchitz, Piet Mondrian, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy and Andre Masson to leave Europe. Translations and Chronology         Mrs. Barr translated Charles Rufus Morey's catalogue of the Vatican Library's Museo Christiano into Italian. She also made the first complete English translation of Matisse's ''Notes of a Painter.''         At the time of her death she was working on the chronology of her life with her husband.         In the introduction to her art history course at Spence, where she taught from 1943 to 1980, Mrs. Barr wrote:         ''I spend no time defining what is art, you'll soon know. Not all of it is, at first sight, beautiful; little of it is pretty; all of it is interesting. And the more you know about a work of art - what preceded it, what followed it, the reasons why it is the way it is - the more it will come to life for you. The tourist who goes through museums exclaiming, 'Beautiful, Beautiful,' is something to be deplored. You jolly well must know why.         ''Now plan to enjoy yourselves. As Poussin, the great French painter of the 17th century, remarked, 'Le fin de l'art est la delectation,' '' - ''The goal of art is delight.''         Mrs. Barr is survived by a daughter, Victoria, a painter who lives in New York City.         A memorial service will be held at 4 P.M. on Jan. 12 at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, 921 Madison Avenue, at 73d Street.       
        Sarah Goddard Power, New York City's deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights and social affairs in 1980 and 1981, died in a fall Tuesday from Burton Tower on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was 52 years old and lived in Ann Arbor.         Sarah Goddard Power, New York City's deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights and social affairs in 1980 and 1981, died in a fall Tuesday from Burton Tower on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was 52 years old and lived in Ann Arbor.         The authorities said they believed her fall from the eighth floor of the 212-foot tower was a suicide.         Mrs. Power, an activist for women's rights and world peace, had been a member of the University of Michigan Board of Regents since 1974.         Her husband, Philip, is chairman of the Surburban Communications Corporation in Livonia, Mich., the publisher of 50 newspapers in the Detroit and Cincinnati areas. His family gave $3.9 million to build the Power Center for the Performing Arts on the Ann Arbor campus.         The university's president, Harold T. Shapiro, said yesterday that Mrs. Power's death was ''a great loss for the university, for the state and for those committed to more progressive social policy.'' Michigan's Governor, James J. Blanchard, called her a ''brilliant and vibrant caring person committed to women's rights and equality.''         From 1966 to 1969, Mrs. Power was executive director of the New York City Commission for the United Nations and Consular Corps in the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay. She also was executive assistant on Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's personal staff from 1959 to 1963.         She was born in Detroit and was graduated from Vassar College. She also received a diploma in French at the Alliance Francaise in Paris and a master's degree in politics and international relations from New York University in 1965.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Power is survived by a son, Nathan E., at home; her mother, Katharine R. Goddard, of Ann Arbor; a sister, Margery G. Whiteman, of Albany, and two brothers, Russel H. Goddard, of New Haven, and Wendell H. Goddard, of Berkeley, Calif.         Correction:  March 28, 1987, Saturday, Late City Final Edition       
        Margaret Harrison, who served for 20 years as personal secretary to Arthur Hays Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times from 1935 to 1961, died Tuesday at her home in New York City after a long illness. She was 72 years old.         Margaret Harrison, who served for 20 years as personal secretary to Arthur Hays Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times from 1935 to 1961, died Tuesday at her home in New York City after a long illness. She was 72 years old.         Miss Harrison, the daughter of the late Floyd and Henrietta Harrison of New York City, was a graduate of the Madeira School in Greenway, Va., and Smith College in Northampton, Mass., and was the director of volunteers for the British War Relief Society during World War II.         She was Mr. Sulzberger's secretary from 1948 until his death in 1968, then served as secretary to his widow, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, until last year.         There are no survivors. A funeral service is to be held at 10 A.M. Tuesday at St. Ignatius Loyola Roman Catholic Church, 980 Park Avenue, at 84th Street.       
        Raya Dunayevskaya, an author who was secretary to Leon Trotsky, died Tuesday in Sheridan Road Hospital, Chicago. A resident of Evanston, Ill., she was 77 years old.         Raya Dunayevskaya, an author who was secretary to Leon Trotsky, died Tuesday in Sheridan Road Hospital, Chicago. A resident of Evanston, Ill., she was 77 years old.         Miss Dunayevskaya was the author of four books, including ''Marxism and Freedom, From 1776 Until Today,'' published in 1958, an anti-Communist study of the American roots of Marxism.         Born in Russia, she was brought to America at the age of 12. She became a secretary to Trotsky, the exiled Russian war minister, from 1937 to 1939. Trotsky was assassinated near Mexico City in 1940.         She was a translator into English of works by Marx and Lenin. She lived in Detroit from 1953 to 1984. A collection of her papers is housed in the Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs of the Walter P. Reuther Library of Wayne State University in Detroit.         Although married, she did not use the name of her husband, John Dwyer of Evanston, who survives. Also surving are two sisters, Bessie Gogol and Sonia Spiegel, both of Los Angeles.       
        Pola Negri, a tempestuous green-eyed vamp of the silent screen who tantalized audiences with her on- and off-camera romances, died Saturday at Northeast Baptist Hospital in San Antonio. She was 88 years old and lived in San Antonio.         Pola Negri, a tempestuous green-eyed vamp of the silent screen who tantalized audiences with her on- and off-camera romances, died Saturday at Northeast Baptist Hospital in San Antonio. She was 88 years old and lived in San Antonio.         Miss Negri was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia last week, hospital officials said yesterday. Her physician, Dr. Houston Wade, said she had been diagnosed two years ago as having a brain tumor. She decided not to undergo treatment, he said.         There were believed to be no survivors.  ----  Most Exotic of Stars         The 1920's and 30's were the Age of the Vamp in the movies, and of all the screen vamps, Pola Negri was, unquestionably, the most colorful, the most exotic, the most mysterious.         The Polish-born Miss Negri was a startlingly beautiful woman, with skin as delicately white as fine porcelain, jet black hair and flashing dark-green eyes.         Her off-screen life was more tempestuous than any role she ever played and, although she often insisted that she wished only to be left alone, she could shrewdly maneuver her love affairs and feuds into avalanches of personal publicity.         Men found her fascinating. She married two noblemen and divorced both. She was the mistress and fiancee of Charles Chaplin, whom she jilted in a whirl of headlines. She was living openly with Rudolph Valentino, the romantic idol of millions of women the world over, at the time of his death in 1926. And Adolf Hitler was so taken with her that he personally intervened to countermand an order, issued by the Nazis on the ground that they thought Miss Negri was part-Jewish, forbidding her to work in Germany.         The temperamental star flourished in the long-gone era of the flamboyant screen siren, competing for roles and popularity with such other stars as Gloria Swanson and Theda Bara. Festooned in Diamonds         Whenever she appeared in public, she was festooned in diamonds and pearl brooches from her $1 million collection, acquired cut-rate from Hapsburgs and Hohenzollerns who could no longer afford them. She popularized painted toenails in the mid-20's, and when she took to wearing turbans, or appeared in high boots, thousands of American women slavishly copied her.         She maintained a mansion in Beverly Hills, a villa on the Riviera and a chateau north of Paris, and just before the crash of 1929 her personal fortune was estimated at $5 million. She lost most of her money and possessions, however, and spent her last years living in elegant simplicity in San Antonio.         In ''Memoirs of a Star,'' published in 1970, Miss Negri wrote that she was born in Lipno, Poland, on New Year's Eve, 1899. (Other sources, however, give the date as three to five years earlier.) Her mother was the former Eleanora de Kielczeska, from a family of impoverished nobility; her father was Jerzy Mathias-Chalupec, a Slovak immigrant.         Miss Negri's two sisters died in childhood. Her father was arrested by Czarist troops in 1905 for revolutionary activity in what was then Russian Poland. He was sent to prison and, although he was ultimately released, he did not return to his wife and daughter.         Miss Negri's mother had to go to work as a cook to maintain a one-room apartment in a Warsaw slum and earn enough money to send Pola to the Imperial Ballet School. Pola's first public performance was in the role of a cygnet in ''Swan Lake,'' with the Imperial Ballet. Illness Ended Dance Career         Her dancing career ended when she was 13 years old, however, because she contracted tuberculosis and had to be sent to a sanitarium. Pronounced cured a year later, she returned to Warsaw and was admitted for study at the Imperial Academy of Dramatic Arts after falsely stating she was 17. It was at that time that she adopted her stage name - Pola, the diminutive of her given name, Apolonia, and Negri, after Ada Negri, an Italian poet whom she admired.         She was one of Poland's leading actresses when she was 17, at which time she made her first movie, a two-reeler called ''Slaves of Sin.'' In 1918 she went to Berlin to perform a leading role in Max Reinhardt's pantomime ''Sumurun,'' which was later filmed as her third full-length movie.         Miss Negri's roles in her first two pictures, ''The Eyes of the Mummy Ma'' and ''Carmen,'' typed her as the man-ruining vamp. She took time out from her career in 1919 to be the wife, briefly, of Count Eugene Dambski, a Polish army career officer, then returned to Berlin to make films. ''Madame Du Barry,'' released in the United States under the title ''Passion,'' won her a Paramount Pictures contract and she was brought here in 1922.         During the Atlantic crossing, Miss Negri's agent scolded her for spending most of her time in her cabin. ''Make a few appearances,'' he said. ''Think of the publicity.''         ''I am thinking of it,'' she replied. ''We will get more publicity this way. I have already learned that the fewer appearances you make, the more they will talk about you. All you have to do is to say you want to be alone - and the whole world thinks you are exotic and glamorous. It never occurs to them that you are simply tired.'' Feud With Swanson         In Hollywood, while carefully limiting her public appearances, Miss Negri, with equal assiduity, cultivated several headlined feuds, most notably with Gloria Swanson, her rival at Paramount. (The leading ladies once had a cat fight using real cats.) Miss Negri's Hollywood films were not artistic landmarks, but most were extremely successful at the box office. Among them were ''Belle Donna'' (1923), her first American movie; ''The Cheat'' (1923); ''Men'' (1924); ''The Spanish Dancer'' (1923); ''Shadows of Paris'' (1924); ''East of Suez'' (1925) and ''Forbidden Paradise'' (1924). At the height of her popularity, she was so much in demand that she ground out five pictures in a single year.         However, she always seemed able to find time for romance. Her first big headlined Hollywood affair was with Charlie Chaplin, who in 1964 wrote in his autobiography that the relationship was essentially one of the pursued (Chaplin) and the pursuer (Negri). In her own memoirs Miss Negri observed tartly:         ''A great deal has been written about my relationship with Charlie Chaplin. Unfortunately, much of it has been written by Mr. Chaplin. Still less fortunately, what he wrote was largely untrue. Rather than say he behaved in less than a gentlemanly fashion, I would prefer to excuse him on the grounds that all clowns live in a world of fantasy.''         Miss Negri went on to say that her relationship with Mr. Chaplin had been intimate and stormy, that he was an inept lover, that he proposed marriage and that finally she ended the affair, over Mr. Chaplin's tearful entreaties. Her Greatest Love         According to Miss Negri, the greatest love of her life was Rudolph Valentino. On their second meeting, she wrote in her memoirs, she found him so passionately overpowering that on that very night they became lovers and remained so for nearly a year, until his death in 1926.         Valentino, called by his adoring public ''The Great Lover,'' was indeed the great lover, she wrote, capable of making such romantic gestures as sprinkling rose petals on the bed before they retired. He could also be quite prosaic. For example, he often wept because he was losing his hair, and sometimes the sex symbol of American women preferred making spaghetti for Miss Negri to making love to her.         After collapsing at Valentino's funeral in New York, Miss Negri took his body back to California by train, stopping at dozens of stations along the way so that hysterical Valentino-worshipers could pay him tribute. She was accused of using the cortege to garner personal publicity, and, true or not, soon afterward her popularity at the box office waned. When her contract came up for renewal, she found she was no longer wanted at Paramount.         Her standing with the Valentino cult was forever shattered when, in 1927, less than a year after Valentino's death, Miss Negri was married to Serge Mdivani, an impecunious Georgian prince, and took him to live in her chateau in France. They were divorced in 1931, after Miss Negri had lost the bulk of her fortune through, she later wrote, her husband's mismanagement of her affairs during the stock-market crisis. Went to Berlin in 1935         After the indifferent reception to her first talkie, ''A Woman Commands,'' Miss Negri in 1935 fled Hollywood for Berlin, where she made pictures until the outbreak of World War II. For a time she was prohibited from working by Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, who put her name on a list of suspected ''non-Aryans.''         Hitler, who was said to be so fond of her German-made movie about mother love, ''Mazurka,'' that he had it run weekly so he could have a good cry, personally overruled Goebbels. Shortly after, newspapers in Europe and the United States printed reports of a romance between Hitler and Miss Negri. She sued the French magazine that initiated the reports and won a 10,000-franc judgment.         Miss Negri, who was living on the Riviera when Germany invaded France, returned to the United States in 1941. Two years later she played a featured comedy role in ''Hi Diddle Diddle,'' but no other film offers were forthcoming.         By the end of the war, she was reduced to living in one room in a small hotel in New York and selling off her jewelry to survive. Ultimately, she recovered some money and property tied up in Europe during the war.         From 1948 to 1963, Miss Negri lived in California and Texas with Margaret L. West, who bequeathed her property in San Antonio. In recent years Miss Negri lived in a duplex apartment in San Antonio, attended by a maid, a chauffeur and a secretary.         Miss Negri made her last attempted comeback in ''The Moonspinners,'' a Walt Disney film released in 1964. As production on the movie began in London in 1963, she proved she had not lost her knack for finding a bizarre gimmick sure to give her headlines. For her first press conference, she entered the room with a frisky cheetah on a leash.       
        Norma B. Watson, one of the first women to serve in the Marine Corps, died on Aug. 8 at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Coatesville, Pa., after a stroke. She was 90 years old and lived in Scullville, N.J.         Norma B. Watson, one of the first women to serve in the Marine Corps, died on Aug. 8 at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Coatesville, Pa., after a stroke. She was 90 years old and lived in Scullville, N.J.         She was one of a group of women who enlisted in the Marines in 1918 to free men for combat duty. The ''marinettes,'' as they were referred to unofficially, were assigned to clerical duties. She was assigned as a secretary to a Philadelphia recruiting officer.         A similar group of women who served in the Navy in World War I were referred to as ''yeomanettes,'' and Mrs. Watson's oldest sister was serving at the time with that group.         A Marine Corps honor guard attended Mrs. Watson's burial Thursday at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill, Pa.         Mrs. Watson, who was born in Philadelphia, worked for almost 40 years for B. Altman & Company department store in Manhattan. Before that she was a designer of women's knitwear products. She had also been a set designer and actress with a theatrical group in Brooklyn called the Neighborhood Players.         She is survived by two sons, James of Schwenksville, Pa., and Dirk of Tenafly, N.J.; a sister, Dorothy C. Parker of Fort Washington, Pa.; seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
        Nina Raditsa, a retired professor of languages at Fairleigh Dickinson University and an officer of the International League for Human Rights, died of a heart attack Friday at her summer home in Strada Inchinti, a suburb of Florence. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Nina Raditsa, a retired professor of languages at Fairleigh Dickinson University and an officer of the International League for Human Rights, died of a heart attack Friday at her summer home in Strada Inchinti, a suburb of Florence. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Raditsa taught French and English at Fairleigh Dickinson for many years, retiring in 1977. She was secretary for the International League for Human Rights in New York. The league was founded by Roger Baldwin, with whom Mrs. Raditsa worked closely for many years.         Mrs. Raditsa was born in Turin, Italy, the daughter of Guglielmo Ferrero, an Italian historian and anti-Facist exiled by Mussolini, and of Gina Lombroso Ferrero. Mrs. Raditsa was educated in Italy and came here in the 40's.         Surviving are her husband, Dr. Bogdon Raditsa, a former Yugoslav diplomat and journalist; a son, Dr. Leo, of Annapolis, Md.; a daughter, Bosa, of Manhattan, and a grandson.       
        Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         She was widely known as the sharp-tongued wife of one of the nation's most influential publishers, Henry R. Luce, whose magazines included Time, Life and Sports Illustrated.         But she won fame on her own as magazine writer and editor, author of ''The Women'' and other hit plays, controversial Republican member of the House of Representatives from Connecticut, and, finally, in the Eisenhower Administration, a hardworking and often praised Ambassador to Italy.         She had enough careers to satisfy the ambitions of several women, but none tied her down for long. She was often on lists of the world's 10 most admired women, but her glamorous existence and tart tongue drew criticism, sometimes partisan, sometimes envious.         Clare Boothe was born in New York City on April 10, 1903, the daughter of William Franklin Boothe, a pit orchestra violinist and sometime businessman, and the former Anna Clara Snyder, who had been a chorus girl. The child was christened Ann Clare, but she never used the Ann. When Parents Separated         Her parents separated when Clare was 8 years old. She was brought up in genteel poverty by her mother, who still managed to take her to France for a year and send her to the Cathedral School of St. Mary in Garden City, L.I., and the Castle School at Tarrytown-on-Hudson, N.Y. In 1919, her mother married Dr. Albert Elmer Austin, a prominent physician in Greenwich, Conn. On a trip to Europe in 1920, the 18-year-old Clare met Elsa Maxwell among other social figures. ''I'll have her to one of my parties,'' Miss Maxwell said. ''Whatever happens then, she'll get a rich husband.''         That happened, but not because of a Maxwell party. Clare Boothe met her future husband in church: George Tuttle Brokaw, millionaire-playboy son of a clothing manufacturer.         They married in 1923 in a wedding called ''the most important social event of the season.'' It was not to last. Mr. Brokaw, 23 years older than his bride, was a heavy drinker, according to one of his biographers, and was prone to abuse his wife. After six years of marriage she won a divorce on grounds of mental cruelty and was awarded $425,000 plus education expenses for her daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw. The Job at Vanity Fair         Declining to rest on her money, Clare Boothe importuned a society friend, Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue and Vanity Fair, for a job. After proving she was not another idle society matron whiling away her time between husbands, she did a stint writing photo captions for Vogue.         Vanity Fair's editor, Frank Crowninshield, hired her after demanding that she draw up a list of 100 ideas. She rose quickly to assistant editor and wrote satirical pieces about society that were later collected in a book, ''Stuffed Shirts.''         Her penthouse apartment on East 57th Street, Manhattan, drew the social, artistic and political types who peopled Vanity Fair's pages. She became managing editor, injecting more political material in an effort to revive the magazine. She left in 1934.         She had written three plays, none produced. She once said reading the plays of George Bernard Shaw was the impetus for her interest in the theater. Much later she met Shaw and is said to have gushed, ''Except for you, I wouldn't be here.'' Shaw supposedly replied, ''And now, let me see, dear child, what was your mother's name?''         Her first produced play, ''Abide with Me,'' in 1935, was unanimously deemed a disaster. It concerned a drunken, sadistic husband who is shot in the last act. Several critics commented on how quickly she responded to almost indiscernible cries of ''Author.'' She never went to another opening night. Sparks at First Sight of Luce         Two days after the opening, the author became the wife of Henry R. Luce, publisher of Time and Fortune. The two independent personalities had struck sparks on their first meeting, when they were seated together at a dinner party and Mr. Luce ignored her.         The next time they met, at a party at the Waldorf-Astoria, his future wife resolved to pay Mr. Luce back by asking rude questions. This time he was enthralled by her. He ordered her to accompany him to the Waldorf's lobby, where he said, ''You are the great love of my life, and some day I'm going to marry you.''         The marriage lasted, although there were rumored difficulties - perhaps inevitable in a marriage between two such strongminded personalities. She had her separate careers and Mr. Luce had his magazines - Life, the picture magazine, was reportedly her idea. The Successful Plays         Mrs. Luce returned to writing plays and with ''The Women,'' in 1936, recovered admirably from her maiden flop on Broadway. The play was an apotheosis of feminine bitchiness, concerning a devoted wife, the only sympathetic character, trying to win back her husband, who had been poached by a saleswoman. It earned her $2 million.         In 1938, Mrs. Luce was represented by ''Kiss the Boys Goodbye,'' a satire on the hoopla surrounding the search for the feminine lead in the movie of ''Gone With the Wind.'' It was a box-office success, as was her next play, ''Margin for Error,'' which purveyed a modish anti-Nazism.         With World War II, Mrs. Luce sought to involve herself on a larger stage. In February 1940, she sailed for Europe as an accredited correspondent for Life for a firsthand look at the war. One result was a book, ''Europe in the Spring.'' Dorothy Parker called it ''All Clare on the Western Front.''         In 1943 Mrs. Luce decided to run for the House of Representatives from Fairfield County, Conn. Criticism of Roosevelt         Despite her friendships with early New Dealers, she was by now a Republican and made speeches critical of the Roosevelt Administration's handling of the war effort. Riding an off-year tide of anti-Administration sentiment, she defeated a Democratic incumbent by 7,000 votes.         In her first speech in the House, she attacked a proposal by Vice President Henry A. Wallace calling for postwar freedom of the air. Mrs. Luce wrapped up the Wallace proposal in a single word, ''globaloney.'' In Congress she frequently spoke out on foreign policy as well as for racial equality in the armed forces and war production.         Despite her own brief infatuation with Communism in the 1930's, Mrs. Luce emerged as an early hardline anti-Communist (although as early as 1964 she was calling for more normal relations with China).         She won re-election in 1944, campaigning with fire but concealing sorrow. Her 19-year-old daughter was killed in an automobile accident that year. A Jesuit priest put her in touch with the Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, who was becoming known for his broadcasts. Before Sheen had talked three minutes, she demanded, ''Listen, if God is good, why did He take my daughter?''         ''In order that you might be here in the faith,'' Sheen replied. Became a Catholic         Their sessions, with Mrs. Luce arguing and Sheen explaining, resulted in her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1946. After that a friend noticed a gradual change in her: ''Twenty years ago she was like a diamond - beautiful, brilliant and cold. Now she is beautiful, brilliant and compassionate. She has become a kind and remarkably unselfish woman.''         Because of personal problems and long separations from her husband that her duties entailed, Mrs. Luce did not seek re-election in 1946. She remained politically active, in addition to writing a column for McCall's, and in 1952 she campaigned for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.         He offered her the post of Secretary of Labor, but she demurred. He then named her Ambassador to Italy, stirring controversy because of Mrs. Luce's Catholicism, her lack of diplomatic experience and because she was a woman.         But she waded into her job with customary energy and contempt for obstacles. She helped lay the diplomatic groundwork for an international conference that worked out a compromise on the status of Trieste, a dispute that threatened war between Yugoslavia and Italy. Effective Diplomacy         She made strongly anti-Communist speeches and warned of cutoffs of American aid to Italian industry: Communists dominated the labor unions. She drew fire from leftists.  Once her chauffeur misunderstood her directions and took her to the residence of President Giovanni Gronchi. Unable to back out, Mrs. Luce, whose relations with the President had been somewhat strained, took the occasion to persuade him to permit the stationing of American troops on Italian soil.         In Italy she caught a mysterious illness finally diagnosed as arsenic poisoning. The Central Intelligence Agency was called in. The cause was paint dust from her bedroom ceiling. A Controversy Over Brazil         In 1959 she was nominated Ambassador to Brazil. A determined one-man opposition to her appointment was mounted in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. Mrs. Luce was confirmed both by the committee and the Senate, but she could not resist a final jab at Morse.         ''My difficulties, of course, go back some years,'' she said, ''when Senator Morse was kicked in the head by a horse.'' (He was once kicked by a horse, but not in the head.) In the resultant furor, Eisenhower defended her while Mr. Luce publicly urged her to resign, which she did.         In 1964 she announced that she was running for the Senate in New York State as a Conservative Party candidate and supporter of Senator Barry Goldwater, whose nomination for President she had seconded at the Republican convention. Under pressure from the party's liberal wing and finally Senator Goldwater himself, she withdrew from the race on the eve of the Conservative convention. Moved to Honolulu         In later years she devoted herself to social life in Phoenix, where the Luces had a house - skindiving, doing mosaics and needlepoint, painting and writing. After Mr. Luce died in 1967, she moved to Honolulu, where she lived until 1983, when she moved into an apartment at the Watergate complex in Washington.''It's a city of human proportions,'' she said.         In recent years Mrs. Luce served on President Reagan's unpaid Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.         Of her writing she once said, ''I have been too involved with living to write much - or well - about life.'' A biographer, Alden Hatch, summed her up this way:         ''Brilliant, yet often foolish; idealistic, yet realistic to the verge of cynicism; tough as a Marine sergeant, but almost quixotically kind to unfortunates; with the mind and courage of a man and exceedingly feminine instincts; the complexities of her character are as numerous as the facets of her career. Probably the reason no one understands her completely is because she does not even understand herself.''         Mrs. Luce is survived by two stepsons, Henry Luce 3d and Peter Paul Luce. Interment will be private, A High Mass will be offered at noon Tuesday in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a memorial service Wednesday at 11 A. M. at the Church of St. Stephen Martyr in Washington.       
        Kate L. Turabian, author of one of the most widely read stylebooks on dissertations, died yesterday morning in her sleep at a retirement home in Los Angeles. She was 94 years old.         Kate L. Turabian, author of one of the most widely read stylebooks on dissertations, died yesterday morning in her sleep at a retirement home in Los Angeles. She was 94 years old.         Fifty years ago, while she was a secretary at the University of Chicago and did not have a college degree, she wrote a slender pamphlet describing the correct style for writing college dissertations. The pamphlet eventually became a book called ''A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations'' and it has sold more than five million copies in five editions.         The book is considered a definitive work on items such as the use of footnotes and bibliographies.         She was born Laura Kate Larimore in Chicago on Feb. 26, 1893. After graduating from Hyde Park High School, in Chicago, Mrs. Turabian worked for an advertising agency. She started her career at the University of Chicago in 1925, as a department secretary, and within five years, became a secretary in the registrar's office. Effort to Aid Students         In 1930 the university appT, Oct. 25 (AP) -         United Automobile Workers members overwhelmingly approved a new three-year contract with the General Motors Corporation that protects union jobs while freeing management to seek less restrictive work rules, the union announced tonight.         Members at 152 locals across the country voted 80.7 percent in favor of the agreement, said a union spokesman, Frank Joyce. About half of the union's 330,000 General Motors workers cast ballots, he said.         In all, 127,047 workers voted to approve the contract, and 30,325 voted against it, Mr. Joyce said.         The contract is to take effect Monday.         The union president, Owen Bieber, said the early settlement of contracts with General Motors and the Ford Motor Company will make it easier to organize workers at Japanese-run auto and parts companies.         The agreements forbid layoffs for most reasons except cuts in production volume because of slow sales. and provide for wage increases of 3 percent the first year and 3 percent lump-sum bonuses in the second and third years.         The contracts give local unions six months to work out new work rules and other changes that would increase efficiency and improve quality at individual plants.         General Motors has announced the closing of 16 plants and the elimination of 37,000 jobs by the end of 1990.
