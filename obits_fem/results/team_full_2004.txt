         Eleanor Holm Whalen, an Olympic swimming champion who was expelled from the 1936 Berlin Games in a headline-making drinking episode that brought her a second career as a slightly notorious but glamorous show-business figure, died Saturday at her home in Miami.         The cause was kidney failure, said her sister-in-law, Mary Ann Flotron.         By her own account, she would have been 90 at her death, but her sister-in-law said she was 91.         When she boarded the S.S. Manhattan in New York Harbor on July 15, 1936, with some 330 fellow Olympians bound for the Berlin Olympics, Eleanor Holm Jarrett, as she was then known, stood at the pinnacle of the swimming world. She had captured the 100-meter backstroke at the 1932 Los Angeles Games and had set world records in that event and the 200-meter backstroke. She had not lost a race in seven years and was the first female swimmer to be chosen for three American Olympic teams.         But when the ship docked at Hamburg, Germany, she was no longer a member of the Olympic team. The American Olympic Committee and its president, Avery Brundage, had expelled her from the Games for carousing and breaking curfew, an incident that became one of the most publicized flaps in Olympic history.         Her actions seem tame by modern standards, when sports pages have no shortage of accounts detailing drug abuse, criminal behavior and narcissism. But the tale of Olympic partying and drinking that emerged in 1936 enthralled readers who were hardly used to hearing about athletes' lives beyond the playing fields.         Eleanor Holm was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of a New York Fire Department officer, and learned to swim at the pool near her family's summer cottage in Long Beach, N.Y.         She finished fifth in the 100-meter backstroke at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam. Having won a gold medal in the backstroke at the Los Angeles Games in 1932, she was favored to repeat at the Berlin Olympics. But that was before she incurred the wrath of Brundage, the powerful American Olympic chief.         Holm was both a world-class swimmer and eminently worldly. She had married Art Jarrett, a bandleader, singer and fellow graduate of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, in September 1933. She had appeared with his band, wearing a white bathing suit and white cowboy hat with high heels, singing ''I'm an Old Cowhand.'' She had bit parts in several Warner Brothers movies.         Two days after the Olympians' ship left for the Berlin Games, Holm was invited to an all-night party for sportswriters on the first-class deck. Her drinking there and her violation of curfew brought a warning from Olympic officials.         Then, during a stopover in Cherbourg, France, she won a couple of hundred dollars playing dice with sportswriters aboard the ship during the afternoon. That night, she attended another party with them.         In an interview for ''All That Glitters Is Not Gold,'' by William O. Johnson, she remembered the moment:         ''This chaperone came up to me and told me it was time to go to bed. God, it was about 9 o'clock, and who wanted to go down in that basement to sleep anyway? So I said to her: 'Oh, is it really bedtime? Did you make the Olympic team or did I?' I had had a few glasses of Champagne. So she went to Brundage and complained that I was setting a bad example for the team, and they got together and told me the next morning that I was fired. I was heartbroken.''         According to ''The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics,'' by David Wallechinsky, the Olympic team doctor had reported that she was suffering from acute alcoholism, but Holm denied it.         Holm maintained that many of her fellow athletes had also been drinking on the voyage because there was no ban on alcohol, and some 200 team members petitioned Brundage to reverse the ban. But Brundage, who ruled amateur athletics in the United States for decades, stood fast.         ''I was everything that Avery Brundage hated,'' Holm said in ''Tales of Gold,'' by Lewis H. Carlson and John J. Fogarty. ''I had a few dollars, and athletes were supposed to be poor. I worked in nightclubs, and athletes shouldn't do that. I was married.''         She went on to recall: ''But he rained on my parade for only a very short time. He did make me famous. I would have been just another female backstroke swimmer without Brundage.''         While Nida Senff of the Netherlands was winning Holm's specialty, the 100-meter backstroke, with American entries finishing third and fourth, Holm joined her sportswriter friends. Hired by the International News Service to file reports on the Games, she became a celebrity presence in the press area, although her articles were ghostwritten.         She also attended receptions held by Hitler and other Nazi leaders. Hermann Goering, the Luftwaffe chief, gave her a silver swastika he took off his uniform. When Holm married Billy Rose, who was Jewish, she had it copied in gold and then placed a Star of David set in diamonds inside it.         After the Olympics, Holm continued in her singing act and was co-featured in the 1938 20th Century Fox movie ''Tarzan's Revenge,'' playing alongside Glenn Morris, the 1936 Olympic decathlon champion, who was cast as Tarzan.         After her divorce from Jarrett in 1939, Holm married Rose, who had obtained a divorce from the comedian Fannie Brice. Co-featured with Johnny Weismuller and then Buster Crabbe, Holm did 39 shows a week at Rose's Aquacade in the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940.         ''I thought I'd never be dry,'' she recalled in ''Tales of Gold.''         ''My hair turned green from the chlorine, and swimming on those cold October and November nights in New York was awful.''         Holm lived with Rose in a five-story, 14-room house on Beekman Place in Manhattan. They were divorced in 1954. She later married Tom Whalen, a retired oil executive, and settled in the Miami area.         She had no children and is survived by two nieces. Whalen died in 1984.         ''I don't swim anymore, I just play tennis,'' she told Dave Anderson of The New York Times in 1984. ''But I still have my 1932 Olympic bathing suit. It's blue with a red, white and blue shield on the front. It's long-waisted with a little skirt. And I don't drink Champagne anymore. Just a little dry white wine.''       
         Marge Schott, who evoked the image of a charming eccentric when she bought the Cincinnati Reds in 1984 but became a baseball pariah for offensive racial and ethnic remarks, died yesterday in Cincinnati. She was 75.         Her death was announced by Christ Hospital, where she had been treated for several weeks. She had lung-related problems in recent years, The Associated Press said.         When she took control of the Reds, Mrs. Schott, a socially prominent widow and heir to an industrial fortune, was the only female owner in the major leagues who had bought a team in her own right. Joan Kroc of the San Diego Padres and Jean Yawkey of the Boston Red Sox had inherited their franchises from their husbands.         She appeared at her introductory news conference with her 170-pound St. Bernard, Schottzie, who, clad in a Reds cap, perched on the feet of Manager Pete Rose. She maintained that in purchasing the team, she might have prevented its move out of Cincinnati. It seemed that she might be an astute baseball promoter, and she was a formidable contributor to Cincinnati area charities.         But a series of gaffes and intolerant remarks caused Mrs. Schott to lose control of the Reds in 1999. In her 15 years as owner, a franchise that had thrived in the 1970's as the Big Red Machine had seven managers but only one pennant-winner, the World Series champions of 1990.         Mrs. Schott's image first soured in November 1992 when several former Reds executives said that she had referred to players and business associates using racial and ethnic slurs. In an interview that month with The New York Times, she said that ''Hitler was good in the beginning, but he went too far.''         Mrs. Schott denied she was a racist, but acknowledged she had sometimes used a racial epithet.         Asked in a deposition for a lawsuit brought by a former Reds employee if she was prejudiced against Jews in light of possessing a Nazi armband -- a war souvenir -- she responded: ''No. They are not smarter than us, just sharper.'' The uproar over Mrs. Schott's remarks prompted baseball's leadership to suspend her from day-to-day oversight of the Reds for the 1993 season. After she made a similar comment about Hitler in May 1996, she was forced to relinquish her daily control of the Reds again and she never regained it.         In October 1999, Mrs. Schott turned over control of the team to a group headed by Carl Lindner, one of the limited partners, in a $67 million deal. She remained in Reds ownership as a limited partner.         Mrs. Schott was a major contributor to local charitable causes, including Children's Hospital and the Cincinnati Zoo.         ''Marge was a paradox,'' Mayor Charlie Luken of Cincinnati told The Cincinnati Enquirer upon her death. ''While there is no excusing some of the indelicate things she said, there was a kindness to Marge that made her a woman of the people.''         She was born Margaret Unnewehr, the second of five daughters of Edward Unnewehr, a Cincinnati native who made a fortune in the lumber business.         ''My father was Achtung-German,'' Mrs. Schott recalled in 1992. ''He used to ring a bell when he wanted my mother. When I was 21 and went to vote, he told me who to vote for. I said, 'Yes, Daddy.' ''         She married Charles Schott, a member of a wealthy Cincinnati family, in 1952, and gained notice for the parties she held for friends and charities at her mansion in the suburb of Indian Hill.         When her husband died of a heart attack in 1968, Mrs. Schott inherited auto dealerships in Cincinnati and interests in insurance, brick manufacturing, concrete products and landfills.         She became a limited partner in the Reds' ownership in 1981 and was named the general partner on Dec. 21, 1984, when she purchased the controlling interest held by the brothers James and William Williams and shares held by two other limited partners, reportedly for $11 million.         Mrs. Schott called her purchase of the Reds a ''Christmas gift to the people of Cincinnati.'' She said she was concerned that the Williams brothers might sell the franchise, which reported $4 million in losses in 1984, to an out-of-city group.         Mrs. Schott promoted the team at functions, and she loved to take part in the Wave from her box seat at Riverfront Stadium. But the allegations in 1992 concerning offensive remarks tarnished her image.         The next February, baseball's executive council suspended Mrs. Schott for the 1993 season and fined her $25,000 for ''the most base and demeaning type of racial and ethnic stereotyping.''         Mrs. Schott had apologized for any offensive remarks, but in an interview for ABC-TV's ''Primetime Live'' after the suspension, she suggested the inquiry was a ''witch hunt'' and said, ''I think if I had been a man this would never have happened.''         A month after that suspension was imposed, baseball's executive council banned Schottzie 02 -- another of her St. Bernards -- from the Riverfront Stadium field, citing ''numerous complaints by the players.''         Mrs. Schott had no children, to her great regret. She bestowed great affection on her dogs and delighted in parading with her St. Bernards around the Reds' ballpark and rubbing the dogs' fur on her players.         In yet another incident, Lou Piniella, who had taken the Reds to the World Series championship in his first year as manager, rejected a two-year contract extension after the 1992 season. He said later that a major factor in his leaving was the failure of the Reds' management to support him in a defamation suit -- later dropped -- that was filed by Umpire Gary Darling and the Major League Umpires Association.         Another embarrassment for Mrs. Schott arrived in 1996.         After the season-opening game at Cincinnati had been called off when Umpire John McSherry sustained a fatal heart attack in the first inning, Mrs. Schott told The Cincinnati Enquirer: ''I feel cheated. Nobody feels worse than me.''         She compounded that gaffe with her sympathy offering to the umpiring crew; according to published reports, it was a recycled bouquet given to her by the team's television affiliate.         On June 12, 1996, Mrs. Schott agreed to give up daily operation of the Reds through the 1998 season, having been told by baseball's executive council that she would be suspended again if she did not do so. She turned over day-to-day affairs to John Allen, the team's controller.         Mrs. Schott is survived by her sisters, Charlotte Crane, Winnie Fraser, Caroline Paddock and Mary Elizabeth Unnewehr.         ''I guess I always thought of her as a tragic figure,'' the former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent told The Associated Press. ''I think she tried very hard to do the right things for baseball, but she had some enormous limitations and she had some difficulty overcoming them.''       
         June Taylor, the Emmy-winning choreographer whose routines on ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' brought the chorus line into the television age, died on Sunday at a hospital in Miami, said her sister, Marilyn Gleason. She was 86 and lived in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.         Each week ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' opened with a number by the 16 high-kicking, wide-smiling young women of the June Taylor Dancers. Their routines, created by Ms. Taylor, were intricate, expensive and wholesome-looking updates of the classic Broadway chorus lines.         To accommodate the square format of television, the dancers were often shot from above, resulting in kaleidoscopic patterns of limbs that recalled the films of Busby Berkeley.         Besides the three-minute numbers that opened each show, Ms. Taylor also choreographed longer routines for special broadcasts. In 1953 Gleason and Ms. Taylor collaborated on ''Tawny,'' a ballet of more than 20 minutes with music by Gleason. A review by Jack Gould in The New York Times said the piece cost a reported $30,000 to produce. ''Every penny was well spent,'' he wrote, ''for here was popular commercial television displaying artistic vision and imagination.''         Ms. Taylor won an Emmy Award for her choreography on ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' in 1955.         Born in Chicago, Ms. Taylor was a seasoned nightclub dancer when her career was derailed by tuberculosis at age 20. She turned to choreography, hitting the road with her own company. She met Gleason, then a little-known comedian, at a Baltimore nightclub in 1946.         Ms. Taylor began working on television in 1948 on Ed Sullivan's ''Toast of the Town'' and later worked on ''Cavalcade of Stars,'' which Gleason joined in 1950. ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' began in 1952 and ran until 1959; it returned to television in 1962 and ran until 1970.         Gleason moved his show in 1964 from New York to Miami, where he could play golf all year long, and Ms. Taylor remained in Florida after the show ended. In 1978 she was invited by the Miami Dolphins football team to direct the team's cheerleaders. She turned her demanding techniques to the squad. She also favored costumes that were throwbacks to her earlier days. The Dolphins' Web site says that it was not until Ms. Taylor retired in 1990 that the women updated their uniforms with, for example, sneakers while they were on the sidelines.         Besides her sister, of Fort Lauderdale, who married Gleason in 1975, Ms. Taylor is survived by a nephew, Craig Horwich of Chicago. Her husband, Sol Lerner, died in 1986.         Ms. Taylor often spoke of television's demands on dance. ''One of the first things I learned in television was the necessity of varying the style of the dancing each week,'' she said in an interview in 1953. ''People want something new. My girls, I believe, are the best hoofers in the business. They know tap, ballet, classical ballet, toe work, modern and acrobatic dancing.''         Mrs. Gleason, who was a dancer in her sister's group, remarked that speed was a necessity.         ''We were on television,'' she said yesterday, ''and we had to move fast. The only comparison was the Rockettes, but we danced four times faster than they did.''       
         Karol Kennedy Kucher, who teamed up with her brother, Peter Kennedy, to win the gold medal in pairs at the 1950 world figure-skating championships and a silver medal at the 1952 Winter Olympics, died on Friday at a hospital in Seattle. She was 72.         The cause was pneumonia, her brother said.         Karol and Peter Kennedy, known as the Kennedy Kids, were the dominant American pair skaters in the years after World War II, winning five consecutive United States championships, from 1948 to 1952.         The Kennedys became the first American pair to win a world championship when they captured the gold medal at Wembley Stadium in London in 1950.         Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner are the only other American pair skaters to have won a world championship, at Vienna in 1979.         The Kennedys were the second American pair to win Olympic silver when they were runners-up to Ria and Paul Falk of West Germany at the 1952 Oslo Games. Beatrix Loughran and Sherwin Badger, at Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1932, and Kitty and Peter Carruthers, at Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, in 1984, are the only other American pair skaters to have captured Olympic silver. No American pair has won a gold medal at the Olympics.         The Kennedys also won the 1949 and the 1951 North American Figure Skating Championships.         They were named to the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame at Colorado Springs in 1991.         Karol and Peter Kennedy began skating together at a rink in Olympia, Wash., when she was 8 and he was 12. As Peter Kennedy recalled yesterday in a telephone interview, they were naturals.         ''We never really had to work at learning to skate,'' he said.         Their father, Michael, a dentist, helped oversee their training, and their mother, Clarice, designed their costumes.         Having finished sixth in the 1948 Winter Olympics at St. Moritz, Switzerland, the Kennedys were narrow runners-up to the Falks in the 1952 Oslo Games. A week later, the Kennedys were second to the Falks again, this time at the world championships in Paris.         The Kennedys retired from competition soon afterward. Karol was married in 1953, settled in Seattle with her husband, Robert Kucher, and operated a clothing store. Peter Kennedy, who lives in Mercer Island, Wash., became a competitive skier and designed skiing equipment.         In addition to her husband and her brother, Karol Kennedy Kucher is survived by two sons, John, of Seattle, and Charlie, of Hailey, Idaho; four daughters, Kathryn Etherington, of Wenatchee, Wash.; Mary Jane Kucher, of California, and Heidi Pray and Suzanne Sanchez, both of Seattle, and five grandchildren.         Peter Kennedy attributed much of the team's success to his father having taught them perseverance.         ''He preached to us, 'You don't give up.''' Kennedy said.       
         Sandra Helen Payson, a socially prominent patron of the arts, died on July 15 in Manhattan, where she was visiting. A former New Yorker, she was 78 and lived in Washington and Delaplane, Va.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Payson was the founder and president of the Beard's Fund, through which she supported groups in the performing arts and individual artists. She also sponsored fellowships for aspiring artists.         The daughter of Charles Shipman Payson, an industrialist, and Joan Whitney Payson, founder of the New York Mets baseball team, she grew up in Manhasset, N.Y., where she founded the Manhasset Stable for thoroughbred racing, which she later moved to Delaplane.         She was a board member of the Lincoln Center Institute for Arts in Education, the Whitney Museum, the Madeira School and the Research Center at the New York Public Library. She also was active in the Women's Leadership Forum of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.         Her two marriages, to William Blair Meyer and George (later Lord) Weidenfeld of London, ended in divorce.         Ms. Payson is survived by a son, William Blair Meyer Jr. of Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla.; two daughters, Joan Curci Meyer of London and Porto Ercole, Italy, and Averil Payson Meyer of New York City and Katonah, N.Y.; two sisters, Payne Whitney Middleton of Manhattan, and Lorinda Payson deRoulet of Manhasset; a brother, John Whitney Payson of Jupiter Island, Fla.; and eight grandchildren.       
         Rose Gacioch, an outstanding outfielder and pitcher in the heyday of women's professional baseball who became a mainstay of the Rockford Peaches team later featured in the movie ''A League of Their Own,'' died last Thursday at a nursing home in Clinton Township, Mich. She was 89.         Her death was announced by a niece, Helen Bozicevich.         Gacioch (pronounced GAY-sotch), a native of Wheeling, W.Va., was in grade school when she sneaked out of class to see Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig play on a barnstorming stop, and she was thrilled when Gehrig shook her hand. At 16, she was the only girl on a town baseball team called the Little Cardinals.         While still in her teens, she played one season for the All Star Ranger Girls, a barnstorming women's team.         In 1944, after working in a West Virginia factory and playing softball, she joined the South Bend (Ind.) Blue Sox in the All-American Girls Baseball League, created the previous season by the Chicago Cubs' owner, Philip K. Wrigley, to provide entertainment if major league baseball was curtailed by World War II.         Gacioch played right field, and, as she told Susan E. Johnson in an interview for ''When Women Played Hardball,'' she had a phenomenal assist total, thanks to a move by her manager, Bert Niehoff, a former National League infielder.         As she remembered it: ''Bert said: 'Rose, I'm gonna put the second baseman closer to second, and the first baseman closer to first. Now you've got all that territory in between. Come in and flip the ball to first.' Batters would see a big space in right field, hit toward it. I'd run in, field the ball and throw them out at first. Twice in my career, I had 31 assists from right field, a league record.''         Gacioch was sent to the Rockford (Ill.) Peaches the next year and played the outfield and pitched for them until the league folded after the 1954 season. She won 92 games and lost 60 and was a three-time All-Star, according to Ms. Johnson. She played on four championship teams with the Peaches.         Gacioch later worked in a factory in Rockford, retired in 1978, then lived in the Detroit area. She never married and is survived most immediately by three nieces.         Interest in women's baseball was revived long after the demise of the All-American Girls Baseball League. In 1988, the Hall of Fame created a Women in Baseball exhibit honoring the players of that league, and in 1992, ''A League of Their Own,'' starring Madonna, Geena Davis, Rosie O'Donnell and Tom Hanks, provided a Hollywood version of the Peaches' exploits.         Gacioch visited Cooperstown for the exhibition opening and reveled in her niche at the Hall of Fame. As she said in the interview reflecting on her career: ''I always say: 'Now I got something on Pete Rose. I got there before he did.'''       
         Phyllis Williams Lehmann, an archaeologist and art historian known for reuniting the hand of one of the icons of Western art, the Winged Victory of Samothrace, with two of its long-lost fingers, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Haydenville, Mass. She was 91.         The cause was congestive heart failure, according to Smith College, where Dr. Lehmann taught for more than 30 years.         Dr. Lehmann was an authority on the monuments and architecture of Samothrace, a remote, mountainous island in the north Aegean. The island was considered crucial in the development of the art and architecture of the Hellenistic period, which lasted from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C. until the mid-first century B.C.         Samothrace was the center of one of the most famous mystery cults of Greek antiquity; its rituals were carried out in the group of imposing buildings known as the Sanctuary of the Great Gods, erected between the fourth and the second centuries B.C. The first of these structures to be built in marble was dedicated by Alexander's father, Philip II. Alexander's successors also erected monuments in the sanctuary.         As a result, the ruins at Samothrace have been of continuing interest to archaeologists, who have excavated there since the 1860's. Dr. Lehmann, who first visited the island in 1938, did her early work there with her husband, the archaeologist Karl Lehmann. She was assistant field director of the excavation from 1948 to 1960 and acting director from 1960 to 1965, and she remained closely involved with Samothrace for the rest of her career. A member of the Smith faculty from 1946 to 1978, she was dean of the college from 1965 to 1970.         Phyllis Williams was born Nov. 30, 1912, in Brooklyn. She received a bachelor's degree from Wellesley in 1934, and for the next two years worked at the Brooklyn Museum as an assistant in charge of the Classical collection. In 1936, she began her graduate work at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts, which ran the excavation on Samothrace. She received her Ph.D. in 1943, and married Mr. Lehmann, the excavation's director, the next year. He died in 1960. No immediate family members survive.         Working on Samothrace in 1949, Phyllis Lehmann made one of her most important discoveries, a tall marble statue of Nike, the goddess of victory, dating from the second century B.C. Unearthed in three large pieces, Dr. Lehmann's statue was the third Nike to be found on the island. The first, the Winged Victory that today greets visitors to the Louvre from the top of an imposing staircase, was found in 1863 by the French archaeologist Charles Champoiseau. That statue, from around 190 B.C., was unearthed in fragments, probably damaged in an earthquake in the sixth century A.D. Reassembled in Paris, it lacked head, arms and hands.         In the 1870's, Austrian archaeologists uncovered a second Nike on Samothrace, this one a Roman copy. They took it to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, along with an unrelated assortment of marble fragments also found on the island. The fragments remained at the museum, unidentified and forgotten, for three-quarters of a century.         Dr. Lehmann's Nike, which had stood atop a building called the Hieron, is today on display in a museum on Samothrace.         In 1950, a team led by Karl Lehmann unearthed the missing right hand of the Louvre's Winged Victory. The hand, which had lost its fingers, had slid out of sight, under a large rock, near where the statue had originally stood. The team also found the tip of the ring finger nearby.         On their way home from Samothrace, the Lehmanns stopped in Vienna, where Phyllis sifted through the dusty storerooms of the Kunsthistorisches Museum. Examining the fragments left there by the Austrian team more than 70 years before, she found the rest of Winged Victory's ring finger and a thumb. The hand, with thumb and finger reattached, is displayed at the Louvre in a glass case next to the statue.         Dr. Lehmann's many books include ''The Pedimental Sculptures of the Hieron in Samothrace'' (1962) and ''Samothrace III: The Hieron,'' which was awarded the Alice Davis Hitchcock Book Award of the Society of Architectural Historians in 1969.         She was made an honorary citizen of Samothrace in 1968.       
         Lilian Kallir, a pianist known for her elegant Mozart performances, both as a soloist and in duet recitals with her husband, the pianist Claude Frank, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         Her daughter, the violinist Pamela Frank, said the cause was ovarian cancer.         Ms. Kallir was born in Prague on May 6, 1931, and made her performing debut on radio when she was 4. She left Europe in 1940 and settled in New York, where she continued her piano studies with Isabelle Vengerova and Herman de Grab. She also studied composition, theory and harmony with Hugo Kauder, whose music she later performed in her recitals.         Ms. Kallir's first important performance in New York was an evening of concertos with the National Orchestral Association at Carnegie Hall, in 1949, when she played the Schumann Concerto and gave the premiere of a Concerto by Alan Hovhaness in which she was asked to imitate the sound of a Javanese gamelan, partly by playing on the strings of the piano with a timpani stick. She made her New York Philharmonic debut in 1957.         Ms. Kallir met her husband when they were both students at Tanglewood, in 1947, but they did not marry until 1959. By then Mr. Frank was an assistant to Rudolf Serkin at the Marlboro Festival, in Vermont. They were married at Marlboro; the pianist Eugene Istomin was the best man.         The two pianists began playing recitals together in 1960, in a format that included solo performances by each, as well as at least one collaborative work.         But although their names are inextricably linked as a duet team for many listeners, Mr. Frank said they had actually devoted most their time to performing on their own, mainly because they disliked much of duet repertory. But they did give countless performances of the Mozart works for two pianos.         On her own, Ms. Kallir favored Mozart and Chopin, with Bartok and Kodaly as the forward edge of her repertory. She performed Mozart and Beethoven Concertos with most of the major American and European orchestras, and was a favorite at the Mostly Mozart Festival from its early years.         She was also a devoted chamber music player. She played recitals with the violinist Pinchas Zukerman, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the clarinetist Richard Stoltzman. And she performed with the Juilliard, Emerson, Guarneri, Cleveland and Tokyo String Quartets. Ms. Kallir also gave performances with her daughter, who survives her, as does her husband.       
         Hildy Parks Cohen, the producer, writer and actress known as Hildy Parks who wrote the first 20 Tony Awards telecasts as well as 20 other television specials, including the Emmy Awards, died on Thursday at the Actors Fund Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 78.         The cause was complications of a recent stroke, said her son Christopher Cohen.         Ms. Parks was a partner with her husband, Alexander H. Cohen, one of the last old-time independent theatrical producers, with 101 Broadway and West End shows to his name. He died in 2000. Together, from 1967 to 1986, Mr. Cohen usually produced the Tonys, and Ms. Parks wrote them.         As a result of the couple's ministrations, the Tony shows were frequently held up as a model of what other award shows, like the Oscars, ought to be: fast-paced, lively and topical.         Mr. Cohen said his mother ''was the intellect, and Dad was the bravado'' in their Tony work. Political events always made their way into the presentations. Ms. Parks's own views were very much those of a liberal Democrat, and she went so far as to give up limousines for bicycles, cheerfully waving to her husband as he went by in his big black car.         Ms. Parks won two Emmy Awards: one in 1980 for producing the 34th annual Tony Awards and one for producing ''The Night of 100 Stars'' in 1982.         In a 1982 article in The New York Times, Carol Lawson described how Ms. Parks worked hard behind the scenes at the Tony Awards:         ''As the one who warms up the live audience with good-natured barbs at the theater industry before airtime, Mr. Cohen is the more visible member of the team; but it is Miss Parks who puts the whole thing together.'' Ms. Parks was both shrewd and down to earth, focusing on getting the awards show picked up by television by signing on names familiar to television viewers. She did all the research for the show herself at the Lincoln Center library.         She also wrote the 37th and 38th annual Emmy Awards; ''Plácido Domingo: Steppin' Out With the Ladies'' on ABC in 1985; and NBC's 60th anniversary show in 1986.         Besides her contributions to causes like housing for the homeless, Greenpeace, the Actors' Fund and animal rights (she often brought home animals that appeared in shows to become family pets), she was involved with Community Board 5 in Midtown Manhattan and was prominent in continuing efforts to acquire landmark status for all the Broadway theaters.         Hildy Parks was born in Washington on March 12, 1926. She graduated from the University of Virginia and soon after went to New York to make her stage debut as Curley's wife in ''Of Mice and Men'' at the New School. She made her Broadway debut in 1947, when she appeared in ''Bathsheba'' with James Mason. In 1948 she played the Girl in Tennessee Williams's ''Summer and Smoke'' and was the only woman in the London cast of ''Mr. Roberts.''         After a brief marriage to Jackie Cooper, Ms. Parks met Mr. Cohen in 1953 while playing Gwendolyn Holly in the comedy ''Be Your Age'' at the 48th Street Theater. He was one of the play's producers. The play lasted only three days, but the marriage endured for 44 years.         Ms. Parks's involvement with theater also lasted for many years. In the 1983-84 season she worked as a producer or co-producer on the plays ''Edmund Kean,'' ''La Tragédie de Carmen'' and ''Play Memory.'' In 1984 she and her husband co-produced Dario Fo's play ''Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''         Ms. Parks also acted in films, like ''Fail Safe'' in 1964 and ''The Group'' in 1966, and made regular appearances on major television shows for 12 years. They ranged from ''Philco Playhouse'' and ''Studio One'' to ''To Tell the Truth,'' on which she was a frequent panelist. From 1951 to 1955, she played the character Ellie Crown in the daytime series ''Love of Life.''         In addition to Christopher Cohen, Ms. Parks is survived by her son Gerald Cohen and a stepdaughter, Barbara Cohen Hoffman.       
         Sharifa Alkhateeb, an advocate for Muslim culture in the United States who helped place courses in Middle Eastern cultures and Arabic in public schools, died on Oct. 21 at her home in Ashburn, Va. She was 58.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her daughter Nasreen.         Ms. Alkhateeb, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, spent much of her life interpreting Islam. Even as she adhered to Muslim traditions like covering her hair, she encouraged Muslim women to be active in their larger communities.         ''She was dedicated to understanding Islam for herself as opposed to Islam coming to us with all the cultural wrappings,'' said her sister Nafeesa Ahmad.         In 1992, she founded the North American Council for Muslim Women, an education and advocacy group, and was president of the Muslim Education Council, which instructed public-school teachers on Middle Eastern cultures, Islam and Muslim society.         In 2000, she created the Peaceful Families Project, which studies and raises awareness of domestic violence in Muslim communities and is financed by the Department of Justice. At the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, she was chairwoman of the Muslim caucus.         Ms. Alkhateeb wrote and lectured extensively to challenge stereotypes of Muslims, and particularly of Muslim women. She was a co-author of ''The Arab World Notebook,'' a secondary school textbook; for eight years she waged a campaign, which was successful, to make Arabic part of the language offerings in several high schools in Northern Virginia. Publishers of social studies textbooks would seek her comments, and she was an adviser to North American Muslim student groups.         Sharifa Ahmad was born on June 6, 1946, to a Yemeni father and a Czech mother. She finished high school in three years and attended the University of Pennsylvania, from which she received a bachelor's degree in English literature. She later received a master's degree in comparative religion from Norwich University, in Northfield, Vt. From 1978 to 1987 she and her husband lived in Saudi Arabia.         In the 1970's, Ms. Alkhateeb wrote for The Saudi Gazette, an English-language newspaper in Jidda, and she edited an English translation of the Koran. She was managing editor of The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences in the early 1990's.         In 1993, she created a monthly cable television program, ''Middle Eastern Parenting,'' for the Fairfax County (Va.) Public Schools.         After the Sept. 11 attacks, she became a team leader of the Community Resilience Project, a counseling center in Northern Virginia supported by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.         In addition to her daughter Nasreen Alkhateeb, of Brooklyn, and her sister Nafeesa Ahmad, of Oakland, Calif., Ms. Alkhateeb is survived by her husband, Mejdi; a brother, Muhammad Ahmad, of Horsham, Pa; her sisters Shahara Ahmad-Llewellyn of Manhattan and Sayyida Ahmad Jordan of Los Angeles; her daughters Layla Alkhateeb of Arlington, Va., and Maha Buthayna Alkhateeb of Potomac Falls, Va.; and a grandson.       
         Maude Lloyd, a dramatically expressive ballerina who became an articulate dance critic, writing in collaboration with her husband, Nigel Gosling, died on Nov. 26 at her home in London. She was 96.         She died after a brief hospitalization, said John Percival, a British freelance dance critic.Born in South Africa in 1908, Ms. Lloyd arrived in London as a dance student and in 1927 became associated with Ballet Rambert, a pioneering British ballet company. After capturing the attention of Antony Tudor, then a young choreographer eager to explore the possibilities of dramatic ballets, she danced in major works of his like ''The Planets'' (1934) and ''Dark Elegies'' (1937).         Perhaps her greatest characterization was that of Caroline in ''Jardin aux Lilas'' (1936), Tudor's poignant and often revived ballet about a young woman who must marry a man she does not love. Ms. Lloyd's eloquence contributed much to the impact of its premiere.         When she started teaching ballet classes for adult beginners, one of her students was a dance-loving young art critic, Mr. Gosling. She married him in 1939 and retired from the stage the next year.         Because Ms. Lloyd's conversation was as expressive as her dancing, and because she and her husband were inseparable, Richard Buckle, editor of Ballet magazine in London, suggested in 1951 that the couple write dance criticism as a team. They adopted Alexander Bland as a byline, derived from the names of two piglets (Pigling Bland and his brother Alexander) in a Beatrix Potter story.         After they wrote for various publications, the team as Alexander Bland began writing dance reviews in 1955 in The Observer, a weekly for which Gosling was also the art critic. Although Gosling stopped writing art criticism in 1975, reviews by Alexander Bland continued until Gosling died in 1982. Some of them are anthologized in ''Observer of the Dance'' (Dance Books, 1985).         When Rudolf Nureyev arrived in England after defecting from the Soviet Union in 1961, the Goslings hospitably took the young dancer under their wings and helped him adjust to his new country. They celebrated his achievements in their book ''The Nureyev Image'' (1976).         Ms. Lloyd is survived by a son, Nicholas, and grandchildren.
