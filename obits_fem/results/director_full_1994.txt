         Katherine Kuh, a writer on art and a former curator at the Art Institute of Chicago who devoted her career to the acceptance of modern art, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died of natural causes, said her lawyer, William H. Roth.         Mrs. Kuh, the former Katherine Woolf, was born in St. Louis in 1904. She attended Vassar College and decided to focus on art history after taking a course taught by Alfred H. Barr Jr., soon to become the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art.         After graduate work at the University of Chicago and New York University, she opened Chicago's first commercial gallery of avant-garde art in 1936. For the next six years, she exhibited works by an impressive list of European and American modernists, including Leger, Kandinsky, Picasso and Klee, as well as African and pre-Columbian art, typographical design and photography. Sales were rare, so Mrs. Kuh kept the gallery afloat by holding art-history classes there. Innovative Exhibitions         In 1943, she was hired by Daniel Catton Rich, director of the Art Institute of Chicago, to run the museum's public-relations office while its regular director served in the military. She was soon put in charge of the museum's Gallery of Art Interpretation, where she mounted innovative exhibitions that introduced the public to modern art by comparing it to examples of art from other periods.         As associate curator of painting and sculpture at the institute, Mrs. Kuh worked with Rich to organize the first public exhibition of the great modern art collection of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Arensberg in 1949. In 1951, she published her first book, "Art Has Many Faces," one of the first books on the appreciation of modern art, and it was widely used by teachers.         In 1954, she became the Art Institute's first curator of modern painting and sculpture and, with Rich, was responsible for acquiring many of its most important works in this area, including Matisse's monumental figure painting "Bathers by a River."         In 1959, a year after Rich's departure, Mrs. Kuh left the Art Institute; soon she moved to New York. Over the next decade, she worked as art adviser for the First National Bank of Chicago, assembling an eclectic corporate collection of some 2,000 works that is considered one of the best in the country. During this period, her books included "The Artist's Voice" (1962), "Break-Up: The Core of Modern Art" (1965) and "The Open Eye: In Pursuit of Art" (1971).         Her marriage, to George Kuh, ended in divorce.       
         Joan Avnet, an art collector, dealer and philanthropist, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter Rosalind Avnet Lazarus.         Mrs. Avnet was the widow of Lester Avnet, founder of Avnet Inc., a distributor of electronics components. As collectors, the Avnets focused primarily on Old Master and Modern drawings, assembling major holdings in 20th-century drawings by European and American artists. Of the 900 works they acquired between 1960 and Mr. Avnet's death in 1970, 180 drawings were donated to the Museum of Modern Art in 1978.         Formed in consultation with the museum, the gift collection came to include theatrical drawings by Jim Dine, early drawings by Picasso and others by Jean Dubuffet, Lionel Feininger, Jackson Pollock, Emil Nolde, Egon Schiele and Leon Bakst. They also gave the museum drawings by Balthus, Chagall, Matisse, Modigliani and Rouault.  Other Gifts         The Avnets also made gifts to the Institute of Molecular Biology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Joan and Lester Avnet Division of Laboratories at the North Shore University Hospital and the Joan and Lester Avnet Chair in Ethics at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         In the 1960's Mrs. Avnet owned a gallery in Great Neck, L.I., and later was a private art dealer in New York and Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Avnet was born in New York and attended Hunter College. Her second marriage, to Dr. Karl Fischbach, ended in divorce.         In addition to Mrs. Lazarus, of New York and Washington, she is survived by another daughter, Carole Avnet Rocherolle of Stamford, Conn.; a son, Jonathan Avnet, a film director and producer of Topanga Canyon, outside Los Angeles, and eight grandchildren.       
         Ruth Pruyn Field, a director of the Field Foundation who was active in civic causes in New York, died on Tuesday at her home in Beaufort, S.C. Mrs. Field, who was 86, also kept a home in Southport, Conn.         The cause was an aneurysm, her family said.         Mrs. Field was the widow of Marshall Field 3d, the publisher and philanthropist, who died in 1956. During their marriage, they both became involved in civic affairs. For many years, her principal interest lay in the Field Family Foundation, which contributed millions to charities promoting child welfare and improved race relations.         A native of Manhattan, Mrs. Field was also a past director of the Citizens Committee for Children in New York City, and the United Nations Association U.S.A. In addition, she was associated with the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Foundation, the Carnegie Hall Corporation, Sarah Lawrence College -- of which she was an honorary trustee -- the Wiltwyck School, the Advisory Committee for the Dalton Schools and the Committee for the Preservation of the White House.         Mrs. Field is survived by a son, Robert L. Phipps of Ridgeland, S.C.; a daughter, Fiona F. Kay, a resident of Alicante province in eastern Spain, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Louise Averill Svendsen, an art historian and former curator and administrator at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, died sometime last week at her home in Manhattan. Her body was found on Monday by the superintendent of the building in which she lived. She was 78.         She died of natural causes, said her brother, Roswell Averill of St. Simons Island, Ga.         Mrs. Svendsen, who was born in Old Town, Me., in 1915, majored in art at Wellesley College. She earned a Ph.D. from Yale University, writing her dissertation on John Vanderlind, a 19th-century American painter. In 1950, she married Thoralf Svendsen, a Norweigen diplomat. He died in 1983.         In the 1940's and early 50's, Mrs. Svendsen taught art history at Duke University, Goucher College and American University. In 1954, she was hired as a lecturer at the Guggenheim by James Johnson Sweeney, the museum's first director. At the time, the museum's famous Frank Lloyd Wright building on Fifth Avenue was under construction. During the late 1950's, Mrs. Svendsen played an important role in the museum's transition to its new home, helping in the organization of departments and galleries. She also edited the first handbook for the museum's collection; it was published in 1959 on the inauguration of the new building. 'Yankee Integrity'         Reached by telephone yesterday, Ward Jackson, the Guggenheim's archivist, praised Mrs. Svendsen for a "Yankee integrity that you found in legendary figures like Alfred Barr and Lloyd Goodrich," referring to the former directors of the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.         At the Guggenheim, Mrs. Svendsen was successively appointed curator of education, associate curator, curator and, in 1978, senior curator. She devoted most of her time to overseeing the museum's collection. In addition, she organized retrospectives of Edvard Munch (1965), Ilya Bolotowsky (1974), Alberto Giacometti (1974) and Paul Klee (1977), as well as a show titled "Rousseau, Redon and Fantasy" (1968). In addition to her catalogue texts she wrote "Klee at the Guggenheim" (1977).         Upon her retirement in 1982, Mrs. Svendsen was named curator emeritus. Over the last decade, she worked as a consultant at Sotheby's in the department of Impressionist and modern paintings.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by a sister, Caroline Averill Rogers, of Patten, Me.       
         Natalie Molostwoff, a former executive director of the School of American Ballet, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         The cause was cancer, said Nathalie Gleboff, the current executive director of the school, which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet.         Ms. Molostwoff, whose original name was Natalie Merimanova, was a native of Baku, Azerbaijan, and emigrated to New York City with her mother when she was a girl. In later years, she became a secretary and was hired by the School of American Ballet in 1938.         Eugenie Ouroussow, the school's director at the time, soon discovered that Ms. Molostwoff possessed administrative skills. She became Ms. Ouroussow's assistant. When Ms. Ouroussow died in 1976, Ms. Molostwoff succeeded her as executive director, holding that post until she retired in 1991.         Ms. Molostwoff's first marriage ended in divorce, but she continued to use her married surname professionally.         She is survived by her second husband, the choreographer John Taras.       
         Hilda Simms, an actress best known for her starring role on Broadway in "Anna Lucasta," died on Sunday in Buffalo at the home of her sister Evelyn Sharp. She was 75 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer of the pancreas, her sister said.         "Anna Lucasta" and Ms. Simms's performance in the title role created a stir when the play, written by Philip Yordan and produced by the American Negro Theater, moved from Harlem to Broadway in 1944. For the first time, American playgoers saw an all-black cast acting in a drama that did not deal with racial issues. Ms. Simms played a middle-class woman who falls into prostitution and tries to fight her way back to respectability. The Road to Broadway         Ms. Simms, whose original surname was Moses, was born in Minneapolis.  She was one of nine children and studied teaching at the University of Minnesota until lack of money forced her to leave.         In 1943, Ms. Simms moved to New York. She acted in radio dramas and joined the American Negro Theater, where she was in charge of sound effects, props and publicity.         After appearing as a Southern ingenue in "Three's a Family," she was cast in "Anna Lucasta," a play written for white actors. Although most of the cast members were amateurs, the play received strong reviews and moved to Broadway. In 1947 Ms. Simms went with the play when it moved to London. While in Britain, she married the American actor Richard Angerolla. (Her first marriage, to William Simms in 1941, ended in divorce.)         Under the name Julie Riccardo, she also sang in Paris nightclubs before returning to the United States in 1953 to make the film "The Joe Louis Story." Her other film role was in "The Black Widow" (1954).         She also appeared in "The Cool World" (1960), "Tambourines to Glory" (1963) and a revival of "The Madwoman of Chaillot" (1970) in New York theaters. On television, she was in the series "The Nurses."         As the director of the creative arts program of the New York State division of human rights in the 60's, she focused attention on discrimination and the lack of roles for black actors in film and television. After earning a master's degree in education from City College, she worked for drug treatment programs in New York.         In addition to her sister Evelyn, she is survived by her husband, of Los Angeles; two brothers, Richard Ricco of Minneapolis and Emil Moses Jr. of Tucson, Ariz., and two other sisters, Laura Thompson of New Orleans and Rose Napue of Minneapolis.       
         Jarmila Novotna, a Czech-born lyric soprano who sang major roles at the Metropolitan Opera from 1940 to 1956, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         She died of natural causes, said her daughter, Jarmila Packard.         Miss Novotna was widely considered one of the finest singing actresses of her time. Her interpretations of such roles as Donna Elvira, Euridice, Manon, Melisande, Antonia and Marenka were praised for their intelligence and lyrical grace. She also excelled in trouser roles, particularly Orlofsky in "Die Fledermaus," Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Octavian in "Der Rosenkavalier." On hearing her American debut in San Francisco in "Madama Butterfly" in 1939, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times: "There is grace, warmth, communicative feeling in all that she does."  'Charming Simplicity'         She made her Metropolitan debut in "La Boheme" in 1940, singing with Jussi Bjoerling. The Times review noted her "charming simplicity, feeling and high artistic intelligence." That year Downes also praised her "great" Violetta at the Met: "She conceived the music, from first note to last, dramatically, and portrayed the character with an aristocratic sensibility and simplicity.         "The word and the tone were indissoluble; the phrasing was that of the finest musician."         In her years at the Metropolitan Opera, Miss Novotna sang 193 performances -- 142 in the opera house, the rest on tour -- and won consistent praise for her expressiveness and musicianship.         Her acting abilities and regal appearance also led to other offers: the director Max Reinhardt urged her to devote herself to the theater; the studio head Louis B. Mayer asked her to become a film star. During the course of her career, she appeared in Hollywood films ("The Great Caruso," "The Search"), on Broadway (as an unscrupulous concert singer in the 1953 drama "Sherlock Holmes") and on television (as Kim Stanley's mother in a postwar drama set in France). But she resisted all attempts to steer her away from singing, which was her first love.  Art as Beauty         "Of course there are many important things in life besides music," she said in a 1989 interview in Opera News, "but that doesn't make music unimportant. If you love music, what would life be without it -- can you imagine? Art is what brings beauty into life."         Miss Novotna studied with Emmy Destinn and made her debut at the age of 17 with the Prague National Opera. She continued her studies in Milan and became a member of the Vienna State Opera from 1933 to 1938, eventually singing opera and concerts in most of the major houses of Europe. The Met invited her to sing in 1928, but she did not want to be separated from her future husband, the Baron George Daubek, whom she married in 1931.         Toscanini brought her to the attention of the Met again after she sang Pamina under his direction in Salzburg in 1937. She came to New York in 1940, arriving, she noted years later, the day Hitler marched into Prague.  A Recording Re-released         During the war years she recorded "Songs of Lidice," in memory of the victims of the Nazi massacre. The recording, recently rereleased on CD by Supraphon, presents folk songs of her native land; the piano accompaniments are by Jan Masaryk, the son of the former president of Czechoslovakia.         Masaryk died in 1948, and the loss of his protection led to the nationalization of the Daubeks' 3,700-acre estate and castle. That same year, Miss Novotna appeared in Fred Zinnemann's film "The Search," as a mother seeking her lost son at the end of World War II.         Miss Novotna moved from Vienna to New York after her husband's death in 1981. She was frequently seen at opera performances and at events celebrating the art of singing.         In addition to her daughter, of New York City, she is survived by a son, George Daubek of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Andrea Heinemann Simon, a community leader in Riverdale, the Bronx, died yesterday at her home there. She was 84.         The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter, Joanna Walker.         Mrs. Simon served for more than 30 years on the board of directors of the Riverdale Mental Health Association. She also worked for the association as a fund-raiser. In addition, she was a director of the Riverdale Chapter of the United Nations Association.         Her husband, Richard L. Simon, was a co-founder of Simon & Schuster, the publishers. He died in 1960.         Mrs. Simon is survived by three daughters, Carly Simon, the singer and composer, Lucy Levine and Joanna Walker, all of Manhattan, and a son, Peter Simon of Chilmark, Mass.       
         Mary Woodard Lasker, the philanthropist and champion of medical research and urban beautification, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 93 years old and also had an apartment on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said her nephew, James W. Fordyce. She made her last public appearance at a luncheon at the Pierre Hotel in October.         As a patron and volunteer lobbyist, Mrs. Lasker furthered medical research on cancer, heart and eye diseases and in other fields. She also lent her support to beautification projects in New York and Washington that included planting trees and flowers and providing fountains and lighting. And she was a noted hostess and art collector.         In her later years she reduced her activities, but at her death she was still president of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, honorary president of the American Cancer Society and a trustee and vice chairman of the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Education Foundation.         In a 1958 speech, Robert Moses, then the Parks Commissioner, said Mrs. Lasker possessed "the irresistible combination Madison Avenue dreams of -- the blend of many essences in the beautiful package."         "Intelligence, vision, generosity, charm, kindness -- Mary has them all," Moses continued. Co-Founded Lasker Awards         Mrs. Lasker and her husband Albert Davis Lasker, a pioneer advertising executive who died in 1952, established the Lasker Foundation in 1942. In almost every year since 1944, it has given Albert Lasker Awards, largely for outstanding contributions to clinical and basic medical research.         The foundation has often been quick to recognize significant new research, and its awards have great prestige. Besides supporting medical research and health programs, it has also given its backing to efforts to beautify New York and to activities in the arts.         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served variously as chairman of the board of the American Cancer Society, a trustee of Research to Prevent Blindness and of the Cancer Research Institute and a director of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. She was also active in other similar organizations.         "I am opposed to heart attacks and cancer and strokes," she used to say, "the way I am opposed to sin."         In addition, Mrs. Lasker strove to persuade Federal, state and city officials and legislators to provide more funds for medical research on major killing and crippling diseases. She worked to persuade Congress to increase appropriations for the National Institutes of Health and to set up additional research centers concentrating on specific diseases.         "Without money," she said in 1985, "nothing gets done." To make sure things got done, she used to visit the White House (during Democratic Administrations, she added wryly). She also paid calls on Washington legislators, corresponded with Presidents and arranged for scientists to meet Government leaders. 'I Couldn't Cut Up a Frog'         Despite her successes in furthering medical research, Mrs. Lasker used to contend that she lacked scientific and medical aptitude. "Nobody would have me in their laboratory for five minutes," she once said, also with a smile. "I couldn't cut up a frog, and I certainly couldn't perform surgery. I'm better at making it possible for other people."         Her passionate interest in medicine was fueled partly by illnesses of people around her and by her own health; she repeatedly had ear infections during her Wisconsin childhood. Laskers Lead to Nobels         Over the years, the Lasker Foundation helped shape medical history by recognizing and supporting promising research, and it has repeatedly singled out future winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Fifty-one Lasker winners have become Nobel laureates.         For instance, the foundation's prize jury, whose longtime chairman is the heart surgeon Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chose two winners of 1985 Albert Lasker Medical Research and Public Service awards -- Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas, for their studies of cholesterol chemistry in relation to the clogging of coronary arteries. They were also named Nobel Prize laureates that year.         Commenting on Mrs. Lasker's efforts, Dr. DeBakey said in a 1985 interview: "Mary Lasker is an institution unto herself. Asking what her importance has been is like asking what Harvard has meant to this country."         Throughout their history, Lasker awards have been given in every year except 1960, 1990 and 1992. In early 1990, when it was announced that no awards would be given that year, the foundation had assets of about $2.4 million, down from about $4.5 million in 1980, but an executive of the foundation said that omitting the awards, of $15,000 each, in that year "wasn't really a financial decision." Since then, the awards have been increased to $25,000 each. 'Annie Appleseed'         Like her passion for medical research, Mrs. Lasker's interest in and patronage of urban beautification was long standing. In a 1953 column in The New York Times, Meyer Berger referred to her affectionately as "Annie Appleseed."         Her beautification activities included furnishing funds for tulips, daffodils, begonias, chrysanthemums and other flowers at various locations in New York. Her other urban beautification projects ranged from lighted Christmas trees to 300 Japanese cherry trees donated to the United Nations.         Mrs. Lasker acquired her interest in parks and gardens during her girlhood in Watertown, Wis., where she was born to Frank Elwin Woodard, a banker, and Sara Johnson Woodard, who was a founder of two parks there.         She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1923 and studied briefly at Oxford. Then she went to work for the Reinhardt Galleries, in Manhattan, where her duties were, as she later put it, "arranging benefit loan exhibitions of outstanding old and modern French masters and selling pictures to collectors and museums." An Art Collector         She also went on buying trips abroad and began building an art collection of her own, which included works by Miro and Renoir. She sold most of the collection years later when she changed Manhattan homes, partly, as she said, "because I wanted to be able to give away the money."         In 1940, after leaving the art-gallery world, she married Mr. Lasker, who had achieved wealth and eminence as an advertising executive, having joined the Lord & Thomas advertising agency in 1898 and become its owner in 1908.         Two years later, he retired from active business and the Lasker Foundation was set up. In addition, drawing on his own experience in public affairs, he encouraged Mrs. Lasker to press Washington to provide more funds for research in medicine. In the decades that followed, her efforts in that direction bore many fruits.         One notable success was the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. "The N.I.H. has flowered," Dr. DeBakey recalled in the 1985 interview, "because in many ways she gave birth to it and nursed it. It was in existence, but it was she who got the funding for it."         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served on the boards of trustees or directors of a number of organizations and institutions, including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Museum of Modern Art, the Norton Simon Museum, New York University and Braniff Airways. Won Presidential Medal         She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, a Congressional Gold Medal in 1989, and other honors. A Health Sciences professorship at the Harvard School of Public Health was named for her in 1989, and a new variety of pink tulip was named for her in 1985.         Mrs. Lasker's first marriage, in 1926 to Paul Reinhardt, the owner of the Reinhardt Galleries, ended in divorce in 1934.         Her sister, Alice Fordyce, was the executive vice president of the foundation and director of the Lasker Awards program. She died in 1992.         In addition to her nephew, Mr. Fordyce of Greenwich, who is a trustee of the foundation, Mrs. Lasker is survived by a stepdaughter, Frances Lasker Brody of Los Angeles; a stepson, Edward Lasker of Los Angeles; three great-nephews; five step-grandchildren, one of whom, Christopher W. Brody of Manhattan, is also a trustee of the foundation, and two step great-grandchildren.         Funeral rites and burial are to be private. A memorial service is to be held in the spring.       
         Dr. Veronica M. Driscoll, a retired executive director of the New York State Nurses Association, died on Sunday at her home in Loudonville, N.Y. She was 67.         The cause was cancer, the association said.         In 1966, Dr. Driscoll was head of the group's negotiations for Registered Professional Nurses employed by the Department of Hospitals of New York City. Barred by law from striking, the nurses at one point threatened to quit by the thousands. The contract they won brought parity to nursing salaries in the public and private sectors.         Dr. Driscoll was also the chief strategist for the association in the revisions of the state law defining and governing nursing practices enacted in 1972.         A native of Brooklyn, she graduated from St. Catherine's Hospital School of Nursing in Brooklyn and earned degrees at St. John's University, New York University and Columbia University Teachers College, where she received a doctorate in education.         She held positions in nursing education and administration before she joined the nurses association, which has headquarters in Guilderland, N.Y., as deputy executive director 1960. She served as executive director from 1969 to 1979.         Dr. Driscoll filled the same position at the Foundation of the New York State Nurses Association in Loudonville and was a consultant to many other nursing organizations.         She is survived by a brother, John Driscoll of Melbourne, Fla., and two sisters, Catherine Ryan of Lake George, N.Y., and Dorothy Driscoll of Loudonville.       
         Willie Mae Ford Smith, a pioneering gospel singer, died on Wednesday at the Tower Village Nursing Home in St. Louis. She was 89.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Anthony Heilbut, a friend and her recording producer.         Mother Smith, as she was widely known, was one of the first singers to perform in the blues-influenced gospel style created by Thomas A. Dorsey in the 1920's and 30's. Her deep contralto and flamboyant vocal flights made her a leading performer of the 1930's and 40's, and she was a major influence on singers like Mahalia Jackson.         Willie Mae Ford was born in Rolling Fork, Miss., 1 of 14 children in a musical family. She moved to St. Louis at the age of 12, and sang with family members in the Ford Sisters. In 1927, she married James Peter Smith and began a career as a soloist.         She started working with Dorsey's National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses in the early 1930's, and she became the director of the convention's Soloist's Bureau, evaluating and training gospel singers until the late 1980's. During the 1930's and 40's, she constantly toured the Midwest with her adopted daughter, Bertha, as accompanist. But while her style and showmanship were widely imitated, she did not make her first recording until 1950. She later recorded albums for the Nashboro, Savoy and Spirit Feel labels.         In 1972 she began to receive national recognition after an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival. She appeared in the 1981 gospel documentary film "Say Amen, Somebody," and received a National Heritage Award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1988. She continued to perform regularly at the Lively Stone Apostolic Church in St. Louis until the early 1990's.         She is survived by her sisters Emma, Geneva and Georgie; a daughter, Jacqueline; a son, William; four grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren, all of St. Louis.       
         Doris C. Frankel, a playwright whose work found its way to Broadway, radio and television and who won an Emmy Award for her work on the soap opera "All My Children," died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was a stroke, said her son Benjamin R. Barber.         Ms. Frankel was the author of "Love Me Long," which starred Shirley Booth and Anne Jackson on Broadway in 1949. She also wrote "Don't Throw Glass Houses," which was produced on Broadway in 1938.         Ms. Frankel was born in Manhattan, and graduated from Radcliffe College in 1931. Her husband, Phillip Barber, was the New York director of the Federal Theater, and Ms. Frankel was one of those involved in founding the Group Theater in the 1930's. At that time she also taught at the Yale Drama School.         Ms. Frankel also helped create the radio characters Ma Perkins and Helen Trent. Her television work during the 1950's included dramas for "Playhouse 90" and "Hallmark Hall of Fame."         In later years she was a head writer for daytime television dramas and wrote scripts for "General Hospital" and "Search for Tomorrow" in addition to "All My Children," for which she received an Emmy in the 1970's.         In addition to her son Benjamin, of Piscataway, N.J., she is survived by another son, Willson Barber of Becket, Mass., and five grandchildren.       
         Anita Morris, an actress who was nominated for a 1982 Tony Award for her exuberant performance as a brassy redhead in black-lace body stocking in the musical "Nine," died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 50.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, the director Grover Dale.         Ms. Morris was acting in George Lucas's next film, "Radioland Murders," in Wilmington, N.C., in December when the cancer was discovered, Mr. Dale said. She was forced to leave the production, and started treatment at that time.         Her musical number in "Nine," "Call From the Vatican," choreographed by Tommy Tune, caused a brief controversy when CBS censors decided it was too risque and banished it from the 1982 Tony Awards program. Ms. Morris was nominated that year for best featured actress in a musical, and also won a Drama Desk award for her performance. Sexy Telephone Call         In the number, Carla (Ms. Morris), a mistress of the director Guido (Raul Julia), got through to her lover when he was on a movie set by pretending that her telephone call was from the Vatican. Dancing on a pedestal, she proceeded to woo him by telephone. Frank Rich, writing in The New York Times, called the number "a dazzling choreographic gem," adding that Ms. Morris "superbly executes a one-body simulation of two-body copulation."         Ms. Morris, who was born in Durham, N.C., studied at the National Academy of Dramatic Arts and began her performing career in the American Mime Theater.         An appearance in the chorus of "Jesus Christ Superstar" in 1972 led to roles on Broadway in "Seesaw" (1973) and "The Magic Show" (1974), in which she was directed by her husband. Ms. Morris subsequently took over several leading roles on Broadway, including those in "Sugar Babies" in 1980 and "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" in 1981.         On film, Ms. Morris played the mistress of Danny DeVito's character in "Ruthless People," and had roles in "The Hotel New Hampshire," "Maria's Lovers," "Absolute Beginners," "18 Again," "Blue City," "Me and the Kid" and "A Sinful Life."         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her parents, Dr. J. B. and Eloise Morris, and two brothers, Byron and Douglas, all of Durham, and a son, James.       
         Elsa Victoria Lorne Harvey, chief executive of Lorne-Harvey Publications in Larchmont, N.Y., died on Tuesday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. She was 62 and lived in Larchmont.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Harvey, known as Vicki, grew up in New York City, the daughter of Swedish immigrants. She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of City College.         Earlier in her career she worked as advertising director of Harvey World Famous Comics Inc., which had been founded by her future husband, Alfred Harvey. The company dealt with such titles as Blondie, Dick Tracy and Casper, the Friendly Ghost.         Lorne-Harvey Publications was formed in 1988 to re-issue some of her husband's earliest characters. These included the Black Cat. Company officials said a Black Cat motion picture is being prepared for production in Los Angeles by Motion PIcture Corporation of America.         Mrs. Harvey is survived by her husband; four sons, Alan, of Larchmont, Russel, of Manhattan, Adam, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Eric, of Larchmont; a stepdaughter, Shulamis Bush of Brooklyn; a sister, Ruth Korten of Winter Park, Fla.; a brother, Eric Lorne Sr. of Inverness, Fla., and three stepgrandchildren.       
         Mai Zetterling, the Swedish actress who went on to a career as one of Europe's busiest female film directors, died on Tuesday in London. She was 68 and had homes in London and in Banne, France.         The cause was cancer, said her agent, Joyce Edwards.         Ms. Zetterling was directing the film "The Woman Who Cleaned the World," which she had written, when she died.         Mai Elisabeth Zetterling was born in Vasteras, Sweden, to a working-class family. She left school barely literate, according to her 1985 autobiography, "All Those Tomorrows."         After working in a drug store and a mail-order company, she tried acting and was invited to join the Royal Dramatic Theater School in Stockholm. She made her stage and screen debuts when she was 17. Breakthrough in 'Torment'         Her sensitive portrayal of a simple girl victimized by a sadistic professor in "Torment" (released in the United States in 1947), created a sensation and is now considered a landmark of the Swedish cinema. The film, directed by Alf Sjoberg and written by Ingmar Bergman, was released under the title "Frenzy" in England and made her an international star.         She also appeared in "Frieda" (1947), "Desperate Moment" (1953), "Knock on Wood" with Danny Kaye (1954), "A Prize of Gold" with Richard Widmark (1955), "Abandon Ship!" with Tyrone Power (1957), "Only Two Can Play" with Peter Sellers (1961), "The Vine Bridge" (1965), "The Witches" (1990) and "Hidden Agenda" (1990).         In the 1960's and 1970's she was one of the few women who found regular work as a director. Her first effort, "The War Game" (1963), a short documentary, won a first prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1963. Many of her subsequent films dealt explicitly with female sexuality and focused on the role of women in society.         Among her directorial credits are "Loving Couples" (1964), "Night Games" (1966), "Doctor Glas" (1968), "The Girls" (1969), "Vincent the Dutchman" (1975), "Lady Policeman" (1979), "Of Seals and Men" (1979) "Scrubbers" (1983) and "Amorosa" (1986).         In later years she continued acting, co-starring with Anjelica Huston in Nicholas Roeg's 1990 film "The Witches."         Ms. Zetterling also wrote children's books, short stories and novels, one of which, "Night Games," she adapted and directed for the screen.         Her two marriages, to Tutte Lemkow, a Norwegian dancer, and the novelist David Hughes, ended in divorce. She is survived by a son and a daughter from her first marriage.       
         Dr. Gordon G. Wallace, a sociologist and expert on women's reproductive health, died on Thursday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. She was 75.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Patricia Sears, a spokeswoman for Population Action International, a research group in Washington.         Since 1980 Dr. Wallace had been the director of the African women's health project at Population Action International and was an authority on female genital mutilation.         She was also a member of the boards of family planning, environmental and civic organizations. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and in 1942 received a doctorate in sociology from Yale University.         She is survived by her husband of 48 years, Robert W. Wallace of Washington, and three sons, Randall, of Manhattan, Scott, of Washington, and Bruce, of Tinicum Township, Pa.       
         Lynn Solotaroff, a translator from Russian and a teacher, died on Monday at the Jewish Home & Hospital in New York. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer and emphysema, her family said.         Mrs. Solotaroff was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from the University of Michigan and studied Russian as a graduate student at the University of Chicago and Columbia University. At Columbia she became a visiting scholar at the Russian Institute -- now Harriman Institute -- and worked as its director of publications from 1977 to 1985.         Among the books she translated was Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilyitch" (1981). She also contributed to Avraham Yarmolinsky's translation of "Letters of Anton Chekhov" (1973), and most recently was working on her own edition and translation of Chekhov's stories.         For the last several years she also taught English as a second language at City College and Touro College.         Mrs. Solotaroff is survived by two sons, Paul, of Boston, and Ivan, of Manhattan; and two sisters, Bernice Silverstein of River Edge, N.J., and Sydelle Corwin of Potomac, Md. Her marriage to Ted Solotaroff ended in divorce.       
         Beatrice Card Fulcher, a retired educator with the Protestant Council of New York and the National Council of Churches, died last Sunday at Highland Farms, a retirement community near Black Mountain, N.C. She was 89.         Mrs. Fulcher, a native of Richmond, Me., was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Boston University. She started working as a high school Latin and English teacher in Massachusetts, and came to New York as an instructor at New York University.         Representing the Presbyterian Church, she served as director of Christian education for the Protestant Council's Manhattan division and the National Council of Churches for 28 years, beginning in 1938.

Mrs. Fulcher's husband, Dawson L. Fulcher Jr., died in 1961.       
         Claire Nichtern, who produced or helped to produce several dozen Broadway plays and musicals in her theatrical career, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Judith Nichtern.         From 1979 to 1985 Ms. Nichtern was president of Warner Theater Productions, a division of Warner Communications. During that period she produced over 30 plays and musicals for Warner, among them "Crimes of the Heart" by Beth Henley, which won a Pulitzer Prize.         In 1955 Ms. Nichtern took an aptitude test that suggested that theater production would be a good field for her talents. She accepted a job as a receptionist at the Phoenix Theater in Greenwich Village and rose quickly to casting director.         In the early 1960's she helped in the production of two short plays, "The Typist" and "The Tiger" by Murray Schisgal, starring Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, at the Theater de Lys. The production was an immediate success.         In 1965 Ms. Nichtern won the Tony Award as best producer of a drama for her Broadway production of Mr. Schisgal's comedy "Luv," directed by Mike Nichols and starring Mr. Wallach, Ms. Jackson and Alan Arkin. Among her other productions of the 1960's and 1970's were "The Banker's Daughter," "Jimmy Shine," "Cold Storage," "House of Blue Leaves," "Absent Friends" and "I Got a Song."         Ms. Nichtern's two marriages ended in divorce.         She is survived by her daughter and a son, David, both of Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Flagg Leet, who directed the forerunner of the Reid Hall campus of Columbia University in Paris for over 30 years, died on Thursday at Meadow Lakes nursing home in Heightstown, N.J. She was 99.         Under Miss Leet's leadership, Reid Hall became the focal point of interest in French-American cultural cooperation for many young American women students. It drew lecturers and guests in the arts, science, literature and public affairs and was also used as a residence hall for students.         In 1924 Miss Leet became the second director of what was then the American University Women's Club in Paris, an 18th-century house at 4 Rue de Chevreuse in Montparnasse. The name was changed in 1928 to honor its patron, Mrs. Whitelaw Reid, wife of an American minister to France in the 1880's.         Miss Leet left Paris in 1938 to become national secretary to the Foreign Policy Association in New York, returning to Reid Hall in 1946. She retired as president emeritus in 1964 when Reid Hall was turned over to Columbia.         Miss Leet also served from 1953 to 1956 as president of the International Federation of University Women. She was a 1917 alumna of Barnard College. Miss Leet received many awards for her cultural and scholastic activities, and in 1949 the French Government awarded her the rank of officer of the Legion of Honor.       
         Suzy Strain, a leading dancer with the Ballet Chicago, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 35.         The cause is being investigated, said Colleen Lober, the general manager of Ballet Chicago.         Ms. Strain had danced with the company since its founding and was a featured soloist in works that included "Steadfast Tin Soldier" and "Apollo," both by George Balanchine, and works by Daniel Duell, the director of the company, and Gordon Peirce Schmidt.

         Betty Furness, who went from doing television commercials for Westinghouse refigerators to pioneering the field of consumer affairs as a television journalist, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in New York City and Hartsdale, N.Y..         She had been treated for cancer for three years, said her husband, Leslie Midgley.         Her career spanned six decades. She began as a Hollywood actress in the 1930's and became a television spokeswoman for Westinghouse appliances in the 1950's. Between 1976 and 1992 she was a regular contributor to the "Today" program on NBC.         In 1967 President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her his special assistant for consumer affairs, though consumer groups feared that because of her association with Westinghouse, she would go easy on American industry.         She became a forceful advocate for American consumers, one who took strong stands on issues like credit regulation and federal meat inspection.         Elizabeth Mary Furness was born Jan. 3, 1916, in New York City. She was the daughter of an executive for Union Carbide. She attended the Brearley School and Bennett Junior College. Modeling and Acting         Her acting career began at age 14 when she got a modeling job with the John Robert Powers agency. Later Mr. Powers arranged for her to take a screen test.         She eventually went to Hollywood, where she appeared in 35 films, most of them low-budget productions, over the next six years.         Ms. Furness also worked in the theater in summer stock and road productions, among them "Doughgirls" and "My Sister Eileen," then moved to television.         In 1949 she had a small part in a CBS "Studio One" drama production that led Westinghouse to offer her the job as their spokeswoman. That lasted for 11 years.         She added the sentence "You can be sure if it's Westinghouse" to popular language in her live spots for refrigerators and vacuum cleaners.         She went on to do the ads in 1952 at the Republican and Democratic national conventions. Recruiter for Head Start         She first worked for President Johnson during the 1964 presidential campaign. Afterward was hired as a recruiter for the Head Start and Vista programs. In 1967 she became assistant to the President for consumer affairs.         She eventually became executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board and then commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs.         She joined WNBC-TV in New York City in 1974 and later made appearances on the network's "Today" show. As a reporter, she went from responding to consumer complaints to extensive investigations of issues like fetal alcohol syndrome, car safety and product liability lawsuits.         She is survived by her husband ; a daughter, Barbara Green; three stepchildren, Leslie Midgley, Andrea Connors and Peter J. Midgley, and two grandchildren.

Mrs. Pinn was born in Brooklyn and earned a bachelor's degree in education from City College and a master's degree in educational technology from Howard, in Washington. After writing columns for The Amsterdam News and The Queens Voice, she worked in the news and public-affairs department at CBS-TV and on the production staff of the PBS series "Black Journal."

         Julia Andrews Bissell, a patron of the arts and moving force in the restoration of the historic Kenmore mansion and museum in Fredericksburg, Va., died on Sunday at the Medical College of Georgia Hospital in Augusta. She was 87 and had homes in Chadds Ford, Pa., and Aiken, S.C.         She had been ill for a long time, her family said.         Mrs. Bissell, of the duPont family of Wilmington, Del., was also associated with the Winterthur Museum and Gardens near Wilmington. She was a past president and longtime member of the board of the Delaware Art Museum and a trustee of the Friends of American Art at Yale University.         Her patronage of Kenmore, a pre-Revolutionary Georgian mansion and one of the country's foremost house museums, spanned more than half a century. It was the home of Fielding Lewis, whose wife, Betty, was George Washington's only sister.         Kenmore, a rambling mansion, is noted for its interiors and period furnishings that are based on inventories taken in 1782 before the sale of the original contents. Over the years, Mrs. Bissell served as chairman of the collections and garden committees, chairman of the board of regents and, twice, as president of the board.         According to Vernon Edenfield, director of Kenmore, "through her gifts the collections were enriched and through her vast knowledge the museum grew and thrived."         In addition to her support for historic preservation, Mrs. Bissell was a noted horticulturist and expert in camellias, for which she won prizes at gardening competitions. Her winter home in Aiken, S.C. -- built in 1905 by her parents, James N. and Julia Sophie duPont Andrews -- is surrounded by woodland gardens.         Mrs. Bissell's husband, Alfred E., died in 1975.

She was 94 and had lived in Washington Heights until the late 1970's.         She had a long illness, Amnesty International said.         A native of Berlin, she received a doctorate at the University of Frankfurt and joined a resistance group shortly after the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933. She and her husband, Marcus, managed to flee to France, where she played a role in helping thousands of homeless refugee children.         French authorities deported the couple, who then were interned in Casablanca, spent a harsh 22 months in the Dominican Republic and finally arrived in New York with their young son in 1944. Dr. Grunwald worked as a file clerk but was able to obtain a master's degree at the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work with the help of her employer. 2d Career at Amnesty Group         She spent many years helping troubled youths through the Brooklyn Bureau of Social Service and other social-work agencies in the city.

She retired from her professional career in 1971 to join Amnesty and its board of directors, and led a group of local volunteers. She was named an honorary chairwoman of the organization in 1978, and later remained active at board meetings and in refugee committees.         Dr. Grunwald is survived by her son, George, of Benecia, Calif., and four grandchildren. Her husband died in 1949 after a long illness contracted in a concentration camp in Germany.       
         Louise Troy, a tall and elegant actress who was praised for performances in Broadway musicals, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60.         The cause was breast cancer, said Larry Keith, a friend.         Miss Troy was applauded for what critics called her sprightly, winning, handsome and vivid performance as Edward Woodward's impatient second wife in the 1964 musical "High Spirits," based on Noel Coward's comedy "Blithe Spirit."         "I lose three pounds a performance," she told an interviewer at the time, and her efforts won her a Tony Award nomination.         Miss Troy also received Tony nominations for her acting in the 1963 musical "Tovarich" and the 1966 musical "Walking Happy."         She had already won recognition for her acting in a 1954 production of Jean Cocteau's play "The Infernal Machine." One critic said she was able to take a classical play in stride without the solecisms familiar in the work of amateurs trained only for realism. Rarely Idle         From 1974 through 1980, Miss Troy had starring roles in a dozen plays, including Coward's "Private Lives" and Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya." She also appeared in regional theater over the years.         In addition, she appeared in a number of television series, including "The Defenders," "Hogan's Heroes," Room 222," "The Odd Couple" and "Kate and Allie." She also acted in the 1968 films "Yours, Mine and Ours" and "The Swimmer."         Miss Troy, who was born in Manhattan, studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and with Lee Strasberg.         Her 1969 marriage to Werner Klemperer, an actor, ended in divorce in 1974.         She is survived by her second husband, Douglas Seale, who is an actor and stage director.         A funeral service is scheduled for Monday at 11 A.M. at Grace Church, Broadway and 10th Street in Manhattan.       
         Dr. Dorothy F. Berezin, a child psychologist who served as a municipal welfare official from 1969 to 1978, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was kidney disease, said her daughter, Judith A. Berezin.         Dr. Berezin served as an assistant commissioner and director of child and adolescent services for the New York City Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services from 1971 to 1978. Previously she had been chief research scientist at that department involved in program planning.

         Patricia Miller King, director of the Radcliffe College library devoted to the history of women, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. Dr. King, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., was 56.         The cause was lung cancer, a Radcliffe announcement said.         In 1973 she became director of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe. In her 21-year tenure the library evolved into one of the nation's foremost centers for women's history. In 1993 the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation donated $2 million to endow the libarary's directorship.         Dr. King was also an officer of the National Council for Research on Women, the American Antiquarian Society and the Massachusetts Historical Society.         She graduated from Radcliffe in 1959 and received a doctorate in medieval history from Harvard University in 1970. As a graduate student she worked at the Women's Archives, a resource center that preceded the Schlesinger Library.         She is survived by three daughters, Victoria King of Minneapolis, Ellen Stein-Samel of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Amy Stein of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Mark Stein of Hamilton, Mass.; her mother, Amy Miller, and a brother, Donald Miller, both of New Port Richey, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
         Anni Albers, a leading textile artist of the 20th century, died yesterday at her home in Orange, Conn., near New Haven. She was the widow of the abstract artist Josef Albers and was 94 years old.         Mrs. Albers was cured of lymphoma 20 years ago and died of old age, said Dr. Samuel Bobrow, her physician.         "From her earliest days as a student and master at the Bauhaus in the 1920's, Anni Albers was an explorer and form giver in textiles," said Jack Lenor Larsen, the New York designer and textile producer. "And in America, she continued in her role as a prophet, teacher and innovative weaver."  A Reluctant Weaver         Mrs. Albers was the last surviving teacher at the Bauhaus, the German design school founded at Weimar in 1919, and closed by the Nazis in 1933. When she enrolled as a student at the Bauhaus in 1922, she hoped to study wall painting but became a weaver reluctantly, when no other workshop was available.         After she received her diploma in 1930, Mrs. Albers and her husband, whom she had met at the Bauhaus and married in 1925, stayed on as teachers, he in design, she as a part-time instructor in textiles and as the acting director of the weaving workshop. When the Bauhaus moved to Berlin in 1932, they moved with it, and Josef Albers continued teaching while Mrs. Albers worked privately as a weaver.         In 1933, after the Gestapo had padlocked the doors of the Bauhaus, Mrs. Albers met the architect Philip Johnson, then at the Museum of Modern Art, who was visiting Berlin and asked her if she and her husband wished to come to the United States. On his return to New York, he spoke with Edward Warburg, the art patron, who was assisting the founders of the Black Mountain College in North Carolina, a progressive school of the arts.  A Solo Exhibition         Though they spoke no English, and did not know where North Carolina was, the Alberses went. From 1933 to 1939, she was an assistant professor of art at Black Mountain. In 1949, she became the first weaver to have a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, the museum which owns the finest collection of her works.         Mrs. Albers's textiles reflected the Abstract style in painting in their geometric patterns and complex weaves. She used knotting and intertwining of linked threads to enrich the texture of her works. She also designed fabrics for Knoll International. Her 1926 designs for rugs are now being produced by Larsen Carpet. And her 1950's books, "On Weaving" and "On Designing," are considered a must for enthusiasts and students of design.         When she was 70, Mrs. Albers gave up weaving and became a printmaker, at which she was prolific for more than a decade. She produced many editions for Tamarind Lithography Workshop and Gemini G.E.L., both of Los Angeles, and Tyler Graphics of Mount Kisco, N.Y.  A Cameo Role         In her 80's, she made her debut in films in 1984, playing a cameo role looking at unedited film, in Maximilian Schell's "Marlene."         Born in Berlin and named Annelise Fleischmann, she was the daughter of a prosperous furniture manufacturer. Mrs. Albers began her art studies as a teen-ager studying drawing and painting with Martin Brandenburg, an impressionist painter. She also attended the School of Applied Art in Hamburg before going to the Bauhaus.         She is survived by her brother, Hans Farman of Old Greenwich, Conn.       
         Elizabeth Birdsall Burdick, the founding director of the International Theater Institute Library in New York, died last Friday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         She had a heart attack in her home, her family said.         A native of Haddonville, N.J., Mrs. Burdick graduated from Wellesley College and the Yale Drama School. She began her career as a production secretary on Broadway.         In 1969, she founded and organized the library for the institute and served as its archivist and curator until her retirement in 1988. The library holds resource materials from 146 countries and about 13,000 foreign play scripts.         Mrs. Burdick is survived by her husband, John; two sons, Owen of Jersey City and Richard of Manhattan; her brother, Robert Birdsall of Haddonfield, and two grandchildren.       
         Arden Fingerhut, a prolific designer for the theater whose lighting and stage effects highlighted dozens of Broadway productions in the last 20 years, died yesterday at the North Adams Regional Hospital in North Adams, Mass. She was 48 and lived in Pownal, Vt.         The cause was breast cancer, said her husband, Dennis McHugh.         Arden Fingerhut designed the lighting for such major productions as "Da," "Bent," "Hay Fever," "Plenty" and "Driving Miss Daisy." She sometimes had as many as 20 productions on the boards in one theater season.         In addition to Broadway and Off Broadway theater, she designed the lighting for regional companies, including the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven and the Williamstown (Mass.) Theater Festival.         Her work with the New York Shakespeare Festival included the 1988 productions of "Julius Caesar" and "King John."         In 1982 she received an Obie Award for sustained excellence in lighting design.         She was a professor of theater and a former chairman of the theater department at Williams College, a trustee of the Williamstown Theater Festival and a director of the Theater Communications Group in New York.         In addition to Mr. McHugh, a daughter, Maude Mikulewicz of Pownal, survives.       
         Natalia Danesi Murray, a publishing executive and book editor in New York from the 1950's through the 1970's, died on Thursday at her son's home in Del Mar, Calif. She was 92.         The cause was heart failure, according to an announcement by the Helen Brann Agency.         Mrs. Murray was the head of the New York office of the Italian publishing house Mondadori in the 1950's. Later, she was the director of the New York office of Rizzoli, another Italian publisher, from the 1960's through the 1970's. She was instrumental in taking the works of American writers to Italian readers.         In 1985, Random House published "Darlinghissima: Letters to a Friend," by Janet Flanner, who, under the pseudonym Genet, wrote the "Letter From Paris" column in The New Yorker. Mrs.Murray, a longtime friend of Miss Flanner, edited the book and added commentary.         Mrs. Murray was born in Rome. In 1924 she married William Murray, the head of the William Morris Agency in New York, and moved to New York. They were divorced in 1936. Mrs. Murray acted on Broadway in the 1930's.         In World War II she helped NBC broadcast a short-wave news program to Italy.         She is survived by her son, William Murray, an author and foreign correspondent, and three grandchildren, all of Del Mar.

         Billie Leibowitz Kotlowitz, an administrator at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 67 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Robert Kotlowitz.         Mrs. Kotlowitz was for a decade, until her death, the executive director of the college's thematic studies program, an undergraduate program in the liberal arts. The program was founded in 1972 to demonstrate the links between history, literature and other fields in the humanities.         Mrs. Kotlowitz became the first counselor on the program's staff in 1973 after earning a master's degree in academic and personal counseling from the Bank Street College of Education in 1972.         In the early 1980's, she became its executive director while continuing to provide academic and personal counseling to students. She also directed classes about alcohol and drug problems, among other roles at the college.         A native of Baltimore, she graduated from Goucher College there in 1949.         In addition to her husband, a novelist and a former editor and executive of WNET, she is survived by two sons, Daniel, a theatrical-lighting designer, of Manhattan, and Alex, an author, of Oak Park Ill., and a sister, Peggy L. Snyder of Manhattan.       
         Frances Corey, a fashion executive whose career of six decades began before the era of the flappers and took in space-age fabrics developed for astronauts, died on Thursday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 91.         She suffered a brief illness, said Keven Bellows of Los Angeles, a family friend.         Ms. Corey's working life began at the age of 19 when she opened a bookstore in the Annex of the Marshall Field department store in Chicago. She subsequently became director of fashion and advertising for Bloomingdale's in New York.         Moving to Los Angeles in 1943, she was named sales-promotion and advertising manager of the May Company. She returned to New York in 1953 to join R. H. Macy & Company as an executive vice president -- the first woman to rise to that executive level at Macy's.         Ms. Corey moved back to California in 1960 to head the West Coast office of Grey Advertising. Over the years, she also served as senior vice president of Catalina, a sportswear company based in Los Angeles, and as a merchandising and marketing consultant for Bullock's department stores.         The space age entered her career when she was engaged as a consultant by a center at the University of Southern California that evaluated products developed for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. She advised the center about the commercial potential of the products and, with her husband, George Corey, founded Environmental Concepts Products to market them.         In the 1970's and 1980's, she was associated with the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, lecturing and meeting weekly with students for career counseling. At a luncheon held in 1982 in a hall named after her, the institute honored her for her contributions.         In 1956, Fortune magazine ranked her among the top businesswomen in the United States, and she won the National Retail Merchants Gold Medal for retailing twice.         Ms. Corey is survived by a daughter, Mary Corey, and a granddaughter, both of Beverly Hills. Her husband died last year.       
         Mary Anne Devanna, an associate dean at the Columbia University Business School, died on Saturday at her home in Ardsley, N.Y. She was 55.         The cause was leukemia, said Maryann Hedaa, an associate professor at the business school.         Dr. Devanna earned her Ph.D. in human resources management from the Columbia Business School in 1982. Beginning in 1988, she was named a research professor and an associate dean, becoming one of the highest-ranking women at the school.         Previously, she was director of executive education at the school and, earlier, an advertising executive.         She was co-author of the book "The Transformational Leader: Molding Tomorrow's Corporate Winners," published in 1986.

         Fiona Baan, the director of dressage and driving programs for the United States Equestrian Team, died on Sunday at her home in Chester, N.J. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, a team spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Baan was responsible for training this country's international teams in driving and dressage and coordinated national championships from which the United States Olympic team was selected.         In the international sport of driving, either four or two horses are guided by one driver in a carriage. In dressage, a rider controls a horse through a series of intricate movements. A Bronze Medal         A highlight of her career came in 1992 at the Barcelona Olympics when the American dressage squad took the bronze after 16 years without an Olympic medal in that competition.         Mrs. Baan's job covered all aspects of administering the two disciplines for the United States Equestrian Team, with headquarters in Gladstone, N.J. She managed the teams for the North American Dressage Championships in 1985 and 1989; the 1986 World Dressage Championships, and the 1989 and 1991 Pairs World Driving Championships.         She managed the 1989, 1990 and 1991 Olympic dressage teams and served as chef d'equipe, or team manager, for the dressage team at the 1987 Pan American Games. In 1991, she helped organize the Equestrian Team's Festival of Champions, having previously set up dressage championships and selection trials at Gladstone.         Born in Scotland, Mrs. Baan took up riding in the Cotswolds in England. She became versed in all its sports aspects, including dressage and show jumping. She entered the hotel business and worked in England, Bermuda, Florida and Nevada before settling in New Jersey.         She hunted with the hounds and successfully competed herself while working for the Equestrian Team. She began with the team in 1966 as a secretary.         Mrs. Baan is survived by her husband, Leslie, and a daughter, Natalie.       
         K. T. Stevens, a theater, film and television actress and a theatrical-union official, died on June 13 at her home in Brentwood, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was lung cancer, said Dick Moore, a spokesman for the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.         Ms. Stevens, whose original name was Gloria Wood, was born in Hollywood. Her father was the film director Sam Wood. She began acting in plays and films as a child, using the stage name Katherine Stevens. After starring in the radio soap opera "Mr. Pepper's Family" and taking ingenue roles on the stage, she made her Broadway debut in "The Land Is Bright" in 1941. She also appeared on Broadway in "Nine Girls" (1943) and "Laura" (1947).         In the 1940's and 50's Ms. Stevens played leading roles in such films as "Address Unknown" (1944), "Port of New York," (1949), "Harriet Craig" (1950) and "Vice Squad" (1953). More recently, she appeared in "Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice" (1969) and "Pets" (1974).         Her television credits include appearances on "I Love Lucy," "The Rifleman," "The Patty Duke Show" "Mannix," "Days of Our Lives" and "General Hospital." For more than five years she played Vanessa on "The Young and the Restless."         Ms. Stevens served on local and national boards of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists from 1978 until her death. She was president of the union's Los Angeles local from 1986 to 1989.         Her marriage to the film actor Hugh Marlowe ended in divorce in 1967. She is survived by two sons, Jeffrey and Chris, both of Los Angeles, and a granddaughter.       
         Peggy Newcomer Pollack, the recently named associate publisher of Mademoiselle magazine, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 38 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was colon cancer, said Nancy Newcomer Vick, her sister.         Ms. Pollack was previously the magazine's advertising director. Earlier she was advertising director of Mirabella magazine.         She was born in Lancaster, Pa., and received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in French literature from New York University.         In addition to her sister Nancy Vick, of Bedford, N.Y., she is survived by her companion, Paul Wigsten; her parents, Judge Clarence C. and Jane Newcomer, of Lancaster, Pa., and Philadelphia, and another sister, Judy Birkett of Lancaster.

         Phyllis J. Shorenstein, a founder of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, died on Wednesday at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center. She was 76 and lived in San Francisco.         Mrs. Shorenstein had a heart ailment and died after a long illness, doctors said.         The wife of Walter Shorenstein, a national real estate developer, Mrs. Shorenstein was also a substantial contributor to local charities and universities.         Mayor Frank Jordan of San Francisco, in a tribute, said that Mrs. Shorenstein and her husband had contributed much to the city's cultural, social and civic life and had "consistently helped make this city a better place for all of us."         Art, particularly Asian art, was an enduring interest in Mrs. Shorenstein's life. She joined with other San Franciscans to create the Asian Art Museum, which opened in Golden Gate Park in 1966. She served as a board member for many years and was one of the museum's 27 commissioners at her death. Gallery Named for Family         She last visited the museum in May, when it opened an exhibition and named one of its four galleries of Japanese art in honor of the Shorenstein family. Although she was particularly devoted to Japanese and Chinese art, her tastes also extended to Western works. Her personal collection included both European and American art.         Mrs. Shorenstein made frequent visits abroad in search of additions to the museum's collection, accompanied by Rand Castile, the museum's director. "She began at the Asian Art Museum at its beginning, and she was with us every step of the way," Mr. Castile said yesterday. In the last 20 years, the Shorenstein family has donated works from China, Japan, India, Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey.         With her family, Mrs. Shorenstein established the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. The center was named in honor of her daughter, a journalist and radio news producer who died of cancer in 1986.         Mrs. Shorenstein was born Phyllis Finley in Wellington, Kan., and attended Lone Mountain College in San Francisco.         She was a volunteer ambulance driver at Travis Air Force Base when she met Walter Shorenstein, who was stationed there during World War II.         Mr. Shorenstein became a leading commercial real estate developer and a prominent contributor to Democratic Party causes. She was not active in politics, but the Shorensteins frequently entertained political dignitaries, including Presidents Johnson, Carter and Clinton.         She is survived by her husband of 49 years; two children, Carole Shorenstein-Hays and Douglas Shorenstein, both of San Francisco, and six grandchildren.       
         Dr. Margaret Shaughnessy Gordon, who became a prominent economist in an academic discipline long dominated by men, died on Saturday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Gordon was a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, where she had served as associate director of the Institute of Industrial Relations from 1954 until 1969. She produced numerous books and studies on health, welfare, employment and, later, higher education.         One of her books, "Employment Expansion and Population Growth: The California Experience, 1900-1950," published in 1954, was among the first analyses to arrive at the conclusion that California, more than any other state, depended on military spending. Another, "Social Security Policies in Industrial Countries: An International Perspective" (Cambridge University Press, 1989) remains in print.         Other books by Dr. Gordon included "Barrier to World Trade" (1941), "The Economics of Welfare Policies" (1963), "Retraining and Labor Market Adjustment in Western Europe" (1965), and "Youth Education and Unemployment Problems: An International Perspective" (1979). Role in War on Poverty         She drafted more than a dozen reports for the Carnegie Commission and Council on Higher Education while serving consecutively as associate director of both from 1969 to 1979. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the Commission on Income Maintenance Programs to examine all "welfare and related programs" in his War on Poverty.         A native of Wabasha, Minn., she graduated from Bryn Mawr College and received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1935. In World War II she worked in the Federal Government's Office of Price Administration.         Dr. Gordon's husband, Robert A. Gordon, who died in 1978 after the couple had been married 42 years, was also a Harvard-educated ecomonics professor, as were her two sons. In Berkeley she was active in civic affairs and was a committeewoman with the Democratic Party of Alameda County. Her husband was also a professor of economics at Berkeley.         She is survived by her sons, Robert J., of Evanston, Ill., an economics professor at Northwestern University, and David M., of Manhattan, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research. .       
         Josephine Moy Hong, active in Chinese-American affairs and Republican Party politics, died on Sunday in Flushing Hospital. She was 93 and lived in Jamaica Estates, Queens.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Hong was born in Boston but spent much of her childhood in southern China, where her father moved when she was 8 years old to help develop the mining industry.         She returned to the United States in 1917 and studied economics and psychology at the University of Chicago and New York University. In 1923 she married Louis Fong Sui Hong, who was instrumental in expanding operations in Asia for the National City Bank of New York. The family went to live at Shanghai's International Settlement, an enclave of foreigners guarded by Western forces, when the Japan invaded China in 1937. Mrs. Hong tended to the wounded and sick while under bombardments.         Back in the United States in 1939, she organized a group of Chinese volunteers to raise funds for war refugees in New York. After Pearl Harbor, she served as a director of the National Board of the American Women's Voluntary Service and as chairman of its Chinese unit in New York.         In the decades since, she held leading positions in the Chinese Women's Benevolent Association, the Institute of Chinese Culture, the Chinese Cultural Renaissance Society and the Asian American Assembly, among others.         She turned to Republican Party politics in the 1960's and was vice president of the New York State Republican Heritage Groups Council.         She was inducted as a Life Member of the Republican Party in 1979. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan named her to his Peace Corps Advisory Council.         Mrs. Hong is survived by three sons; Alfred of Jamaica Estates, Robert of Syosset, L.I., and Morris of Fresh Meadows, Queens; a daughter, Virginia Wei of Princeton, N.J.; a brother, Herbert Moy of Chicago; a sister, Mae Wu of Berkeley, Calif.; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         The Rev. Beatrice Blair, associate priest at St. George's Episcopal Church on East 16th Street, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in the East Village.         The cause was a heart attack, her husband, John Robbins, said.         Her ordination in 1978 put her among the first female priests in the Episcopal Church. She had served at St. George's for the last four years, after assignments at the Church of the Heavenly Rest and St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery. Scion of Blair House Family         A native of Boston, Ms. Blair was raised in Washington, a scion of the family that gave Blair House to the United States Government, which turned it into a residence for dignitaries visiting Washington as guests of the White House. She attended Bryn Mawr College but graduated from the Manhattan branch of Empire State College, and trained for the priesthood at the General Theological Seminary, in Manhattan.         Before moving to New York from Rochester, she was a president of the Monroe County League of Planned Parenthood and the founding president of Eleanor's List, a group formed to raise funds for female candidates who support abortion rights. In the early 1970's, she was also executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.         More recently, she was a leader in the New York Metropolitan Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights.         Besides her husband, Ms. Blair is survived by a daughter and three sons from a previous marriage: Elizabeth Hillard of Pleasant Hill, Calif., Harper Sibley Jr. of Portland, Me., Blair Sibley of Miami, and Durbin Sibley of Corpus Christi, Tex.; three sisters, Judy Green of Cincinnati, Betsy Douglas of Missoula, Mont., and Edith Blair of Alexandria, Va., and nine grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Collins, a singing star of the popular 1950's television show "Your Hit Parade" and a Tony nominee for the Broadway show "Follies" in 1971, died on Thursday at her home in Watervliet, N.Y. She was 67.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Melissa Holgate.         As a featured singer on "Your Hit Parade" from 1950 to 1957, Miss Collins was America's singing sweetheart, noted for her trademark high-necked blouses and such standard songs as "Too Young," "Shrimp Boats" and "Harbor Lights." The show was the television version of the long-running radio program "Lucky Strike Hit Parade" and featured the top tunes of the week performed by the show's cast in a variety of costumes and settings. Other members of the cast during Miss Collins's time included Snooky Lanson, Gisele MacKenzie, June Valli and Russell Arms.         Miss Collins, whose original name was Marjorie Chandler, was born on Nov. 18, 1926 in Windsor, Ontario. Her first career thoughts were for secretarial work, but when her parents entered her in a talent show in 1938, she won a wristwatch and a chance to sing on a children's radio program in nearby Detroit. She was such a hit that she stayed with the show for some time. Met Her Mentor at 16         In 1942, she was introduced to the band leader Raymond Scott, who advised her to take voice lessons for a year and then to sing for him again. She subsequently sang with his quintet and performed in jazz spots across the country. In 1949, Mr. Scott left his group to become director of the orchestra for the radio show "Your Hit Parade," and Miss Collins stayed on the road and ran the quintet. That meant doing the introductions as well as singing. Speaking Mr. Scott's lines, she was actually doing her first announcing.         "It was quite a terrifying experience," she said in a 1953 interview, but it took her closer to the earnest commercials that were to contribute to her fame.         She and Mr. Scott were married in 1952.         Early in 1950, the American Tobacco Company, sponsor of "Your Hit Parade" for Lucky Strike cigarettes, was looking for a new type of advertising commercial. Mr. Scott was commissioned to write some jingles, which eventually gained nationwide popularity, and he had Miss Collins sing them. The sponsor liked her voice and personal appearance and when televising "Your Hit Parade" was broached, she was selected for four trial telecasts. Impressed by this cheerful woman who told people to get happy by smoking a particular cigarette, the sponsor signed her to do the commercials and to be a featured singer when the show began its official run in October 1950. Letters From the Clergy         In a 1979 interview, Miss Collins was asked if she liked her girl-next-door image.         "Yes, because that's me, and you can't be what you aren't," she replied. "I was very protected when I was growing up, and there's a lot that I don't know. When I was on 'Hit Parade,' the bulk of my mail was from priests and nuns. They used to do sermons on all the good I was doing for American womanhood."         After "Your Hit Parade" went off the air, she did a stint on "'Candid Camera," from 1961 to 1963. In 1971 she was given a starring role in the Stephen Sondheim musical "Follies," singing one of the show's big songs, "Losing My Mind" and receiving a Tony nomination for her performance. She also had leading roles in stock companies and dinner-theater productions and gave concerts across the country. Plagued with asthma for years, she retired from performing in 1980.         She was also active for many years in the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and became a vice president of the organization in 1988.         Her two marriages, to Mr. Scott and to the singer Ron Holgate, ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Holgate, who lives in Watervliet, she is survived by two other daughters, Elizabeth Adams, also of Watervliet, and Deborah Studebaker of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.       
         Ann McGarry Buchwald, wife of the columnist Art Buchwald and an author and former literary agent, died on Sunday at her home in Washington. She was 74.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         In the 1970's Mrs. Buchwald was a Washington partner of Irving Lazar, one of Hollywood's top literary and talent agents. But in 1974, after Mr. Lazar agreed to try to sell the memoirs of former President Richard M. Nixon, Mrs. Buchwald ended her partnership, citing a conflict of principle because her husband had written many satirical columns about Watergate and Mr. Nixon.         Besides her autobiography, "Seems Like Yesterday," Mrs. Buchwald was the co-author of "White Gloves and Party Manners" (Robert B. Luce, 1965) and "Stand Up, Shake Hands, Say 'How Do You Do' " (Robert B. Luce, 1969).         Mrs. Buchwald, who was born in Warren, Pa., was also a fashion coordinator for Neiman-Marcus in Dallas, and later was a publicity director for Pierre Balmain in Paris. In 1950, while still in Paris, she opened a public relations firm. She met Mr. Buchwald there the same year, and they married in 1952.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Connie Marks of Culpeper, Va., and Jennifer Buchwald of Boston; a son, Joel, of Denver; three grandchildren, five sisters and two brothers.       
         Zelma Watson George, a sociologist, musicologist and performer who broke a color barrier on Broadway in 1950, died on Sunday at University Hospitals in Cleveland. A resident of Cleveland, she was 90.         The cause was heart failure, said Raoul Abdul, a New York writer and longtime friend.         Dr. George was a sought-after lecturer, a trained soprano and a leading researcher of African-American music. Her encounter with Broadway was brought about by the composer Gian Carlo Menotti for the 1950 production of "The Medium," a folk opera, at the Arena stage of the Hotel Edison.         Dr. George had sung the opera's leading role of Madame Flora, a fraudulent spiritualist, at the dedication of the Karamu Lyric Theater in Cleveland the year before. 'Power and Imagination'         That production was a black version of the 1946 Menotti work. Learning of her performance, the composer brought her to New York to sing the part in a white production. She was the first black woman to take a white role on Broadway.         "She has great personal force," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. "She sings with power and imagination."         In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her as the only black member of the United States delegation to the 15th General Assembly of the United Nations. In the late 1960's, she was the executive director of the oldest Job Corps center in the United States, in Cleveland. The State Department once sent her on a six-month lecture tour around the world.         Dr. George was born in Hearne, Tex., and graduated from the University of Chicago. She studied voice at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago and pipe organ at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. She briefly worked as a social worker in Evanston and spent seven years as a probation officer in Chicago.         From 1932 to 1937, she was the dean of women at Tennessee State University in Nashville. She then helped to organize the Avalon Community Center in Los Angeles and served as its executive director until she was named a Rockefeller Foundation research fellow in 1942. Studying Black Music         Starting early in her career, Dr. George lectured on the cultural contributions of blacks. In 1935 she began her research on black music and started a lecture series on human relations.         She returned to school to earn master's and doctoral degrees in sociology at New York University. Her Rockefeller grant enabled her to travel the country and cull data from libraries, private collections, cellars and attics. She spent six months in the Library of Congress alone.         The result was her doctoral thesis, "A Guide to Negro Music: An annotated bibliography of Negro folk music and art music by Negro composers or based on Negro thematic material." It was a compendium of 12,163 titles; she donated the manuscript to Howard University.         Dr. George sat on policy-making boards of the Girl Scouts of America, the American Red Cross, the League of Women Voters and the National Conference of Christians and Jews, among others.         She was married to Clayborne George, a lawyer in Cleveland and a prominent Republican there. He died many years ago.         Dr. George is survived by two sisters, A. Catherine Johnson of Massachusetts, and Vivian Edwards of Los Angeles, and a brother, Samuel E. J. Watson of Bangor, Mich.       
         Jane Preddy, an architectural historian specializing in theatrical architecture, died on Friday at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. She was 59 and lived in Wappingers Falls, N.Y.         The cause was injuries suffered in an automobile accident, said her son, Phil D. Carroll.         Ms. Preddy was the founder of Architecture on Stage, a foundation for the study of theaters in New York, and an expert on the life on John Eberson, who designed many Art Deco theaters. Her first show as the director of the gallery at the City College School of Architecture was devoted to New York's theaters of the 1930's. A member of the City Municipal Art Society and several theater restoration groups, she also taught at City College and lectured around Manhattan.         In addition to her son, of Austin, Tex., she is survived by three grandchildren.       
         Mary C. McDonald, a retired assistant director of continuing education for the New York City schools, died on Monday at her home in Rockville Centre, L.I. She was 83.         The cause was chronic kidney failure, her family said.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. McDonald graduated from Hunter College and Columbia University Teachers College. She took a job as a substitute teacher during the Depression, then in the mid-1930's became the Department of Parks director of recreation for Queens.         She returned to the Board of Education in 1948 and specialized in adult literacy and English as a second language. She was also a consultant to the State Division of Higher Education, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Governments of Egypt and Greece. She retired from the school system in 1971.         Mrs. McDonald is survived by a son, Dr. Brian F. of Rockville Centre; a sister, Anna Gordon of Bayside, Queens, and two grandchildren. Her husband of 34 years, F. Joseph McDonald, died in 1983.       
         Anne Freeman Turpin, a retired director of special learning at St. Bernard's School in Manhattan, died yesterday at her home in Richmond. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Douglas Ochs Adler.         Throughout her life, Mrs. Turpin worked with children who had learning problems. She began her teaching career at the Birch Wathen Lenox School in Manhattan in 1971, and moved in 1977 to St. Bernard's School, from which she retired in 1992.         Mrs. Turpin, a native of Richmond, lived in Manhattan for 45 years after her graduation from Vassar College in 1945. In 1970, she received a master's degree from Teachers College at Columbia University.         She was the daughter of Douglas Southall Freeman, the editor of The Richmond News Leader and a biographer of George Washington and Robert E. Lee.         She is survived by her husband, A. Royall Turpin Jr. of Richmond; her son, of Takoma Park, Md.; two daughters, Anne Adler Tarbell and Mary Ballard Malhotra, both of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Katherine Turpin Gnugnoli of Washington and Mary Turpin Barradale of Richmond; a sister, Mary Tyler McClenahan of Richmond; a brother, James Douglas Freeman of Richmond, and three grandchildren.       
         Danitra Vance, an actress and performance artist who appeared in "The Colored Museum" and "Spunk" at the New York Shakespeare Festival, died on Sunday at the home of her grandfather, Clarence M. Edwards, in Markham, Ill. She was 35 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was breast cancer, said her companion, Jones Miller.         Once described as a cross between Laurie Anderson and Little Richard, Ms. Vance appeared in feature films and in 1985 became the first black woman to join the regular cast of "Saturday Night Live."         But it was through her association with George C. Wolfe, the playwright and director who is now the producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival, that Ms. Vance was best known to theatergoers. In "Spunk," Mr. Wolfe's 1990 adaptation of stories by Zora Neale Hurston, she demonstrated "exceptional range in playing a trio of women who are in turn worn to the bone, full of sass and aglow with innocence," wrote Frank Rich in The New York Times. Ms. Vance received an Obie Award for her performance.         Ms. Vance was born in Chicago. She attended the National College of Education in Evanston, Ill.; Roosevelt College in Chicago, from which she graduated with honors, and the Webber-Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After performing with the Second City comedy troupe in Chicago, she moved to New York in 1981, where she became an Off Broadway success with her 1985 revue "Danitra Vance and the Mell-o White Boys." In it, she created a range of comic characters including a ghetto Shakespearean actress, a feminist stripper and a genteel "lesbian recruiter."         Ms. Vance last appeared at the Public in the spring as the guardian angel in Jose Rivera's "Marisol." After breast cancer was diagnosed in 1990, she used her experience of the illness in a performance piece called "The Radical Girl's Guide to Radical Mastectomy." "Pre-Shrunk," an autobiographical show in which she expanded on this material, was scheduled at the Public Theater last season, but Ms. Vance was unable to perform.         In addition to Ms. Miller and Mr. Edwards, Ms. Vance is survived by her mother, Laura Vance of Chicago, and a sister, Latrice Lee, of Markham.       
         Dr. Marion F. Langer, a former executive director of the American Orthopsychiatric Association and an expert on widowhood, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was cancer, said Karen Kun of the association's staff.         Dr. Langer, who had a Ph.D. in sociology from New York University, was on the boards of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, in Washington, and the National Coalition Against Censorship.         She was the orthopsychiatric association's executive director from 1953 until she retired in 1988. The association, which has its headquarters in Manhattan, was founded in 1924 by Karl Menninger (1893-1990), the psychiatrist, and others to advance a preventive approach to treating mental illness. Orthopsychiatry offers treatment through a collaborative approach involving such fields as psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric social work and other sciences.         Her writings included a book, "Learning to Live as a Widow," published in 1957. In an interview in 1963, she said that widows usually blame their husbands for dying, although that feeling is irrational.         "Unlike the divorcee, who is expected freely to express her resentment toward her former spouse, the widow is not supposed to be angry," Dr. Langer said. As a result, she said, feelings of anger are repressed and affect the widow's social relationships.         Dr. Langer was born and raised in Newburgh, N.Y. and studied at Smith College and elsewhere before receiving her Ph.D. in 1949. She was assistant director of the Child Study Association of America before going to the Orthopsychiatric Association.         Over the years, she taught at City College, New York University, the Hunter College School of Social Work and elsewhere.         She married Julius Rosenberg, a lawyer, in 1940; he died in 1948. Her 1957 marriage, to Samuel Gruber, also a lawyer, ended in divorce in 1973.         Dr. Langer is survived by a son, Seth Rosenberg of Chatham, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Donna Kay Price, a Westchester County real estate executive and former director of the Lighthouse for the Blind of New York and Westchester, died on Saturday at Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 59 and lived in Waccabuc, N.Y.         Mrs. Price died of head injuries suffered in a fall at her home, her family said.         Mrs. Price, who was blind, was a longtime fund-raiser for the Seeing Eye Inc. in Morristown, N.J., which trains guide dogs for the blind. She was a past member of the board of the Lighthouse Inc. of New York and its Westchester division.         "She was a devoted supporter of services to people with visual impairments in the Hudson Valley," said Judith Millman, the organization's regional director in White Plains. Started in Advertising         Born in Terre Haute, Ind., Mrs. Price was a Phi Beta Kappa history graduate of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. She worked briefly in advertising before making her career in real estate. She was associated for 33 years with Houlihan Lawrence Real Estate of Bronxville, N.Y., most recently as a vice president and manager of the Katonah, N.Y., and Bedford, N.Y., offices.         In an interview three years ago, Mrs. Price said she was a diabetic and lost her sight completely over a period of two years, beginning about 1973.         "In the 1970's, they didn't know what to do with diabetes and eyesight problems," she said. "Now they have a pretty good chance of saving the eyesight with lasers."         She said she turned to the Lighthouse when her sight began to fail and remained associated with them ever since.         Mrs. Price is survived by her husband, Kenneth W., of Waccabuc; a daughter, Darcy Lee Price of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, Timothy of Port Jervis, N.Y.; and a sister, Barbara Lee Crowder of Scarsdale, N.Y.       
         Sheila Campbell Williamson, the founding director of the Community Foundation of New Jersey in Morristown, died on Sunday at her home in Short Hills, N.J. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Williamson, who continued to work until earlier this month, helped set up the foundation in 1980 and became a leader of the community-foundation movement in the United States. Such organizations collect endowed funds from individuals, businesses or private foundations to benefit innovative projects in a specific area.         Mrs. Williamson became the executive director of what began as the Essex County Community Foundation in 1980. Starting with little more than a borrowed desk and a phone, she nurtured the foundation into an organization with assets of about $11.5 million and distributions of more than $6 million.         Its donors include such corporate giants as Johnson & Johnson and the AT&T Corporation, and the Newark Boys Chorus, the New Jersey Symphony, AIDS education, neighborhood initiatives, civic improvements and various social services have been among the beneficiaries. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is a trustee and former president but the foundation operates with little fanfare,         Mrs. Williamson was active in many local organizations, including the United Way of Essex and West Hudson, the Association for Children in New Jersey and the Orange Orphan Society. She was a member of the Planning Board of Millburn and Short Hills.         Mrs. Williamson was a native of Glasgow. She graduated from Wells College in Aurora, N.Y., and received a master's degree in city and regional planning from Rutgers University. In the 1950's, she was a securities analyst for Bear, Stearns, one of the first women to be employed in that capacity on Wall Street.         Mrs. Williamson is survived by her husband, James G., and two daughters, Anne W. Holman of Short Hills and Christina Williamson of Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Buehring Phillips, a lifelong champion of the disabled and the founder and first State Director of the New York Special Olympics, died on Wednesday at Fannie Allen Hospital in Colchester, Vt. She was 83 and lived in Albany until three months ago, when she moved to Williston, Vt.         She suffered a long illness, said a spokesman for the Special Olympics organization.         Mrs. Phillips was president of the board of directors of the New York Special Olympics from its beginning in 1970 until 1982.         In 1969, Mrs. Phillips first became involved in the games by soliciting private donors and recruiting athletes for a New York contingent to the Northeast Regional Special Olympics Games for the Handicapped in Boston in 1969. After that event, she worked to create a permanent New York organization, which now trains and holds competitions for almost 35,000 children and adults statewide. Tribute from Governor Cuomo         Gov. Mario M. Cuomo paid her tribute yesterday for a quest of more than half a century to build bridges for those with mental and physical disabilities to the rest of society.         "She has seen her vision of Special Olympics in New York State grow to become the largest organization of its kind in the country, providing athletes with mental retardation an opportunity to enjoy the benefits of organized athletics," he said.         Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder and honorary chairman of Special Olympics International, said, "As we celebrate 25 years of achievement, I continue to reflect on those early days and say a heartfelt thanks to those pioneers such as Dorothy Buehring Phillips, who helped to make it all possible."         Born in Scottdale, Pa., Mrs. Phillips graduated from Geneseo State College and began to work with the mentally retarded in Hornall, N.Y. She also earned a bachelor's degree in special education and a master's degree in educational and vocational guidance at New York University.         Over the years she taught at the University of Rochester, Syracuse University, and Bar-Ilan University in Israel. She was a member of many state and national boards and the recipient of many honors. She also remained active on the Special Olympics' board and several committees after retiring as its president.         Mrs. Phillips, whose husbands, Donovan Franklin Buehring and William Holgate Phillips, are both dead, is survived by her daughter, Sandra D. Buehring of Williston, and three granddaughters.       
         Edith Sherin Markson, a promoter of regional theater in the United States and the founder of an exchange program for American and Eastern European theater artists, died on Saturday during a visit to Santa Fe, N.M. She was 81 and lived in New York City.         The cause was heart failure after a stroke, said her daughter, Mary Markson Dawe.         In the 1950's Mrs. Markson was among the founders of the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, and she later helped found the American Conservatory Theater in Pittsburgh before the company moved to San Francisco in 1967; until 1980, she was vice president of the theater's board.         Mrs. Markson also created the Theater International Exchange Services Foundation, an organization that arranged for collaborations, both here and abroad, between American theater artists and administrators and their counterparts in Eastern Europe.         In addition to Mrs. Dawe, of Milwaukee, she is survived by a son, Simpson Markson of New Jersey; a brother, the producer and director Edwin Sherin of New York City, and three grandchildren.       
         Joan Wolff, the director of the Allan Stone Gallery in Manhattan for 25 years, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said Claudia Stone, a daughter of the owner of the art gallery.         Mrs. Wolff went to work at the gallery, which is now on East 90th Street, east of Park Avenue, in 1968. She helped organize exhibitions of works by the gallery's artists Richard Estes and Wayne Thibaud, as well as shows of paintings by Arshile Gorki, Franz Kline, Willem de Kooning and John Graham.         Mrs. Wolff, whose name was originally Margaret Joan Trott, was born in Akron, Ohio, and graduated from Oberlin College. She is survived by her husband, Raymond A. Wolff Jr., the leader of the Dutch Wolff Orchestra, a society band; two daughters, Margaret, of Seattle, and Melora, of Oneonta, N.Y., and a sister, Beverly Earle Knapp of New York City.       
         Mildred McAfee Horton, who helped revolutionize the role of women in the military as the first director of the WAVES, died on Friday at the St. Vincent DePaul Nursing Home in Berlin, N.H. She was 94.         Under her stewardship of the WAVES (an acronym for Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service), navy women in World War II worked as flight instructors, weather observers, truck drivers and air traffic controllers. The service paved the way for the expanding role of women in the armed services.         After the war, Mrs. Horton continued to be an outspoken advocate for improving the position of women in the military. In one speech, she criticized the "folly of a national policy of discussing manpower in a national emergency as though it were only male power," adding that such an attitude put women in the "category of a national luxury instead of a national asset."         Mrs. Horton was born in Parkville, Mo., and graduated from Vassar College in 1920. In 1923, she began teaching economics and sociology at Tusculum College in Tennessee, and in 1934 she became dean of women at Oberlin College. Was President of Wellesley         Mrs. Horton became president of Wellesley College in 1936, and in 1942 took a leave of absence to organize the WAVES. By the time she finished her tour of duty, in 1946, she had risen to the rank of captain and had been awarded a Distinguished Service Medal.         She returned to her position at Wellesley, where she remained until 1949.         Mrs. Horton also served as president of the American Association of Colleges and was on the boards of the NBC and RCA. She was also vice president of the National Council of Churches.         In 1945, she married the Rev. Douglas Horton, who became Dean of Harvard Divinity School in 1955. He died in 1968.         She is survived by four stepchildren: Margaret H. Grant of Chicago; Alan W. Horton of Randolph, N.H.; Alice H. Tibbetts of Madison, Wis., and Elizabeth H. Breunig of Appleton, Wis.       
         Joy Ungerleider-Mayerson, a former director of the Jewish Museum in Manhattan and a philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in Larchmont, N.Y. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her son Andrew Ungerleider.         At her death, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was president of the Dorot Foundation, whose interests include biblical archeology and Jewish education. She was also the chairman of the Albright Institute for archeological research in Jerusalem and served on the boards of other cultural and educational institutions. She was the director of the museum, on Fifth Avenue at 92d Street, from 1972 to 1980, after being a curator there from 1967 to 1969.         In 1971, criticized for neglect of its Judaica collection and facing a substantial deficit, the museum's board decided that the institution should devote itself to "a commitment to the Jewish community." The museum was shut during that year, and Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson has been praised as having subsequently rescued it from its doldrums. She shifted the museum's focus from art to Jewish culture, instituting a strong education program and creating popular exhibitions on the subject of Israel and biblical archeology.         As a philanthropist, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was instrumental in providing support, through family foundations, for the New York Public Library. She was the author of one book, "Jewish Folk Art from the Biblical Period to Modern Times" (1986) and the co-author of another, "The Museums of Israel" (Abrams, 1989).         Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson, who was born in Lawrence, L.I., received a B.A. from New York University in 1942 and a master's degree in Hebrew Studies from New York University in 1971. She was married to Samuel Ungerleider in 1945; he died in 1972.         In addition to her sons Andrew, of Los Angeles, and Peter, of Manhattan, she is survived by another son, Dr. Steven Ungerleider of Eugene, Ore.; three daughters, Jeane Ungerleider-Springer of Boston, Miriam Mayerson-Michael of Manhattan and Clare Benac-Mayerson of Paris; two sisters, Celeste G. Bartos of Manhattan and Miriam G. Wallach of Scarsdale, N.Y., and seven grandchildren       
         Jessica Tandy, who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have, died yesterday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 85.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the actor Hume Cronyn.         Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film "Driving Miss Daisy." In the years between, she and Mr. Cronyn, played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day.         With the role of Blanche Dubois, Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood's leading ladies, to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage. The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance, which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called "incredibly true." Almost four decades later, another New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of her, "Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should be allowed to write about her."         When she was 80 years old, she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in "Driving Miss Daisy." It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and, at last, an Academy Award. When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one. She vowed to go on working, although she said she hoped she would know when to stop, "before they have to get the hook." The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of "Foxfire," of which her husband was was a co-writer. Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work, completing three films and two television dramas. A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs         When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together, in "The Fourposter" in 1951, audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater. One triumph followed another, culminating in "The Gin Game" in 1977 and "Foxfire" in 1982.         By 1986, when they appeared in "The Petition," Mr. Rich was writing of "their legendary theatrical relationship" and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as "an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again." Mel Gussow, another drama critic for The Times, called them "two actors at their summit." He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together, it was "a matter of hearts, minds and bodies in creative harmony."         One of their last projects together was "To Dance With the White Dog," a television movie that had its premiere last year. At last night'a Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Cronyn was named best actor in a mini-series or special for his performance as a recently widowed man mourning his wife. Miss Tandy was nominated for best actress but did not win. A clip from the movie was shown during the awards ceremony in a brief tribute to her.         When they took "The Gin Game" to Moscow in 1979, they won the accolade that Mr. Cronyn treasures above all others. Oleg N. Yefremov, the director of the renowned Moscow Art Theater, wrote in his review, "It takes a couple of actors from America to remind us what Stanislavsky was talking about."         Miss Tandy was nominated five times for a Tony and won three: in 1948 for her role as Blanche Dubois, for "The Gin Game" in 1978, and for "Foxfire" in 1983. Mr. Cronyn was also nominated for "The Gin Game" but did not win. "I was bitterly disappointed," Miss Tandy said. "His performance is part of mine. I think he's very proud when I win, and vice versa."         In July 1994 they were honored with a special Tony for their life's work in the theater. They had already received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal, in December 1986, and the National Medal of Art, from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature         Miss Tandy acted in more than 100 stage productions during her 67-year career, which began in England and encompassed the West End in London as well as the British provinces, Broadway, and the regional theaters that were once so important to the American stage. She appeared in more than 25 movies and played the leading role in a number of television programs, developing from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft, a star adored by directors for her serenity. There was no temperament; there were no tantrums. Elia Kazan, her director in "Streetcar" said: "She's absolutely sweet-natured. She does her job; she has a sense of humor."         With each performance her reviews got better. "I think I've gotten better," she said when she was 77. "I've gotten more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrusted myself. I'd be in things I felt weren't being done right and I didn't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me."         Miss Tandy, who became an American citizen in 1954, was born in London on June 7, 1909. Her father died when she was 12 and her mother took clerical and teaching jobs at night to supplement her regular income as headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two older brothers were read to a lot, Miss Tandy recalled in 1986: "good stuff, poetry."         "I had an appreciation of the words. We were also taken to theater. I sat in a lot of galleries. It was a magical time, but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never wanted it to end." She also grew to love Shakespeare, one of the few in her class who did. "Almost everyone would say, 'Oh, God, it's Shakespeare this afternoon.' To me it was heaven."         Her brothers would stage family theatricals in their five-room flat in northeast London, but she said she did not show any promise. "I was a graceless lump," she recalled. "My brothers would always say, 'Oh, Mummy, do we really have to have her in it?' "         Nevertheless, her love of the theater led her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where, in 1924, she began three years of dramatic training. She was 18 when she made her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in "The Manderson Girls." The salary was $:2 a week, out of which she somehow had to pay for the five elegant costumes her part required. She managed by sewing them herself.  Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling         She was convinced that she was plain and that there was nothing to be done about it. "I had absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I did," she said. Her self-confidence was not enhanced by her many letters of recommendation. She remembered that each one of them said, "Don't be put off by how she looks." But if she ever was an ugly duckling -- and there are many photographs that suggest she was not -- a swan finally emerged, for in her later years she was a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkling eyes of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically, saying: "In a way it was rather good. I didn't get the part of the young ingenue. I got more interesting parts."         In 1929 she made her West End debut in "The Rumor," by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro, but it was in 1932, in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe's "Children in Uniform," that she became recognized as a gifted actress. It was a role that also afforded her one of her most treasured moments in the theater. "There was one performance when the audience didn't clap at all, they were so moved," she recalled.         During the 1930's she appeared in more than two dozen contemporary plays, but in the English tradition honed her skill on the classics, especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she was Ophelia to John Gielgud's legendary Hamlet. She was Viola in Tyrone Guthrie's 1937 production of "Twelfth Night" at the Old Vic in London, where she twice shared the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940, she returned to the Old Vic as Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear.         The offer of a role in "The Matriarch" brought her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten years later, when the war in Europe had begun and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins was ending, she settled in the United States. There was the lure of Hollywood, and there was the need to support her 6-year-old daughter, Susan. She was allowed to take only $:10 out of the country, and despite her long list of credits, it was such a struggle to make ends meet that she almost abandoned the stage.         In 1940, while she was appearing in A. J. Cronin's "Jupiter Laughs," a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn called on her backstage. Two years later they moved to Hollywood and were married. A son, Chris, was born in 1943 and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. They, her daughter Susan, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive her, in addition to her husband. Maids' Roles Ended, Thanks to Cronyn         In Hollywood, Mr. Cronyn landed some interesting roles in the movies, but Miss Tandy's career languished. At one point she even told friends she was thinking of giving up acting. She appeared with Mr. Cronyn in "The Seventh Cross" (1944) and played bit parts in several other movies, including the role of a ladies' maid in "Forever Amber" (1947), but having to say lines like "Yes, Mum" and 'No, Mum" in yet another movie became very discouraging, she recalled many years later. "I'd had a good start and I was in the doldrums in Hollywood," she said. "It was not a happy position. I began to feel I had no talent and it was all a pipe dream. It was Hume who got me out of it."         He got her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in "Portrait of a Madonna," a play by Tennessee Williams that he was directing in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave reviews brought Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York, where he was casting his new play, "A Streetcar Named Desire." He wrote in his "Memoirs," "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche."         The play, co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter as Blanche's sister, Stella, won rapturous reviews, a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and ran for more than two years on Broadway before going on a national tour. Years later, Mr. Kazan remembered the joy of directing Miss Tandy. "She's perfect," he said. "She never stops working and she's always full of little surprises. She always does things a little better than you think she will."         Mr. Atkinson, writing about Miss Tandy's performance in The New York Times, said, "It does seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, revealing and true."         A contrary view was expressed by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently published autobiography. In "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the actor wrote: "I think Jessica and I were both miscast, and between us we threw the play out of balance. Jessica is a very good actress, but I never thought she was believable as Blanche. I didn't think she had the finesse or cultivated femininity that the part required, nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned."         When "Streetcar" was filmed, the part of Blanche went to Vivien Leigh; it was the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script         She said that in creating a character, "You have to get over 'how' you're doing it and know 'why' you're doing it. Once you forget about the 'how' you get the appearance of reality." She believed the secret to a character was in the script and that it was the actor's duty to "dig it out." She said: "I'm slow about it. I keep going back to the script, the script, the script."         To Miss Tandy, audience reaction was part of a play. She said, "It's not a matter of whether they're laughing or not but whether they're breathing or not." But audiences, like the theater itself, underwent profound changes during Miss Tandy's years on the stage. "The trouble with the theater," she said in 1986, "is that it's no longer a way of life for an audience. It's just a way to kill an evening." One of the theater's problems, she said, was "we are so inundated with entertainment."         "Now you flick a switch," she continued. "It's not the event it used to be."         She said theater people had contributed to the problem by removing the curtain. "People come into the theater and they sit there watching the first scene and talking about what they've bought in Bloomingdale's that day. When you had a curtain, when the footlights went up on the curtain, and then the curtain itself went up, you were part of an experience."         As for the actors, Miss Tandy said she hated to have to grope her way across a dark stage, stumbling into the furniture, "instead of getting on stage and having a moment to think about what you're going to do." Joe Mankiewicz, the film director who was a longtime friend, said that while Lynn Fontanne always had to make an entrance, "to Jessie the way she was when she got there was what was important."  Loved to Play In the Classics         Miss Tandy was always eager to perform in regional theaters and, with Mr. Cronyn, was among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launched his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of stars of their magnitude helped put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who followed was the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie's first season in 1963, for example, Miss Tandy played Gertrude in Hamlet, Olga in "The Three Sisters" and the wife of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman." She also acted in the Shakespeare festivals in Stratford, Conn., and Stratford, Ontario. In 1983 she starred in a revival of an American classic, Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie." Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "You pass up Miss Tandy's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril."         She hated the experience of seeing herself in the movies. "It's a very humbling experience to watch yourself," she said. But while the satisfaction of film never came close to the joy of a live performance, she said she felt it was important to accept roles that were offered to her; it helped pay expenses when she took parts at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She played Mr. Cronyn's wife in four of her most recent films, "Honky Tonk Freeway," (1981) "Cocoon," (1984), "Batteries Not Included" (1987) and "Cocoon: The Return" (1988). In 1991, Miss Tandy, then 82, played an indomitable 82-year-old woman in "Fried Green Tomatoes."         Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 plays on Broadway and dozens of Off Broadway and regional productions during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they went they were asked how they tolerated so much togetherness. "It's hard sometimes," she acknowledged, "but we always manage to give ourselves space. We don't live in each other's pockets. We don't take the play home with us. We do make suggestions to each other, and if we don't agree we respect each other's views." She burst out laughing and recalled Dame Sybil Thorndike's response when asked whether she ever considered divorcing her husband, with whom she had long shared the stage. "Divorce? Never. Murder? Frequently."         In her 70's and even into her 80's, Miss Tandy continued to take on strenuous parts, despite increased difficulty with memorization and stage fright that had got worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that caused her collapse onstage during a performance of "Foxfire" in Los Angeles in 1985 did not slow her down. Nor did major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appeared in the television movies "The Story Lady" (1991) and "To Dance With the White Dog" (1993) and completed three more feature films: "Used People" (1992) and "Camilla" and "Nobody's Fool," which are to be released this fall.         "Jessie adores working," Mr. Cronyn said in 1986. "She's more fully alive when she's working." As she got older she seemed to be in ever greater demand, but over the years she took good parts and she took bad parts. "You are richer for doing things," she said. "If you wait for the perfect part or for what sends you, you will have long waits, and you deteriorate. You can't be an actor without acting." A DEDICATED LIFE IN THE PUBLIC EYE         During a 67-year acting career in Britain and the United States, Jessica Tandy appeared in more than 100 plays, more than 25 movies and numerous television shows. Here is a sampling.

The year was 1989. In some editions the obituary also misstated the year for the film "Fried Green Tomatoes." It was 1991.       
         Faith Cardwell Davis, who with her sisters Hope Cardwell Brock and Charity Cardwell Lawson had been listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest complete set of triplets, died on Sunday at Rolling Plains Memorial Hospital in Sweetwater, Tex. She was 95.         The cause of death was believed to be a heart attack, said Dan McCoy, director of McCoy Funeral Home in Sweetwater.         The three sisters had lived together for more than a decade at a nursing home in Sweetwater, a small city on the plains of West Texas.         Several experts on multiple births said that when the Cardwell sisters turned 95 last May, they were the first set of triplets on record to reach that age.         Mrs. Davis had owned and operated the Silver Spur diner in Roby, Tex., for 25 years before moving to nearby Sweetwater in the early 1980's.         Her husband, J. P. Davis, whom she married in 1920, died in 1980, and her son, James, died in 1986. She is survived by her sisters; two granddaughters, and three great-grandsons.       
         Merrinelle Sullivan, a past president and longtime officer of the National Council of Women of the United States, died on Sunday in her Manhattan home. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said Robert Sonderskov, a family friend.         At her death, Mrs. Sullivan represented the International Council of Women, an umbrella organization for 78 national councils worldwide, to the United Nations Family Committee.         She had been executive director of the National Council in New York for 18 years before being elected president. As such, she oversaw its activities in New York and Washington in 1988, when both the national and international groups, which lobby for women's causes, observed their 100th anniversaries.         Although her cancer was diagnosed seven years ago, Mrs. Sullivan led an active life, working with women's groups and other organizations. She attended meetings in Indonesia, Cairo and Paris within the last year.         She also continued to work for the Manhattan League, Helen Keller Services for the Blind, Nightingale-Bamford School Volunteers and Mount Sinai Hospital.         Born Merrinelle Rice in Little Rock, Ark., she attended Stephens College in Missouri. Before her marriage in 1961, she managed a hotel in Cape May, N.J., and worked for a New York advertising agency.         She is survived by her husband, Robert A., and two daughters, Amanda, of Manhattan and Susan, a student at the University of Colorado at Boulder.       
         Marcia Lawrence, who retired in January after 25 years as the director of communications for Planned Parenthood of New York City, died on Thursday at her home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. She was 71.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         Beginning in 1968, Ms. Lawrence served as the chief writer for the organization, producing training manuals, public-service advertising and other written materials.         Her duties included informing the public about birth control and where to find services. In 1969, she wrote a comprehensive publication on family planning, "Yes, You Can," which the city bought in bulk for general distribution when New York State rewrote its abortion law the next year. It covered information on contraception, sterilization, adoption and abortion.         In 1971, Ms. Lawrence wrote a consumer guide, "Birth Control: All the Methods That Work and the Ones That Don't," which was sold to agencies nationwide. She edited a book-length guide to legal abortion services based on Planned Parenthood services in New York. It appeared in 1973, the year the Supreme Court legalized abortion.         Ms. Lawrence also created a campaign that persuaded the Yellow Pages to mention birth-control and abortion services in her agency's display ads. Starting in the mid-1970's, she composed the texts for full-page advocacy advertisements published in national newspapers. In 1984, she successfully campaigned for an increase in state appropriations for contraceptive services and consumer education on that subject.         She was born in Kansas City, Mo., and graduated from Barnard College. She was a vestry member of the Episcopal Church of St. Luke-in-the-Fields in Greenwich Village. She was also a trustee of St. Luke's School.         Ms. Lawrence, who used her maiden name, is survived by a daughter, Alison Collins of Kew Gardens, Queens, and a son, Charles Collins of Forest Hills, Queens.       
         Kaleria Fedicheva, a former ballerina with the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad who taught and staged the classics in the United States, died on Sept. 13 in Maribor, Slovenia, where she had been seeking medical treatment. She was 58 years old and lived in Glen Cove, L.I.         Ms. Fedicheva died of cancer, said Martin Fredmann, her former husband and the artistic director of the Colorado Ballet in Denver.         Ms. Fedicheva belonged to the generation of Kirov stars, including Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova, Yuri Soloviev and Alla Sizova, who created a sensation in the West in the 1960's. After graduating from the Kirov school in 1955, Ms. Fedicheva excelled in 19th-century classics that showed off her dynamism, like "Raymonda," and she drew immediate acclaim during the Kirov's first seasons in New York in 1961 and 1964. Unlike her younger partner Mikhail Baryshnikov and Mr. Nureyev and Ms. Makarova, Ms. Fedicheva did not defect while touring abroad.         But after she married Mr. Fredmann, an American dancer studying at the Kirov, in 1974, Soviet authorities, saying she was not divorced from her first husband, blocked her exit visa to the United States for a year. Her case received international attention after she was beaten by two men outside her apartment in what was then Leningrad, in what she said was an attempt to intimidate her. The Soviet Government permitted her to leave in February 1975 with her son, Ivan.         Ms. Fedicheva and Mr. Fredmann were divorced four years later but remained good friends, and she staged an acclaimed production of "Giselle" for the Colorado Ballet last year.         Ms. Fedicheva staged other works from the Russian repertory and choreographed new ones in the United States and abroad after she opened the New Russian School in Sea Cliff, L.I., after her arrival. She also directed her students and professional guest artists in the Fedicheva Ballet Company of Glen Cove, which was founded in 1982. The group's annual production of "The Nutcracker" was seen in New York City and on Long Island.         As a dancer, Ms. Fedicheva was at her best when her technical brilliance came to the fore in ballets like "Laurencia" and "Don Quixote." Yet she also excelled in "La Bayadere" and performed regularly in classics like "Swan Lake" and in contemporary Soviet ballets.         In addition to her son, Ms. Fedicheva is survived by her mother in St. Petersburg, Russia.       
         Elizabeth S. Freidus, an innovative teacher of children with learning disabilities who included parents and educators in her instruction, died on Oct. 13 in a nursing home in Burlington, Vt. She was 88 and had lived in New York City.         She died after a long illness, said Joan Saltzman, a niece.         Ms. Freidus, who taught children with learning disabilities for more than 40 years, became interested in ways to overcome learning problems while teaching in private nursery schools and kindergartens in New York City in the 1940's and through her work with physically disabled children. She was among the first to recognize that visual and perceptual problems, rather than emotional or behavioral ones, were often at the root of learning problems.         She counseled that to teach a child with learning difficulties, a parent or educator had to be a problem solver who could fit the task to the child's ability. As part of her method, Ms. Freidus arranged demonstrations in which her pupils moved a box across a stage before groups of parents and educators to show them the different ways the task could be done.         In 1965, she helped to found the private Gateway School in Manhattan and was its director until her retirement in 1979.         Ms. Freidus was a member of the adjunct faculty at Teachers College at Columbia University from the mid-1950's to 1970, teaching a popular special-education class, and she also taught at New York University.         She was invited by organizations in Britain, Denmark, Canada and in South American countries to give her demonstrations to parents and educators, and she made educational films for Columbia and New York State.         Ms. Freidus received bachelor's and master's degrees in early childhood education from New York University.       
         Mildred Natwick, a versatile actress who created an engaging gallery of eccentric, whimsical and spunky characters in plays, films and television for more than 60 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Miss Natwick, a small woman with sharp features and a mischievous manner, was a familiar figure on the Broadway stage, where she appeared in some 40 productions. Among other roles, she played an idiosyncratic secretary in George Bernard Shaw's "Candida," an extroverted medium in Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit" and a shrewish wife in Jean Anouilh's "Waltz of the Toreadors."         The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson, in his review of the Anouilh play in 1957, characterized her performance as "protean" and one that "rides the whirlwind with a great sweep of venomous extravagance."         Miss Natwick's comic brilliance in Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park" prompted Walter Kerr to acclaim her in 1963 as "the most hilarious woman in the Western hemisphere." She further confirmed her versatility in 1970 in Harold Pinter's "Landscape" and in 1971 when, at the age of 62, she made her debut in a singing role in a John Kander-Fred Ebb musical, "70, Girls, 70," as the disarming leader of a circle of elderly people seeking self-esteem by stealing furs.         Among Miss Natwick's films were four directed by John Ford. She appeared as a prostitute in "The Long Voyage Home," a doomed mother in "The Three Godfathers," a hard-bitten Army wife in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" and a sly widow in "The Quiet Man."         In a 1990 interview, she praised Ford as a masterly director who needed just a few words to inspire actors and give them the right clue or insight for a scene. In contrast, she said, Alfred Hitchcock, in directing the comedy "The Trouble With Harry," told her and the other actors precisely what he wanted.         Miss Natwick concentrated her career on Broadway, saying she had always preferred plays to movies because "on the stage, you're in control for two hours, while in a film, you do bits and pieces, usually out of sequence."         She received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her work in the 1967 film version of "Barefoot in the Park." She also received several Tony and Emmy nominations and was awarded an Emmy for "The Snoop Sisters," a 1973-74 television series in which she and Helen Hayes played successful mystery writers who were obsessed with solving real crimes.         In an interview in her Park Avenue apartment, she said her main criterion for creating a role was to make a character as inseparable from herself as possible. Nearly everything, she remarked, "is hit or miss for a while, until it all comes together." She said her advice to young performers was: "Act every time you get a chance. At least in the beginning, go wherever acting is."         Miss Natwick, who was called Milly by friends and associates, was born in Baltimore on June 19, 1905, to Joseph Natwick, a businessman, and the former Mildred Marion Dawes. She graduated from the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore and also from Bennett Junior College in Dutchess County, N.Y., where she majored in drama.         She began performing at the age of 21 with the Vagabonds, a nonprofessional group in Baltimore. She soon joined the celebrated University Players on Cape Cod, trading lines with such other young performers as Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan and Joshua Logan. She made her Broadway debut in the melodrama "Carry Nation" in 1932.         Among her films were "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945), "The Late George Apley" (1947), "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950), "The Court Jester" (1956), "If It's Tuesday This Must Be Belgium" (1967), "Daisy Miller" (1974) and "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988)         No immediate family members survive.         Correction:  November 8, 1994, Tuesday         An obituary on Oct. 26 about the actress Mildred Natwick referred incorrectly to her debut in a singing role in a musical. It was in "Stars in Your Eyes" in 1939, not in "70, Girls, 70" in 1971.       
         Mary G. Roebling, former chairwoman of the National State Bank, one of New Jersey's largest independent banks, and a former governor of the American Stock Exchange, died on Tuesday at her home in Trenton. She was 89.         The cause was renal failure, The Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Roebling retired in 1984 as chairman of the National State Bank in Elizabeth, N.J., which then had assets of $1.2 billion.         Earlier, she became the first woman to head a major American bank, the Trenton Trust Company. In 1937, at the age of 30, she was named its president. It grew substantially and she was its president or chairman or both until 1972, when Trenton Trust was acquired by National State. She was then elected chairman of the combined institutions.         Mrs. Roebling was also a founder, in 1978, of the Women's Bank N.A. of Denver, the first nationally chartered bank founded by women. She went on to serve as its chairman until 1983. In addition, she was the American Stock Exchange's first woman governor, from 1958 to 1962.         Mrs. Roebling also served as a director of numerous other corporations over the years, was active in many civic, charitable and educational organizations, and was a tireless advocate of a greater role for women in the country's economic affairs.         In a speech in 1965, Mrs. Roebling said: "As a woman who for years has competed in the business world, I would be the first to agree that the American woman has almost unbelievable economic power, but American women, like women of all civilized nations, do not use the influence their economic power gives them."         Mrs. Roebling's own economic power came initially through inheritance, but she increased it vastly once it fell into her hands. She was bequeathed a large block of Trenton Trust stock by her millionaire second husband, Siegfried Roebling, whose family had long been prominent in engineering and cable manufacturing. He was a great-grandson of John A. Roebling, who designed the Brooklyn Bridge, and a grandson of Col. Washington A. Roebling, who completed its construction.         Siegfried Roebling died in 1936, of a heart attack. Mrs. Roebling's father and father-in-law then urged her to try her hand at running the bank. She had preparation for the job: she had worked for a Philadelphia investment house while taking business courses at night and, the two men told her, she had another important qualification, common sense.         The rest was banking history. She took her husband's seat on the bank's board and, on Jan. 21, 1937, was elected president.         "Mary G. Roebling didn't wait for women's lib," Forbes magazine once wrote, "she was ahead of it, way ahead."         By 1970, Mrs. Roebling estimated that 300 other American women had become presidents or chairwomen of banks. But in 1978, when she became chairwoman of the Women's Bank, she argued that there still was a place in the business world for banks that were operated specifically for female customers.         "Women's banks can be better listeners for women and give them more time, advice and direction than an ordinary bank would give," she told an interviewer. "It's a psychological thing, really."         She continued to be active in male-dominated spheres, however: in 1978, after having served as a civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army in several administrations, she became the founding president of the newly formed Army War College Foundation. It was set up to support the college's fund-raising and other activities.         She was born Mary Gindhart in 1907 in West Collingswood, N.J., the daughter of Isaac D. Gindhart Jr., a telephone company executive, and Mary Simon Gindhart, a music teacher. She went to public schools in Haddonfield and Moorestown, N.J., and earned pocket money picking strawberries for a penny a box.         While still a teen-ager, she married a musician, Arthur Herbert, but he died three years later, leaving her with a daughter to support. She went to work in Philadelphia and took evening courses in merchandising and business administration at the University of Pennsylvania.         She left her job when she married Mr. Roebling, becoming a housewife again until his death.         Over the years, Mrs. Roebling was variously a director of the Tattersall Corporation, the Standard Fire Insurance Company and the Colonial Operating Company, in Trenton, among other concerns; an officer of the New York World's Fair Corporation in 1964 and 1965; a member of the National Business Council on Consumer Affairs and of the Boy Scouts of America's national advisory council, and an active participant in other nonprofit organizations. She was awarded numerous honorary degrees and other honors.         She is survived by a daughter, Betty Hobin of Palm Beach, Fla., and Hopewell Township, N.J.; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren, and a sister, Margaret G. Finley of Haddonfield, N.J. A son, Paul Roebling, died in July.       
         Kathleen L. Schwaninger, an advocate for the disabled who played a critical role in the decade-long effort to close down the Willowbrook State School for the mentally retarded on Staten Island and who went on to help found an agency to aid seriously ill children, died Sunday in a plane crash in Hyannis, Mass. She was 50 and lived in Brooklyn and East Falmouth, Mass.         Ms. Schwaninger became executive director of the Willowbrook Review Panel in 1978, three years after it was created under a Federal court order to monitor the release of residents of Willowbrook into community settings. Willowbrook was then the state's largest treatment center for the mentally retarded, and the panel was criticized for its oversight of the process, which included placing residents in smaller institutions within the community. The seven-member panel was dissolved in 1980 after Albany cut off its financing.         In 1981, she became deputy director of the Massachusetts Commission of Retardation, working to remove the retarded from institutions. From 1982 to 1987, she headed the nonprofit agency Working Organization for Retarded Citizens in Queens, which put handicapped people in group homes.         She left the agency to join SKIP, Sick Kids Need Involved People, of New York, which she helped to found. She was its chief executive director for the last six years. The agency advises more than 2,000 clients on equipment, services and benefits for people with developmental disabilities.         Born in Omaha, she received her undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of Nebraska. She was involved in mental health work in Nebraska and was a former executive director of the state Office of Mental Retardation.         She is survived by a son, Jason M. Anderson of Boca Raton, Fla.; a daughter, Amy J. Anderson of East Falmouth; a stepdaughter, Sherri O'Grady of Boston; a sister, Pat Hodges of Ashland, Neb., and three grandchildren.       
         Pearl Primus, a pioneering dancer, choreographer and teacher whose anthropological work exposed Americans to the realities of black life in America and to the richness of African and Caribbean dance, died on Saturday at her home in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 74.         Miss Primus died after a brief illness, said Joyce Knight, a friend.         A powerful performer and lecturer, Miss Primus played a role similar to that of Katherine Dunham in establishing dance by and about blacks as an important part of American culture. Her belief that there was material for dance in the everyday lives of black people -- and her strong personality and early success -- had a profound influence on several generations of black choreographers and dancers, among them Donald McKayle and Alvin Ailey.         Miss Primus visited Africa for the first time in 1948, but she had begun to present carefully researched dance with African themes in 1943 and was the first American choreographer to do so. In 1974, her contributions were celebrated in a salute to her and the ballerina Janet Collins by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.         But Miss Primus was equally celebrated for her depiction of American life and of the injustices inflicted on black Americans, particularly in the American South. In one of her best-known dances, "Strange Fruit," a woman reacts in horror to a lynching. "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" -- created, like "Strange Fruit," in 1943 and inspired by the Langston Hughes poem -- depicted the Mississippi and the hard lives of blacks along its shores. "Dance has been my freedom and my world," she said in 1991. "I dance not to entertain but to help people better understand each other."         An accident of fate led Miss Primus to become a dancer. Born in Trinidad, she was brought to the United States as a child by her parents. She received a bachelor's degree in biology and pre-medical sciences from Hunter College with the intention of becoming a doctor. Unable to find a laboratory job open to blacks, she applied to the National Youth Administration and was put into a dance group.         She enrolled in modern-dance classes at the New Dance Group, where she began to teach, and in 1943 gave the first performance of her own work. John Martin wrote in The New York Times that "if ever a young dancer was entitled to a company of her own and the freedom to do what she chooses with it, she is it."         A few months later, Barney Josephson invited Miss Primus to perform at his Cafe Society Downtown. Troubled by having to choose between medicine and dance, she consulted Mr. Martin. No one would ever be able to say, he told her, whether art or medicine had the greater curative power. Miss Primus remained at the nightclub for 10 months. When there was a problem with the music during her first performance there, a burly man rose from the audience and encouraged her to keep on, teasing her about having broken up his home by teaching his son the Lindy Hop. The man was Paul Robeson, one of many black cultural figures with whom Miss Primus would become friendly over the years.         Miss Primus toured with the musical "Show Boat," then founded a company and presented her work on Broadway and in national tours. On one Southern tour, she was offered a Rosenwald Foundation scholarship to study dance in Africa. Later, she worked there with local performers. She married Percival Borde, a dancer she met on a visit home to Trinidad in 1953, and they founded a popular school in New York and performed frequently together. Mr. Borde died in 1979.         Miss Primus was made director of a new performing-arts center in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1959. Two years later, she and Mr. Borde performed throughout Africa with their dancers and musicians on a tour sponsored by the Rebekah Harkness Foundation. It was not until 1978 that she completed her work for a doctorate in anthropology at New York University.         "My life has been like traveling up a river," she told an interviewer in 1979. "Every now and then I would hear singing around the bend, and so around the bend I would go and become occupied with living."         Miss Primus continued to perform until 1980, after which she was the director of the Cora P. Maloney College, a black studies school at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and was Five-College Professor of Ethnic Studies at schools in Massachusetts in the 1980's. She was an early and important participant in "The Black Tradition in American Dance," a program to revive and preserve black dance that began in 1988 at the American Dance Festival, where in 1991 she was named the first recipient of the Balasaraswati/ Joy AnnDewey Beinecke Chair for Distinguished Teaching. Other honors included the National Medal of the Arts in 1991. Miss Primus continued to teach throughout the United States until her death.         She is survived by a son, Onwin Borde of Miami.       
         Shirley Chernela, a former administrator of Temple Shaaray Tefila in Manhattan and the first woman to be president of the National Association of Temple Administrators, died Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said Janet Chernela Mount, her daughter.         Ms. Chernela became the administrator of Temple Shaaray Tefila in 1972 and held the job for 20 years. She was president of the national administrators' group from 1982 to 1985. In 1991, she was elected an honorary trustee.         She was the first woman to be certified a Fellow in Temple Administration in a program set up by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the National Association of Temple Administrators.         In the early 1950's, her family joined with three others to found a congregation, Temple Emanuel in Great Neck, L.I., of which she served as administrator. She then became director of personnel and building services at the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, where she remained until joining Temple Shaaray Tefila.         In addition to Ms. Chernela Mount, she is survived by another daughter, Susan Chernilo, and a son, Abbey Chernela, both of New York; a sister, Diane Graf of Southbury, Conn., and a brother, Paul Moss of Hewlett, L.I.       
         Virginia E. Montes, a former national secretary and lobbyist for the National Organization for Women, died Thursday at her home in Atlanta. She was 50.         The cause was a stroke, the Atlanta medical examiner's office said.         Ms. Montes, a native of Honduras, had been active in NOW for 13 years and was the first Latin American woman to serve as a national officer of the organization.         She was elected secretary of NOW and of its national political action committee in 1991 and served until last year. In the spring of 1993 she led the organization's defense of Lani Guinier, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was nominated by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division. The President withdrew the nomination after conservatives criticized Ms. Guinier for papers she had written on ways for blacks to increase their influence in elections.         Earlier, Ms. Montes was involved in NOW's lobbying efforts while serving as its government liaison officer. In two terms on the organization's national board she headed the committee for racial diversity.         Ms. Montes, who was known as Ginny, came to the United States when she was 10 years old. She was a delegate to three Democratic national conventions and frequently lobbied for civil rights groups in the halls of Southern state legislatures. One cause she advocated was the redrawing of election districts to strengthen minority representation.         In 1980 she became director of legislative research for the Southern Regional Council, based in Georgia. For a time she directed the Georgia Housing Coalition, but later returned to the council, where she was a senior consultant.         She also conducted leadership training activities for NOW, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Women's Political Caucus and other groups.         Ms. Montes is survived by a daughter, Rebecca Albury of Atlanta; her mother, Greta Hyde Montes of Tampa, Fla.; two sisters, Greta Montes of Wayne, Pa., and Jacqueline Zaborski of West Palm Beach, Fla., and three brothers, Robert, of Clearwater, Fla., and Ronald and Hiram, both of Tampa.       
         Ruth Blumka, a prominent New York dealer in medieval and Renaissance art and a donor of artworks to museums around the country, died on Monday at New York University Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, said her son, Anthony Blumka.         Among the works donated to the Metropolitan Museum by Mrs. Blumka and her husband, Leopold, were a 15th-century silver tabernacle produced for the Monastery of St. Peter at Salzburg and a rare enameled devotional cradle made in the Netherlands in the 15th century.         After her husband's death in 1973, Mrs. Blumka donated other objects, including, in 1991, a German 15th-century tapestry from the altar of a Nuremberg church.         "It's a great loss," Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said yesterday. "Ruth Blumka was really an art dealer of the old school with a tremendous knowledge of the works of art she handled and an extremely good eye. And she placed a number of great objects, both through sale and gift in the Metropolitan Museum and elsewhere."         The Blumkas also made gifts of art objects and antiques to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the National Gallery in Washington, the Minneapolis Museum of Art, the Cincinnati Art Museum and the Louvre in Paris. She was a member of the National Antique and Art Dealers Association of America and a participant in the International Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show each year since its founding in 1989.         Mrs. Blumka, whose name was originally Ruth Zickel, was born and reared in Munich, the daughter of Nadja and Frederic Zickel, dealers in German Expressionist art. She came to New York in 1939, and in 1942 began to work for Mr. Blumka at his East 57th Street gallery.         Mr. Blumka introduced her to medieval and Renaissance art, the field in which his family had specialized in Vienna for several generations. She remained at the gallery after their marriage a decade later. The gallery is now at 101 East 81st Street.         The Blumkas counted among their clients Robert Lehman, Belle and Jack Linsky, Marjorie Merriweather Post and Anne Johnson when she was the wife of Henry Ford 2d.         In addition to her son, a New York art dealer, she is survived by three grandchildren, Kimberly and Justin Nasatir and Amanda Goldberg, and a brother, John Zickel of Carmichael, Calif.       
         Jane Hayward, a curator of medieval art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an authority on stained glass, died on Sunday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 76 and lived in Riverdale.         The cause was cancer, said William D. Wixom, chairman of the museum's department of medieval art.         Philippe de Montebello, director of the museum, said yesterday that "Jane Hayward was responsible for bringing medieval stained glass to the attention of the American public," and that she was completing the collection catalogue at her death.         In 1972, five years after Miss Hayward joined the museum, she organized the first comprehensive exhibition of its medieval and Renaissance stained-glass holdings.         In 1982, she helped organize "Radiance and Reflection, Medieval Art from the Raymond Pitcairn Collection," an exhibition of the greatest private stained-glass collection in America, formed by an heir to the Pittsburgh Plate Glass fortune.         Miss Hayward founded the American Committee of the Corpus Vitrearum, an international group of scholars on medieval and Renaissance stained glass. In the mid-1980's, she was instrumental in uncovering one of the earliest stained-glass windows in America, at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights, where it had been obscured for decades behind a pipe organ. The medieval-style 1840's window was restored under her direction and given on extended loan to the museum, where it hangs in the Charles Engelhard Court of the American Wing         Miss Hayward served as a technical illustrator for the United States Navy during World War II. She earned bachelor's and masters degrees in the early 1950's, and a doctorate from Yale in 1958. In the 1960's she was the curator of the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London, Conn., and taught art history there and at Connecticut College.         She is survived by two brothers, Ward and William, of Hawaii.       
         Lillian Hayman, a Tony Award-winning actress and singer, died on Oct. 25 at her home in Hollis, N.Y. She was 72.         The cause was a heart attack, said her sister, Coreania Carter.         Miss Hayman won a Tony in 1968 as best supporting actress for her performance in the musical "Hallelujah Baby." She appeared in many other Broadway productions, including "Kiss Me Kate," "Show Boat," "Kwamina," "70, Girls, 70," "No, No, Nanette" and "Porgy and Bess," with which she traveled for its entire three-and-a-half-year world tour. She also appeared in several Off Broadway plays, including "Dream About Tomorrow" and "Along Came a Spider."         Miss Hayman had a role in the soap opera "One Life to Live" for 17 years, as the character Sadie Gray, and was a regular on the short-lived "Leslie Uggams Show" in 1969. She also recorded a gospel album, "My Prayer," and appeared in the film "Purlie Victorious."         Lillian Irene Hayman was born in Maryland and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Wilberforce University in Ohio. She then studied music privately in New York where she became the director of several church choirs.         She is survived by her sister, of St. Albans, Queens.       
         Dr. Lucy Shields Morgan, a groundbreaking educator in public health and an adviser to the World Health Organization, died on Friday at the Deerfield Episcopal Retirement Center in Asheville, N.C. She was 93.         She had suffered a long illness, said the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she had been professor emeritus of health education since 1966.         In 1942, Dr. Morgan established the nation's first graduate training program for teachers in public health at Chapel Hill. She founded the university's health education department and was its first chairman.         While at Chapel Hill, she was also director of health education for 15 years at North Carolina College at Durham, now North Carolina Central University.         In addition to her teaching, Dr. Morgan worked with the World Health Organization and traveled abroad to help develop educational programs.         She was born in Baton Rouge, La., and graduated from the University of Tennessee. She earned a master's degree at Columbia University, a master's at Tennessee and a doctorate in public health at Yale University in 1936.         Early in her career, she worked as a health-education specialist and consultant at the University of Tennessee and the Tennessee State Health Department. In 1938 she became executive director of the Hartford Tuberculosis and Public Health Society.       
         Katherine Elliott, an advocate for simpler and more practical methods of health care for poor people, died on Saturday at the Hospital of St. John and St. Elizabeth in London, where she lived. She was 75.         The cause was cancer, her daughter, Veronica Elliott of Washington, said.         Dr. Elliott was among those professionals in an emerging medical field in the 1950's and 60's who stressed that the technology used to meet the health care needs of any population must be appropriate to their own resources and skills.         Recognizing that diarrhea was the greatest killer of children in poor countries, for example, she aided in the development of a simple oral rehydration therapy consisting of a foiled-packet containing a powder that could be mixed with water to provide nutrients the sick child needed to survive.         In an effort to make childbirth safer, she helped to develop kits for midwives with a clean plastic sheet, cotton, soap and an antiseptic razor to cut the umblilical cord.         Dr. Elliott, whose work took her to Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Iran, also advocated greater reliance on trained medical workers to see to the health needs of people in remote areas.         She received a medical degree from the University of London's School of Medicine for Women and after World War II she joined the National Health Service. She was an assistant director at the Ciba Foundation from 1966 to 1981.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a second daughter, Rose, and a son, Tony, both of London, and six grandchildren.       
         Viola Spolin, who as a teacher and author was an inspiration for the improvisational theater movement, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 88.         Her sister, Beatrice Lees, said Mrs. Spolin had three strokes in recent years.         Through her theater games and her book "Improvisations for the Theater" as well as the subsequent work of her son Paul Sills at the Compass and Second City in Chicago and with Story Theater, Mrs. Spolin influenced several generations of actors and directors, including Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Alan Arkin, Severn Darden, Barbara Harris, Anthony Holland, Paul Sand and Avery Schreiber. Although she did not have a career as a professional director, her guidance as a vital and highly demonstrative teacher was to indispensable as actors increasingly responded to the idea of improv.         Various comic techniques came later, but she was a primary source of the practical mechanics of theater games, exercises designed to free actors. Explaining her approach, she once said, "My vision is a world of accessible intuition." Mr. Sills said his mother wanted "to help players hit their intuition" and become more spontaneous.         Most of Mrs. Spolin's theater work was with children. She was born in Chicago, where she trained with Neva Boyd, an educator who used games to help children adjust to life in the city. Mrs. Spolin added the idea of theater games, exercises that led to role-playing. Later she worked for the W.P.A. When Mr. Sills joined David Shepherd in creating the Compass improvisational theater, his mother's games became part of the work process.         Since 1945 Mrs. Spolin had lived in Los Angeles, where she founded the Young Actors Company, which is both a school and theater. She retired in 1980. "Improvisations for the Theater," her best-known book (published by Northwestern University Press) remains a standard theatrical text.         In addition to her sister, of New York City, and her son Paul, of Baileys Harbor, Wis., she is survived by her third husband, Robert Kolmus Greene; another son, William Sills of Oakland, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Fizdale, who helped to make modern social work a profession, died on Sunday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in the Bronx. She was 86 and a resident of Patterson, N.Y.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke, according to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, where she was an adjunct professor emeritus in community medicine.         Miss Fizdale made her mark during 19 years as executive director of the Arthur Lehman Counseling Service in Manhattan. At the service, which is defunct, she developed a fee-for-service system for use by private agencies. The purpose was to lift the welfare aura of charity from them.         Lehman Counseling was created for clients who could afford a reasonable fee. It also paid reasonable salaries, thus bolstering the professional image of its social workers.         Miss Fizdale chronicled the agency's first decade and a half in "Social Agency Structures and Accountability" (Burdick, 1974). The work became a casebook for graduate schools, social agencies and private practitioners as it set standards for social-work services on a fee basis for middle- and upper-income clients.         A month ago, the Columbia University School of Social Work established a Helen Rehr and Ruth Fizdale Professorship of Health and Mental Health. New York State recognized her as Social Worker of the Year in 1970, and a few years ago, the National Association of Social Work set up its Ruth Fizdale Fund in Social Welfare Studies in her honor.         She was long associated with the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and its Department of Community Medicine. She was also an adjunct professor at the Hunter School of Social Work.         Miss Fizdale graduated from the University of Chicago. She received a master's at the Smith College School of Social Work and an advanced-study certificate from the University of Pennsylvania. She was a charter member of the National Association of Social Workers and its Competence Certification Board.         During World War II, she led a Veterans Administration program to restructure its staff and student training. She then served as a psychiatric caseworker at the Jewish Family Service's Mandel Clinic in Brooklyn and with the New York Association for New Americans.       
         Joanne Rathgeb, an actress, director and educator who fought for greater awareness and increased resources to fight breast cancer, died of the disease on Nov. 19 at her home in Essex Junction, Vt. She was 64.         Her cancer was diagnosed nine years ago, but she continued an active life. She retired last year as a professor of fine arts and drama at St. Michael's College in Colchester after 30 years on the faculty. She was the first woman to head the fine arts department there.         Vermont has the eighth highest rate of death from breast cancer in the nation, but Mrs. Rathgeb's prominence as a campaigner against the disease extended beyond her home state. She collected about 14,000 letters that were delivered to the Congressional delegation from Vermont. The letters called for increased research and a cancer registry.         In 1992, she started a cancer registry in Vermont, and Congress passed the Cancer Registries Act, which established a national standard for the collection of cancer data.         Mrs. Rathgeb was born in Terre Haute, Ind., and earned a bachelor's degree in theater and a master's degree in English at Indiana State University. She did post-graduate work at Catholic University of America, taught in the Chicago public schools and helped to organize theaters in Terre Haute.         Early in her career, she joined National Players and took part in productions of "The Taming of the Shrew," "Twelfth Night" and "Oedipus Rex" in Europe and in this country, including a performance at the Carnegie Hall Playhouse in Manhattan. She later returned to New York to appear in Phoenix Theater productions of "Peer Gynt" and "Lysistrata."         Since 1958, she had been a producer, director, coach and actress at St. Michael's Playhouse in Vermont.         Mrs. Rathgeb is survived by her husband of 34 years, Donald Sr.; three daughters, Elizabeth Pratt of Amesbury, Mass., and Laura Rathgeb and Mary Jo Balaskas, both of Manhattan; a son, Donald Jr. of Burlington, Vt.; a sister, Laura Mae Hellrung of Alton, Ill.; a brother, Howard Ellspermann of Cape Coral, Fla., and one granddaughter.       
         Sally A. Knapp, a singer and actress who appeared in numerous productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, died on Tuesday at Gwinett County Hospital in Georgia. She was 68 and lived in Atlanta.         The cause was an aneurism, said Tedi Dreiser Godard, a friend.         Miss Knapp was a leading actress with Dorothy Raedler's Masque and Lyre Light Opera Company, which later became the American Savoyards. She starred in many of its productions, as well as in television commercials.         In 1980 Miss Knapp was a co-founder of the Southeastern Savoyards in Atlanta, and served as its artistic director through 1987.         She is survived by a daughter, Holly Crumpton; a brother, Rue Knapp; a sister, Mary Lou DiNardo, and a granddaughter, Crystal, all of Atlanta.       
         Elenore Hangley, a former executive vice president of the Advertising Council, died on Saturday at the Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, in Englewood, N.J. She was 63 and lived in Cliffside, N.J.         The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Charles.         Mrs. Hangley spent her 30-year career with the Advertising Council, which is responsible for the nation's public service advertising campaigns. At the council, she developed and managed advertising campaigns like the one involving McGruff, the dog who promoted anti-crime activities. She was also responsible for the council's overall operations.         Mrs. Hangley, a native of Union City, N.J., and a graduate of Hunter College, began work at the Advertising Council in 1951. In 1965, she left her position as a radio and television services manager to rear her son. She returned as an advertising campaign manager 12 years later and in 1980 was named director of campaign administration.         In 1982, she was appointed vice president of the council. Seven years later, she was named senior vice president of campaign administration and then, in the same year, was named executive vice president of operations. In 1993, she retired.         At the time of her death, she was the president of the board of directors of Child Find America, which tries to find runaways and missing children, and a member of the steering committee of the National Crime Prevention Council, for which the McGruff anti-crime advertisements were designed.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her son, Charles, of Cliffside, N.J., and her sister, Norma Kramer of New York City.       
         Alice Miller, the director of the Brooklyn College Women's Center since 1985, died on Monday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 46 and lived in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn.         The cause was cancer, said Richard Coniglione, a spokesman for Brooklyn College.         The Women's Center, which provides various services for students, teachers and others, acts as an advocate for women on issues like educational equity and sexual harassment. The center also co-sponsors lectures and conferences on topics like women's health, professions and the arts.         In 1987, Ms. Miller founded the Eureka Teen Achievement Program, which the college describes as "a math and science enrichment program for minority and disadvantaged teen-age women." The program has been emulated elsewhere around the country.         From 1986 to 1988, she was on the board of Women's Survival Space, a shelter for battered women.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Miller, whose maiden name was Lokiec, graduated from Barnard College in 1968 and earned an M.A. from Columbia University Teachers College and from New York University.         She taught in junior and senior high schools, was an editor and a freelance writer and was director of the women's center and adult education at the Brooklyn Y.W.C.A. before heading the college's women's center.         Her survivors include her husband, Sandy Miller, and a daughter, Nell Miller, also of Carroll Gardens.       
         Ella Keats Whiting, an administrator and English literature professor at Wellesley College for 33 years and a great-niece of John Keats, died on Thursday at her home in the Carleton Village retirement community in Bedford, Mass.         She was 98 and died of natural causes, a spokeswoman for Wellesley said.         Ms. Whiting joined the Wellesley faculty in 1928 and became a professor in 1942, specializing in medieval English literature. She was the editor of "The Poems of John Audelay," published in 1931.         She served in several administrative posts before becoming Dean of the College in 1954. During World War II, when the president, Mildred McAfee Horton, went on leave to become the first director of the WAVES, Ms. Whiting shared the responsibilities of the office of the president, heading panels on curriculum and instruction and faculty publications. She retired in 1961.         Ms. Whiting, a native of Somerville, Mass., received a bachelor's degree in economics at Vassar College in 1918 and a master's in English literature at Radcliffe College in 1922. She received a doctorate in medieval English literature from Yale University in 1929.       
         Dr. Judith Krieger Gardner, a child psychologist, teacher and researcher at Brandeis University, died of an aneurysm on Saturday at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. She was 51 and lived in Belmont and West Tisbury, Mass.         She fell ill three weeks ago on a trek in Nepal with friends, her family said.         Dr. Gardner was an associate research professor at the Heller Graduate School of Advanced Studies and Social Welfare at Brandeis; she was acting director of the school two years ago.         She also taught a course on the history of child rearing at Harvard University and lectured at Boston University.         Born in Philadelphia, she graduated magna cum laude from the Connecticut College for Women in 1964 and earned a Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard in 1971.         Dr. Gardner was a former research associate at Children's Hospital in Boston and a staff psychologist at the Judge Baker Center in Boston.         She was co-editor with Howard Gardner, her former husband, of many books, including the multivolume series "Classics in Psychology" and "Classics in Child Psychology" published by Ayer.         Dr. Gardner is survived by her daughter, Kerith, of Manhattan; two sons, Jay and Andrew of Belmont, and her parents, Sylvia and Bernard Krieger of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Elizabeth (Biddie) Kramer, a philanthropist who spent most of her life raising millions of dollars for the nation of Israel, died on Monday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         In 1949, Mrs. Kramer and her husband, Benjamin Abrams, the founder and chairman of the Emerson Radio Corporation, visited Israel. At a meeting with Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and Finance Minister Eliezer Kaplan , Mr. Abrams suggested issuing bonds to help finance the new nation.         As a result of that conversation, the Israel Bond Campaign was born.  From its inception and for years after Mr. Abrams's death in 1967, Mrs. Kramer remained deeply involved in the campaign, serving at various times as a co-chairwoman, honoree and fund-raiser. Mark Ruben, executive director for Israel Bonds of the Greater Palm Beaches, credited her with raising tens of millions of dollars for Israel.         Mrs. Kramer was also involved in various educational projects, serving as a member of the board of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and as vice president of the American Friends of the Hebrew University, which bestowed on her the Scopus Award and an honorary doctorate of philosophy in 1984.         She was also the first recipient of the Israel Bond Association's Eleanor Roosevelt Centennial Award for her philanthropic efforts.         A member of Long Island University's board, Mrs. Kramer was a founder of the Benjamin and Elizabeth Abrams Communication Center at the university. She also served on the board of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and as chairwoman of the Women's Division of the United Jewish Appeal in New York City and Palm Beach.         Mrs. Kramer, who survived two other husbands, leaves three daughters, Marjorie Hyman, Geraldine Kory and Cynthia Bernstein, all of New York City; six grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.       
         By all appearances, this was a great year for Alix Gres, the French fashion designer. There was a retrospective of her work held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in September, attended by Yuzo Yagi, the chairman of Yagi Tsusho Ltd., the Japanese company that had bought the rights to her name in 1988 and had sponsored the exhibition. In Japan, the company was promoting her name anew.         And she was being heralded by fellow couturiers like Yves Saint Laurent, who marveled at the show in an interview in Women's Wear Daily. Her daughter, Anne Gres (the name is pronounced greh), provided the fashion industry newspaper with a response she said her mother had dictated on Oct. 9. "Coming from an artist and colleague whom I admire," said an excerpt published on Nov. 1, "I'm greatly touched."         So the fashion world was startled to learn yesterday that Mme. Gres, as she is always called by those in her trade, had been dead for more than a year. Born on Nov. 30, 1903, she died on Nov. 24, 1993, in a retirement home in the south of France, a fact that was carefully hidden by her daughter.         In a front-page story in the French newspaper Le Monde, Anne Gres said she had disguised the death of her mother for the last 13 months for two reasons. "First of all, I looked to protect her," she said. "All those who have profited from her would again find the means to draw on her money." The second reason she gave was respect for the older sister of Mme. Gres, who is still alive. She added that she did not yet have the money to buy the sort of tomb that would dignify her mother's memory. "It made me suffer more," she said about hiding the news. "It is like it didn't happen."         No one knew about Mme. Gres's death until the article appeared. Not her closest friends and peers, Pierre Cardin and Hubert de Givenchy. Not Jacques Mouclier, the head of the Chambre Syndicale, the governing body of French fashion, where she held the title of honorary president for life. Not Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute exhibition, and not even Mr. Yagi, the owner of the rights to her name.         Those interviewed in Paris as the news spread expressed confusion at the charade, which was revealed when Le Monde uncovered a document in a district mayor's office in Paris confirming her death. It was verified in interviews with residents of the home in St.-Paul-de-Vence where Mme. Gres had lived.         For the French fashion industry, where designer names are often bought and sold without consulting the founders, it is an eerie illustration of how a design house can continue on without its progenitor.         Mme. Gres was the last survivor of her generation of couturiers, which included Madeleine Vionnet, Jeanne Lanvin, Elsa Schiaparelli and Gabrielle Chanel. Although some have asked whether there could have been a commercial reason for her daughter's actions, it seems unlikely, given the number of houses in Paris that continue after the designer has died, from Balenciaga to Chanel and Christian Dior, where big-name designers took over the workrooms.         "It is very difficult to express oneself on hearing such a frightening piece of news," Mr. de Givenchy said in a fax. "I was very shocked to learn of the passing of such a 'grande dame' like this one a year too late. Mme. Gres was a person who was very discreet and very humble, and maybe this was her decision."         Her clients, often the people closest to designers who work in couture, as Mme. Gres did, were especially shocked at the news. Sao Schlumberger, who donated a dress to the Costume Institute for the exhibition, said: "It is quite strange. Some time ago I talked with the Duchess of Orleans, who was a customer of hers and a close friend, and she said she went to visit her in an old people's home. And the first time she recognized her, but the last time she didn't recognize her at all."         One reason Mme. Gres was able to fade away was that she was no longer active in her house, which she sold in 1984 to the French industrialist Bernard Tapie. She later told Mr. Cardin that the decision was the worst she had ever made, recalled Bernard Danillon, the communications director for Pierre Cardin. Mr. Cardin had tried to stay in touch with Mme. Gres, Mr. Danillon said, but "every time that anyone asks about Mme. Gres to Jacques Mouclier, the answer was given by her daughter, and she said always, 'Mme. Gres wants to be quiet, she doesn't want to be disturbed, she doesn't want to talk to anybody.' "         "After years and years of getting this answer, you don't call again," Mr. Danillon said. "You respect someone's wish."         At the Costume Institute, Mr. Martin said he had made two attempts to contact Mme. Gres, one when the show was in the planning stage, the other when it was ready to open, inviting her to come. "We took the Women's Wear Daily response as being the sure indication that Mme. Gres was aware of the show," Mr. Martin said. "Maybe you wouldn't have told people if you were reclusive, but to create a fiction, a fabrication of her being alive? I don't even understand what the purpose would be."         Everyone who wrote about the exhibition discussed the designer in the present tense. Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times: "A nonagenarian, she is one of the great female designers who dominated haute couture in Paris until after World War II, when the men took over."         Those who admire her work are feeling haunted, having missed a long mourning period.         "It gives me goose bumps," said Susan Gutfreund, a client of Mme.  Gres who also shared a Paris hairdresser with her. She last saw her four years ago. "Her daughter must have had a reason to hide it, but I find it very sad," she said.         One of the reasons for the deception may have been the resentment that Anne Gres indicated to Le Monde over the way the French fashion industry had reacted in 1987, when her mother's couture house was liquidated after rent on her atelier went unpaid for two years. "No one did anything," Anne Gres said, when wooden mannequins, toiles and partly finished dresses were thrown into trash bags.         The house was emptied in a day. "That day there, she had paid in full, because they had stolen her life," she said.         In 1988, the house was bought by Mr. Yagi. Her daughter condemned the fashion professionals yesterday in Le Monde. "Mme. Gres is the Bosnia of couture," she said, always speaking in the present tense. "Except for Pierre Cardin and Hubert de Givenchy, who has tried to help her?"         Mme. Gres's death is remarkable in the way its secrecy mirrors her life. In interviews throughout her career, she refused to reveal her age, her parents' backgrounds (her grandparents were said to be Italian and German) or even her real name. Gres was the name taken by her husband, Serge Czerefkow, a Russian painter she married in the 30's. She was born Germaine Krebs, then changed her name to Alix Barton. The Metropolitan Museum's catalogue told her life story simply: "Mme. Gres is a creation," it said.         Trained as a sculptor, she began designing clothes in 1930 after learning sketching and cutting at the house of Premet. She then worked for a house called, coincidentally, Alix. During World War II, she started her own house, called Gres, one of only 20 that stayed open throughout the war.         By the 1950's, Mme. Gres had fully developed what became her signature. She devoted herself early on to draping, and even her name began to evoke images of Grecian dress. Soon she was dressing the society women who became devoted to her, and wives of heads of state, including Princess Grace, Jacqueline Kennedy and Danielle Mitterrand.         "Mme. Gres is one of the most important 20th-century designers," Mr. Martin said of his decision to hold a retrospective of her work. "Along with Vionnet and Chanel, Mme. Gres was making the most advanced clothing in Paris in the 1930's."         It was not until 1980 that Mme. Gres showed a ready-to-wear line, 10 years after her peers had done so.         In an interview with Women's Wear Daily in 1975, she said: "From the beginning, I didn't want to do what others were doing in any way. I wasn't able to, because I didn't have the knowledge. That was one reason I took the material and worked directly on it. I used the knowledge I had, which was sculpture."       
         Frances Prince Schuman, the founding chairwoman of the National Friends of Public Broadcasting and the wife of the composer William Schuman, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         She died after a brief illness, said her son, Anthony.         Mrs. Schuman was the founder and first chairwoman of the Friends of Thirteen and the National Friends of Public Broadcasting, and served for many years on the board of WNET Channel 13. With the director John Houseman she guided the development of the Acting Company, a theater group of drama graduates that her husband established when he was the president of the Juilliard School.         Mrs. Schuman, known as Frankie, was born in New York City in 1913 and graduated from Barnard College. Her early career was in social services, with a focus on people with disabilities. She was a staff member of the New York State Employment Service and a director of the Vocational Advisory Service. She was a founding director of the Cerebral Palsy Association and the Urban League of Westchester County, and at the time of her death was on the boards of the MacDowell Colony and the American Composers Orchestra.         In addition to her son, of Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Andrea, of Newton Highlands, Mass., and a grandson, Joshua Weiss.       
         Julie Haydon, the actress who created the role of the fragile Laura Wingfield in the original production of "The Glass Menagerie," died on Saturday in La Crosse, Wis. She was 84.         The cause was abdominal cancer, said Patricia Angelin, the executor of the estate of George Jean Nathan. Miss Haydon was the widow of Nathan, the drama critic.         When "The Glass Menagerie" opened on Broadway in 1945, it immediately established Tennessee Williams's reputation and represented an important return to the theater for Laurette Taylor, who played Amanda Wingfield, a fictional representation of the playwright's mother. Though overshadowed by Miss Taylor, Miss Haydon, as the young girl who cherished her collection of glass figurines, shared in the praise. In his review in The New York Times, Lewis Nichols wrote that she brought "a shy helplessness, a desire to be liked" to a role that was based on Williams's sister.         Miss Haydon was born in Oak Park, Ill. When she was 19, she toured with Minnie Maddern Fiske in "Mrs. Bumpstead Leigh." Two years later, she played Ophelia in a production of "Hamlet" at the Hollywood Playhouse. Among her films were "Age of Innocence" (with Irene Dunne), "The Scoundrel" (with Noel Coward) and "A Family Affair," the first in the Andy Hardy series. While appearing on the stage in California in "Autumn Crocus" (with Frances Lederer) she met Nathan.         She made her Broadway debut in 1935 in Philip Barry's "Bright Star," which closed after seven performances. Several subsequent plays were successes, including Paul Vincent Carroll's "Shadow and Substance," in which she played a saintly maid, and William Saroyan's Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Time of Your Life," in which she created the role of the prostitute Kitty Duval.         Also in the cast of "The Time of Your Life" were Gene Kelly and Eddie Dowling. Later she appeared in Saroyan's "Sweeney in the Trees" and "Hello, Out There," opposite Dowling. Reviewing "Hello, Out There," Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times that together they gave "a lyrical performance of great enchantment."         Dowling was the director as well as a star of "The Glass Menagerie" (in the role based on the author). After that historic production, Miss Haydon acted in several other Broadway plays, including Ferenc Molnar's "Miracle in the Mountains." Her performance in "The Glass Menagerie" remained the high point of her career.         She married Nathan in 1955. After his death in 1958, she made guest appearances in various plays often in community theaters and on college campuses. She also lectured in programs drawn from her husband's many books. In 1962 she left New York and returned to the Midwest. For 10 years she was actress in residence at the College of St. Teresa in Winona, Minn.         She played the mother in revivals of "The Glass Menagerie," and in 1980, still petite with a cameo face, she returned to the New York theater to do the role off Broadway, opposite Ms. Angelin as the daughter.         She is survived by her sister, Miriam Donaldson Ziegler of Los Angeles.       
         Elizabeth Glaser, who waged a tireless campaign to draw attention to pediatric AIDS after she unknowingly passed the disease on to her daughter and son, died yesterday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said Josh Baran, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Glaser, the wife of Paul Michael Glaser, a director and actor who starred in the "Starsky and Hutch" television series, was one of several public figures to bring AIDS to the forefront of the 1992 Presidential campaign. She had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion in 1981.         Thousands of delegates, dignitaries and guests stood frozen in place at the Democratic National Convention in New York City as she told of the death of her 7-year-old daughter, Ariel, in 1988 from AIDS.         "She taught me to love when all I wanted to do was hate," Mrs. Glaser said. "She taught me to help others when all I wanted to do was help myself."         In a statement yesterday, President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, said they were deeply saddened by her death. "Elizabeth confronted the challenge of AIDS in her own life and lost her beloved daughter to AIDS at a time when our Government and our country were too indifferent to this illness and the people who had it," he said.         Mrs. Glaser, a former teacher, was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus when she was nine months pregnant with Ariel, her first child. She began bleeding and was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she received seven pints of blood in a transfusion.         The baby was delivered successfully but four years later, became seriously ill. Hospital tests found her red blood count low, and she was later tested with the other members of the family for H.I.V.         Mrs. Glaser tested positive, and doctors found she had passed the virus to Ariel through her breast milk. She had also given the virus to her son, Jake, during pregnancy. Mr. Glaser remained uninfected.         Jake, now 10, has shown no signs that he has developed AIDS.         In 1988, drawing on connections made through her husband, Mrs. Glaser helped to found the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with two friends, Susan DeLaurentis and Susan Zeegen.         The foundation, working out of a donated room with 14 desks and 12 employees, has raised more than $30 million for pediatric education and research, much of it for the Ariel Project, which is searching for ways to block transmission of AIDS from a mother to her fetus.         The foundation is also studying why some children infected with H.I.V. live longer than others.         After she and her husband first described the family's fight with the virus in a magazine story in 1989, Mrs. Glaser became a public crusader for more Government involvement in AIDS research and prevention. She appeared on "60 Minutes" and on the cover of People magazine. She also testified before Congress.         In 1991, she wrote an autobiography, "In The Absence of Angels" (G. P. Putnam's Sons), with Laura Palmer, describing her frustration with the dearth of information on children suffering from AIDS. The book, which was called "a handbook on how the connected make waves in America" in a review in The New York Times, also detailed how she was able to mobilize legislators like Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who sponsored a benefit in Washington for Mrs. Glaser's fledgling foundation.         While she used her celebrity status to further her work, she also promoted her cause through sheer force of will. She was chosen to speak at the 1992 convention only after confronting Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, Mickey Kantor, now the United States Trade Representative, at a Los Angeles picnic, and telling him, "I have words inside me that I have to share."         Elizabeth Glaser was born in New York City and raised in Hewlett Harbor, L.I. She was educated at the University of Wisconsin and at Boston University and worked as a teacher and as a director at the Los Angeles Children's Museum.         She is survived by her husband and son; by her parents, Edith and Max Meyer of Sarasota, Fla., and by a brother, Peter, of Worcester, Mass.

         Aminda Badeau Wilkins, a retired welfare official and the widow of Roy Wilkins, longtime executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center. She was 89 and lived in Jamaica, Queens.         She suffered a brief illness, said Mildred Roxboro, director of development of the N.A.A.C.P.         Born in St. Louis, Mrs. Wilkins trained at the University of Chicago and started her career with a Chicago settlement house and doing case work in St. Louis. After her marriage to Mr. Wilkins in 1929, she moved to New York City and became a supervisor in the Department of Welfare.         She later carried out special projects for the commissioner and served as director of community relations. President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the National Advisory Council on Extension and Continuing Education, and she served on the Department of Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Armed Forces. She retired in 1971 as an assistant commissioner in the city's Department of Welfare.         Mr. Wilkins died in 1981.
