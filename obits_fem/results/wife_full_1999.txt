         Susan Strasberg, who at 17 electrified Broadway with her luminous portrayal of the title role of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' and -- with highs and lows professional and private -- went on to a career onstage and in movies, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 and also had a home in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her stepmother, Anna Strasberg.         As the daughter of Lee Strasberg, the director of the Actors Studio, and the acting coach Paula Miller, Ms. Strasberg spent her childhood surrounded by celebrated figures of the American theater, people who were, she said, ''supremely talented, alive, sensitive, eccentric, and some were neurotic and miserable.''         When she made her Broadway debut as Anne Frank in 1955, she was unknown, except for her last name. She had appeared in an Off Broadway play and had acted in two films, ''The Cobweb'' and ''Picnic,'' that had not been released. And she had never studied acting with her father.         With a naturalness and an authority that belied her limited theatrical experience, she was an astonishing success in her first major role. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson characterized her as ''a slender, enchanting young lady with a heart-shaped face, a pair of burning eyes and the soul of an actress.''         Ms. Strasberg's father was among those surprised by her performance. He and his wife had tried to talk to her about the interpretation of the role, but then left her to work on her own and with her director, Garson Kanin. ''When we saw Susie in action  we were all amazed at her great sensitivity,'' Mr. Strasberg said at the time. ''I just don't know how she picked it all up. She's never had any formal training.''         Ms. Strasberg was born in Manhattan, and her birth announcement heralded her as ''a four-star hit.'' After working briefly as a model, she made her theatrical debut Off Broadway in ''Maya,'' and followed that with several roles on television, including ''Romeo and Juliet,'' live on the Kraft Television Theater.         She auditioned for the role of Anne Frank, but the producer Kermit Bloomgarden made no decision about casting and the show was postponed. When the play was rescheduled in 1955, Ms. Strasberg was in Hollywood acting in the film of William Inge's ''Picnic.'' Mr. Bloomgarden and Albert and Frances Hackett, the authors of the play ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' asked her to read for the role again.         ''Susan was so terrified at the thought of being rejected that she declined to read at all,'' Mr. Bloomgarden had said in an interview. ''Finally, with tears in her eyes, Susan did read the last, touching scene from play. Within 10 minutes, she knew the part was hers.''         The play was an enormous hit, running for two years and winning the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the New York Drama Critics award and Tony Award for best play. Within the year, she was a certified Broadway star, with her name above the title on the Cort Theater marquee.         In 1957 she starred with Richard Burton and Helen Hayes in Jean Anouilh's ''Time Remembered.'' The next year she was in the Actors Studio revival of Sean O'Casey's ''Shadow of a Gunman'' and then she toured with Franchot Tone in ''Caesar and Cleopatra.'' In 1963 she returned to Broadway in the title role of Franco Zeffirelli's production of ''The Lady of the Camellias.'' When her first two films were released, she was on her way to movie stardom, and was soon playing opposite Henry Fonda in ''Stage Struck.''         Within several years, her career had crested and her private life was in turmoil. In the early 1960's she  was using a wide variety of drugs. When she wrote her autobiography in 1980, it was titled ''Bittersweet,'' a word that seemed to sum up her life. Her marriage to the actor Christopher Jones had ended. Her daughter, Jennifer, was born with a congenital birth defect: Ms. Strasberg blamed herself even though there was no medical evidence linking the drugs and the daughter's disabilities.         A reason she wrote her book, she  said, was that her career was stalled: ''It become totally untenable to me that after acting for 25 years -- I've played Juliet, Cleopatra and Anne Frank -- there I was, sitting in Hollywood, just waiting for somebody to want me.'' Her films include ''Kapo,'' ''The Trip,'' ''Manitou,'' ''Delta Force'' and ''Prime Suspect.'' In the book, she criticized her father for being preoccupied with his acting classes and she criticized her mother for being overly supervisory about her daughter's work.         She was also close to some of her father's students, especially Marilyn Monroe, whom she wrote about in ''Bittersweet'' and in her 1992 book, ''Marilyn and Me, Sisters, Rivals and Friends.''         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms. Strasberg is survived by her brother, John, who lives in Paris and New York, and by two half-brothers.         Even as Ms. Strasberg's life spiraled, those who saw her in her Broadway debut remembered her as the image of Anne Frank. After that opening night performance, she entered Sardi's with her parents, followed by Ms. Monroe. Before the reviews were read, Mr. Tone offered a toast: ''Little Susan, you have been launched on a long and glittering career.''       
         Betty Bryant, who had such a satisfying childhood career in the backwaters of show business that she never bothered to try to top herself in the Broadway mainstream, died on Jan. 15 at her home in Park Ridge, Ill.         She was 76 and was recalled as the third generation of a family of showboat performers who brought corn  pone and culture to riverside mid-America.         If her life wasn't actually written by Edna Ferber or set to music by Jerome Kern, it was surely because Miss Bryant was only 4 when Ferber's novel ''Show Boat'' came out in 1926, two years before Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d translated it to the Broadway stage.         By then Miss Bryant was an experienced on-board performer, one who had made her acting debut at the age of 6 weeks, stoically (she didn't cry) portraying the slave girl Eliza's baby in the dash across the ice in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.''         If ever an actress was at home in the theater it was she.         The family showboat was both her home and her stage, and for 20 years, until World War II helped bring the showboat era to an end, she spent her springs, summers and falls going from town to town along the Ohio River and its tributaries, sometimes stopping for several weeks in bigger river cities like Pittsburgh or Cincinnati.         During the off-season, with the boat tied up in West Virginia, the family would visit New York or Chicago, sometimes staging variety acts, sometimes just taking in the theatrical sights.         With her mother as her tutor, Miss Bryant managed to get her high school diploma from a cooperating school that monitored her progress.         Based on Miss Bryant's 1994 book ''Here Comes the Showboat'' (University Press of Kentucky), hers was an idyllic life and one she was certainly born to.         To say that show business was in her blood would be something of an understatement. Her grandfather, Sam Bryant, a onetime gardener at Buckingham Palace, had no known theatrical inclinations until he fell in love with a young Gilbert and Sullivan actress named Violet Chapman, who had inclinations enough for both of them.         After the couple married and came to the United States in 1884, it didn't take many years of nagging before Lady Violet, as she preferred to be known, had persuaded her husband to seek thespian adventure, initially, as it turned out, in a horse-drawn traveling medicine show in which Dr. Sam, as he was known, would hawk a cure-all mixture of gasoline and red pepper on the first night in a town, then stage a tent show on the second.         The couple's children, Billy and Florence, were part of the dodge from the beginning and by the time the family graduated to vaudeville a few years later, they had become the Four Bryants.         A chance summer booking on a turn-of-the-century Mississippi River showboat gave them the river bug. Within a few years, Dr. Sam and Captain Billy, as his son was soon known, had acquired first the Princess and then, in 1918, Bryant's New Showboat.         By then, Captain Billy had married the floating troupe's piano and calliope player, Josephine Costello, who gave birth to Betty four years later.         From her start in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' Miss Bryant swiftly advanced to other roles and vaudeville turns, including impressions of George M. Cohan and Eddie Cantor.         As the only member of her generation among the now six Bryants (although Aunt Florence was increasingly an absentee actress), she played boys as often as girls, but regardless of the sex, she soon learned, her forlorn character was sure to die before the final curtain.         That's because the Bryant plays tended to be heavy, heart-rending  melodramas, which never failed to delight their small-town audiences.         Captain Billy did stage an abridged version of ''Hamlet'' once,  but after he got a look at the dazed audience on its way out, he quickly reverted to more familiar fare, replacing it with ''Ten Nights in a Barroom,'' a sure audience pleaser, partly, no doubt, because Miss Bryant died so convincingly.         By the time she graduated to grown-up roles, Miss Bryant had mastered the psychological subtleties of the showboat method of melodrama.         As she wrote in her book, ''A dependable leading lady must be able to run, duck, fall, get up, fall again, crawl over a bed and under a dresser, scream, swing by a rope, deliver an uppercut, struggle and kick and still have enough breath left to say, 'If this is aristocracy, thank God I'm a country girl.' ''         At 20 she married a fellow showboat actor, Jat Herod, a jazz violinist who joined the Army and was soon entertaining troops, as he and his wife continued to do after the war.         She is survived by two daughters, JoAleene Miranda of Des Plaines, Ill., and Mary Perry of Park Ridge, and three grandchildren.         After their divorce in 1962, Miss Bryant, who never tried to win acting jobs in New York or Hollywood, settled in Park Ridge, where she directed amateur theatrical productions and frequently gave lectures on what it was like to grow up on a showboat.       
         Sarah (Sadie) Delany, the last of the storied Delany sisters, died peacefully in her sleep at age 109 yesterday at her home in Mount Vernon, N.Y., spokesmen for her family said.         She was the oldest survivor of one of America's most remarkable families, the daughter of a man who had been born a slave, and the first colored woman -- the term she preferred -- ever permitted to teach home economics in white New York City schools.         Miss Delany and her younger sister, Dr. A. Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, were always celebrated in Harlem, where they lived and flourished from 1916 to 1957, after leaving their native Raleigh, N.C.         Dr. Delany, who received her doctorate in dental surgery from Columbia in 1923, was the second black woman licensed to practice dentistry in New York State. She had an office in Harlem and was known to thousands of people only as ''Dr. Bessie.'' She charged $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling and never raised her rates in 27 years of practice.         The sisters gained widespread fame after the publication in 1993 of a memoir they called ''Having Our Say; The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years.'' They wrote it with Amy Hill Hearth as an oral history from their early days in the Jim Crow South to their arrival in New York City during the Harlem Renaissance to their life in a white suburb.         The book, now part of curriculums at hundreds of colleges and high schools, was on the New York Times hardcover best-seller list for 28 weeks and on the paperback list for 77 weeks. They followed it in 1995  with ''The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom.''         In 1995, ''Having Our Say'' was adapted by Emily Mann into a Broadway play that was nominated for three Tony awards. The play followed the sisters in virtually nonstop conversation while they prepared an annual meal celebrating their father's birthday in the home they owned on a dead-end street in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         The sisters lived in that house from 1957 to 1995, and Miss Delany  remained there after Dr. Delany died in 1995 at 104. ''She is my right arm,'' Miss Delany had told an interviewer shortly before her sister's death. ''If she were to die first, I'm not sure I would want to go on living because the reason I am living is to keep her living.''         But Sadie, as her friends called her, kept going, just as the Delany sisters always had. Her last book, with Ms. Hearth, ''On My Own at 107: Reflections on a Life Without Bessie,'' appeared in May 1997.         The sisters liked to say that Dr. Bessie was the acerbic one, who was convinced it was her duty to tell people the truth, whether it concerned race relations or their molars. Sadie would say to her, ''Bessie, don't you realize that people don't want to hear the truth?''         If Dr. Bessie was the vinegar, then Miss Sadie was the molasses, with an uncommon talent for getting along  and for being as sweet as the candy she used to make for extra money as a young teacher.         The Delanys were a mix of hard-working African, white and American Indian stock, a family that was rich in everything but money, reserved, aristocratic and irrepressible even as they suffered through segregation.         Sadie Delany always thought of herself as a ''colored woman'' or, if one insisted on labels, a Negro. She never saw herself as black -- that did not describe her color, she used to say -- nor did she care for the term African-American.         Henry Beard Delany, their gentle, scholarly father, was born into slavery in 1858. The Delanys were house slaves of a St. Marys, Ga., family named Mock, who taught them to read and write. Henry Delany later attended St. Augustine's School in Raleigh and became the first Negro bishop of the Episcopal Church. He met his future wife, Nanny James Logan, at St. Augustine's. Sarah Louise Delany, their second child, was  born Sept. 19, 1889, at an aunt's home in Lynch's Station, Va. She grew up with two sisters and six brothers on  the campus of St. Augustine's, where their father was vice principal.         Happy though they might have been, the South around them was not. The former Confederate states were still reacting to the loss of the war nearly 50 years before. The sisters took different approaches to the Jim Crow laws passed across the south around 1914. In ''Having Our Say,'' Sadie Delany wrote:         ''I'll tell you how I handled white people. There was a shoe store in Raleigh called Heller's. The owner was a Jewish man, very nice. If you were colored, you had to go in the back to try on shoes, and white people sat in front. It wasn't Mr. Heller's fault; this was the Jim Crow law. I would go in there and say, 'Good morning, Mr. Heller, I would like to try on those shoes in the window.' And I would say, 'Where, Mr. Heller?' And he would gesture to the back and say, 'Back there.' And I would say, 'Back where?' Well, I'd just worry that man to death. Finally, he'd say, 'Just sit anywhere, Miss Delany!' And so I would sit myself down in the white section, and smile.         ''Now Bessie thinks that I shouldn't play dumb like that,'' she recalled. ''But I don't care. I got to sit in the white section.''         Sadie Delany liked to say that  when she got her master's degree in education from Columbia in 1925, a white teacher there observed, ''That Sarah Delany. You tell her to do something, she smiles at you, and then she just turns around and does what she wants anyway.''         In this, Miss Delany said, she was ''just like Papa.''         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1910. Her first job was working for the black school system in Wake County, N.C., teaching subjects like sanitation, how to can food and how to care for newborn infants.         Years later, she remembered her students: ''They looked up to me and I showed them it was possible to live a better life, despite what white people were trying to do to us.'' She proudly recalled driving Booker T. Washington around when he visited.         The Delany sisters first saw New York City in 1915, on a visit with their mother. Their father agreed to let them move to New York to attend college. Sadie Delany moved first, in  1916, and Bessie came along a year later. It was one of the rare times when the sisters were separated. Eventually, 9 of the 10 Delany children moved to New York, and all received college educations. Only Lemuel, the oldest, stayed in the South. The sisters are survived by 13 nieces and nephews.         At one point, Sadie, Bessie, Julia, Hubert and Lucius Delany lived together at 2505 Seventh Avenue and West 145th Street in Harlem, each paying a $9 share of the monthly rent. Their neighbors complained.         ''They thought we were running a fast house!'' the two sisters recalled.  ''We don't know why it didn't occur to them that we were brothers and sisters, except that they must have had unclear minds. So we had a little talk with the super and straightened out the whole mess.'' The Delanys had quite a few such talks over the years with people who did not understand them, and they always straightened out the mess.         While she was teaching at Public School 119, Sadie Delany found she could not support herself on the salary, so she started baking cakes and selling them for a nickel a slice to other teachers. She also made lemon and cinnamon lollipops, which she sold for a penny a piece.         People liked her cakes and candies so much that she rented a loft on 121st Street in the late 1920's and made homemade chocolate fondant, a soft, creamy affair. Called ''Delany's Delights,'' it was soon sold all over New York, including Abraham & Straus, at $2 a pound. She closed her business down after the 1929 stock market crash. ''People had no money for chocolate fondant, that's for sure,'' she said.         After years of teaching at predominantly black grade schools, Miss Delany wanted to teach high-school level domestic science, as home economics was then called. She had a master's from Columbia, after all. No Negro had ever done that before. She applied for a job, and received a letter from the Board of Education asking to meet her.         She knew that if the board members saw her, they would not hire her. So she skipped the appointment, sent a polite letter explaining there had been a ''mixup,'' and just showed up at the all-white Theodore Roosevelt High School on the first day of class.         ''They just about died when they saw me,'' she recalled. ''A colored woman!''         She kept the job and spent the rest of her career teaching at excellent high schools before retiring in 1960. Among them were Girls' High School in Brooklyn, Evander Childs High School in the Bronx and Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, where she taught adults at night.         It was lonely, she said. Some of her  fellow teachers, who were all white,  were friendly, she said, ''but you couldn't count on any of them being your real friend.''         She told Ms. Hearth: ''New York was no piece of cake for a colored person, but it was an improvement over the South, child. But don't go thinking I don't love the South. I was born there, and I expect to be buried there, right next to my Mama and Papa. Raleigh will always be home.''         ''Sadie is molasses without even trying,'' her sister once said. ''She can sweet-talk the world, or play dumb, or whatever it takes to get by without a fuss.'' ''         But sometimes the molasses could boil. The Board of Education once sent her what she called a ''nasty'' letter. She had lived for so long that the bean counters had become convinced that she must have died and that somebody else was cashing all those pension checks. She was furious, but as usual straightened it all out.         Toward the end of her life, Sadie Delany did not want anybody to think that she and her sister were just a couple of old women letting life slip by as they sat in their rocking chairs. ''Why, we don't even own a rocking chair,'' she said.         She said she woke up every morning at 6:30, smiled and said, ''Thank you, Lord, for another day.'' Then she would wake up Bessie, a late sleeper, who would open her eyes and say, ''Oh Lord, another day?''         Then they would prepare their food, consuming as many as seven different vegetables a day and lots of fresh fruit. They took vitamin supplements, boiled their water despite assurances that people could drink Mount Vernon water and live. They took up Yoga. They ate milk shakes for dinner, watched the nightly news on public television, said their prayers (extra ones for the people Bessie didn't like) and went to bed.         They believed that their simple lives and good food contributed to their longevity. Bessie said another reason was they ''never had husbands to worry us to death.''         But Sadie Delany said, ''Life is short, and it's up to you to make it sweet.''       
         Lucille Kallen, the lone woman in the raucous, celebrated and astonishingly untidy group of television writers behind Sid Caesar's ''Your Show of Shows,'' died on Monday at her home in Ardsley, N.Y. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Lise Engel.         ''Your Show of Shows,'' which starred Mr. Caesar and Imogene Coca, was broadcast live for 90 minutes on Saturday nights from 1950 to 1954 and is today revered as a classic of television's golden age. For writers, a job on the program was a coveted plum; many of Ms. Kallen's colleagues, including Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner and Neil Simon, would become show business luminaries in their own right.         The quick-witted, fast-talking gang of writers was so famous that it was memorialized repeatedly in popular culture, including the 1982 film ''My Favorite Year'' (remade as a Broadway musical in 1992) and Mr. Simon's play ''Laughter on the 23d Floor'' (1993). But Ms. Kallen, one of a tiny handful of women employed as television comedy writers in the 1950's, was curiously absent from these works: they featured instead a generic female character who was an amalgam of Ms. Kallen and Selma Diamond, a writer for ''Caesar's Hour,'' which succeeded ''Your Show of Shows.''         The two women were also conflated in the character of Sally Rogers, played by Rose Marie on ''The Dick Van Dyke Show.'' That program, created by Mr. Reiner, starred Mr. Van Dyke as a television comedy writer.         ''Lucille got lost a little bit,'' said Mel Tolkin, the head writer on ''Your Show of Shows.''  ''She was generally the least given credit because the other people are so loud and so famous.''         But if her co-workers barreled into posterity as hit playwrights, movie directors and 2,000-year-old men, Ms. Kallen was, in Mr. Reiner's words, ''a real writer'' -- the profession's most dignified accolade -- who possessed a finely honed ear for dialogue.         ''She was quite a talented girl, and she was cute as a button, too,'' Mr. Reiner, who also performed as Mr. Caesar's second banana on ''Your Show of Shows,'' said recently. ''And being the woman, she did give it the woman's touch.''         In addition, Ms. Kallen was the author of six novels, including the C. B. Greenfield mystery series.         Last year, Ms. Kallen unearthed in her attic a faded piece of paper that neatly encapsulated her craft. The paper contained notes for a sketch in which a wife (Ms. Coca) bemoaned the spark gone from her marriage to Mr. Caesar:         Wife: Where is the sense of adventure? Where is the fun? Where is the romance?         Husband: How do I know where you put things? I can't even find my shirt!         ''This was so typical of their exchanges that I could practically write it in my sleep,'' Ms. Kallen observed in an oral history videotaped last April for the Archive of American Television in Hollywood.         Lucille Kallen was born on May 28, 1922, in Los Angeles. At 3, she moved with her mother to Toronto after her parents separated; she was raised there by her grandparents after her mother's death seven years later. As a girl, she trained to become a concert pianist; as a teen-ager, she founded a theater troupe, for which she wrote songs and sketches.         At 16, Ms. Kallen moved to New York to study at the Juilliard School, but in the years that followed she had two epiphanies that pre-empted her classical-music career: one, her fingers were too short; two, she hated to practice.         She turned instead to writing, putting together a nightclub revue that included the young Martin Balsam. The act was spotted by the producer Max Liebman, who invited Ms. Kallen to hone her craft at Camp Tamiment, a Poconos resort renowned for its Saturday night shows. At Tamiment, she was teamed with Mr. Tolkin, who would become her longtime writing partner. She also met her future husband, Herbert Engel, who worked there as a soda jerk; they were married in 1952. Mr. Engel, a businessman, survives her, as do her daughter, of Manhattan; her son, Paul, of Oceanside, N.Y., and four grandchildren.         On the strength of their Tamiment sketches, Ms. Kallen and Mr. Tolkin were hired to write for a new television show produced by Mr. Liebman, ''The Admiral Broadway Review,'' which paired Mr. Caesar and Ms. Coca for the first time. Undeterred by the fact that she had never even seen a television program, Ms. Kallen signed on, dashing off sketches with Mr. Tolkin in a corner of the male dancers' dressing room. The program, broadcast simultaneously on NBC and the Dumont network from January to June of 1949, was the direct progenitor of ''Your Show of Shows,'' which made its debut on NBC the following year.         As Ms. Kallen recalled, she and her colleagues didn't simply write ''Your Show of Shows,'' they lived it, working seven days a week, 39 weeks a year at the program's offices in midtown Manhattan, producing a series of now-classic sketches, including movie parodies (''From Here to Obscurity''), opera sendups (''Galipacci'') and the weekly travails of the married couple Charles and Doris Hickenlooper for the live broadcast on Saturday night.         In their cramped domain, known as the Writers' Room, the air was blue with cigar smoke and invective and the decor was early fraternity house: dogeared sofa, discarded paper cups crunching underfoot, half-eaten sandwiches abandoned beneath piles of typescript, acoustical-tile ceiling stuck with pencils hurled there in moments of frustration, and widening pools of spilled coffee. ''I learned,'' Ms. Kallen wrote afterward, ''to wear dark skirts.''         As the men paced and the room erupted with jokes and argument, Ms. Kallen was a small, ordered island in a roiling sea, sitting calmly, her legs tucked under her, taking down the good stuff in pencil on a yellow legal pad as it hurtled by, all the while contributing her share. ''She was the only one who could write and talk at the same time,'' Mr. Caesar recalled recently. ''The rest of us were all crazy. It was all being made up at that moment: 'Put it in!'  'Take it out!'  'You've got to put it back!' So it was a very, very frustrating job.''         Most of the writers were extremely large. All of them were extremely loud. Ms. Kallen was 5 foot 1 and, when off duty, spoke with measured thoughtfulness.         ''I was torn between preserving my femininity and preserving my career,'' she later said. ''It was difficult to be forceful enough to get through.''         At one point, she resorted to standing on the sofa and waving a red scarf to command attention. It worked -- briefly.         When ''Your Show of Shows'' went off the air, Ms. Kallen turned down a job with its successor, ''Caesar's Hour'' (1954-57), to write for ''The Imogene Coca Show,'' which lasted only a single season. With Mr. Tolkin, she wrote a short-lived Broadway play, ''Maybe Tuesday'' (1958). In addition to writing five mysteries, she was the author of the novel ''Outside There, Somewhere,'' (1964), a comic, early feminist exploration of the competing demands of career and motherhood.         Reflecting on her Writers' Room days, Ms. Kallen was forthright about the condescension as well as the camaraderie she encountered there. ''At the time I felt it was one big happy family, but later I said, What an idiot!'' she remarked. ''There was a male phalanx, and then there was me. But when we were working, there was no difference.''       
         Iris Murdoch, a prodigiously inventive and idiosyncratic British writer whose 26 novels offered lively plots, complex characters and intellectual speculation, died yesterday at a nursing home in Oxford, England. She was 79 and had Alzheimer's disease.         Her struggle with Alzheimer's was documented recently in ''Elegy for Iris,'' a memoir by her husband, the critic and novelist John Bayley, who was at her bedside when she died.         Miss Murdoch's first novel was published in 1954 and in a career that lasted for more than four decades, her fiction received many honors, including the Booker Prize for ''The Sea, the Sea,'' the Whitbread Literary Award for Fiction for ''The Sacred and Profane Love Machine'' and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for ''The Black Prince.'' Although she was made a Dame of the British Empire, she rarely garnered the attention given to gaudier contemporaries. She spent much of her career quietly teaching and writing, away from lecture tours, prize committees and television appearances.         Along with novels, she produced a half a dozen works on philosophy, several plays, critical writing on literature and modern ideas and poetry.         Miss Murdoch had a background in philosophy -- she knew and wrote about Jean-Paul Sartre, studied with Ludwig Wittgenstein and was a lecturer in philosophy at Oxford University -- and her fiction grappled with such questions as the nature of good and evil. This led many who knew her work superficially to assume that her novels were philosophical explorations of the origins of morality and behavior and too esoteric or intellectually rigorous for a general audience.         In fact, many of Miss Murdoch's novels are exuberantly melodramatic, offering bemused records of romantic or erotic follies, as well as more somber battles between individuals representing moral good and its opposite. Her characters, drawn largely from the middle class, are described with loving exactitude and in such depth that their struggles to define what it means to live a good life take on dramatic force.         In Books, Happiness And Moral Lessons         Far from viewing fiction as another and lesser way of dealing with philosophical questions, Miss Murdoch argued that literature was meant ''to be grasped by enjoyment,'' and that the art of the tale was ''a fundamental form of thought'' in its own right. The ideal reader, she told one interviewer, was ''someone who likes a jolly good yarn and enjoys thinking about the book as well, about the moral issues.'' In another interview she went further, asserting that good art offers ''uncontaminated'' happiness that also teaches ''how to look at the world and to understand it; it makes everything far more interesting.''         Her belief in literature had its inception in her happy and book-filled childhood. Jean Iris Murdoch was born in Dublin on July 15, 1919, the only child of British and Irish parents. When she was a year old her family moved to London, where her father, Wills John Hughes Murdoch, joined the civil service. In interviews she remembered that as a child she had existed ''in a perfect trinity of love.'' Her mother, the former Irene Alice Richardson, who had trained as an opera singer, was a ''beautiful, lively, witty woman with a happy temperament.''         Her father began discussing books with her early on and encouraged her to read widely. She progressed rapidly from Lewis Carroll (one of her favorites) and Robert Louis Stevenson to more adult fare. Her great pleasure in reading, and her early attempts to write stories led to the conviction, which she formed as a child, that she would become a writer.         She attended boarding school in Bristol, and in 1938 entered Somerville College, a women's college at Oxford, where she studied the classics, ancient history and philosophy. She graduated with honors in 1942 and immediately took a job with the Treasury. In 1944 she began working for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which helped Europeans displaced by World War II. The somber experiences of the war had a profound impact on her thinking. Close friends died while in service, and her work, often on the front lines, with poor and elderly refugees was hard but instructive.         If her childhood had been mostly idyllic, there was, she later noted, at  least one shadow falling across her memories of those years: her family members were largely ''wanderers,'' cut off from their Irish relations and their roots. Working with refugees led her to reflect further on the place of the exile in modern society, as well as on the sources of evil, raising questions that she would pursue in many novels.         After leaving the United Nations, Miss Murdoch took up further study in philosophy at Cambridge University, where she worked with Wittgenstein. While she expressed no lasting allegiance to his school of thought, she said her studies with him  spurred her development as a writer.         In 1948 she became a fellow and tutor at St. Anne's College at Oxford, where she remained for 15 years as a lecturer in philosophy. It was a particularly heady time for anyone concerned with the study and application of philosophical thought; new schools of philosophy were contending for primacy and often combative works were being produced to define these emerging disciplines.         Miss Murdoch had met Sartre, the most visible proponent of existentialism, while working with refugees in  Belgium. Existentialism, with its focus on individual will, appealed to her, but she found its emphasis on the primacy of the self disturbing.  Her first published work, ''Sartre: Romantic Rationalist'' (1953), was a serious, clear explanation of existentialism and its place in contemporary thought. While it was balanced, it was not uncritical: Miss Murdoch felt that existentialism encouraged an almost hermetic focus on the self, ignoring the corrosive implications of such a perspective on society.         Her study paid special attention to Sartre's fiction. She had already written and discarded several novels, but now she had become absorbed with how fiction expressed ideas and the ways fiction and ideas could best be blended. ''Under the Net,'' her first published novel, appeared to generally positive reviews. It focused on the picaresque adventures of a free-spirited Irishman making the rounds of some of the more raffish areas of London and Paris. A reviewer in The Times Literary Supplement said the work seemed to announce the emergence of ''a brilliant talent.''         The novel signaled the beginning of an industrious and prolific career.  Miss Murdoch published, on average, a novel every two years for the next four decades. Her work, while varied in setting and tone, rarely moved far from several central preoccupations and themes.         She first encountered existentialist writings while working with refugees, and she drew deeply from her fascination with those experiences in  her second novel, ''Flight From the Enchanter'' (1956). It concerns the  well-intentioned, conventionally liberal Rose Keep, who attempts to offer solace to two Polish brothers, refugees from the war. Her efforts founder because she cannot see the brothers as something more than symbols of displaced, wounded humanity.         Revisiting Themes Of Pure Love         The double-edged nature of love figures often in Miss Murdoch's fiction. True love, she asserted in the essay ''The Sublime and the Good,'' was perhaps the best way to overcome isolation and the absorption with one's crippled and constricted self. ''Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real,'' she argued.         Many of the figures in her fourth novel, ''The Bell'' (1958), are crippled by their inability to clearly see, and thus to truly love, those around them. ''The Bell'' reached a new level of sophistication for Miss Murdoch, displaying elements that would  become hallmarks of her fiction: effortless shifting between the grim and the humorous; deft marshaling of a large, varied cast of characters and numerous subplots, and creation of fables or myths that could suggest the struggle between true and diminished forms of love.         In many of Miss Murdoch's novels, romantic disasters, suicides and even murder are set in motion by a character who is brilliant and ferociously self-absorbed. Such figures, usually men, often go beyond egotism into evil.         In ''A Fairly Honorable Defeat'' (1970), a biologist who helps create biological weapons sets out to destroy those around him. But goodness, Miss Murdoch suggests, while imperiled, is also resilient.         In ''The Sacred and Profane Love Machine'' (1974), the only character who comes close to true altruism is destroyed. But the novel suggests that her death may have opened the  hearts of those around her to a better, more responsible life.         ''The Sea, the Sea'' (1978), which received the Booker Prize, is considered one of Miss Murdoch's best novels. Its protagonist, a retired theatrical director trying to win back his first love, is not so much evil as simply self-absorbed and dangerously certain of his limited view of the world.         ''A Severed Head'' (1961) was a black farce about infidelity, incest and violence.         Storytelling And Large Truths         Miss Murdoch was always balancing the demands of storytelling with the more urgent need to examine how the truth of a fleeting life reflected the larger, permanent truths of  existence.         ''The Red and the Green'' charts the fates of two friends who find themselves on opposite sides during Ireland's 1916 Easter rebellion against British rule.         ''The Nice and the Good'' follows  the efforts of a decent man to uncover the reasons for a colleague's suicide and extricate himself from the seamy web of blackmail and the occult that he uncovers.         ''Italian Girl'' traces the struggle of a young man to liberate himself from the corrosive effects of family secrets and a shallow, destructive image of love.         The tension generated by this iconoclastic approach to fiction has made Murdoch's novels unique and controversial. Her fiction takes a distinctive vigor and texture from its combination of the usual elements of a tale with a sustained, sophisticated inquiry into such concepts as the defining characteristics of goodness, the nature of morality, the place of faith in everyday life and the conflict between spiritual and carnal love.         When most other writers were content to dwell on the heated specifics of individual lives or to simply offer a catalogue of society's ills, Miss Murdoch dared to suggest that fiction should be a means of dealing with life's largest and most basic issues and a way to learn about moral behavior.         This quest ''for a passion beyond any center of self,'' as David Bromwich wrote in The New York Times Book Review, made her fiction unlike that of any other contemporary Western writer. It also let her in for  both considerable acclaim and criticism. Harold Bloom, while praising her ''formidable combination of intellectual drive and storytelling exuberance'' in a review of her novel ''The Good Apprentice'' in The Times, and noting her ''mastery'' in ''representing the maelstrom of falling in love,'' also found that her narrative voice often lacked authority, ''being too qualified and fussy.''         Anthony Burgess, while noting the highly original ''synthesis of the traditional and revolutionary'' in her work and praising her talent for creating stories that were ''both thoroughly realistic yet at the same time loaded with symbols,'' also argued in his 1967 book ''The Novel Now'' that her characters were too often ''caught up in a purely intellectual  pattern.'' In a memorable phrase, he contended that, while Miss Murdoch had a rare ability ''to dredge that world of the strange and mysterious'' that rested ''on the boundary of the ordinary,'' her work rarely offered a convincing portrait of the more common realms of life.         In a body of work so large, both admirers and critics were bound to find material to advance their arguments, and this was true as well in her later novels, such as ''The Message to the Planet'' (1989) and ''The Green Knight'' (1994).         But neither criticism nor praise seemed much to affect her. She said that she never read her reviews. She rarely read modern writers, preferring the British and European novelists of the 19th century (Jane Austen,  Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Henry James, Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky), with whom she felt an affinity, describing them as ''moralistic writers who portray the complexity of morality and the difficulty of being good.''         She lived for many years in the small village of Steeple Aston, near  Oxford, in a house crowded with books and paintings. The quiet life there, and in the house in Oxford to which she moved in 1986, has been described memorably by her husband, an Oxford don, in ''Elegy for Iris,'' his memoir of their lives together.         John Bayley fell in love with Iris Murdoch when he was in his late 20's and she was in her early 30's; she passed his window on a bicycle. ''I indulged the momentary fantasy that nothing had ever happened to her; that she was simply bicycling about, waiting for me to arrive,'' he wrote. ''She was not a woman with a past or an unknown present.'' They were married in 1956; he is her only close survivor.         The novelist Mary Gordon, reviewing ''Elegy for Iris'' in The Times, touched on their relationship. ''Radical privacy, sealing compartments of her life off from each other, was always a condition of Iris Murdoch's selfhood, and anyone who married her had to deal with that. From the beginning, she had friendships that she kept from Bayley, and love affairs that he was meant to understand had nothing to do with him. There are some hints that this was not always easy, but Bayley rose to the challenge.'' Ms. Gordon then quotes Mr. Bayley's memoir: ''In early days, I always thought it would be vulgar -- as well as not my place -- to give any indications of jealousy, but she knew when it was there, and she soothed it just by being the self she always was with me, which I soon knew to be wholly and entirely different from any way that she was with other people.''         Slipping Into A Baffling Darkness         In 1995 Miss Murdoch told an interviewer that she was experiencing severe writer's block, noting that the struggle to write had left her in ''a  hard, dark place.'' In 1996, Mr. Bayley announced that she had Alzheimer's disease, which she had suffered for five years by the time she died. Her final three weeks were spent in a nursing home. If ''Elegy for Iris'' offers a moving evocation of a great love story, it also provides a grim record of watching the personality of a loved one gradually dwindle under the burden of fear, bafflement and grief.         She was, Miss Murdoch confided to one of her friends, ''sailing into the darkness.'' Mr. Bayley's descriptions of his struggle to understand his wife's suffering, to find ways to ameliorate it and to come to grips with the physical demands of his new responsibilities and to understand the conflicting emotions aroused in him by the experience are exact, penetrating and unsparing. Miss Murdoch became like ''a very nice 3-year-old,'' her husband said, and she needed to be fed, bathed and changed.         The note on which the book concludes, however, is one of reconciliation, and of a painfully won serenity. ''Every day,'' Mr. Bayley wrote of their lives together in Miss Murdoch's last years, ''we are physically closer. . . . She is not sailing into the dark. The voyage is over, and under the dark escort of Alzheimer's, she has arrived somewhere. So have I.''       
         Lucienne Bloch, an acclaimed muralist whose most significant contribution to art may have been a series of surreptitious photographs she took in 1933, died on March 13 at her home in Gualala, Calif. She was 90.         She was the photographer whose sneak pictures taken behind enemy lines on May, 8, 1933, are the sole visual record of the great Diego Rivera's ill-fated Rockefeller Center fresco with its doomed depiction of Lenin.         At a time of economic distress, when capitalism itself seemed vulnerable to competing currents of social change, if anybody was going to pin Lenin on a capitalist wall it was Diego Rivera, the fiery Mexican muralist whose artistic acclaim was matched only by his reputation as a fiercely committed, if renegade, Communist.         If anybody was going to stop him it was John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s son, Nelson A. Rockefeller, who had commissioned Rivera to paint a 1,000-square-foot fresco, ''Man at the Crossroads,'' in the great hall of the new RCA Building, the soaring Rockefeller Center capstone now known as the G.E. Building and at the time an especially potent symbol of capitalism.         Sure enough, when it became apparent that Rivera was intent on portraying Lenin as a charismatic leader, Rockefeller asked him to substitute an anonymous figure, and Rivera refused.         Realizing his work was doomed, Rivera hired a photographer to take pictures of the mural, but Rockefeller, determined that there be no record of what the family regarded as desecration of their property, had guards at the building thwart the effort.         Aware that the mural would be sealed off the next day, the Rockefellers could be complacent, but only because they had not reckoned on  Miss Bloch, an unpaid Rivera assistant who seemed an unlikely foot soldier in his anti-capitalist cause.         A Geneva-born daughter of the celebrated Swiss composer, Ernst Bloch, she was a child of privilege who had come to the United States with her family in 1917 and lived in Cleveland until 1925, when her father became director of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and her mother, aware that the composer would be comforted by mistresses, took her children to Paris.         There, Miss Bloch studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and made a yearlong side trip to the Netherlands, studying at the Leerdam glass works and turning out such impressive glass sculptures that she had a one-woman show in New York in 1931 and was invited by Frank Lloyd Wright to teach at his Wisconsin school.         By then, however, she had become fascinated by another art. Shortly after her arrival in New York in 1931, she was invited to a banquet honoring Rivera in connection with his famous one-man show at the Museum of Modern Art. Largely because Rivera spoke little English and no one else spoke Spanish, the 22-year-old Miss Bloch, who spoke French, a language Rivera also knew, was seated next to the great man.         During their animated conversation, a dark-haired woman came up behind Miss Bloch and said, ''I hate you,'' a comment of such disarming candor that Miss Bloch burst out laughing. The woman was Rivera's wife, the tortured artist Frida Kahlo, whose husband's philandering gave her reason to fear the worst, but not, as it happened, from Miss Bloch.         As the the daughter of a womanizing father, Miss Bloch made clear, she had no designs on Kahlo's womanizing husband, a pledge that laid the groundwork for a remarkable friendship.         Over the next few years, Miss Bloch worked on Rivera's controversial mural at the Detroit Institute of Art and on the Rockefeller Center project, along the way falling in love with the artist's chief plasterer, Stephen P. Dimitroff, a young Bulgarian immigrant, and immortalizing their romance in lyrical passages in her diary, which a granddaughter, Lucienne Allen, plans to use as the basis for a book.         The couple, who eventually married, became an artistic team, he handling the plaster and she the painting for frescoes all over the country, including her most acclaimed work, ''The Evolution of Music,'' at George Washington High School in upper Manhattan.         They lived for a time in Flint, Mich., where he became a union organizer and she photographed strikes for Life and other publications, before eventually moving to Mill Valley, Calif., where Mr. Dimitroff, who died in 1996, operated a frame shop until the couple retired to Gualala in 1965.         After a lifetime devoted to art, including wide-ranging sculptures in glass, wood and terra cotta and a famous series of photographs of Kahlo, Miss Bloch is nevertheless largely recalled for her association with another artist's work, but, then, the artist was Rivera, widely regarded as a 20th century giant, and her photographs are all that remain of his most famous work.         For that, Miss Bloch, who is survived by two sons, George Ernst Dimitroff of Tumwater, Wash., and Pancho Dimitroff of Aurora, Colo; a daughter, Sita Milchev, of Gualala; a sister, Suzanne Bloch Smith of New York; 8 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren, had only herself to blame.         It was she, after all, on the night after Rivera's hired photographer had been thwarted, who slipped a camera under her blouse and walked boldly into the RCA building with Mr. Dimitroff and Kahlo, who distracted the guards while Miss Bloch climbed up on the scaffold and proceeded to photograph the mural.         The next day, in what has been likened to a military operation, the mural was shrouded from public view.         Nine months later, after the resulting furor had subsided, it was scraped into oblivion -- almost.         Rivera did a copy in Mexico City, complete with Lenin, but it is only Miss Bloch's photographs that show it as it was -- on a Rockefeller wall.         Correction:  April 6, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary of the muralist Lucienne Bloch on March 28 misspelled the given name of her father. He was Ernest Bloch, not Ernst.       
         Lila Hotz Luce Tyng, the first wife of Henry R. Luce, founder of Time Inc., died on Wednesday at her home in Gladstone, N.J., five days after her 100th birthday.         Mrs. Tyng, the mother of Mr. Luce's children, was a leading figure in New York's social and philanthropic circles for several decades.         Though overshadowed in history by the editor's famous second wife, the author Clare Boothe Luce, Mrs. Tyng played an important role in the life of Mr. Luce, who sought her advice even after they were divorced, said Robert E. Herzstein, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina and the author of ''Henry R. Luce'' (Scribner, 1994).         Lila Hotz was born in Chicago in 1899, the daughter of Robert Schuttler Hotz, an inventor and financier, and Lila Ross Hotz. On New Year's Eve 1919, she met the young Luce through one of his Yale classmates, Thornton Wilder; they were married in 1923.         The young wife hoped that Time's growing success would eventually allow her workaholic husband to join her in the kind of social whirl she loved. But they divorced in 1935, not long after Mr. Luce met Clare Boothe, whose literary and journalistic drives and interests better matched his own. ''Lila was devastated when Luce confronted her with his intention to divorce her,'' Dr. Herzstein said. ''But they maintained a closeness and were in constant contact, often discussing their children's education and careers, among other things.''         Mrs. Tyng and Mr. Luce, who died in 1967, had two sons: Henry Luce 3d,  chairman and chief executive of the Henry Luce Foundation in New York City, and Peter Paul Luce of Englewood, Colo.         In 1939, she married Sewell Tappan Tyng, a lawyer, author, head of a mining company and assistant to the New York City District Attorney, Thomas E. Dewey. She became a fixture in New York society, serving on the boards of several institutions,  including the Henry Street Settlement, the Berkshire Farm School, the Spence-Chapin Adoption Service  and the Grosvenor Neighborhood House. She once reported attending 36 balls in 36 weeks.         Besides her two sons, Mrs. Tyng is survived by six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Felicia Gizycka Magruder, an American heiress who was kidnapped as a child by her father, a continental count, died on Feb. 26 at the Regency retirement community in Laramie, Wyo. She was 93 and moved to Laramie from New Canaan, Conn., in 1995.         Mrs. Magruder was the former Countess Felicia Gizycka, the only daughter of the Chicago-born newspaper heiress Eleanor Medill Patterson and Count Josef Gizycki, a fortune-hunting scion of a noble Polish family. Ms. Patterson, who eventually divorced the count, was a granddaughter of Joseph Medill, the founder of The Chicago Tribune.         The little Countess Felicia, as the newspapers later called her, was born in 1905 in Blansko in what is now the Czech Republic.         In 1908, when Felicia was a golden-haired, blue-eyed toddler, The New York Times reported that she had been ''kidnapped in London by the Count,'' who ''is thought to be either in Vienna or St. Petersburg and has concealed the child.'' The Times said that earlier ''the Countess ran away from him with her child one night after a violent quarrel.''         The ensuing custody struggle led President-elect William Howard Taft to intervene with Czar Nicholas II of Russia, in whose realm the Gizycki family estates were located. In December 1908, Taft wrote the Czar pointing out Felicia's mother's connection to Russia and saying that the count had put the kidnapped toddler in a convent in Russia. Taft asked the Czar to ''make such order to Count Gizycki as shall seem to Your Majesty equitable.''         The Czar commanded the count to return Felicia to her mother, and when that happened, as one Patterson biographer has written, ''they caught the first train for Germany and from there took the first steamship to America.''         Lake Forest, Ill. became their home. Mrs. Magruder's mother also bought a ranch in Wyoming, and there, as The Laramie Daily Boomerang reported in its obituary of Mrs. Magruder, an able young journalist named Drew Pearson ''came out to court Felicia.''         But things did not go smoothly, and the teen-age countess ''caught a train to San Diego, where she took an assumed name and supported herself as a waitress.'' In a 1939 interview she said, ''I tell you, I was good'' as a waitress.         ''I could swing a mean tray,'' she added. ''I always wanted to make my own way in life -- it gives one a nice feeling.''         Undeterred, Pearson caught up with her. He is said to have made her a practical offer: ''Look, you're only 18. Marry me now and in three years, if you don't love me, you can leave and start your life all over again.'' Their marriage began in 1925, produced a daughter, Ellen, and was ended in divorce by Mrs. Pearson after three years.         But what years they were, with the promising Pearson, who was not yet the mighty syndicated columnist he later became, taking his young wife  to China and beyond, while he polished his journalistic skills.         In later years she wrote for American magazines and newspapers, lived in New York and elsewhere, and wrote novels and short stories.  In her 1939 novel ''Flower of Smoke,'' the Austrian-American heroine says, ''Make your own peace, no matter what.''         After living for years in New Canaan she moved for good to Wyoming, where she had relatives.         Her 1934 marriage to an Englishman, Dudley de Lavigne, ended in divorce. Her 1958 marriage to John Kennedy Magruder, a landscape architect and a director of the Alcoholics Anonymous Men's Home in Alexandria, Va., also ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen Pearson Arnold of San Diego; three grandsons, Joe and Drew Arnold of Laramie and George Arnold of Evanston, Wyo.; a granddaughter, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Lucille Lortel, whose pioneering efforts to bring innovative theater and adventurous new playwrights and actors to the American stage earned her the title Queen of Off Broadway, died on Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 and had homes in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         Among the legacies of Miss Lortel's cutting-edge career, which spanned more than 70 years, is the theater that bears her name in Greenwich Village; the still thriving White Barn Theater that she started in Westport in 1947; the Lucille Lortel Room at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, and the funds and fellowships she established to aid the arts. She also leaves a veritable Who's Who of people in international theater -- playwrights, actors, directors, composers and designers -- whose careers were advanced by her daring and her confidence in young talent.         ''If you love the theater you must be innovative,'' she once said. ''You must try new ideas and new faces. That's the only way theater can develop. You can't do it on Broadway because it costs too much. The costs are lower Off Broadway, so you can afford to take a chance, and you must take a chance.''         Forsaking the Footlights For a Backstage Role         Miss Lortel gave up a career as an actress in 1939 in deference to her wealthy husband's wishes and in 1947 began an experimental summer theater for American and foreign plays and playwrights in the barn of the couple's summer estate in Westport. From the start she wanted White Barn, as she called it, to be a sanctuary from commercial pressures, a place where writers could take a chance with their plays and where actors could stretch their talents. It was there that Miss Lortel staged readings, mothered performers like Eva Marie Saint, Geoffrey Holder and Zero Mostel and presented plays by Samuel Beckett, Edward Albee, Eugene Ionesco and Sean O'Casey.         In 1955 her husband, Louis Schweitzer, gave her a Manhattan theater, now known as the Lucille Lortel Theater, as a 24th wedding anniversary gift. The first production in the house, at 121 Christopher Street, then called the Theater de Lys, was Marc Blitzstein's adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ''Threepenny Opera. '' It caused such a sensation that the production ran for seven years and put Off Broadway on the map.         As Stuart W. Little observed in his 1972 book ''Off Broadway: The Prophetic Theater'': ''For thousands of theatergoers, a visit to the de Lys was the authentic Off Broadway experience. Off Broadway meant the discovery of new talent and fresh theatrical experiences in unfamiliar parts of the city. . . .The de Lys at the far end of Christopher Street, near the Hudson River docks, was situated in a borderline neighborhood between the known residential part of the city and the open seaport. The unknown world beyond, in imagination, merged with the pulsing underworld life of 'The Threepenny Opera' and became sinister, exotic, menacing.''         Miss Lortel was frustrated by the success of ''Threepenny Opera'' because she wanted to bring more plays into her theater, so she  persuaded the American National Theater and Academy to support a matinee series as a ''laboratory for innovation.'' The series ran for 20 years and became a legend. A verse adaptation of Alan Paton's novel ''Cry the Beloved Country'' became the first venture of the series in 1956, followed that  season by such groundbreaking productions as Anna Sokolow's Kafkaesque dance-drama ''Metamorphosis'' and May O'Donnell's modern-dance interpretation of Maeterlinck's play ''Pelleas and Melisandre.''         Over the years the series offered ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' a dramatization of Langston Hughes poems with Godfrey Cambridge; adaptations of poetic works by Robert Frost, Archibald MacLeish, W. H. Auden and Conrad Aiken; performances of rarely seen plays by O'Casey, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Albee and William Inge, and presented actors like Richard Burton in ''An Afternoon of Poetry,'' Siobhan McKenna as Hamlet, Helen Hayes in an anthology of Shakespeare and Dame Sybil Thorndike and Sir Lewis Casson in a joint dramatic reading. Terrence McNally and Adrienne Kennedy were among the new writers whose works were presented.         She brought Jean Genet to the attention of American audiences with a production of ''The Balcony,'' which she co-produced at Circle in the Square in 1960. She also oversaw the first American production of a play by Athol Fugard, the South African playwright; it was ''Blood Knot,'' starring James Earl Jones and J. D. Cannon, and it ignited audiences at the Cricket Theater on Second Avenue in 1964. She introduced many plays by Beckett, including ''Rockaby,'' on Theater Row on West 42d Street.         Creating a Setting For Cutting-Edge Work         At the Theater de Lys, she provided a home for such plays as David Mamet's ''A Life in the Theater,'' Sam Shepard's ''Buried Child'' and ''Getting Out,'' early work by Marsha Norman, Caryl Churchill's ''Cloud Nine'' and Wendy Wasserstein's ''Isn't It Romantic.'' The house was renamed the Lucille Lortel Theater in 1981, and has been the setting for Larry Kramer's ''The Destiny of Me,'' for ''Groucho'' and for ''Gertrude Stein and a Companion,'' the recipient of the National Education Film and Video Award for historical biographies.         The 38th volume of John Willis's ''Theater World'' (1981-82) is dedicated ''To Lucille Lortel, whose vibrant spirit and untiring efforts have made immeasurable contributions to all components of the theater by discovering and encouraging new talent, and whose devotion to Off Broadway provided the impetus for its proliferation.''         In 1960 Miss Lortel began sponsoring dramatic productions and seminars at the Library of Congress. The presentations included O'Casey's ''Time to Go,'' Mark Van Doren's ''Last Days of Lincoln'' and Albee's ''Fam and Yam.''         Miss Lortel produced or co-produced some 500 plays, 5 of which were nominated for Tony Awards -- ''As Is'' by William M. Hoffman, ''Angels Fall'' by Lanford Wilson, ''Blood Knot'' by Mr. Fugard, ''Sarafina!,'' an import from South Africa, and ''A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing. Several were produced in Broadway theaters and the others moved to Broadway.         The theater on Christopher Street was only one of many unusual gifts that Mr. Schweitzer lavished on Miss Lortel before his death in 1971. A chemical engineer who made his fortune manufacturing cigarette papers, he also owned the FM radio station WBAI.         In 1957, when his wife told him it was sometimes difficult to find a cab after the theater, he bought a gray Mercedes-Benz. He had been told there was a cab driver named Louis Schweitzer in town and he arranged to get a taxi medallion for the car and for his namesake to act as its part-time driver. When the driver wasn't transporting  Miss Lortel, he was free to use the car as a taxi and split the earnings with the boss.         In 1956, Mr. Schweitzer was the first foreigner in more than 400 years allowed to buy a gondola in Venice. Although traditionally gondolas were identified only by numbers, he was given permission to name his purchase ''Lucille.'' The gondola continued to carry passengers and the gondolier was told that if American visitors used Mr. Schweitzer's name to book a ride, they were to be charged double. ''My friends can afford it,'' he explained.         For some years, the Schweitzers spent part of each winter on a houseboat in Florida. The two-story villa on a raft, anchored off Miami Beach, had two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, servants' quarters and a bar sheltered by a thatched roof.         Lucille Lortel was born in Manhattan on Dec. 16, 1900, the daughter of Harry and Anna Wadler. Lucille was her given name, Lortel an alliterative concoction for the stage. Her father was a manufacturer of women's clothes and frequently traveled to Europe to buy designs that he would copy. For some years, Miss Lortel was tutored at home and although she said, ''I think I went to public school after that,'' she did remember that she never graduated. She attended Adelphi College briefly and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. A 1921 review in ''The Musical Leader'' of her  graduating class's production of D'Annunzio's ''Honeysuckle'' described her as ''an exquisite little creature who seemed to be inspired.'' Later, she studied briefly with Max Reinhardt in Berlin.         Miss Lortel made her Broadway debut in 1925 in the Theater Guild production of George Bernard Shaw's ''Caesar and Cleopatra'' with Helen Hayes as Cleopatra and Lionel Atwill as Caesar. She had a small role, which she said had been added by the director, playing what she described as a whore. She never forgot her unwhorelike lines: ''No no, no, I'll have nothing to do with you,'' addressed to the line of men following her.         She met Mr. Schweitzer in 1930. ''I wasn't interested in getting married,'' she recalled. ''I was involved in the theater.'' Mr. Schweitzer pursued her. During a business trip to France he telephoned and told her he was sending a ticket and that they would get married in Paris. Friends persuaded her to accept -- ''You can always get a divorce,'' they said.         When she arrived in March 1931, the couple discovered that official proclamations of their intended marriage had to be posted for several weeks before the marriage could take place. They sailed back to the United States on the Leviathan and were married by the captain. ''I wouldn't have anything to do with my husband until we came back to New York,'' she said, and even then she waited for two more ceremonies,  one at City Hall and a religious service in Manhattan performed by the Jewish chaplain at West Point.         The year after her marriage, Miss Lortel appeared on stage with Jean Arthur and Claude Rains in ''The Man Who Reclaimed His Head,'' but her husband objected to her absence in the evenings. His unhappiness led to a new activity that continued until 1939 -- acting in movie shorts filmed in Brooklyn in the afternoons. This was followed by a temporary retirement.         ''My husband's mother disapproved of acting, and he was very possessive,'' Miss Lortel said in a 1996 interview. ''After a while, I was getting bored. I thought I'd go nuts so I started readings at Westport, moving the tractors and Ping-Pong table from the barn.''         From a White Barn To Off Broadway         In 1947 Miss Lortel was approached by the actor Canada Lee and Philip Huston, a playwright, who needed a place and a distinguished audience for a staged reading of a new play called ''The Painted Wagon.'' Miss Lortel provided both. This was followed by a request from the agent Audrey Wood, who wanted a showcase for a musical, ''No Casting Today.'' Thus the White Barn was opened with Miss Lortel as its sole backer and hostess, providing room and board for the actors.         She had a permanent stage built, brought in new and innovative troupes like the Dublin Players Company, the Oxford University Players and Mr. Holder and his Trinidad Dance Troupe, established an apprentice school, introduced seminars in Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov, and offered playwrights, actors, designers, composers and directors a chance to spread their wings.         ''When the White Barn began, it was to summer theater what Off Broadway is to the commercial theater,'' the actress and producer Eva Le Gallienneonce said. ''An avowed pioneer, it proved that summer productions could be stimulating, avant-garde and enthusiastically received.''         Nurturing Newcomers And Seasoned Actors         Among the newcomers who got a chance at the White Barn were Peter Falk, Vincent Gardenia, Sada Thompson, George Peppard and Sidney Lumet. Working with them were more established actors seeking challenges  -- Mildred Dunnock, Mr. Mostel, Kim Hunter, James Coco and Peggy Wood.         Mr. Schweitzer initially enjoyed his wife's new enthusiasm and the idea of having actors around the estate in the summer. Later, his enthusiasm waned and although he continued to support her endeavors, it wasn't until his later years that his interest revived.         Miss Lortel was showered with virtually every theatrical award and honor except a Tony, which is given for achievement on Broadway. She received the first Margo Jones Award (1962) and the Lee Strasberg Lifetime Achievement Award (1985), as well as induction into the Theater Hall of Fame (1990) and recognition from the School of the Arts at Columbia University (1996). The first theater chair to be named for a woman bears her name, the Lucille Lortel Distinguished Professorial Chair in Theater at the City University of New York. A permanent tribute to her career is on display at the archives of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The Lucille Lortel Theater Collection, an archive of theatrical history and memorabilia, is on permanent exhibition at the Westport Public Library.         In 1986, the Lucille Lortel Awards were established by the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers to honor outstanding achievements in the Off Broadway theater. Recipients have included the playwright A. R. Gurney, for ''The Cocktail Hour''; John Tillinger, the director; Playwrights Horizons, and Lincoln Center Theater for ''Woza Afrika!''         Miss Lortel, who leaves no immediate survivors, was a generous donor in other theatrical areas. She established the Lucille Lortel Fund for New Drama at Yale University to support the production of new plays at the Yale Repertory Theater (the fund's premiere production was August Wilson's ''Fences''). The Lucille Lortel Fellowship in Playwriting was started at Brown University in Providence, R.I., in 1996. She also donated money for the annual Drama Circle awards and made sizable financial contributions to dance and music groups.         ''Honey, I've got a one-track mind and it's theater, theater, theater,'' she once said. ''I have no time for anything else.''         One of Miss Lortel's favorite possessions in her memento-filled midtown apartment at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, where she lived after her husband's death, was a box covered with notices of plays she had produced. The lid opened to the sound of applause and a voice calling out ''More! More!''         Circulating in a milieu where youth often takes the starring role, she frequently sidestepped the matter of age by saying ''age is a number and mine is unlisted.'' When a gossip column last year reported that Miss Lortel would soon celebrate her 98th birthday, Blanche Marvin, a friend, reported that she was furious.         ''This will kill my love life,'' she said.       
         Mary Lutyens, a well-born English  biographer and novelist who was applauded by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, died on April 9 in London. She was 90 and lived in London and the English county of Dorset.         Miss Lutyens (pronounced LUTCH-ens) was a daughter of Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens (1869-1944), the British architect who planned New Delhi and many of its Government buildings, including the Viceroy's palace. Her mother was Lady Emily Lutyens, daughter of the First Earl of Lytton, a poet and a Viceroy of India.         Not surprisingly, Mary Lutyens was worldly as well as literary. In London, The Independent noted,  ''She was famous for her dry martinis and her elegance and, although unmusical, danced alone to Cole Porter for exercise.'' As a writer, she won praise for the accuracy and readability of her biographies, which included ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (1968). Sir John Everett Millais (1829-96) was a handsome British painter and a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite movement in Britain. John Ruskin (1819-1900) was a British social theorist and critic whose wife, Effie, fell in love with Millais.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Carolyn G. Heilbrun noted: ''Mary Lutyens has now restored to England the Davis Cup for the editing of Victorian letters -- a trophy long in American hands. In 'Millais and the Ruskins,' combining exemplary scholarship with editing that is at once tactful and informative, she uses many previously unpublished letters by eminent Victorians to tell a passionate and moving story. Her book will be equally valuable to the Victorian scholar and to what used to be called the general reader.''         Miss Lutyens was the editor of a related book-length collection of letters, ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice,'' which was described in The Times Book Review by another critic, Joan Evans, as ''admirably and discreetly edited.''         Miss Lutyens also wrote several authoritative books about the Indian spiritual philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurt (1895-1986). They include ''Krishnamurti: The Open Door'' (1991).         Her more than a dozen works of fiction include ''Cleo'' (1974), which Martin Levin in The Times Book Review called a ''flawless tour de force.''         She also wrote fiction under the pseudonym Esther Wyndham.         Miss Lutyens was born in London and educated privately before attending Queens College, London. She  became a writer in her early 20's.         She married Anthony Sewell in 1930 and the couple were divorced in 1945. Later that year she married J. G. Links, an art expert known as Joe, who died in 1997.         She is survived by a daughter from her first marriage, Amanda.       
         Edith Lewin, who with her husband, Bernard, amassed the largest privately owned collection of Mexican modernist art and then gave it away, died on Sunday at her home in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 88.         The Lewins, who settled in California after fleeing Berlin in 1933, started out as furniture dealers in Los Angeles, selling art along with household items. They eventually opened art galleries in Beverly Hills and Palm Springs. They began acquiring Mexican art in 1958, when they bought three paintings by Diego Rivera.         Over the next 40 years, during travels in Mexico and through friendships with artists such as Rufino Tamayo and David Siqueiros, they put together a collection of 1,800 paintings and works on paper by, among others, Frida Kahlo, Jose Clemente Orozco, Carlos Merida and Rivera, including the only portrait Rivera ever painted of Kahlo, who was his wife.         The portrait, dated 1939, will appear in the exhibition ''Diego Rivera: Art and Revolution,'' which opens at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Sunday.         In 1997, the Lewins donated their entire collection, valued at more than $25 million, to the museum.         Ms. Lewin is survived by her husband, and a son, Ralph, also of Palm Springs.       
         Ruth Whitney, the editor who steered Glamour magazine for 31 years and influenced several generations of women during three important decades in American feminism, died yesterday at her home in Irvington, N.Y. She was 71.         The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, said her daughter-in-law, Christina Ferrari.         Mrs. Whitney was the editor in chief of Glamour, a magazine owned by Conde Nast Publications that now has a circulation of 2.1 million readers, from 1967 until last September. Part of her mission, she said, was to make feminism accessible, not intimidating, to American women.         Her reputation for frankness reached into the pages of Glamour, where -- along with the standard fare of women's magazines, like frothy fashion spreads and light service articles -- she published articles about sexuality, politics and women's health issues that other women's magazines had generally avoided. And her editorial decisions -- like putting a black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, a first in the women's magazine industry -- sometimes caused a stir in magazine circles.         In an interview a week before she retired last September, Mrs. Whitney explained her goal as editor in chief of Glamour: ''I always felt that I had a mission. I wanted to broaden the scope of a magazine to go with women's lives. I never wanted to appeal to everyone. That's not what we were about, and that's not the secret of our success. But I really wanted to make women feel good about themselves, not just about what they wore.''         Mrs. Whitney's origins were more humble than glamorous. She was born Ruth Reinke is Oshkosh, Wis., on July 23, 1928. Her mother, Helen, was a housewife, and her father, Leonard, was a designer of gravestones and mausoleums, but the only effect her father's choice of career had on her, she said last year, was that she learned to drive in a cemetery.         She was awarded a scholarship to Northwestern University, where she met Daniel Whitney, a journalism student; they married shortly after her 21st birthday. Unlike her husband, who attended journalism school but eventually ran his own advertising agency, Mrs. Whitney decided against professional journalism training and went straight to work for Time Inc. as a promotional copywriter. She didn't last long in the job.         ''It was an election year and I was madly for Adlai,'' she said. ''And the company was not madly for Adlai. So I got more and more sullen and eventually they fired me.'' To her dismay, the young Mrs. Whitney found that she could not get a job writing for Newsweek or Fortune.         ''What I always say next,'' she said, ''was that if you had a uterus, you couldn't write for those magazines.'' She found a job in women's magazines and, at 28, became editor in chief of a now-defunct magazine called Better Living, then of Seventeen. She arrived at Glamour in 1967.         During her tenure the magazine won four National Magazine Awards, including two for general excellence, in 1981 and 1991, and one in the public interest category in 1992, for a series conceived by Mrs. Whitney on the availability and safety of abortions in America. Until her death, she served on the board of the NOW Legal Defense Fund.         While she was editor, she kept a low profile. She never ran an editor's note at the front of the magazine and refused parties for her 20th, 25th and 30th anniversaries as editor in chief. When S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance Publications, the parent company of Conde Nast, asked her what she would like for her 25th anniversary, she asked that he establish two scholarships in her name at the Newhouse School of Journalism at Syracuse University.         Despite her low-key manner, she was fond of controversy. When she wanted to feature the black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, the issue was debated at every level of the company, all the way up to the president. ''I never shied away from controversy,'' Mrs. Whitney said last year. ''It's always good for you.''         And she was a champion of women who confronted authority. In October  1991, just as Anita Hill began testifying on Capitol Hill against the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, Mrs. Whitney closed the December issue of the magazine -- with its special feature on notable women of the year -- and went home to watch the hearings. On Sunday she called her production manager and said that she wanted to reconfigure the issue to include Ms. Hill as one of the notable women, which she did, beating most monthly magazines to an interview with Ms. Hill.         Gloria Steinem, a former contributing editor to Glamour, said that decisions like those defined the magazine under Mrs. Whitney. ''She was always trying to get as much real information into the pages of a fashion and beauty magazine as she possibly could,'' Ms. Steinem said.         The combination of fashion and service with strong editorial articles worked especially well on the newsstand. Glamour is second in circulation in its field only to Cosmopolitan. Conde Nast is a privately held company and does not disclose the earnings of its magazines, but in 1997 Steven T. Florio, the chief executive officer, said that Glamour's annual profits were in the ''tens of millions of dollars.''         Richard B. Stolley, the first managing editor of People and now the senior editorial adviser at Time Inc., said that Mrs. Whitney's rare longevity in the magazine industry could be attributed to her forward thinking.         ''She truly tried to turn her readers into not only capable women,'' he said, ''but functioning citizens of America, with all the knowledge and concerns that she felt young women ought to have. And of course she was right.''         The magazine business was long a family enterprise. Mrs. Whitney's husband served as her sounding board on all editorial matters until his death in 1995. Her son, Philip, who survives her, was until last year an executive at Money magazine; his wife, Christina Ferrari, is the managing editor of Teen People magazine. She is also survived by a brother, Leonard Reinke, of Oshkosh.       
         Sola Sierra, who campaigned to bring to justice those responsible for the death of her husband and hundreds of other Chilean dissidents during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, died on July 1 at a hospital in Santiago, Chile, where she lived. She was 63.         She died of a heart attack during surgery for a back injury suffered in a fall several months ago, according to Jim Foster, a spokesman with the United States Embassy in Santiago.         Mrs. Sierra spent 23 years doing human rights work in Chile after her husband disappeared in 1976. Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Washington, said,  ''Anyone who was involved in human rights work at that time in Chile, especially taking the lead, was courageous.''         In 1984 she became president of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared, an organization that seeks an accounting of those who vanished under General Pinochet and prosecution of those involved in their deaths.         In the past year, she led protests in London in support of General Pinochet's house arrest there on a Spanish extradition warrant. An extradition hearing is scheduled for Sept. 27. The general, now 83, is charged with ordering torture and other crimes during his years in power, from 1973 to 1990.         ''The most important thing, the most crucial thing, was her perseverance, her unwavering dedication to this cause,'' said Apolonia Ramirez Caballero, who from 1976 to 1981 was one of the coordinators of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         Mrs. Sierra was born on Dec. 1, 1935, in Santiago and grew up in poverty, leaving school in her teens to help support her family. She worked for several years as a community worker for the Ministry of Social Development and Planning. She married Waldo Pizarro in 1962 and settled into a life as a working-class wife and, later, mother of three children.         In 1973, in a right-wing coup backed by the American Government, General Pinochet overthrew the Government of Salvador Allende Gossens, a democratically elected Marxist. And on Dec. 15, 1976, Mr. Pizarro, a Communist and labor activist, disappeared. It is presumed that he was taken prisoner and killed by agents from the DINA, a secret police run by the Chilean armed forces.         More than 1,100 Chileans who disappeared under General Pinochet are still unaccounted for.         Two days after Mr. Pizarro vanished, Mrs. Sierra and her children moved in with a sister, Adrina Sierra, whose support allowed her the time to search for her husband and work with the Association for the Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         In addition to her sister, Mrs. Sierra is survived by her son, Waldo Pizarro Jr. of Santiago; two daughters, Lenia Pizarro and Lorena Pizarro, both of Santiago, and eight other brothers and sisters.         Mrs. Sierra was often seen at human rights demonstrations in Chile, a black-and-white photograph of Mr. Pizarro hanging around her neck.         Over the years, the group she led discovered about 180 bodies of Pinochet prisoners, but no one has been convicted in connection with the deaths and disappearances. Since 1978, an amnesty has given members of the DINA and military leaders immunity from prosecution .         Mrs. Sierra was uncompromising in seeking not only the fate and bodies of the disappeared but also the revocation of the amnesty.         Mrs. Sierra was both a sympathetic and controversial figure in Chile, where many would prefer to forget about the dark side of General Pinochet's rule. Prominent foreign visitors, however, eagerly met with her. The rock star Sting wrote a song about her organization called ''They Dance Alone.''         The current democratic Government in Chile issued a statement mourning Ms. Sierra's death.         Secretary General Carlos Mladinic, who represented the Government at her funeral, said he understood the pain she must have felt. ''Unfortunately, people continue dying in Chile without knowing the truth,'' Mr. Mladinic said. 'I hope that in the near future this pain will end.''       
         Brenda Hughes Moore, a human-rights advocate and arts consultant and the wife of the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr., retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, died Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 56 and lived in Greenwich Village and Stonington, Conn.         The cause was hepatitis, her husband said.         A native of Richmond, Mrs. Moore graduated from Salem College in North Carolina and studied at the University of Aix-Marseille and the University of Perugia.         She accompanied her first husband, John Franklin Campbell, a Foreign Service officer, to Ethiopia, where she became a special assistant to Emperor Haile Selassie and arranged a national exposition of Ethiopian crafts. She was also interested in the cause of Eritrea, then seeking independence from Ethiopia. Back in the United States, she assisted her husband, the first editor of Foreign Policy and author of ''The Foreign Affairs Fudge Factory.''         Mr. Campbell died in 1971 at age 31, and the next year she married Vernon Eagle, then the executive director of the New World Foundation, which supported civil rights and community projects.         The year after Mr. Eagle's death in 1974, she married Bishop Moore, who had officiated at her second wedding and had himself recently been widowed. She later received a degree from Yeshiva University as an arts appraiser.         In 1989 she and Bishop Moore visited the island of East Timor, and for the rest of her life she championed the cause of autonomy for East Timor.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Moore's immediate survivors are two sisters, Stephanie Hughes of Phoenix, and Lisa Hughes of Honolulu.       
         Joan Wight, the widow of the Yorkshire veterinarian who wrote under the name James Herriot and the model for a character in his books and television programs based on them, died on Wednesday. She was in her 80's.         Ms. Wight's health slowly declined after her husband died in 1995 at age 78, said Thomas McCormack, the former editor in chief of St. Martin's Press, which published the first five Herriot books.         Her husband, whose real name was James Alfred Wight, vividly depicted his wife as the endearing and supportive Helen Herriot in his memoirs, beginning with ''All Creatures Great and Small.'' Mr. McCormack described Ms. Wight as the model for ''the humorous, loving and, from time to time, tolerating wife of James Herriot.''         ''All Creatures Great and Small'' became the basis for a long-running television series, which was originally a BBC-TV production and later a cable television series in the United States. Its accounts of rural life attracted an audience of millions around the world.         On television, Helen was played first by Carol Drinkwater and later by Lynda Bellingham. In a 1979 movie, ''All Things Bright and Beautiful,'' Helen was portrayed by Lisa Harrow.         Although ''All Creatures Great and Small'' became a best seller, it was not reviewed until months after its publication, when strongly positive word-of-mouth reports had begun to make it famous.         One episode in the first Herriot book describes how Ms. Wight met her future husband. She grew up on a farm in Yorkshire not far from ''the surgery,'' as Mr. Wight's veterinary hospital was known.         One day, she brought in a calf with a broken leg. Mr. Wight repaired the damage with a splint. Later, she brought in a dog with a dislocated hip, and this time, he had eyes only for her. They soon became engaged.         ''A characteristic scene comes in the final chapter of 'All Creatures Great and Small,' '' Mr. McCormack said. ''The scene tells of Joan's and James's honeymoon, which is interrupted by a sudden, mad crush of work, which kills their hope of taking a trip. As Joan sits with notebook on her knee and pencil at the ready, she smiles. It was a magnificent, loving ending.''         Ms. Wight is survived by a son, James, and a daughter, Rosemary Page, both of Yorkshire in northern England.       
         Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, whose marriage to John F. Kennedy Jr. catapulted her and her understated glamour to fame, was reported lost and presumed dead on a flight Friday to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., along with her husband and her sister Lauren Bessette.         She was 33.         Until shortly before her marriage, Ms. Bessette was an executive at Calvin Klein Ltd. in New York. Her rise there -- from saleswoman in Boston to director of publicity for Mr. Klein's flagship line -- had been fast, but her achievements were quickly overshadowed by her relationship with Mr. Kennedy, whom she married in 1996.         After her marriage, she quickly became a fashion icon herself, on the cover of numerous magazines.         She soon settled into the role of Kennedy wife, with all the public appearances and public attention that entailed. But she kept a deliberately quiet profile.         ''She's a very private woman,'' Mr. Kennedy told USA Today in 1998. ''It's like you go from having a life you've built on your own terms and all of a sudden it's being snatched away from you.''         Ms. Bessette Kennedy grew up in affluent Greenwich, Conn. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Her mother, Ann, a teacher and administrator, remarried, to Richard Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon; the couple now live in Old Greenwich, Conn. Her father, William Bessette, an architectural engineer, lives in White Plains.         Ms. Bessette Kennedy had two sisters, Lauren and Lisa Ann, identical twins who were born 18 months before her.         Lauren Bessette, who graduated from Hobart College in Geneva, N.Y., was a principal in the investment banking division at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. She joined the company in 1993 and spent several years in Hong Kong.         Carolyn Bessette graduated from St. Mary's High School in Greenwich in 1983 and went on to Boston University, where she majored in elementary education. She graduated in January 1988 and was briefly a nightclub promoter. She then began working at Mr. Klein's Boston store.         A Calvin Klein executive brought her to the fashion house's headquarters in New York. She was hired to outfit the ''personals,'' friends of the house, among them celebrities and socialites.         Paul Wilmot, the former director of publicity for Calvin Klein who hired her, said he had been immediately stuck by her intelligence and poise. He said she easily juggled the demands of the job, which required a keen fashion sense and attention to countless administrative details.         She was promoted to director of publicity of the collection, a job that entailed working with fashion editors as well as coordinating the shows for the line.         She began dating Mr. Kennedy in 1994. Their relationship was relentlessly chronicled in the tabloid press, but their wedding, in front of 40 people in a rundown church on a secluded island off Georgia, was carefully scripted to elude publicity.         Usually dressed in black, she often wore her hair slicked back in a bun, and she favored simple clothing designers like Prada and Yohji Yamamoto.         Comparisons to her mother-in-law, the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, were frequent -- the two shared a Roman Catholic heritage, a thin, athletic physique, a cultivated mystique and a fierce possessiveness of their privacy.         Since her marriage, Ms. Bessette Kennedy had largely shunned the fashion world. Along with her husband, she lent her presence, and sometimes her name, to numerous benefits and cultural events.         ''I don't think she particularly missed being in the fashion industry,'' said John Perry Barlow, a friend of the couple. ''She still had plenty to do to adjust to being Mrs. John F. Kennedy Jr.''         Correction:  July 20, 1999, Tuesday  The obituary of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy yesterday misidentified the college from which her sister Lauren graduated. It was William Smith College, not its affiliate, Hobart; both are in Geneva, N.Y.       
         Amaryllis Fleming, a British cellist who was particularly devoted to chamber music and the Baroque literature, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Nettlebed, near Oxford, England, where she lived. She was 73.         Ms. Fleming lived a colorful life, partly because she was born into a family with both pronounced creative abilities and strong social connections, but also because of her own musical abilities, which drew her into the orbits of the pianist Artur Schnabel, the violinist Joseph Szigeti, the cellists Pierre Fournier and Pablo Casals, the conductor Sir John Barbirolli and the guitarists Julian Bream and John Williams.         She made her public debut playing the Elgar Cello Concerto when she was 19, and went on to win several important prizes and competitions. She also appeared -- or at least, her arms and hands did -- in ''Connecting Rooms'' (1969), as the screen fingers of Bette Davis, who played a cellist in the film.         Ms. Fleming was born in 1925, the  daughter of the painter Augustus John and of Eve Fleming, the wife of a Maj. Valentine Fleming, Member of Parliament. Ms. Fleming had four half-brothers, the most famous of whom was Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond spy novels. Until she was 24, Ms. Fleming believed that she was Eve Fleming's adopted daughter. Her discovery of the truth caused a rift with her mother but brought her closer to John, whose home in Wiltshire became a retreat for her.         Having taken up the cello at the age of 9, Ms. Fleming determined early that she would become a professional musician. In 1943 she enrolled at the Royal College of Music, where she studied with Ivor James. By the end of the following year she had performed on the BBC and made her concert debut. When she auditioned for Fournier at that time, he was so impressed that he offered to teach her at no charge. They soon began a romance that mellowed into a long-standing friendship. Ms. Fleming's mother, determined to separate her from Fournier, arranged for her to study first in Portugal and later with Casals in Prades, Spain.         Ms. Fleming never married, and left no immediate family.         In the early 1950's, Ms. Fleming won the Queen's Prize, in England, as well as the Munich International Competition. She gave the German premiere of the Elgar Concerto in Hamburg, with Barbirolli conducting, and performed as a member of the Loveday Trio, the Fidelio Ensemble and the Paganini Trio. Later she formed the Fleming Trio, which went through many personnel changes in the 1970's, but was one of her most highly regarded chamber music endeavors.         The most decisive influence on her career, though, was her meeting in the 1950's with E. M. W. Paul, a musicologist who introduced her to Baroque music played on period instruments. Under Paul's influence, she became one of the first cellists to become interested in incorporating musicological research into her performances of Baroque works. She began playing on both restored Stradivarius and Guarneri cellos, and on an Amati with a five-string layout that allowed her to play certain works -- including Bach's Sonatas for Viola da Gamba, and the Sixth Suite for Unaccompanied Cello -- without making the transpositions necessary on a four-string instrument.         Ms. Fleming continued to perform until 1993, when a stroke left her unable to play. But she continued to teach, an occupation to which she had devoted herself increasingly, starting in the 1970's, when she joined the faculty of the Royal College of Music. Her best-known student is the cellist Raphael Wallfisch.       
         Eva Shain, the first woman to serve as a judge at a heavyweight championship boxing match when she was assigned to the Muhammad Ali-Earnie Shavers bout at Madison Square Garden in 1977, died Thursday at Englewood (N.J.) Hospital and Medical Center. Mrs. Shain, who lived in Fort Lee, N.J., was 81.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Frank, a longtime ring announcer.         Mrs. Shain, who was among the first female judges in New York State, judged some 50 title bouts. She worked at fights in New York, New Jersey, Nevada, Canada and Europe for over a quarter of a century.         ''It wasn't the idea of being a trailblazer,'' Mrs. Shain said of her pioneering role. ''It was something I wanted to do. It was a challenge.''         Mrs. Shain, a native of Jersey City who worked as an interior decorator and bookkeeper after attending New York University, agreed reluctantly to accompany her husband to a Golden Gloves bout at Madison Square Garden one night in the late 1960's.         ''I didn't want to watch two men beating each other up in the ring,'' she recalled. ''Besides, there were never any women at the fights.''         But she remembered how she ''totally fell in love with boxing.''         ''It was such a precise science,'' she said. ''After that, I went to every fight with him.''         Mrs. Shain went on to judge amateur bouts for eight years. In July 1974, the New York State Athletic Commission named Carol Polis, the wife of a former boxer and referee, Bob Polis, as the first woman to be a professional boxing judge in the state. Mrs. Shain and Carol Castellano, whose husband, Tony, was a judge, were the next female judges, gaining their licenses in March 1975.         Mrs. Shain received word that she would judge the Ali-Shavers bout, on Sept. 29, 1977, only hours before the fight. ''I really did not expect it,'' she recalled. ''That morning I had gone to the doctor, and he told me to stay home because I had a cold.''         Ali won the bout on a unanimous decision, Mrs. Shain giving him 9 of the 15 rounds and feeling elated that she had reached the pinnacle of her calling, ''like when an opera singer sings at the Met.''         Mrs. Shain, who worked with her husband in promotions and sales at a toy company when she was not involved in boxing, remained active as a judge until last December.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Harvey Shultz, of Hackensack, N.J., and a daughter, Barbara Brocklehurst, of Franklin Lakes, N.J., both from a previous marriage; a brother, Jack Inwood, of Paramus, N.J.; a sister, Florence Schiffman, of Tamarac, Fla., and three grandchildren.         Frank Shain, the ring announcer at seven title fights for which Eva Shain was a judge, recalled that the first time they worked together, ''As I announced the judges, there was about a three-second pause -- it was so emotional I couldn't get her name out.''         Later, he said, his wife quipped, ''We're married, and he forgot my name.''         In October 1984, a tempest of sorts arose when John Branca, the chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, announced plans to name three female judges to the Marvelous Marvin Hagler-Mustafa Hamsho middleweight championship bout at the Garden, saying, ''This fight needs some publicity.''         One of Hagler's handlers, Pat Petronelli, complained that ''it's a man's game'' and ''there's going to be a lot of blood and I don't want the three judges throwing up.''         Mrs. Shain did work the bout -- a third-round knockout by Hagler -- but the other two female judges were assigned to a title fight on the undercard.         Hagler's corner man need not have worried about Mrs. Shain being squeamish amid boxing violence, as her husband noted in remembering a conversation Ali once had with her.         ''Ali said to her, 'Eva, if you're wearing a blouse or a skirt and blood got on it, would it bother you?'         ''She replied, 'Well, it's not my blood.'         ''Ali laughed. He said, 'I didn't expect that answer.' ''       
         Joan Braden, a former State Department official who was a hostess and friend to high-ranking Washington figures and whose eight children inspired the ABC television series ''Eight Is Enough,'' died on Monday in Alexandria, Va. She was 77 and a longtime resident of the Washington area.         The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported. Mrs. Braden collapsed at Sutton Place Gourmet, a food store in Alexandria,  and was pronounced dead at a local hospital.         For two years beginning in 1976, Mrs. Braden was the State Department's coordinator of consumer affairs and special assistant to the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. She had also been an aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller and had worked in political campaigns for  John and Robert Kennedy.         The 1975 book ''Eight Is Enough,'' by her husband, Tom Braden, tells of their family of eight children. In 1977 the book was adapted as the ABC series, starring Dick Van Patten, which was broadcast by the network until 1981.         In the book, Mr. Braden, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate from 1968 to 1986, described his wife's personality: ''She's blithe. That's what it is about her, and that is why she is so everlastingly cheerful.''         By 1976, when Mrs. Braden took up her State Department posts, her friends included Vice President  Rockefeller, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and many other powerful figures, who would assemble at the Bradens' large yellow clapboard house in Chevy Chase, Md., a Washington suburb.         According to those who dined there, the food was simple but good,  and the furniture pleasant and necessarily childproof. There were always flowers and candles and, if the weather was right, a fireplace ablaze.         But it was not those things that made Mrs. Braden's dinner parties special, and her invitations a status symbol.         Rather, it was said in Washington, the main magnet was Mrs. Braden herself, a slight woman (5 feet 5 inches tall, admittedly too thin at 103  pounds) with short auburn hair and a wide smile -- blithe, as her husband said, and everlastingly cheerful.         Mrs. Braden herself wrote a book, ''Just Enough Rope: An Intimate Memoir'' (1989). Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Maureen Dowd said, ''Joan Braden has taken a lot of heat for this book, which has been criticized as a vapid kiss-and-sell by a Washington society hostess with the capital's most notorious 'open' marriage.''         ''The title refers to the amount of freedom the author has received from her husband,'' Ms. Dowd wrote.  ''Washington insiders, however, sniff that it also alludes to the fact that she has hanged herself with this 'intimate memoir.' ''         But ''this reviewer does not take such a harsh view,'' Ms. Dowd continued, adding that after all, how can a book be all bad that features ''a shower scene with Nelson Rockefeller, a bedroom scene with Bobby Kennedy, a toe-tingling lunch with Kirk Douglas and an account of Frank Sinatra singing 'High Hopes' without his toupee?''         Mrs. Braden was born Joan Ridley in Indianapolis, and was reared in the nearby town of Anderson and in Washington. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Northwestern University, and  worked in the Pentagon during World War II.         From 1946 to 1951, she was an assistant to Mr. Rockefeller, who was then in the middle of a succession of Federal posts he filled before becoming Governor of New York in 1959. She went on to be a special assistant for public relations to  Oveta Culp Hobby, the Eisenhower Administration's Secretary of  Health, Education and Welfare.         Later she and her husband moved to California, where Mr. Braden -- with the assistance of a $100,000 loan from Mr. Rockefeller, whom he had known for years -- bought a small daily newspaper, The Oceanside Blade-Tribune. Mr. Braden published the paper for more than 13 years before selling it to South Coast Newspapers for $1.6 million.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Braden's survivors include five daughters, Mary Poole of Alexandria, Joan Ridder of Denver, Susan Zarker of Takoma Park, Md., and Nancy and Elizabeth Braden, both of Denver; two sons, David, who lives in Taiwan, and Nicholas, of Alexandria, and 12 grandchldren. One of the Bradens' sons, Tom, died in 1994.       
         Louise Alone Thompson Patterson, an advocate of civil rights and leftist causes, a participant in the Harlem Renaissance and a longtime associate of one of its leading figures, the poet Langston Hughes, died on Friday at the Amsterdam Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 97.         The 1920's and 30's saw an artistic and literary flowering in Harlem and an outpouring of social criticism examining the position of blacks in American society. Soon after her arrival in 1928, Mrs. Patterson, then Louise Thompson, gravitated toward that intellectual ferment, which became known as the Harlem Renaissance.         Born in Chicago on Sept. 9, 1901, she had experienced racism while living in a succession of predominantly white towns in the Pacific Northwest, before entering the University of California at Berkeley, where she was inspired by a lecture on racism given by W. E. B. DuBois.         After graduating from Berkeley in 1923 with a degree in economics, she taught at Hampton Institute in Virginia, which had a black student body but a predominantly white and paternalistic administration. She supported a student strike there, then went to New York to study at the New School for Social Research under a scholarship from the Urban League.         Louise Thompson entered Harlem Renaissance circles through a friendship with the painter Aaron Douglas and his wife, Alta, and she married the writer Wallace Thurman. They separated six months later. In the late 1920's, she became a secretary to Hughes, and a long professional association and friendship began.         In 1932, after helping found a Harlem branch of the Friends of the Soviet Union, she became a leading organizer of a trip to the Soviet Union by 22 black intellectuals, journalists and writers who were to make a Soviet-sponsored movie called ''Black and White,'' about white supremacy in America.         She enlisted Hughes's participation in the trip, but the film project was canceled by Soviet authorities after the group's arrival, ostensibly because of inefficiency on the part of the Soviet film company. The real reason may have been Soviet fears that the film would create enmity in the United States and jeopardize diplomatic recognition.         Louise Thompson enjoyed her experience of Soviet society and told how ''the Russians would push us to the front of the queue line for a bus or ticket, or offer us seats in a crowded streetcar.''         ''For all of us who experienced discrimination based on color in our own land, it was strange to find our color a badge of honor, our key to the city, so to speak,'' she said.         The group eventually split into two factions. Those who saw Louise Thompson as too trusting of the Russians nicknamed her Madame Moscow.         After returning to the United States, she organized a march to Washington to speak out on the ''Scottsboro Boys'' -- nine black youths wrongly convicted of raping two white women in Scottsboro, Ala. She later traveled to Spain on behalf of the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War.         She was an organizer of Vanguard, a left-wing salon organized at her Harlem apartment in the 1930's for cultural presentations and discussions of Marxist theory. In 1938, she helped Hughes start the Harlem Suitcase Theater, where he presented his play with music ''Don't You Want to Be Free?'' Hughes dedicated his 1942 collection of poems, ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' to her.         In 1940, having moved to Chicago, Louise Thompson married William Patterson, a figure in the American Communist Party. He died in 1980. She is survived by a daughter, MaryLouise Patterson of Manhattan, two granddaughters and a great-grandson.       
         Chan Richardson Parker, known to many in the jazz world as the last wife of Charlie (Bird) Parker, the be-bop innovator, died on Sept. 9 in a hospital in Etampes, France, southwest of Paris. She was 74.         She died of cancer, said Albert Oehrle, the lawyer for her son, Baird Parker. She had lived in Champmotteux, south of Paris, since 1971.         She lived with Parker from 1950 until he died in 1955 at 34, his life cut short by alcohol and drug use. Robert Dobrish, the lawyer for Parker's estate, said Parker ''thought of her as his wife,'' but they were not legally spouses.         Chan Parker, a native New Yorker, was originally named Beverly Dolores Berg, but as she wrote in her 1993 memoirs, ''My Life in E-flat'' (University of South Carolina), ''I changed that name as soon as I could.'' For a time, she was a nightclub dancer. She became an avid fan of jazz and be-bop. She met Charlie Parker when he was 23 and she was 18.In 1950, she and Kim, her daughter, moved in with Parker.         In later years, Ms. Parker's activities included operating a restaurant in New Hope, Pa.         Two daughters, Pree Parker and Aimee Woods, died earlier.         Besides Baird Parker of Lansdale, Pa., she is survived by her daughter, Kim Parker, of Delaware Water Gap, Pa.; another son, Gar Woods of Long Pond, Pa., and two grandchildren.       
         Raisa Maksimovna Gorbachev, who broke Kremlin tradition by sharing the spotlight with her husband, the former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and did so with bold self-assurance and flair, died today in Munster, Germany. She was 67.         The cause was leukemia, aides to Mr. Gorbachev said. She had been under treatment in University Hospital in Munster since late July.         Mr. Gorbachev's rise to the leadership of the Communist Party in 1985 was the first sign of a seismic shift in the Soviet Union's calcified politics and economy. But it was Raisa Gorbachev who, both at home and abroad, soon came to embody the changes to come. She emerged as a First Lady who had her own mind, her own style and according to reports of a secret videotape that circulated after one of her foreign trips, her own American Express card.         None of this endeared her to the Soviet public, who began to grumble early in her husband's tenure that she was too pushy, too flashy and too influential. Her appearances on foreign trips and her cultural projects at home stirred debate in many Russian kitchens over whether the proper place for Kremlin wives was -- as it had always been -- at home, or at least in the background.         But since the beginning of this month, when Russians first learned that their former First Lady had been hospitalized in Germany with an advanced and rare case of leukemia, sentiments toward her in Russia began to shift. Favorable articles began to appear in the press, and thousands of letters and telegrams of sympathy arrived at the hospital in Munster, where her husband kept a faithful vigil that touched many Russian hearts. ''It must be in the Russian character -- to run somebody into the mud, and them laud them to high heavens after a tragedy strikes,'' said Vladimir Polyakov, a Gorbachev spokesman.         President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev's bitter rival in the early 1990's, sent a message of condolence today, and in a statement he said that a ''wonderful person, a beautiful woman, a loving wife and mother is no longer with us.''         In his autobiography, published in 1996, Mr. Gorbachev acknowledged that the resentment over his wife's high profile surfaced in letters written to the Communist Party's Central Committee. ''Who does she think she is, a member of the Politburo?'' he quoted one as saying. ''The simplest answer would have been: 'No, she is my wife.' ''         She first became known in the West in 1984 when she accompanied her husband, then a ranking member of the Soviet Politburo, to Britain, where they were received by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Diplomats and reporters, scanning the couple for clues about the next generation of Soviet leaders, quickly focused up on her wardrobe -- in particular her gold lame sandals with chain straps, a far cry from the dowdy shoes worn by other Kremlin wives. On a later trip to France, the French press labeled her clothes ''elegant, but not chic.''         On her foreign travels, she also became known for a haughty conversational style that bordered on the pedantic. During the 1986 summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, she needled her tour guides with persistent questioning, adding didactic commentary of her own. Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, she irked Nancy Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American President's wife to quip, ''Who does that dame think she is?''         As she became more comfortable in her role as the Soviet First Lady, she loosened up and her wardrobe became more subdued. On a visit to Washington in 1990, she established more friendly relations with Barbara Bush, from whom she got a recipe for blueberry pie.         Born in the Siberian city of Rubtsovsk, Raisa Titarenko grew up as the daughter of a railway engineer. She graduated from school with a gold medal -- top honors in the Soviet system -- and went on to the prestigious University of Moscow. She was studying philosophy there when she met Mr. Gorbachev, then a law student. According to his book, he was smitten, but she was aloof.         ''Our first meeting had not impressed Raisa at all,'' he wrote. ''She seemed calm and indifferent -- judging by the look in her eyes.'' Not much later, at an impromptu party staged by Mr. Gorbachev's roommates for Raisa and her friends, ''I wanted to impress her,'' he wrote, but ''I think I made a terrible fool of myself. She was reserved and was the first to suggest breaking up the gathering.''         After an intense courtship, the two penniless students were married in 1953, the year of Stalin's death. They had one daughter, Irina, born in 1956, who survives her along with Mr. Gorbachev and two granddaughters.         After the couple completed their college work in 1955, the family returned to Mr. Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol in southern Russia. There Mrs. Gorbachev completed a doctoral dissertation, entitled ''The Emergence of New Characteristics in the Daily Life of Collective Farm Peasantry,'' based on an unusual amount of field research, which was accepted by the Lenin Pedagogical Institute in Moscow.         When her husband, then first party secretary in Stavropol, was promoted to Moscow as a Central Committee secretary in charge of agriculture, she returned to academics, taking a job as lecturer in philosophy at Moscow University, a position which she gave up when he became General Secretary of the Communist Party.         As the wife of the Soviet leader, she was enlisted as a board member of the Soviet Cultural Foundation, headed by Dmitri S. Likhachev, one of Russia's most distinguished academicians, which was created to promote the arts and to restore the country's cultural heritage.         In this role, she became one of her husband's conduits to the Russian intelligentsia, which was then rallying to his call for more ''glasnost,'' or openness. As Soviet censorship eased, the Soviet people rushed to rediscover books and parts of their own history that had been buried under a rigid Communist ideology.         Mrs. Gorbachev's most traumatic moments came during the August 1991 coup, when the Gorbachevs were held hostage at a seaside villa in the Crimea while a group of Communist hard-liners tried to seize control in Moscow. The coup failed, and Mr. Gorbachev and his family returned to Moscow, visibly shaken. ''Raisa Maksimovna took it very hard,'' said Mr. Gorbachev at a news conference after their return to Moscow.         In 1991, Raisa Gorbachev published a book of reminiscences, entitled in English, ''I Hope,'' which she decided to write after a visit with Mrs. Bush in 1990 to Wellesley College where, she said, ''the girls showered me with questions.'' Reviewers found the book self-serving in parts but also informative about the couple's intellectual journey as, together, they came to realize the flaws in the Soviet system.         In her last years, Mrs. Gorbachev started a club that drew together a dozen well-known and high-powered Russian women for conferences, charitable projects and informal debates. She described the group as an attempt to promote a civil society in Russia. Against her wishes, the club became known as the Raisa Maksimovna Club.         Lyudmila Telen, a deputy editor at the newspaper Moscow News and a member of the club, said her impressions of Mrs. Gorbachev changed as she got to know her better. ''She set herself very high goals -- she felt she had to improve herself,'' said Ms. Telen. ''Going from wife of a provincial first secretary to First Lady was a big jump.         ''She wanted to represent the country in a new way. She understood that what Mikhail Sergeyevich was doing was a revolution, but she had many complexes, too -- a natural reserve and a Soviet way of behavior that she tried to overcome.''         Ms. Telen said Mrs. Gorbachev was well aware of the resentment against her felt by many Russians. But she herself was never bitter. ''She realized that people had been used to different women, different traditions, different leaders,'' said Ms. Telen. ''She understood it. It hurt her of course, but I never heard her be mean or bitter about it.''         As a couple, the Gorbachevs shared interests in philosophy and literature, theater and politics. Mr. Gorbachev on several occasions acknowledged that he often turned to his wife for advice. In his book, he recalled how the two would have their most serious discussions in the garden of their Government-provided apartment, beyond the earshot of K.G.B. eavesdropping devices.         Their close relationship was the envy of their friends. At a dinner in Paris in the fall of 1985, her host said she confided: ''I am very lucky with Mikhail. We are really friends, or if you prefer, we have great complicity.''         After the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, when Mr. Yeltsin took over Mr. Gorbachev's office in the Kremlin, he became a political pariah in Russia, widely blamed for ushering in reforms that led to a decade of political and economic instability.         After a disastrous run for the presidency in 1996, he maintained a low profile at home, while Mrs. Gorbachev, who accompanied him on the international lecture circuit, became practically invisible until her recent illness.         With a diagnosis of acute lukemia, Mrs. Gorbachev was rushed to the hospital in Munster on July 25. News of her hospitalization became public only in early August.         According to Russian news reports, Mr. Gorbachev remained at her side day and night. ''Dear God,'' the former Soviet President, visibly exhausted, told a Russian television reporter on Aug. 9, ''for her to undergo such a drama these two days before my very eyes.''       
         Lenon Hoyte, better known as Aunt Len, who shared her dream of a doll museum with Harlem children and  collectors from around the world for two decades, died Aug. 1 at a hospital in New York. She was 94.         A public school art teacher, she  founded Aunt Len's Doll and Toy Museum, one of the most extensive private collections of dolls and related toys in the United States, and long one of New York City's choice specialty museums. She closed the museum in the early 1990's when she was no longer able to care for it.         To Ms. Hoyte, the dolls were her ''babies,'' to be loved and shown off, whether they were the rarest antiques or battered castoffs.         In 1938, Ms. Hoyte and her husband bought the three-story brownstone at 6 Hamilton Terrace between Convent and St. Nicholas Avenues.         At one time the house was home to 6,000 dolls.         There were a dozen versions of  Shirley Temple; there was Barbie, and Betsy Wetsy, presidents and their wives, and refined French dolls with bodies and faces made of  bisque, the unglazed ceramic ware used to make fine dolls in the 19th century and before.         And always, her collection included black dolls, which are now highly sought by collectors, because so few were made before the 20th century.         One rarity, described in the sale catalogue as ''a black Bru pressed-bisque-head bebe doll,'' was valued at $18,000.         There were a pair of papier-mache dolls, named Lillian and Leo, made by Leo Moss, a black handyman who lived in Atlanta in the 19th century. Both Lillian and Leo have tears running down their cheeks.         The story has it that after the dollmaker parted from his wife and children he became so sad that he made only crying dolls.         The collection also included accessories like doll houses, doll clothing and costumes, tin toys and stuffed animals.         Visitors had to squeeze their way sideways or hunch down as they progressed through the narrow passageways of the public spaces on the ground floor and in the basement of the building.         The museum had a modest entrance fee, never exceeding $2 for adults and 50 cents for children.         Visitors would encounter all manner of mannequins, ranging from thumb-size to two or three feet tall.  Not all of the collectibles were old. One of Ms. Hoyte's favorites -- a baby doll with wide eyes and long eyelashes -- was carved in mahogany in 1977 by a California artist, Patty Hale.         In 1990, soon after Mayor Edward I. Koch presented Ms. Hoyte with the Mayoral Award of Honor for Art and Culture, her genteel house and museum was broken into by thieves.         At least nine dolls, including a two-foot-tall English king, considered priceless by knowledgeable collectors, were stolen.         Ms. Hoyte was disconsolate.         ''People any more don't let you live,'' she said then. ''You struggle to keep something up for joy and beauty, and you find yourself having to watch for thieves. It's not right.''         But soon after, four of the stolen dolls -- representing George and Martha Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin -- turned up, disjointed but repairable, in Ms. Hoyte's front room. ''I don't ask questions about how,'' she said. ''I'm just happy to have them back.''         In 1994, 700 of the finest antique dolls were auctioned at Sotheby's. Thousands more had been sold previously to dealers around the country.         Lenon Holder Hoyte was born in New York City on July 4, 1905, the first of five children of Moses and Rose Holder. She attended public school in New York City and studied art at the College of the City of New York, Columbia University and with private teachers.         She taught art at Junior High School 149 in the Bronx and retired after 41 years. ''When they started killing teachers, I got out,'' she said.         Her passion for collecting dolls dated to 1962, when she was asked to organize a doll show to raise money for Harlem Hospital. After that, she began acquiring dolls from flea markets, garage sales and antiques shops that she visited throughout the United States, Europe and the Caribbean. Her collection was officially opened as a museum in 1974.         Ms. Hoyte continued to produce  doll shows, and donated the proceeds to St. Philip's Episcopal Church, where she had been a lifelong member.         She spent many of her retirement years traveling to doll shows and picking up dolls and doll accouterments for her collection.         Ms. Hoyte's husband, Lewis Hoyte, died about 30 years ago. She is survived by her brother, Dr. Oliver Holder, of Sag Harbor, N.Y., two nieces and three nephews.       
         Ruth Roman, a screen actress who parlayed her electrically charged combination of sexiness and wholesomeness into Hollywood stardom in the late 1940's and 50's, died on Thursday at her home in Laguna Beach, Calif. She was 75.         She died in her sleep, said her son, Richard Hall.         After her breakout role opposite Kirk Douglas in Stanley Kramer's ''Champion,'' a 1949 adaptation of a Ring Lardner short story about a maniacal prize fighter, Warner Brothers gave her starring roles in nine films in under two years.         In one day she leaped from working with Bette Davis in ''Beyond the Forest'' to supporting Milton Berle in ''Always Leave Them Laughing.'' A week after the completion of ''Strangers on a Train'' opposite Robert Walker, she was whisked into ''Tomorrow Is Another Day'' with Steve Cochran.         From 1948 to 1965, Ms. Roman appeared in more than 30 movies, and in the 1960's and 70's in numerous television shows.         Her romantic partners in films included Randolph Scott in ''Colt .45,'' James Stewart in ''The Far Country'' and Gary Cooper in ''Dallas.''         Few of her films are studied in film schools today. But in their time they made box office cash registers ring like sleigh bells and in 1951 Ms. Roman was receiving 500 letters a week from around the world.         There were plenty of cheesecake queens in Hollywood seeking roles when Ms. Roman arrived in 1945, but it was her come-hitcher warmth, combined with her shapely, dark-haired good looks, that made her a standout. When Collier's profiled her in 1951, the magazine declared that Ms. Roman's career had been built on a ''pervasive air of wholesomeness.''         It was an appeal that even Ms. Roman did not fully understand. When she auditioned for a part in ''Champion,'' she thought she would be right for the role of the fighter's gold-digging floozy and accordingly wore a tight-fitting black dress and heavy makeup when she swivel-hipped into Stanley Kramer's office.         But somehow the wholesomeness showed through. ''Actually, I thought of you for the other girl,'' said Mr. Kramer, then serving as the film's producer.         Marilyn Maxwell played the floozy, with Kirk Douglas as the fighter and Ms. Roman as his demure and steadfast wife.         It had been that same quality that landed Ms. Roman her first film role: a bit part as a WAVE in ''Stage Door Canteen'' in 1942.         Clem Beauchamp, company manager for ''Stage Door Canteen,'' told an interviewer in 1951 that he chose Ms. Roman from dozens of eager actresses because ''I felt right away that here was a girl who would show up on time in the morning with her lines learned and no nonsense.''         By Hollywood standards, Ms. Roman's romantic life was a bit dull. She dated Bill Walsh, a publicity agent, for five years. She once stepped out with Ronald Reagan. And in 1950 she married Mortimer Hall, a Los Angeles television executive. The marriage ended in divorce.  A second marriage, to Budd Burton Moss, also ended in divorce. She told interviewers that she disliked nightclubs and flashy clothes. Her one extravagance, she said, was her collection of 35 pairs of shoes, and that consisted mainly of Indian moccasins.         Not all of the excitement in her life was make-believe. In 1956 Ms. Roman was aboard the luxury passenger liner Andrea Doria when it was struck by the Stockholm. Ms. Roman was returning from Italy with her 3-year-old son, Dickie. She was dancing in the ship's Belvedere room, she told a reporter for The New York Times, when ''we heard a big explosion like a firecracker.''         She said she saw smoke coming from the general area of her cabin and rushed there to protect her son. He was sound asleep. She said she awakened Dickie and told him,  ''We're going on a picnic.''         When it was clear that the liner was sinking and passengers began entering lifeboats, a seaman lowered Dickie into a boat. Ms. Roman said she followed down a rope ladder, but when she was halfway down the lifeboat pulled away. She called out to the boat but it did not return. She was put on another lifeboat.         Ms. Roman told a reporter she was never in fear for her son's life, but felt sure he would be safe in the lifeboat, which turned out to be true. Ms. Roman and her son were among the 760 survivors of the Andrea Doria.         Her son, her only survivor, lives in California.         Born in Lynn, Mass., on Dec. 23, 1923, she was the youngest of three daughters of immigrants from Lithuania. Her father, Anthony Roman, a carnival barker, died when she was a child, forcing her mother to work as a waitress, cleaning woman and laundress.         Ms. Roman was proud of her family's endurance. ''For a while,'' she once told a reporter, ''we were moving regularly once a month because we couldn't pay our rent.''         But she never felt sorry for herself, she said, remarking, ''When you start out poor, you don't know what you're missing.''         Ms. Roman quit high school in her second year when she decided to become an actress. During the day she worked as a movie usher and at night she performed with the New England Repertory Company, a semi-professional group in Boston.         With $200 in her pocketbook, she  soon struck out for Hollywood. For a while, she lived in a boarding house with several other aspiring actresses. They called their home the House of the Seven Garbos.         For six years she endured a series of disappointments. She got a good part in a western called ''White Stallion,'' but it was never released. Then came a role in ''A Night in Casablanca,'' but after the filming her part was cut. But then everything changed after her audition with Stanley Kramer.       
         Frances Knight, who ran the United States Passport Office for 22 years with efficiency and conservative zeal, denying passports and entrance visas to those she regarded as enemies of the nation and surviving efforts to remove her and even mandatory retirement at 70, died on Sept. 11 in a hospital in Bethesda, Md. She was 94.         Frances Knight Parrish, who used her maiden name of Knight while working at the State Department rather than her married name, lived at the Carriage Hill Bethesda nursing home in Bethesda, Md., for the last three years.         The conviction that guided Ms. Knight as she supervised the Passport Office was that the Government had a legal right and moral responsibility to protect American citizens from ideas and philosophies she found abhorrent, especially Communism. To people who represented such forces, she denied passports and visas, and sometimes, when she was not permitted to do so by her superiors in the State Department, she went over their heads and complained to Congress.         Ms. Knight inherited her sense of mission, she said, from her predecessor, Ruth Shipley, a staunch conservative who ran the office with unchallenged authority and who hand-picked Ms. Knight as her successor in 1955. She served until 1977, when she was 72.         Ms. Knight's convictions and fearlessness attracted powerful friends and allies like J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. Director, and powerful members of Congress like Representative Francis E. Walter of Pennsylvania, who headed the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization.         She drew fire from liberals who accused her of practicing thought control and perpetuating many of the strict travel regulations imposed in the most bitter days of the cold war.         But Ms. Knight won praise from both conservatives and liberals for running a highly efficient agency at a time when Americans were traveling overseas in previously unimaginable numbers.         In a 1960 interview, she said, ''I was determined to prove that a Government agency could be made efficient; that business management and standards could be instituted and sustained; that Government employees could provide the public with interested, friendly and personalized public service.''         Ms. Knight was also outspoken on equal rights for women. She often complained about the lack of women in high-ranking management positions in the State Department.         She raised a furor in Congress in 1963 when it came to light that she had told a closed meeting of the Senate Internal Security subcommittee that she had been ordered by Secretary of State Dean Rusk to approve passport applications by ''dangerous undercover Communists engaged in espionage, sabotage and sedition.''         She testified that Mr. Rusk's order and departmental regulations ''in effect forbids us to protect ourselves,'' and she questioned ''whether there exists the will'' to defend the country from ''the inroads of Communism.''         In 1966, Abba P. Schwartz, the liberal-minded head of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, a Kennedy appointee, tried unsuccessfully to force her to resign because of their political differences.         Ms. Knight called a news conference in which she declared: ''Some creeps are out to get me.''         She also sought the help of J. Edgar Hoover and powerful members of Congress, and in the end it was Mr. Schwartz who was forced to resign.         After that, her critics in Congress referred to her as ''the ogress'' and the columnist Mary McGrory likened Ms. Knight to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.         But her friends in Congress twice permitted her to remain on the job at the Passport Office after she had reached mandatory retirement age.         Ms. Knight was born in Newport, R.I., and grew up in New York City. She attended Hunter College and New York University. She moved to Washington when her husband, Wayne Parrish, a magazine publisher, was offered the editorship of a Washington-based aviation magazine.         Mr. Parrish soon became a multimillionaire and the couple lived on Embassy Row in Washington.         He later started his own publication, with his wife dealing with the bookkeeping and circulation.         Mr. Parrish died in 1984. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Nathalie Sarraute, the Russian-born French novelist who remained an influential and innovative literary figure long after she first gained fame as the doyenne of the Nouveau Roman movement in the late 1950's, died today at her home in Paris. She was 99 and also had a country home in Cherence in Normandy.         In a writing career that lasted more than six decades, Mrs. Sarraute published 17 books, including 10 novels, although in her very first book, ''Tropisms,'' she already set the tone of her life's work. She took the book's title from the biological term for the involuntary reaction of plants to external stimuli and used it to describe the human impulses that precede gestures or words.         All her subsequent books can be understood through the prism of these tropisms, which she once described as ''the interior movements that prepare our words and actions at the limits of our consciousness.'' On another occasion, she spoke of her writing as ''sub-conversation'' through which she captured and conveyed half-formed ideas and feelings in often hesitant dialogue.         While ''tropisms'' became her tool for exploring the human spirit, her purpose was to break with the 19th-century novel of Balzac and Flaubert, which in her view, had been made obsolete by Kafka, Proust, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. She considered these writers to be her mentors, but she went further, creating a stark literary form stripped of characters, plot and chronology, a form that Jean-Paul Sartre tagged the ''antinovel.''         ''I believe that, through my novels, I showed that it was possible to write novels where the purely fictional element was freed from the conventions that encumbered it, just as the purely pictorial element in painting has freed itself from subject matter, perspective, and so on,'' Mrs. Sarraute wrote in an essay in The New York Times Book Review in 1964.         In the 1950's, her innovative approach drew her toward several young French writers, among them Alain Robbe-Grillet, Michel Butor, Marguerite Duras, Claude Simon, and Robert Pinget, who came to be identified with the Nouveau Roman (a term borrowed from a critic for Le Monde). But while she enjoyed being discovered as a ''new novelist'' when she was already well into her 50's, her attacks on traditional literary form both anticipated and survived the movement.         Born into an intellectual Jewish family in Ivanovo, Russia, on July 18, 1900, Natasha Tcherniak -- as she then was -- had an unsettling childhood. Her father, Elie, a chemist, and her mother, Pauline, a writer, separated when she was 2 and remarried,  and she was painfully shuttled back and forth between two countries and two sets of parents. She went to Paris with her mother in 1902, moved to St. Petersburg in 1905 and then returned to Paris in 1908, where she was then brought up by her father and his new wife, Vera.         Soon fluent in German and English as well as French and Russian, she  studied law and literature at the Sorbonne and Oxford University before joining a Paris law firm in 1925, the same year that she married a fellow lawyer, Raymond Sarraute. After Germany occupied France in 1940, she escaped the fate of 76,000 Jews who were deported from France to German death camps by hiding out in a village and posing as Nicole Sauvage, the governess of her own three young daughters.         She never returned to the Paris bar. In 1932, she had begun writing ''Tropisms,'' a book comprising 24 short sketches. She finished five years later, but it was not until 1939 that she found a publisher. After the war, dedicating herself entirely to writing, she became friends with Sartre, who offered to write a preface for her first novel, ''Portrait of a  Man Unknown'' (1948), which he famously described as ''an antinovel that reads like a detective story.'' He noted, ''Nathalie Sarraute has a horror of the tricks of the novelist.''         Although Mrs. Sarraute was not drawn to existentialism, she remained friends with Sartre until Simone de Beauvoir came between them. ''She separated us completely,'' Mrs. Sarraute recalled in a 1990 interview with The Paris Review. ''But I heard that she couldn't bear Sartre having an intellectual relationship with anyone, male or female.''         Like many French writers then and now, Mrs. Sarraute liked to work at a table in a cafe, in her case one at the Trocadero near her home in the 16th arrondissement. In his memoir ''Paris in the Fifties,'' the American journalist and author Stanley Karnow, who was briefly married to Mrs. Sarraute's eldest daughter, Claude, paints a portrait of the writer as ''a lean, severe-looking woman with a hawk nose, piercing black eyes and combed-back ebony hair.''         At one point, Mr. Karnow recalled, he moved in with his wife's parents, although he was unsure whether Mrs. Sarraute's ''unpredictable Slavic temperament'' would prove too much. ''She could be uptight and relaxed, cantankerous and amiable, dour and cheerful,'' he wrote. ''Even so, I adored her -- or perhaps it was the intellectual electricity of her company.'' Mrs. Sarraute is survived by her daughter Claude and two other daughters, Anne and Dominique.         In her second novel, ''Martereau'' (1953), Mrs. Sarraute used the natural intrigue of an extended family to explore her tropisms. The book sold few copies, but it sufficed to identify her as a ''new novelist.'' Just three years later, when she published ''The Age of Suspicion,'' this book of essays about her approach to literature was presented to the public as ''the first theoretical manifestation of the Nouveau Roman school.''         Mrs. Sarraute was not prolific. After she published ''The Planetarium'' in 1959, it would take more than a decade for her to complete her next three novels -- ''The Golden Fruits'' (1963), ''Between Life and Death'' (1968) and ''Do You Hear Them?'' (1972) -- which had in common a complex and humorous self-criticism of her own creative process hidden inside a novel.         Quintessentially French in its intellectual playfulness, ''The Golden Fruits'' revolved around a discussion of the merits and demerits of an imaginary, much-acclaimed book, also called ''The Golden Fruits,'' a discussion that enabled Mrs. Sarraute to demystify the solemn language of literary criticism through parody and caricature while, at the same time, raising disturbing questions. ''It is my most abstract work,'' she said at the time.         Well received in France, ''The Golden Fruits'' appeared obscure to some American critics. ''The fact that this misty book contains some valid satirical points does not make it a rewarding novel,'' Orville Prescott wrote in The New York Times in February 1964. ''When the experimental techniques shrink the size of fiction and squeeze the juices of life out of it, they are fruitless indeed.''         Albeit eliminating even the narrator from some of her books (in which characters may be reduced to ''he,'' ''she'' and ''they''), Mrs. Sarraute was in fact always present as a form of mischievous puppeteer. In her 1983 autobiographical work, ''Childhood,'' however, she showed herself, at least how she remembered her turbulent first 12 years of life. And, typically, she recalled them through the impact of single words, like ''stupid'' and ''tragedy.''         ''Childhood'' was written in her ''predialogue'' style, which she defined as the ''little bits of something still alive'' on the border of consciousness, ''something prior to language -- a sensation, a perception.'' These feelings, she said, must be captured before they're labeled with adult words because adult words both falsify experience and render it traumatizing.         ''Childhood'' was adapted as a one-act play and presented in New York with Glenn Close. But it was less successful than several pieces that she wrote as radio plays and that were later staged, among them ''The Lie'' and ''Silence.'' In writing for theater, she was also forced to become more explicit. In novels, she said, the dialogue skimmed the surface of the sub-conversation. But in plays, the ''predialogue'' became a fully fledged dialogue. ''They later said my plays, in relation to my novels, were like a glove turned inside out,'' she told The Paris Review.         Slowing down in the mid-1980's after the death of her husband, Mrs. Sarraute nonetheless never stopped writing, occasionally demonstrating that she remained as fascinated with her explorations of language as she had been a half-century or more earlier. ''You Don't Love Yourself,'' published in 1990, is a dialogue about self-hate in which, as often is the case, there is a counterpoint between language and emotion.         ''Here,'' published in 1995 in France and in 1997 in the United States, just as Mrs. Sarraute's complete works were being reissued in France's legendary Pleiade Series, is as always a novel without plot or characters or perhaps, as suggested by Richard Burgin writing in The Washington Post, ''a poetic essay of ideas'' in which the author pursues ''the power and poverty of words.''         In France, ''Here'' was described by some critics as Mrs. Sarraute's final testimony, an apt summation of her oeuvre. But she had not yet finished. In September 1997, at the age of 97, she published ''Ouvrez,'' or ''Open,'' a 130-page book in which she denounced the impoverishment of the French language. ''It seems completely mad,'' she remarked in one interview, ''but at my age one is allowed to write things that are completely mad.'' And, unsurprisingly, she was working on yet another book at the time of her death.       
         Bethel Leslie, a lifelong presence onstage and on television whose final Broadway performance earned her a Tony nomination, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, said Leslie McCullough Jeffries, her daughter.         The daughter of a lawyer and a socialite, Ms. Leslie was a 15-year-old student at the Brearley School on the Upper East Side when she was discovered by the producer George Abbott and cast as the girl next door in the 1944 Broadway production of ''Snafu,'' a comedy.         The role began Ms. Leslie's career, which included appearances in 10 Broadway plays before she was 25 and which had her acting alongside the likes of Fredric March (''Years Ago,'' in 1946), Sam Wanamaker (''Goodbye, My Fancy'' in 1948) and Helen Hayes (''The Wisteria Trees,'' in 1950).         Her breakthrough came in 1955, in ''Inherit the Wind,'' in which she played the conflicted daughter of a Bible-wielding reverend. The part earned Ms. Leslie strong reviews, and she soon headed to Hollywood. There she found steady work in television, parlaying her dark good looks into roles on shows like ''Gunsmoke,'' ''Perry Mason'' and ''The Fugitive.''         A 1965 press biography listed some of her character roles as ''a cheating wife, a husband-framing mistress'' and ''the wife of a confessed murderer.''         Ms. Leslie made her film debut in 1964 in ''Captain Newman, M.D.,'' as the wife of a traumatized Air Force pilot, played by Robert Duvall.         By 1965 she had returned to New York and to the theater, though appearances on soap operas helped support that passion. As a side pursuit Ms. Leslie began to write, eventually becoming a head writer for the daytime drama ''The Secret Storm.''         It was not until 1986, however, that she scored her biggest triumph, appearing as the morphine-addicted mother in Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey into Night,'' a performance that Frank Rich of The New York Times called ''exceptionally beautiful.'' Her work earned her a Tony nomination.         In recent years she appeared Off Broadway in productions with the Signature Theater Company and most recently with the Women's Project, where she won praise this spring for her work in Joan Vail Thorne's play ''Exact Center of the Universe.''         In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York, Ms. Leslie is survived by a brother, Warren Leslie, also of New York, and two grandchildren.       
         Georgia Hofmann, an owner and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses, including the Triple Tiara winner Sky Beauty, died Sunday at her home in Bal Harbour, Fla. She was 91.         The cause was complications from leukemia, which was diagnosed several months ago, said Lawrence G. Foster, a family spokesman.         Mrs. Hofmann learned to ride horses bareback and said that was when her love for them began. In 1962, she bought her first racehorse, a filly named Calabrea, who won her first race and paid $72 to win.         ''That horse was the real reason I am in the racing business today,'' she said years later. She did most of her own buying and selling, and bred or owned such outstanding horses as Gold Beauty, named the champion sprinter in 1982, Louis Quatorze, winner of the 1996 Preakness, Gold Stage, Maplejinsky, Dayjur, Royal Indy and Bankers Gold.         But the pride and prize of the lot was Sky Beauty, a daughter of the European champion Blushing Groom and a granddaughter of Nijinsky II. She came into prominence in 1992, when she won five starts. And, in 1993, she was only the eighth filly to win the Triple Tiara, the equivalent of the Triple Crown for fillies.         Mrs. Hofmann was the widow of Philip B. Hofmann, a retired chairman of Johnson & Johnson, the health care products company. Mr. Hofmann's lifelong interest in horses centered on jumpers, show horses and coach-and-four competitions. He left the thoroughbred racing to his wife, and when at the racetrack he often said: ''I'm just here to watch. She's the expert.''         Mrs. Hofmann's first marriage, to Fred R. Fehlhaber, ended in divorce.         Georgia Hofmann was born Georgia Ellis on a farm near Montgomery, Ala. She became a fashion model in New York and had a minor part in a musical production staged by Florenz Ziegfeld. But she seemed to have a sixth sense about a racehorse's breeding and racing potential. She spent long hours studying books and reports on bloodlines.         Mrs. Hofmann, who owned Wycombe House Stud, a 218-acre horse farm in Ocala, Fla., earned more than $12 million through the sale of 22 horses, including Sky Beauty.         Although she was ill, Mrs. Hofmann attended the Breeders' Cup races at Gulfstream Park in Florida on Nov. 6. The next day, she flew to Lexington, Ky., to preside over the sale of the last of her racehorses.         She is survived by a sister, Elizabeth St. Almond of Jacksonville, Fla.; two stepdaughters, Judy Hofmann Richter of Bedford, N.Y., and Carol Hofmann Thompson of Colts Neck, N.J.; a stepson, Robert F. Fehlhaber of Fort Lauderdale, Fla; and two stepdaughters, Chris Fehlhaber McGuire of Vero Beach, Fla., and Julie Fehlhaber Flavell of Fort Lauderdale.         Mrs. Hofmann, who never had children, often referred to her horses as ''my babies.''       
         Phoebe Snetsinger, who saw and recorded more birds than anybody else, died on Nov. 23 in a van accident on a birding expedition to Madagascar, shortly after viewing an exceptionally rare Helmet vanga. She was 68 and lived in Webster Groves, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis.         Birding went from a hobby to a passion for Mrs. Snetsinger on the day in 1981 that a doctor told her she had an incurable cancer, with less than a year to live. Rejecting therapy, she took off to Alaska on a scheduled trip, her first long-distance journey simply to see birds.         ''She came back and felt good,'' her husband, David, said. ''Things just started snowballing from there.''         Mrs. Snetsinger liked to say her avian ardor ''began with a death sentence,'' and her relentless energy reflected that level of urgency as her cancer went into the first of several remissions. Family members and friends could not imagine her without binoculars, floppy hat, sneakers, telescope and other field gear as she scurried around the globe on scores of bird tours, most costing more than $5,000. An inheritance paid the bills; she supplied the boundless energy. She said she spent more time in the world's jungles, mountains and other wild areas than at home.         There were setbacks, as the cancer, melanoma, recurred every five years or so, only to go into remission again. But her record, as verified by the American Birding Association, was sighting about 8,400 birds, or nearly 85 percent of the species now estimated to exist, more than 2,000 birds ahead of her nearest competitor.         ''She was a celebrity in our bunch,'' said Bret Whitney, a co-founder of Field Guides, a tour operator based in Austin, Tex. Mrs. Snetsinger was traveling on one of the group's tours when the van overturned. Mr. Whitney said she apparently died instantly.         ''She gave so much to the birding world and had so much more left to give,'' said G. Stuart Keith, the birding association's first president. At the highest tier of birding, it was a common joke to differentiate between Phoebe Snetsinger and the phoebe, a genus of flycatchers.         Genera, or large groups of species (as in the genus Homo of Homo sapiens), were of considerable importance to Mrs. Snetsinger, who kept a separate list of those that have only a single species, known as monotypic genera. Her list of more than 2,000 such genera far surpassed anyone else's, said Mr. Whitney, who also works as a research associate at Louisiana State University.         She also kept extensive notes on subspecies, using index cards as a catalog until switching in recent months to a computer from the Remington portable typewriter she had used since college.         Her subspecies notes, in whatever format, are important because many of the birds have now been reclassified as species. When she started, there were 8,500 officially named species, compared with about 10,000 now. A spokeswoman for the American Museum of Natural History said some scientists believed there could eventually be as many as 18,000 named separate bird species.         This means that her life list will almost certainly grow posthumously. ''She has birds in escrow,'' Mr. Whitney said.         Mrs. Snetsinger was born in Lake Zurich, Ill., where she attended a one-room elementary school with only two other students. At 11, she met her future husband, then 13, in 4-H clubs.         She graduated from Swarthmore College as a German major, and then taught science at the Baldwin School, a private girls school in Bryn Mawr, Pa. When Mr. Snetsinger returned from service in Korea, they both attended graduate school and she earned a master's degree in German literature.         They had four children, all of whom survive. They are Thomas, of Corvallis, Ore.; Penny, of Woodbridge, Conn.; Carol, of Missoula, Mont., and Susan, of Tempe, Ariz. All but Penny pursued careers relating to birds, Thomas as a researcher in endangered bird species for the Federal government, Carol as a bird researcher in Alaska and Montana, and Susan as a student of the spotted owl in the Northwest.         In 1965, a friend took Mrs. Snetsinger birding for the first time in Minnesota, and when her husband took a corporate job in Missouri she pursued her interest with a group of birders. (Birders adamantly spurn the term ''birdwatcher'' in the belief that it suggests a lack of gravity.) The group visited local woods and prairies each Thursday afternoon.         After birding came to represent a new lease on life to her, Mrs. Snetsinger began to take longer and longer trips. She was hooked when she visited Kenya and saw 500 different birds in three weeks. Her odyssey was aided by new technology for recording bird sounds, greater access to more and more remote habitats and the increasing numbers of tours being offered.         The depth of her enthusiasm is suggested by her response to a fall she took about six months ago while climbing a mountain in the Philippines: she stayed in the field for two additional weeks to see more birds.         The whole idea of listing birds, or at least the seriousness of the pursuit, is also sometimes criticized, or at least satirized. Indeed, it is called ''the game'' by birders themselves. ''It's like collecting stamps or baseball cards,'' said Paul J. Baicich, editor of Birding, the magazine of the American Birding Association.         Mr. Snetsinger said his wife's competitive spirit was kept hidden, though he did not deny it existed. In a 1996 interview, she insisted that she wanted to play down her quantitative quest. ''I'm going back to being a birder, not a lister,'' she said.         Ultimately, she felt very lucky, as she explained in an article to be published in next February's issue of Birding. ''Birding is the best and most exciting pursuit in the world, a glorified never-ending one,'' Mrs. Snetsinger wrote. ''And the whole experience of a foreign trip, whether you see 10 new birds or 500, is simply too good to miss.''       
         Jill Craigie, a devoted socialist and feminist who became one of Britain's first successful female film directors and whose half-century marriage to the Labor Party leader Michael Foot put her at the heart of the country's leftist politics, died on Monday in London. She was 85.         Ms. Craigie first made her mark in documentary filmmaking with ''Out of Chaos,'' a 1943 film about modern art; ''The Way We Live,'' a 1946 study of the effects of the German blitzkrieg on Plymouth, and ''Blue Scar,'' a 1948 look at life in an impoverished Welsh mining village. It was while making her film in Plymouth that she met Mr. Foot, then a candidate for Parliament. She interviewed him and a relationship began.         Ms. Craigie was born in Derbyshire to a Scottish father and a Russian emigre mother and had, by her own estimation, a wretched childhood. Her parents divorced when she was an infant. Her father was killed in World War I and her mother lived mostly abroad.         ''I used to spend most of my holidays at boarding school,'' she once said. ''I went to a dozen different boarding schools over the years and never learned anything. I was one of the rootless people. I had a very lonely childhood indeed. I turned to writing because I was lonely.''         After school, she moved to London and began writing an advice column and horoscopes for a women's magazine called Betty's Paper. She quickly found her way into artistic and literary circles. When she was 19, she married a sculptor, Claude Begbie-Clench, and they had a daughter, Julie. The marriage was short-lived.         Soon after, she married Jeffrey Dell, a scriptwriter for the movie producer Alexander Korda, and they wrote a play called ''The Judge,'' which was staged in London in 1938. This marriage was also short-lived, but Ms. Craigie was able to use the connections she made through Mr. Dell to get work in the British film industry, first making sports films and later turning to feature-length documentaries.         During these years, Ms. Craigie was romantically linked to many prominent artists and writers.         Mr. Foot and Ms. Craigie did not marry for almost two years after their meeting in Plymouth, though they lived together for much of that time. They finally married in 1949, she once said, to assuage the concerns of Mr. Foot's family.         Though many at the time doubted that Ms. Craigie's third marriage would last longer than the first two, theirs turned out to be a close and loving relationship, friends said.         She is survived by her husband and daughter.         Ms. Craigie's work as a filmmaker and writer dwindled after her third marriage, though she did write the screenplay for ''The Million Pound Note,'' renamed ''Man With a Million,'' a 1953 film starring Gregory Peck that was filmed in London.         In 1952, she wrote and produced a BBC radio documentary about the British suffragist movement, a subject that was near to her heart since a chance meeting in 1940 with a group of aging suffragists at a memorial service for one of their members.         For the last decades of her life, Ms. Craigie was said to be at work on a  history of the movement, left unfinished at her death.         In 1967, she made a television documentary called ''Who Are the Vandals?'' that was critical of housing developers. In 1995, she made ''Two Hours From London,'' a documentary about the former Yugoslavia.         As Mr. Foot's political career prospered, Ms. Craigie became known as one of his confidantes as well as the hostess for many Labor Party gatherings at the couple's home. When Mr. Foot became chief of the Labor Party in 1980, beginning a three-year leadership that ended with a crushing defeat for the party in 1983, a few asserted that he was being pushed by an ambitious wife. Ms. Craigie demurred.         ''He would be in exactly the same position he is in today had he not been married to me, except he wouldn't have had such a nice house,'' she said.       
         Lucile Petry Leone, the founding director of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps, which recruited more than 100,000 young women to study nursing and helped spare the country of the need to draft nurses in World War II, died on Nov. 25 at an assisted-living center in San Francisco. She was 97.         As early as the summer of 1941, months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, there was talk in Washington that it might be necessary to conscript nurses to care for the inevitable high number of casualties there would be should the United States become engaged in a major war.         A less radical alternative -- and a much more politically acceptable one -- was temporarily agreed upon. The United States Public Health Service would start a program to attract young women at schools throughout the country into nursing. Lucile Petry, a teacher at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing, was chosen to initiate the program.         Two years later, after the United States was at war in both Europe and Asia, Ms. Leone founded and directed the Cadet Nurse Corps, a more formal effort to start women on a path to nursing. The program, authorized by Congress in 1943, offered to cover the cost of a candidate's tuition, fees, room and board, books, monthly stipends and snappy navy-style uniforms.         In exchange, said Ellen Schell, a nursing historian based in San Francisco, candidates had to ''promise to participate in essential military or civilian nursing for as long as the war lasted.''         The Cadet Nurse Corps proved a success, meeting its recruitment quotas in 1943 and 1944 and outstripping them in the final year of the war, when there were 112,000 cadets in the program. As a consequence, the United States never had to draft nurses into the armed services during the war.         Explaining the success of the Cadet Nurse Corps, Ms. Leone told an interviewer in 1945: ''We had a saleable package from the beginning. The girls immediately liked the idea of being able to combine war service with professional education for the future.''         She also gave credit to the organization's slogan, ''Custodians of the Crises of Life.''         In 1949, Ms. Leone became the first woman to direct a division of the United States Public Health Service, the Division of Nurse Education. Her rank was equivalent to that of an admiral.         ''In that capacity,'' said Zina Mirsky, assistant dean for administration at the School of Nursing of the University of California at San Francisco, ''she established the role of nursing in the federal government -- a presence that still exists.''         Ms. Leone retired from government service in 1966 and went on to teach nursing and serve as associate dean at Texas Women's University.  She retired again in 1971.         Lucile Petry, the only child of a high school principal and his wife, was born on Jan. 23, 1902, in Frog Heaven, in Preble County, Ohio. She was reared in Selbyville, Del., and  after graduating from the University of Delaware in 1924, she received  advanced degrees at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing in 1927 and Columbia Teachers College in 1929. She taught at the Yale School of Nursing and the University of Minnesota School of Nursing before being summoned to Washington.         Ms. Leone's marriage to Nicholas Leone ended in divorce in 1967. She has no immediate survivors.
