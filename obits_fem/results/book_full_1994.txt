         Katherine Kuh, a writer on art and a former curator at the Art Institute of Chicago who devoted her career to the acceptance of modern art, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died of natural causes, said her lawyer, William H. Roth.         Mrs. Kuh, the former Katherine Woolf, was born in St. Louis in 1904. She attended Vassar College and decided to focus on art history after taking a course taught by Alfred H. Barr Jr., soon to become the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art.         After graduate work at the University of Chicago and New York University, she opened Chicago's first commercial gallery of avant-garde art in 1936. For the next six years, she exhibited works by an impressive list of European and American modernists, including Leger, Kandinsky, Picasso and Klee, as well as African and pre-Columbian art, typographical design and photography. Sales were rare, so Mrs. Kuh kept the gallery afloat by holding art-history classes there. Innovative Exhibitions         In 1943, she was hired by Daniel Catton Rich, director of the Art Institute of Chicago, to run the museum's public-relations office while its regular director served in the military. She was soon put in charge of the museum's Gallery of Art Interpretation, where she mounted innovative exhibitions that introduced the public to modern art by comparing it to examples of art from other periods.         As associate curator of painting and sculpture at the institute, Mrs. Kuh worked with Rich to organize the first public exhibition of the great modern art collection of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Arensberg in 1949. In 1951, she published her first book, "Art Has Many Faces," one of the first books on the appreciation of modern art, and it was widely used by teachers.         In 1954, she became the Art Institute's first curator of modern painting and sculpture and, with Rich, was responsible for acquiring many of its most important works in this area, including Matisse's monumental figure painting "Bathers by a River."         In 1959, a year after Rich's departure, Mrs. Kuh left the Art Institute; soon she moved to New York. Over the next decade, she worked as art adviser for the First National Bank of Chicago, assembling an eclectic corporate collection of some 2,000 works that is considered one of the best in the country. During this period, her books included "The Artist's Voice" (1962), "Break-Up: The Core of Modern Art" (1965) and "The Open Eye: In Pursuit of Art" (1971).         Her marriage, to George Kuh, ended in divorce.       
         Mildred Gilman Wohlforth, who wrote books and magazine articles and was a New York newspaperwoman during the Roaring Twenties, died on Monday at her home in Ridgefield, Conn. She was 97.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Robert M. Wohlforth.         Mrs. Wohlforth's breathless coverage of flappers, bootleggers, love nests and trunk murders earned her a reputation as one of journalism's first sob sisters.         She was a friend and confidante of Harold Ross, the first editor of The New Yorker magazine, and she knew Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, Christopher Morley and other members of what came to be known as the Algonquin Round Table.         Among the dozens of murders that Mrs. Wohlforth covered for The New York Journal was the notorious Triple X murder case, which involved a serial killer who preyed on couples in lovers' lanes.         Her first novel, "Fig Leaves," was published shortly after she graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1919. Mrs. Wohlforth later became secretary to the columnist and author Heywood Broun and wrote a second novel, "Headlines."         Her articles appeared in Redbook, American Mercury, Reader's Digest, and McCall's. In 1931 Hollywood made a film of her third book, "Sob Sister," which she defined as "a reporter who almost literally sobbed with the victim, the culprit, the families of both."         She is survived by her husband of 63 years; two sons, Eric E., of Anchorage, and Timothy A., of Oakland, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Emily Jordan Boxer, a television producer who arranged book interviews for NBC television's "Today" show in the 1980's, died yesterday at New York Hospital. A resident of Manhattan and Amagansett, L.I., she was 65.         The cause was massive pneumonia, said her husband, John Boxer.         A native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College. She started her career in 1953 with Walt Framer Productions, working on such shows as "The Price Is Right."         From 1979 to 1991 she was book coordinator at the "Today" show. She selected and scheduled authors and other literary figures, briefed NBC anchors and correspondents and wrote questions they asked the guests.         After that, until last February, she was the special-features producer for "The Home Show" on ABC.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Boxer is survived by two sons, Adam, of Brooklyn and Nicholas, of Atlanta, and two grandchildren.       
         Emily Taft Douglas, a former United States Representative from Illinois, died on Friday at a nursing home in White Plains. She was 94 and had lived in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., since moving from Washington in 1986.         Mrs. Douglas was the widow of former Senator Paul H. Douglas, who represented Illinois from 1949 to 1966. But having served in the House from 1945 to 1947, she was the first American woman to precede a husband to Congress. Both were Democrats.         In the House, Mrs. Douglas became a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and campaigned for the fledgling United Nations. She traveled in war-ravaged Europe and backed the relief efforts of the United Nations.         She introduced legislation for bookmobiles to bring library services to rural America, and such a bill eventually passed after her husband's election as the Hill-Douglas Act. Marched for Civil Rights         Mrs. Douglas was elected in 1944 after a campaign against isolationism and went to Washington as Representative-at-Large, representing Illinois as a whole. By 1946, the political climate had changed and her support of the Truman Administration's policies sank her bid for re-election.         During her husband's 18 years on Capitol Hill, Mrs. Douglas was an advocate of civil rights and marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Alabama. She was a representative to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other United Nations conferences. A Unitarian, she was also a moderator of the American Unitarian Association.         Mrs. Douglas was the author of "Appleseed Farm" (1948), a children's book; "Remember the Ladies" (1966), the story of women who helped shape America, and "Margaret Sanger" (1970), about the pioneer in family planning.         A native of Chicago, she was the daughter of Lorado Taft, the sculptor, and Ada Bartless Taft. After graduating from the University of Chicago, she studied acting.         Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, yesterday called the Douglases good partners and said, "Together, Emily and Paul Douglas contributed immensely to Illinois and the nation."         Paul Douglas died in 1976. Mrs. Douglas is survived by a daughter, Dr. Jean Taft Douglas Bandler of Manhattan, and two grandsons.         Correction:  February 3, 1994, Thursday         An obituary on Tuesday about Emily Taft Douglas, a former Democratic Representive from Illinois, misstated the middle name of her mother, who died before her. She was Ada Bartlett Taft.       
         Ann M. Sperber, whose biography of Edward R. Murrow was a best-seller in 1986, died on Friday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 58.         The cause was an apparent heart attack, said her brother, Dr. Alan Sperber.         Miss Sperber's book, "Murrow: His Life and Times" (Freundlich Books), was a well-received biography that was republished in paperback in 1987. She had spent over a decade writing the work and had first collected research material for it in Berlin while a Fulbright Scholar there in 1956-57.         Before writing the book about Mr. Murrow, Miss Sperber was an editor of children's books for Putnam and McGraw-Hill. She graduated from Barnard College in 1956.         She is survived by her mother, Lisa Sperber, and her brother, both of Manhattan.       
         Marjorie Keller Sitney, an independent film maker whose works have been shown at museums, festivals and film institutes around the world, died on Thursday in Winter Haven, Fla. She was 43 and lived in Wakefield, R.I.         The cause has not been determined, said her family, whom she was visiting.         Ms. Keller, married to the film scholar P. Adams Sitney but known by her maiden name, began exhibiting films in 1969. Among them are "Misconception" (1977), "Daughters of Chaos" (1980) and "Herein" (1992). She has had one-woman shows at the Museum of Modern Art and Anthology Film Archives in New York City. From 1986 to 1989 she was president of the New York Film Makers' Cooperative.         Ms. Keller was a teacher and lecturer at the University of Rhode Island, the San Francisco Art Institute and other institutions. Her book "The Untutored Eye: Childhood in the Films of Jean Cocteau, Joseph Cornell and Stan Brakhage," was published in 1985.         In addition to her husband and her parents, Clarence and Nellie Keller, she is survived by twin daughters, Augusta Nell and Miranda Hope; a stepson, Blake; a stepdaughter, Skye; four sisters, Jacquelyn Gilbert and Barbara Wilkens, both of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.; Patricia Button of Peeksill, N.Y., and Sarah Ann Filippini of Reston, Va., and two brothers, Clarence Christian Keller Jr. of Golden, Colo., and Stephen Lee Keller of Newark, Ohio.       
         Margaret Lane, the Dowager Countess of Huntingdon, a British author whose works included books about Peter Rabbit's creator, Beatrix Potter, died last Monday in Southampton, England. She was 86 and lived outside Southampton.         Miss Lane's two biographies of Miss Potter were the basis of "The Tale of Beatrix Potter," a two-part BBC dramatization shown on "Masterpiece Theater" on WNET in 1984 that was praised as a simple yet intense story with just the right touches of unflinching reserve.         Miss Lane's two books, "The Tale of Beatrix Potter: a Biography" (1946, Warne and Viking Penguin) and "The Magic Years of Beatrix Potter" (1978), were praised last week in the London newspaper The Independent as enriched by Miss Lane's own "exquisite sympathy with animals."         When "The Tale of Beatrix Potter" was published in the United States, it was lauded for its deep understanding of Miss Potter, who helped Miss Lane with the book, and for its vivid depiction of Miss Potter walking the hills and moors, gathering material for stories and pictures.         Miss Lane's 1975 book "Samuel Johnson and his World" has been called one of the very best modern works on Johnson. Her 1953 book about the writer Charlotte Bronte and members of her family, "The Bronte Story," won praise as an outstanding literary biography. And her 1965 novel "A Night at Sea" was lauded for its poignancy and narrative suspense.         Her other books -- she wrote more than two dozen, all told -- included "A Calabash of Diamonds" (1961), a personal account of an African safari; "Purely for Pleasure" (1967), a collection of essays, and "The Day of the Feast" (1968), a novel. She also wrote children's books.         The daughter of a journalist, Miss Lane studied at St. Hugh's College of Oxford University, worked as a reporter for some years and went on to become a critic as well as an author.         Her 1934 marriage to Bryan Wallace, son of the writer Edgar Wallace, was dissolved in 1939. In 1944 she was married to the 15th Earl of Huntingdon, a mural painter, and he died in 1990. They had two daughters.       
         Ruth Mortimer Lancaster, curator of rare books and assistant librarian at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., died on Monday at her home in Williamsburg, Mass. She was 62.         Her husband, John Lancaster, said she had died of metastatic breast cancer.         Known professionally as Ruth Mortimer, she was a specialist in rare manuscripts and books, especially illustrated books of the Renaissance. Her detailed catalogues of such 16th-century French and Italian books at Harvard University's Houghton Library are standard reference works in the field.         In her honor, a room at Smith's Neilson Library was named the Mortimer Rare Book Room just before her death.         Ms. Mortimer, who was born in Syracuse, became associated with rare books while working as a student assistant in her freshman year at Smith. She graduated summa cum laude and received a certificate at the Shakespeare Institute of the University of Birmingham, England, as well as a master's degree at the Columbia University School of Library Service. Expanded Collections         She spent 18 years at Harvard's Houghton Library before returning to Smith as curator of rare books in 1975. Under her guidance, the Neilson Library added its Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf collections, along with materials ranging from the earliest printed books to contemporary fine-press books.         Ms. Mortimer also lectured in the art department and taught a course on the history of books until a few weeks ago.         She was the first woman to be elected president of the Bibliographical Society of America, serving from 1988 to 1992. In the 1980's she edited, with Mr. Lancaster, the society's quarterly journal. She also wrote many papers and articles for scholarly journals.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Sally Belfrage, who wrote nonfiction books about life in an Indian ashram and about the civil rights movement in Mississippi in 1964, died yesterday at Middlesex Hospital in London. She was 57 and lived in London.         The cause was cancer, said her literary agent, Irene Skolnick.         Ms. Belfrage (pronounced BELL-fridge) spent a month studying under an Indian spiritual leader to gather material for "Flowers of Emptiness: Reflections on an Ashram" (1981). The book won her praise as an intelligent and humorous journalist and critic who ardently searched for the truth.         Her Mississippi memoir, "Freedom Summer" (1965), based on her experience as a civil rights volunteer, was lauded for freshness and forcefulness.         Her other books are "A Room in Moscow" (1959), about a sojourn in the Soviet Union and "Living With War: A Belfast Year" (1987). "Un-American Activities," a memoir of her adolescence, is to be published in June by HarperCollins. Youth in Hollywood and London         Ms. Belfrage was born in Hollywood, the daughter of Cedric Belfrage and Molly Castle, Britons who were then correspondents for London newspapers. In "Un-American Activities" she wrote, "My mother was a mere English eccentric, but my father was a Red and so in trouble all the time."         After her family moved east, she attended Bronx High School of Science, Hunter College and, after moving to London when she was 18, the London School of Economics. In 1957, she worked for the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow.         Her 1965 marriage to Bernard Pomerance, who wrote the play "The Elephant Man," ended in divorce in 1976.         She is survived by a daughter, Eve Pomerance of London; a son, Moby Pomerance of Manhattan; a brother, Nicholas, of London, and a sister, Anne Zribi of Paris.       
         Dr. Martha E. Rogers, a nursing administrator at New York University for 20 years who helped establish nursing as a profession with responsibilities apart from traditional medical care, died on Sunday at her home in Phoenix. She was 79.         She died of pulmonary failure complicated by emphysema, said her brother-in-law, J. Paul Coleman of Johnson City, Tenn.         In her book "An Introduction to the Theoretical Basis of Nursing" (1970), Dr. Rogers drew on many disciplines, including psychology, sociology, biology, history and literature, to postulate a humanistic nursing science. She termed it "a unified concept of human functioning" basic to understanding and treating people. Treating the Whole Person         While physicians respond to the immediate medical condition of a patient, "nursing is concerned with evaluating the simultaneous state of the individual (or group) and the environment and the preceding configuration leading up to the present," she wrote.         While much of her work is considered complex if not abstract and the subject of scores of academic articles, her theories led to numerous studies evaluating patients beyond the traditional scope of medical treatment, such as determining the agitation of bed-ridden patients by observing arm and leg movements and the role of nursing in dealing with hyperactive children.         Dr. Rogers was a strong advocate of rebuilding nursing education programs by replacing the hospital training of nurses, where she received her early training, with university studies, which she was later to head at New York University from 1954 to 1975.         After taking science courses from 1931 to 1933 at the University of Tennessee, Dr. Rogers, who was born in Dallas, received a nursing diploma from the Knoxville General Hospital School of Nursing in Tennessee in 1936. She graduated from George Peabody College in Nashville in 1937.         In the mid-1940's, she established the first visiting nurse service in Arizona, one of the first in the nation. In 1945 she received a master's degree in nursing supervision from Teachers College of Columbia University and in 1952 she received a master's of public health and two years later a doctor of science, both from Johns Hopkins University.         Dr. Rogers's books, including "Nursing: A Science of Unitary Man" (1980) and "Science of Unitary Human Beings: A Paradigm for Nursing" (1983), are standard works for advanced nursing students.         She is survived by two sisters, Laura R. Wilhite of Knoxville and Jane R. Coleman of Johnson City, Tenn.       
         Mary Moon Hemingway, an author of food-processor cookbooks and a former editor of Vogue, House & Garden and Bride's magazines, died yesterday at her home in Kittery Point, Me. She was 76.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her husband, Booth Hemingway.         Mrs. Hemingway was the co-author, with Suzanne De Lima, of two cookbooks that first came out in the 1970's and were in print until recently. For a time Mrs. Hemingway and her co-author taught cooking together in Stamford, Conn.         One of their books, "Food Processor Magic: Six Hundred Recipes, Basic Techniques, Twists and Turns," was highly rated by critics when it appeared in 1976. It includes classic recipes as well as an eclectic array of recipes for other dishes, ranging from cranberry meatloaf to spinach nicoise. The other book is "Food Processor Baking Magic," published in 1978.         Mrs. Hemingway was born in Dorset, Vt., and attended schools in Switzerland and California before going on to Madeira School in McLean, Va. She was graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1939 and received an M.A. in theology in 1964 from Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y.         She was an oblate of St. Gregory's Abbey in Three Rivers, Mich., and an associate of St. Mary's Convent in Peekskill, N.Y.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Ann Hemingway Tarlton of Rumson, N.J.; two sons, John Moon Hemingway of Seattle and Booth Roy Hemingway of Kittery Point, and seven grandchildren.       
         Sarah Patton Boyle, an author who was active in civil rights matters, died on Feb. 20 at her home in Arlington, Va. She was 87.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said her son Roger.         Mrs. Boyle described her experiences as a white Southern woman coming to understand the problems of many black Americans in her book "The Desegregated Heart" (1962). Her other books on human relations were "For Human Beings Only" (1964) and "The Back Together Heart" (1966). Her last book, "The Desert Blooms" (1985), described her personal experiences with aging.         In addition to her son Roger, of Cos Cob, Conn., she is survived by another son, the Rev. Patton L. Boyle of Corvallis, Ore.       
         Helen Wolff, an American editor and publisher whose taste and talents led to the acquisition and publication of major works of literature, died yesterday at her home in Hanover, N.H. She was 88.         The cause was apparently a heart attack, said her son, Christian.         Mrs. Wolff, who was regarded by her colleagues in the international book world as the grande dame of letters, published greatly acclaimed and successful works under the imprint "A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book," which she established with her husband at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1961. The Wolffs were particularly respected for bringing out translations of distinguished European authors.         After her husband's death in a traffic accident in West Germany in 1963, she remained as the imprint's sole publisher at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich without losing any authors to other publishing houses. Mrs. Wolff retired in 1986, but was regularly consulted about acquisitions and translations. The Wolff imprint has continued to flourish at Harcourt Brace. The Merits of Literature         "The joy of publishing is to see good works become generally recognized," Mrs. Wolff once said. "Literature can do surprisingly well."         Among the authors with whom she worked closely were Gunter Grass, Umberto Eco, Max Frisch, Georges Simenon, Stanislaw Lem and Amos Oz. She also published Anne Morrow Lindbergh's best-selling "Gift From the Sea."         "I don't plan to write my memoirs, and I will tell you why," Mrs. Wolff said in 1982 when she was the subject of a profile in The New Yorker. "If one writes oneself, one closes out the writing of others. I've never been able to understand editors who could also write. You have to keep yourself open for the creative efforts of authors; you must be totally receptive. It's like being a priest, and I don't think priests should be married. Nor do I think editors should write. Kurt and I found our creativity and our life in editing and publishing."         The Wolffs brought to publishing a European sensibility that went beyond the demands and vagaries of the marketplace. Early in this century, Kurt Wolff was Franz Kafka's first publisher, at Kurt Wolff Verlag in Germany. The couple left Germany in the 1930's and lived in Italy and France before immigrating to the United States in 1941 to escape the Nazis. A Founder of Pantheon Books         The Wolffs founded Pantheon Books in New York in 1942 and went on to publish works that included Boris Pasternak's "Doctor Zhivago." They nurtured that company and remained with it until 1961, when they resigned and moved to Europe. Shortly thereafter, Pantheon was acquired by Random House. The couple's next venture, the Helen and Kurt Wolff imprint, began at the invitation of the publisher William Jovanovich.         Mrs. Wolff was a step ahead of rival American publishers in acquiring important foreign books because of her fluency in several languages. At the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, for example, she could read a manuscript in its original German, French or Italian and make a decision about it overnight.         Mrs. Wolff, whose name was originally Helen Mosel, was born in 1906 in Macedonia. Her father was German and her mother was of Hungarian and Austrian parentage. At home, Helen, her sister and her parents spoke German, Turkish and Serbian. Arriving Poor in New York         After World War I, she attended boarding schools in Vienna and discovered that she had a gift for languages, including English. In 1927, she went to Munich as a trainee at Kurt Wolff Verlag, where she became a full-time employee in charge of art books. She and Mr. Wolff, who was 20 years her senior and divorced, were married in London in 1933. Their son was born the next year.         When the Wolffs arrived in New York, they were nearly penniless. In 1942, they persuaded three investors to contribute a total of $7,500, which enabled the creation of Pantheon Books. Mrs. Wolff recalled that her personal budget at that time was a dollar a day. The next year, they were joined by Jacques Schiffrin, who had founded Editions Pleiade in Paris and who brought many fine books to Pantheon.         The Wolffs' first success in the United States was a new edition of the Grimm fairy tales, in 1944. Under their own imprint, they published a number of important works, both fiction and nonfiction. After her husband's death, Mrs. Wolff was responsible for such notable novels as Italo Calvino's "Invisible Cities," a retranslated edition of Giorgio Bassani's "Garden of the Finzi-Continis," Mr. Grass's "Flounder," Mr. Oz's "My Michael" and Mr. Eco's "Name of the Rose."         In 1981, for her contributions to international publishing, Mrs. Wolff was awarded the Inter Nationes Award for Literature and the Arts by the West German Government. In 1985, she was given the Goethe Medal by Goethe House, the German cultural institute in New York City.         In addition to her son, a professor of music and classics at Dartmouth College, she is survived by a stepson, Nikolaus Wolff of Norwich, Vt.; a stepdaughter, Maria Stadelmayer of Hamburg, Germany; a brother, George Mosel of Santiago, Chile; a sister, Elizabeth Steinbeis of Brannenburg, Germany, and 10 grandchildren.       
         Elissa Ichiyasu, a graphic designer, died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on April 13. She was 41 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, her family said.         A native of Chicago, Ms. Ichiyasu was a graduate of Columbia University and studied design at Pratt Institute. At her death she was a book designer for Harry N. Abrams Inc., an art-book publisher. She joined the company in January 1987 after working as an art director for Random House.         A show of her work is scheduled for the fall at the American Institute of Graphic Arts on Fifth Avenue.         Ms. Ichiyasu is survived by her husband, Michael Clancey; her father, Harry T. Ichiyasu, and a brother, Alan, both of Chicago.       
         Sonia Raiziss, a New York literary figure for many years, died on March 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 85 and also had a home in Bucks County, Pa.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said Alfredo de Palchi, her collaborator and former husband.         A poet, translator and critic, Ms. Raiziss was an editor of Chelsea, a semi-annual avant-garde literary magazine featuring poems and prose by promising new writers. She became an editor of the magazine in 1960, two years after its founding.         Chelsea published early work by such authors as Sylvia Plath, Umberto Eco, Raymond Carver and Grace Paley. Many of its back numbers are collectors' items. Published as High School Student         A native of Germany, Ms. Raiziss was brought to this country as a child and grew up in Philadelphia. Her earliest poems were published while she was in high school, and her subsequent work appeared widely in literary magazines.         She earned undergraduate and doctoral degrees at the University of Philadelphia, where her father, the biochemist Dr. George W. Raiziss, was a professor. She also studied at Columbia University and published her first collection of poems, "Through a Glass Darkly," as a student at the Sorbonne.         Her first book of criticism, "Metaphysical Passion: Seven Modern American Poets and the 17th-Century Tradition," was published in 1952 by the University of Philadelphia and reissued by Greenwood Press in 1970. "Bucks County Blues," a volume of her poetry that appeared in 1977, also remains in print.         Most recently, she was the translator of "The Scorpion's Dark Dance" (1993), a volume of Italian poetry by Mr. de Palchi.         She is survived by a son, Peter St. Mu Raiziss of Sacramento, Calif.       
         Shirley M. Sills, the executive vice president of PTN Publishing Company in Melville, L.I., died yesterday in her home in Manhasset, L.I. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Stanley S. Sills.         Mrs. Sills was an executive for six years at PTN Publishing, which produces 30 financial magazines relating to businesses like photography, chemicals and security services. Before that, for six years, she was the president of the General Medical Book Company in Manhattan.         She was a graduate of the State University of New York at Geneseo and received a master's degree in psychology from Hofstra University.         She is survived by her husband; two sons, Dr. Michael N. Sills of Dallas and David C. Sills of Roslyn, L.I., and three grandchildren. She also leaves a sister-in-law, Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Lois G. Forer, an author, a retired Philadelphia judge and a lifelong advocate for the young, the elderly and the poor, died on Monday at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. A Philadelphia resident, she was 80.         The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, her family said.         Judge Forer, an authority on criminal justice, spent 32 years practicing law and 16 years on the bench. Her books on the law received critical acclaim nationally.         She also headed a poverty law office for children, sat on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union and represented poor people in constitutional cases. As a private lawyer, she worked for wealthy clients and corporations, and as a judge she tried both criminal and civil cases. Benchmark Cases         From 1955 to 1966, she served Pennsylvania as Deputy Attorney General and played a key role in two benchmark cases. One of them ended the whites-only policy that the founder of Girard College had written into his will. The other opened the celebrated art collection of the tax-exempt Barnes Foundation to the public.         She became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia in 1971 and retired as a senior judge in 1987.         Lois Goldstein Forer was born in Chicago and graduated from Northwestern University in 1935. She worked briefly as a reporter and then as a union organizer. Dissatisfied, she returned to Northwestern for a law degree and spent several years in public service in Washington before moving to Philadelphia as a law clerk in Federal Court.         After her stint as Deputy Attorney General in 1966, she organized the Office for Juveniles at Community Legal Services and headed it for nearly two years.         Judge Forer received national attention with her first book, "No One Will Lissen: How Our Legal System Brutalizes the Youthful Poor" (1970). In it, she argued that the humane ideal to treat juveniles differently had been mangled in practice. For the most part, she wrote, juveniles falling into the system are poor, nonwhite and defenseless.         Her "Criminals and Victims: A Trial Judge Reflects on Crime and Punishment" (1980) tried to make sense of seeking to mete out justice in an environment of abstract theories of the way things are supposed to be. A judge, she asserted, finds little in the way of either practical guidance or spiritual comfort from abstractions.) Critical Views on Justice         "Money and Justice: Who Owns the Courts?" (1984) describes a system that costs too much and takes too long and often results in "substantial injustice." "A Chilling Effect: The Mounting Threat of Libel and Invasion of Privacy Actions to the First Amendment" (1987) argued for definitions of what is libelous and what is newsworthy. Federal legislation to that end would help rid the First Amendment of the ballast a litigious society has heaped on it, she contended.         Since her fourth-stage lymphoma was diagnosed eight months ago, Judge Forer finished two more books. One, "What Every Woman Should Know Before (and After) She Gets Involved With Men and Money," is scheduled for publication by MacMillan later this year.         Her highly topical last book, "The Rage to Punish: The Unintended Consequences of Mandatory Sentencing," is on W. W. Norton's list for next month.         Judge Forer is survived by her husband, Morris L. Forer; two sons, Stuart, of Warwick, R.I., and John, of Philadelphia; a daughter, Hope Forer Ross of Manhattan; a sister, Marion Schott of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and two grandsons.         Correction:  May 14, 1994, Saturday         An obituary on Wednesday about Lois G. Forer, author and retired Philadelphia judge, referred incorrectly to the publication of her book "What Every Woman Needs to Know Before (and After) She Gets Involved With Men and Money." The publication, by Macmillan, is not due later this year; it occurred in February.       
         Marchette Chute, a biographer of Shakespeare, Chaucer and Ben Jonson, died on Friday at the Madison Nursing Home in Montclair, N.J. She was 84 and lived at the nursing home.         She died of pneumonia, said Elizabeth Hauser, her niece.         Her best-known book was "Shakespeare of London" (1950), published by E. P. Dutton, which was a best seller and a Book-of-the-Month Club dual selection.         "Miss Chute has had the happy idea of basing her life-sized portrait entirely on contemporary evidence," wrote Harry Levin in The New York Times. "From the facts as we know them, she has pieced together a readable and credible presentation of the man in his time."  Books for Children         She was born in Wayzata, Minn., the daughter of William Chute, a real estate broker, and Edith Mary Pickburn Chute, who had been a nurse in a London hospital. She was privately educated at home and then attended Central High School in Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota.         After writing a series of books of verse for children, Miss Chute wrote her first biography, "Geoffrey Chaucer of England" (1946), an informal survey of Chaucer's life that was well-enough received to encourage her to write about Shakespeare in London.         Among her other books were "An Introduction to Shakespeare" (1951); "Ben Jonson of Westminster" (1953); "Two Gentlemen: The Lives of George Herbert and Robert Herrick" (1959); "The First Liberty: A History of the Right to Vote in America, 1619-1850," and "PEN American Center: A History of the First 50 Years" (1972).         Miss Chute was a president of the PEN American Center, and was elected to the American Academy of the National Institute of Arts and Letters.         In addition to her niece, she is survived by a sister, Mary Chute Smith of Morris Plains, N.J.       
         Rita Webb Smith, a community advocate whose work to rid a neighborhood of drug trafficking gained her national attention, died last Saturday at her home in Harlem. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A lifelong resident of West 143d Street, Mrs. Smith was a social worker and counselor for many years at Harlem Hospital, the Children's Aid Society and, most recently, the Visiting Nurse Service.         Starting with the organization of a preservation group for her street, she helped the police in her precinct to clear a drug-infested neighborhood. Her preservation group was largely credited with the restoration of a 10-block area in Harlem between 138th and 144th Streets.         Her efforts received the attention of national television shows and she recounted her experiences in a book written with Tony Chapelle, "The Woman Who Took Back Her Street" (New Horizon, 1990). It describes her life and her efforts to keep drug dealers and addicts from dominating her surroundings. Making a Difference         Mrs. Smith founded her own agency, the Family Systems for Living Center, to provide individual counseling, classes, referrals and other social services. She also started M.A.N.A. -- Make A Neighborhood Again -- to keep up the restored area; and Project Living With AIDS, which provides counseling for AIDS patients.         Mrs. Smith graduated from Fordham University College at Lincoln Center and Fordham's Graduate School of Social Service. The university made her an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1984 for showing that "even one citizen can make a difference." Her work also drew praise from Mayor Koch and President Reagan.         She is survived by seven daughters and sons: Judy, David, Gladys, Peter, Abena and Ayana, all of Harlem, and Mark, a resident of Spring Valley, N.Y. Also surviving is a sister, Pearl Edwards, of St. John's, Antigua.       
         Natalia Danesi Murray, a publishing executive and book editor in New York from the 1950's through the 1970's, died on Thursday at her son's home in Del Mar, Calif. She was 92.         The cause was heart failure, according to an announcement by the Helen Brann Agency.         Mrs. Murray was the head of the New York office of the Italian publishing house Mondadori in the 1950's. Later, she was the director of the New York office of Rizzoli, another Italian publisher, from the 1960's through the 1970's. She was instrumental in taking the works of American writers to Italian readers.         In 1985, Random House published "Darlinghissima: Letters to a Friend," by Janet Flanner, who, under the pseudonym Genet, wrote the "Letter From Paris" column in The New Yorker. Mrs.Murray, a longtime friend of Miss Flanner, edited the book and added commentary.         Mrs. Murray was born in Rome. In 1924 she married William Murray, the head of the William Morris Agency in New York, and moved to New York. They were divorced in 1936. Mrs. Murray acted on Broadway in the 1930's.         In World War II she helped NBC broadcast a short-wave news program to Italy.         She is survived by her son, William Murray, an author and foreign correspondent, and three grandchildren, all of Del Mar.

         Dr. Janet G. Woititz, a best-selling author, lecturer and counselor to the troubled offspring of alcoholics, died last Thursday at her home in Roseland, N.J. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Woititz's "Adult Children of Alcoholics" offered insights into typical patterns in the families of alcoholics, like lack of self-esteem and difficulty relating to people.         The trade paperback turned into something of a publishing phenomenon. Issued by Health Communications Inc. in 1983, the book won a grass-roots following and made best-seller lists around the country in 1986 and stayed on them for about a year.         An expanded edition appeared in 1990. The book was translated into six foreign languages; the English version alone has sold 1.8 million copies.         Another of her books, "Struggle for Intimacy" (1985), also reached best-seller lists, and has sold 900,000 copies. Doctorate from Rutgers         Dr. Woititz was born in Great Neck, L.I., and graduated from Antioch College. She received an M.A. from Montclair State College, where she became an adjunct professor. Her doctorate in education was granted by Rutgers University in 1976. She taught during the summer at the Rutgers Center for Alcoholic Studies.         She was the founder and president of the Institute for Counseling and Training of West Caldwell, N.J. The institute provides therapeutic counseling for people with family problems, overeating habits and other disorders.         Dr. Woititz's other books include "Healthy Parenting: An Empowering Guide for Adult Children" (1992), "Lifeskills for Adult Children Workbook" (1991), "Healing Your Sexual Self" (1989), "The Self-Sabotage Syndrome: Adult Children in the Workplace" (1989), "Home Away From Home" (1987) and "Marriage on the Rocks" (1986), all in print. She also contributed to academic journals and lectured in this country and abroad.         Dr. Woititz is survived by two sons, David, of West Orange, N.J., and Daniel, of Roseland; a daughter, Lisa Taub of Allentown, N.J.; two grandchildren, and her companion, Bernard Zweben.       
         Mary Anne Devanna, an associate dean at the Columbia University Business School, died on Saturday at her home in Ardsley, N.Y. She was 55.         The cause was leukemia, said Maryann Hedaa, an associate professor at the business school.         Dr. Devanna earned her Ph.D. in human resources management from the Columbia Business School in 1982. Beginning in 1988, she was named a research professor and an associate dean, becoming one of the highest-ranking women at the school.         Previously, she was director of executive education at the school and, earlier, an advertising executive.         She was co-author of the book "The Transformational Leader: Molding Tomorrow's Corporate Winners," published in 1986. She was also the author or co-author of several other books and wrote numerous articles for journals in the human resource management field.         Dr. Devanna was born in Jersey City and received a bachelor's degree from St. John's University in 1960 and a master's degree in business administration from the Columbia Business School in 1974.         She is survived by her husband, Ralph; a son, Joseph R., of Boston; two daughters, Eva M. Grizell of Boston and Nichole Devanna of Ardsley; two grandchildren, and a sister, Barbara Schwab of Mount Laurel, N.J.       
         Joan Haslip, a British author known for her biographies of Marie Antoinette, Empress Elizabeth of Austria and other female blue bloods in history, died on June 19 in Bellosguardo outside Florence. She was 82 and lived in Bellosguardo.         Summing up her career last week, The Times of London said, "As a writer, she had an eye for the romantic, the dramatic, the picturesque."         Miss Haslip's 1988 book, "Marie Antoinette," about the French queen who was beheaded by revolutionaries in 1793, was praised in the United States as fully recognizing the queen's fascination while coolly detailing her many faults.         That work was translated into 10 languages, as was Miss Haslip's 1965 book, "The Lonely Empress: A Biography of Elizabeth of Austria," whose beautiful protagonist was assassinated in 1898. That volume was lauded by one American critic as humane and readable, and also vivid "in conveying the effect of Elizabeth's looks." Recreating Lost Worlds         In an interview late in her life, Miss Haslip, who also wrote well-received biographies of men, said that in a good work of historical biography, "a whole vanished world is brought back to life."         In that interview, she went on to observe about the writing of a biography, "The whole venture follows the pattern of a love affair: initial infatuation, experience, disillusion, friendship, in that order!"         Only one of her books is still in print: "Madame Du Barry: The Wages of Beauty" (Grove-Atlantic, 1992). Her other biographies of women included "Catherine the Great" (1977), "Lucrezia Borgia" (1954) and "Lady Hester Stanhope" (1936). And her biographies of men included "Imperial Adventurer" (1972), about the 19th-century Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, which was a Book-of-the-Month Club choice, and "Parnell" (1937) about Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th-century Irish nationalist leader. She also wrote novels.         Miss Haslip grew up in England and Florence and was privately educated. She was on the staff of The London Mercury, a literary magazine, from 1929 to 1939 and was an editor at the BBC from 1941 to 1945.         She was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.         .       
         Barbara Howell, a feminist novelist and short story writer, died on Tuesday in Lenox Hill Hospital. Ms. Howell, who lived in Manhattan, was 57.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Alan Woltz.         Ms. Howell was the author of the novels "Joy Ride" (Viking, 1989) and "A Mere Formality" (M. Evans, 1984) and the nonfiction book "Don't Bother to Come in on Monday" (St. Martin's, 1973). She also wrote extensively for such magazines as Cosmopolitan and Vogue.         She graduated from Barat College in Lake Forest, Ill., and was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Lille in 1957.         She is survived by her husband and a son, William Leroy, both of Manhattan.         Correction:  June 10, 1994, Friday         An obituary headline on Thursday about Barbara Howell, a novelist and short-story writer, misstated her age. She was 57, not 59.       
         Mary Lasswell, an author whose humorous novels about life in Southern California and Texas were popular in the 1940's and 50's, died on Tuesday in the nursing unit of the Solvang Lutheran Home in Solvang, Calif., where she resided. She was 89.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said her husband, Dr. Dudley Winn Smith, a surgeon.         Her first book, "Suds in Your Eye," published by Houghton Mifflin in 1942, was described as "a crazy, funny story" about three impecunious elderly women. It was unlike most of the novels coming out of Southern California, wrote Beatrice Sherman in The New York Times Book Review on Dec. 13, 1942. A Broadway play in 1944, based on the book, was dramatized by Jack Kirkland.         Among her other books were "High Time" (1944); "Mrs. Rasmussen's Book of One-Arm Cookery" (1946); "Wait for the Wagon" (1951); "I'll Take Texas" (1958); "Let's Go for Broke" (1962), and "Tio Pepe" (1968).         Miss Lasswell, who was born in Glasgow, Scotland, of American parents, on Feb. 8, 1905, grew up in Brownsville, Tex.         She is survived by her husband, who lives in the Solvang Lutheran Home in Solvang, and a brother, Clyde Lubbock of Pensacola, Fla.       
         Alice Childress, an actress and a writer of plays and novels, including "A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich," died on Sunday at Astoria General Hospital in Queens. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Nathan Woodard.         In 1973, in a review of "A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich" in The New York Times, the playwright Ed Bullins wrote: "There are too few books that convince us that reading is one of the supreme gifts of being human. Alice Childress, in her short, brilliant study of a 13-year-old black heroin user, achieves this feat in a masterly way."         In the mid-1970's, the book was at the center of a controversy when a Long Island school district banned it and works by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Langston Hughes and others on the grounds that they contained obscenities and other material considered offensive. Ms. Childress adapted her novel for a 1978 film that starred Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield.         Among her other books were "Rainbow Jordan," "Those Other People," "When the Rattlesnake Sounds," "Let's Hear It for the Queen," "Like One of the Family" and "A Short Walk." 'Wedding Band'         One of her plays was "Wedding Band," an interracial love story set in Charleston, S.C., at the time of World War I. Ms. Childress wrote the play in 1965 but was unable to find a New York producer until the New York Shakespeare Festival presented it in 1972. In a review of a 1979 production of the play, Richard Eder wrote in The Times that the ideas in "Wedding Band" were "like wildflowers growing in their own ground; not, as in works of less art, like cut flowers sorted and offered by the dozen at a florist shop." ABC later produced the play for television, but eight of the network's affiliates declined to carry the show because of its theme and earthy dialogue.         Her other plays included "Florence," "Gold Through the Trees," "Just a Little Simple," "Trouble in Mind," "String" and "Mojo." With Mr. Woodard, she wrote musicals including "Young Martin Luther King," "Sea Island Song," "Gullah" and "Moms (A Praise Play for a Black Comedienne)," about Jackie (Moms) Mabley.         Ms. Childress was born in Charleston on Oct. 12, 1916. Before she turned to writing, she was an actress with the American Negro Theater, and acted in the original company of "Anna Lucasta." At the time of her death, she was working on a novel for young adults about her African great-grandmother, a slave until the age of 12, and her Scotch-Irish great-grandmother.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a granddaughter, Marilyn Alice Lee of Brooklyn.       
         Dr. Marion F. Langer, a former executive director of the American Orthopsychiatric Association and an expert on widowhood, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was cancer, said Karen Kun of the association's staff.         Dr. Langer, who had a Ph.D. in sociology from New York University, was on the boards of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, in Washington, and the National Coalition Against Censorship.         She was the orthopsychiatric association's executive director from 1953 until she retired in 1988. The association, which has its headquarters in Manhattan, was founded in 1924 by Karl Menninger (1893-1990), the psychiatrist, and others to advance a preventive approach to treating mental illness. Orthopsychiatry offers treatment through a collaborative approach involving such fields as psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric social work and other sciences.         Her writings included a book, "Learning to Live as a Widow," published in 1957. In an interview in 1963, she said that widows usually blame their husbands for dying, although that feeling is irrational.         "Unlike the divorcee, who is expected freely to express her resentment toward her former spouse, the widow is not supposed to be angry," Dr. Langer said. As a result, she said, feelings of anger are repressed and affect the widow's social relationships.         Dr. Langer was born and raised in Newburgh, N.Y. and studied at Smith College and elsewhere before receiving her Ph.D. in 1949. She was assistant director of the Child Study Association of America before going to the Orthopsychiatric Association.         Over the years, she taught at City College, New York University, the Hunter College School of Social Work and elsewhere.         She married Julius Rosenberg, a lawyer, in 1940; he died in 1948. Her 1957 marriage, to Samuel Gruber, also a lawyer, ended in divorce in 1973.         Dr. Langer is survived by a son, Seth Rosenberg of Chatham, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Rosa Chacel, a Spanish writer of complex, intellectual novels and poetry, who was in exile during most of the Franco era, died on Wednesday in the Ramon y Cajal Hospital in Madrid. She was 96 and lived in Madrid.         The cause was heart and lung failure, hospital officials said.         An English translation of one of her most widely read novels, "Memoirs of Leticia Valle," won praise when it was published earlier this year by the University of Nebraska Press in a translation by Carol Maier, a professor of Spanish at Kent State University. The work originally appeared in Spanish 49 years ago in Buenos Aires.         Susan Kirkpatrick, a professor of Spanish at the University of California at San Diego, wrote, in the preface to her translation of Miss Chacel's novel "The Maravillas District," which was published in 1992 by the University of Nebraska Press: "Chacel's writing is dense and labyrinthine, but at the same time it is open-ended and dynamic, shaping a narrative design that ends with a query instead of a conclusion."         Miss Chacel (pronounced cha-THELL) was born in Valladolid, in north-central Spain, on June 3, 1898. She studied art in Madrid and spent six years in Rome, where she wrote her first novel, "Season of Departure and Return," which was published in Spain in 1930.         In 1938, as Gen. Francisco Franco drew close to victory in the Spanish Civil War, she fled to South America, where dozens of Spanish intellectuals were in exile. She left Spain largely because her husband, Timoteo Perez Rubio, had been active on the Republican side, and her sympathies were also with the Republic. She spent her 36 years in exile mainly in Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro.         From 1959 to 1961, Miss Chacel was in New York City on a Guggenheim Fellowship and wrote a book of literary and philosophical essays, "Saturnalia," which was published in 1972. Over the years, she wrote more than a dozen books, including novels and volumes of poetry and of essays. She returned to Spain in the early 1970's, not long before Franco's death.         In the weeks before her death, while Miss Chacel was in the hospital, she was awarded Spain's Gold Medal for Fine Arts by King Juan Carlos.         Miss Chacel's husband died in 1977. She is survived by a son, Carlos Perez Chacel.         Correction:  August 4, 1994, Thursday         An obituary on Tuesday about Rosa Chacel, a Spanish novelist, misidentified the author of the English translation of her book "The Maravillas District," published in 1992 by the University of Nebraska Press. It was translated by D. A. Demers, not Susan Kirkpatrick.       
         Valerie Worth Bahlke, a poet and novelist for young readers, died on Sunday at her home in Clinton, N.Y. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Bahlke, who wrote under her maiden name, Valerie Worth, had many interests, from astronomy to gardening to meditation, which became the subject matter she wove into her poetry. She sought to present ordinary things in a fresh way.         She was most widely known for her "small poems" for children, composed in simple free verse. The poet and teacher Myra Cohn Livingston wrote of Ms. Worth's work in The New York Times Book Review in 1988, "The treasures Ms. Worth offers do not lie in some distant, golden land but in the everyday world." For example, of a safety pin, Ms. Worth wrote:         Closed, it sleeps         On its side         Quietly,         The silver         Image         Of some         Small fish;         Opened, it snaps         Its tail out         Like a thin         Shrimp, and looks         At the sharp         Point with a         Surprised eye.         In 1991, the National Council of Teachers of English honored her with its Poetry Award for Excellence in Poetry for Children, given for a body of work.         It was only one of many such citations she garnered over the years. Since the 1950's, her poems have been included in numerous anthologies. She also wrote fiction for adults and young people. 'Small Poems' by the Volume         She was born in Philadelphia and lived in Swarthmore, Pa., Tampa, Fla., and Bangalore, India, when her father, a biologist at Swarthmore College, was asked to go to India to study malaria. She graduated from Swarthmore in 1955.         After settling in Clinton, she joined an informal writing group at Kirkland College and met Natalie Babbitt, an author and illustrator who then furnished the black-and-white drawings for her work, starting with "Small Poems" in 1972. Three more volumes followed, in 1976, 1978 and 1985, and all four appeared in a single paperback in 1987.         Her other books included "The Crone's Book of Words" (1971) and "The Crone's Book of Wisdom" (1988); "Curlicues: The Fortunes of Two Pug Dogs" (1980), and two novels for young adults, "Gypsy Gold" (1983) and "Fox Hill" (1986).         Another book of her verses for children, "At Christmastime," was published two years ago. Much of her work remains in print, and at her death she had completed two more such collections of all-new poems. They are scheduled for publication by HarperCollins in 1995 and 1996.         She is survived by her husband, George W. Bahlke; a son, Conrad D., of Hoboken, N.J.; two daughters, Catherine B. Hornstein of Brooklyn and Margaret B. Diskin of West Chester, Pa.; two brothers, Michael Worth of Swarthmore and Douglas Worth of Newton, Mass., and a granddaughter.       
         Barbara Drew Hoffstot, an architectural and community preservationist, died on Sept. 18 at her Pittsburgh home. She was 75 and also had homes in Palm Beach, Fla.; New Waterford, Ohio, and County Galway, Ireland.         She died after a long illness, The Palm Beach, Fla., Post reported.         At her death, Mrs. Hoffstot was a vice president of the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach and vice chairwoman of the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, two groups that she helped found. She had served as co-chairwoman of Palm Beach's first Landmarks Preservation Commission and had drafted landmarks preservation legislation for that city. She was a former trustee of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.         Her writings included the book "Landmark Architecture of Palm Beach," which was published in 1974 and has been twice revised.         Mrs. Hoffstot, whose family has spent winters in Palm Beach for three generations, was born Barbara S. Drew in Pittsburgh, graduated from the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Conn., and attended Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla.         She is survived by her husband of 46 years, Henry Phipps Hoffstot Jr.; a daughter, Thayer of Westlake Village, Calif.; a son, Henry Phipps 3d of Ligonier, Pa., and New York, and four grandchildren.       
         Margaret Brown Klapthor, an expert on White House history and a former department chairman at the Smithsonian Institution, died on Monday at her home in Washington. She was 72.         The cause was stomach cancer, said a son, Paul Edward Klapthor of Sumter, S.C.         Mrs. Klapthor retired from the Smithsonian in 1983. She first went to work there as a scientific aide in 1943, and rose through the curatorial ranks in its divisions of civil and political history, becoming curator of the Smithsonian's First Ladies collection and chairman of the institution's department of national and military history.         Among her writings is the historical text in "The First Ladies Cook Book: Favorite Recipes of All the Presidents of the United States," an illustrated volume of historical lore and recipes. It was published for Parents' Magazine Press in 1965, and went through several editions.         The book was praised by Craig Claiborne, then the food critic for The New York Times, who called it "perhaps the most comprehensive and detailed volume ever written" about "what American Presidents and their wives have dined on."         It reported, for example, that Ulysses S. Grant personally selected the wines to be served at formal dinners, "though his own glass was usually turned down"; that Chester A. Arthur was an epicure who savored fine wines, and that William McKinley's taste ran to fried potatoes, bacon and eggs, johnnycakes and cherry pie.         Mrs. Klapthor also wrote "First Ladies" (sixth edition 1990, White House Historical Society) and was a co-author, with her father, Paul D. Brown, of "The History of Charles County, Maryland," in 1958.         She gave lectures on White House history that detailed the occupants' idiosyncrasies, like Dolley Madison's conversational icebreaker of reading a passage from whatever book she was carrying at the time.         In the 1950's, when Mrs. Klapthor was in charge of the gowns of White House hostesses, she discovered Dolley Madison's inauguration gown, which had been kept by heirs. She traced it to the William Rockwell Nelson Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and the gallery then sent it to the Smithsonian on indefinite loan.         As associate curator in the division of political history, Mrs. Klapthor assembled a Smithsonian collection of White House china in connection with her creation of First Ladies Hall, a modernized setting for the Smithsonian's First Ladies costume collection.         Sometimes she talked about more recent First Ladies. In 1988, commenting on reports of summit talk tiffs between Nancy Reagan and Raisa M. Gorbachev, the wife of the Soviet leader, Mrs. Klapthor said in an interview in The Times, "It struck me as something that had been manufactured by the press."         Mrs. Klapthor was born in Henderson, Ky., reared in Charles County and graduated from the University of Maryland.         In the last 21 years she suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, and was confined to a wheelchair for the last two years. Her husband, Frank Edward Klapthor, died earlier this year.         Besides her son Paul, she is survived by another son, Carlson Brown Klapthor of Washington; a daughter, Frances Andrews of Baltimore; a sister, Mary Berry Moore of Port Tobacco, Md., and four grandchildren.       
         Joy Ungerleider-Mayerson, a former director of the Jewish Museum in Manhattan and a philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in Larchmont, N.Y. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her son Andrew Ungerleider.         At her death, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was president of the Dorot Foundation, whose interests include biblical archeology and Jewish education. She was also the chairman of the Albright Institute for archeological research in Jerusalem and served on the boards of other cultural and educational institutions. She was the director of the museum, on Fifth Avenue at 92d Street, from 1972 to 1980, after being a curator there from 1967 to 1969.         In 1971, criticized for neglect of its Judaica collection and facing a substantial deficit, the museum's board decided that the institution should devote itself to "a commitment to the Jewish community." The museum was shut during that year, and Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson has been praised as having subsequently rescued it from its doldrums. She shifted the museum's focus from art to Jewish culture, instituting a strong education program and creating popular exhibitions on the subject of Israel and biblical archeology.         As a philanthropist, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was instrumental in providing support, through family foundations, for the New York Public Library. She was the author of one book, "Jewish Folk Art from the Biblical Period to Modern Times" (1986) and the co-author of another, "The Museums of Israel" (Abrams, 1989).         Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson, who was born in Lawrence, L.I., received a B.A. from New York University in 1942 and a master's degree in Hebrew Studies from New York University in 1971. She was married to Samuel Ungerleider in 1945; he died in 1972.         In addition to her sons Andrew, of Los Angeles, and Peter, of Manhattan, she is survived by another son, Dr. Steven Ungerleider of Eugene, Ore.; three daughters, Jeane Ungerleider-Springer of Boston, Miriam Mayerson-Michael of Manhattan and Clare Benac-Mayerson of Paris; two sisters, Celeste G. Bartos of Manhattan and Miriam G. Wallach of Scarsdale, N.Y., and seven grandchildren       
         Sister Parish, the acclaimed and enduring American interior decorator who began her career when she was a young Depression-era mother and later came to redesign rooms of the White House during the Kennedy Administration, died on Thursday at her home in Dark Harbor, Maine. She was 84 and also had a home in New York City.         She had suffered a lengthy illness, said Dorothy B. Gilbert, one of her daughters.         Mrs. Parish's six decades of decorating epitomized the rise of women in her own and other professions in 20th-century America. The one-room business she founded in 1933 in Far Hills, N.J., evolved into the noted decorating firm of Parish-Hadley Associates, based in Manhattan, whose designs consistently exuded quality.         The anxious 23-year-old of 1933 -- whose nursery nickname had replaced her seldom-used given name, Dorothy -- went on to become a force in forming and articulating tastes in interior design. Vogue magazine once said she was "the most famous of all living women interior designers, whose ideas have influenced life styles all over America." 'Patrician Aplomb'         John Richardson, an art historian, wrote in 1989, "No one else in America does a room with such patrician aplomb, such life-enhancing charm, such a lack of gimmickry or trendiness."         With a profile that seemed carved from the Maine coastline, her longtime home and design influence, Mrs. Parish was a strong traditionalist. "What seems important to me is permanence, comfort and a look of continuity in the design and decoration of a house," she once observed. "The happiest times of my life are associated with beautiful, familiar things and family."         She and her firm became known for the low-keyed handsomeness of their work and for their well-heeled and relatively conservative clientele. It included President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy; the philanthropists Brooke Astor and Enid Annenberg Haupt; William S. Paley, the chairman of CBS, and members of the Bronfman, Getty, Mellon, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney clans.         In 1988, one of Queen Elizabeth II's daughters-in-law, the Duchess of York, asked the firm to design the interior of the ducal couple's new house near Windsor Castle. But the assignment was eventually switched to a British designer, and the British press reported that the Queen thought the Americans' plans were too expensive. Still Working in Her 80's         Mrs. Parish stayed on as a partner in the firm into her 80's, proving to be a notably durable member of a pioneer cohort of American women who came to prominence as interior decorators between the two world wars.         Mrs. Parish is widely considered to have originated, in the 1960's, the decorating idiom that became known as American country style: she was an early and influential champion of the humble striped cloth called mattress ticking, which had traditionally covered mattresses, using it for slipcovers and on throw pillows.         She saw no conflict between innovation and traditionalism. As she wrote in HG magazine in 1990, "Years ago, my partner, Albert Hadley, and I were delighted when patchwork quilts, four-poster beds, painted floors, knitted throws, rag rugs and hand-woven bedsteads were first listed among the 'innovations' of our firm."         "The list sounds old-fashioned, and no decorator wants to be that," she continued, "but Albert and I understood that innovation is often the ability to reach into the past and bring back what is good, what is beautiful, what is lasting." Father Collected Antiques         Mrs. Parish's own girlhood was, if not regal, at least baronial. She was born Dorothy May Kinnicutt in July 15, 1910, in Morristown, N.J., the daughter of G. Hermann Kinnicutt and the former May Appleton Tuckerman, who had homes in Manhattan, Maine and Paris, as well as New Jersey.         Mrs. Parish's father was a collector of antiques (as was a cousin, Dorothy Draper, who also became a renowned decorator). Much later she would recall the distaste she felt as a child for the furniture her father collected, "that awful English brown," as she put it.         As a teen-ager, she saw painted French furniture in Paris -- and experienced a revelation.         She went to the Chapin School in Manhattan and to the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., made her debut and was married to Mr. Parish in 1930 in Manhattan with, as The New York Times reported at the time, "a representative gathering of old New York families on hand." Decorating a Farmhouse         After her marriage, she and her husband had a home on East End Avenue in Manhattan -- which had been done by a decorator -- and a farmhouse in Far Hills, N.J., which Mrs. Parish herself decorated, with gusto.         Her handiwork was admired, friends began coming to her for help with decorating, and she later confidently recalled that "it never occurred to me that I wasn't qualified to give it."         It was four years after the Wall Street crash of 1929 that Mrs. Parish, who had never received a high school diploma, opened her first office. Hard times were coming upon her husband and her father, both blue-blooded stockbrokers. She called her business "Mrs. Henry Parish 2d Interiors" and placed it in Far Hills.         The success that followed was fueled by her taste, talent and strength of will. Mr. Hadley, who joined forces with her in 1962, said in 1991 that "Sis always knows when a room is right and a room is not." She was famed for creating a homey "undecorated look."  'Money, Big Money'         In some ways, Mrs. Parish's rise was made easier by her upper-crust roots, and her earliest work was decorating the houses of friends.         Decorating by Mrs. Parish and her firm also acquired a reputation for being expensive. The New York Times columnist Charlotte Curtis wrote in 1985 that Parish-Hadley work "costs money, big money."         But Mrs. Parish also had an economical streak. In the mid-1960's, she acquired a batch of turn-of-the-century golden oak furniture at a bargain basement price, the story goes, then painted it white and used it in decorating a house that she and her husband had bought in Maine.         As the design editor Elaine Greene wrote later in The New York Times, "when shown in the January 1967 issue of House & Garden, the house dazzled decorators the way Christian Dior's 1947 New Look did the fashion world."         The white furniture and other furnishings in the house -- including soft-hued chintz, needlework, hand-crafted cotton rugs and paintings of dogs -- became staples of the style. Decorating for the Kennedys         Mrs. Parish met Jacqueline Kennedy socially in the late 1950's and helped her decorate the house in the Georgetown section of Washington where she and her husband, John F. Kennedy, lived while he was a Senator. After Mr. Kennedy was elected President, his wife made Mrs. Parish a consultant in her redecorating of the White House.         Mrs. Kennedy also named her to a committee that was formed to help furnish the White House with authentic pieces from a century and a half earlier.         Speaking of Mrs. Kennedy's plans for redoing the family quarters in the building, Mrs. Parish said early in 1961 that the nation's new First Lady was a person of "simple tastes who wants to create a home."         The walls of the family quarters were done in pastel tones -- the private drawing room was eventually done in yellow and white.         In the years since, there have been persistent reports that Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Parish -- who could be blunt and acerbic -- had a falling-out over the White House. As Town & Country magazine recounted it in 1988, the First Lady "fired Sister for telling little Caroline to keep her feet off the upholstery. Sister would later describe the experience in explicit, harsh terms."         But Mrs. Parish could go to enormous lengths to please a client. Sally Bedell Smith wrote in her 1990 book "In All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley" that in a single bedroom Mrs. Parish and Mr. Hadley did in the 1960's in Mr. Paley's Fifth Avenue duplex, "a painter worked for five months applying 18 coats of paint -- six different shadings just for the base, plus glazing."         Mr. Parish died in 1977, having spent 34 years with the Wall Street securities firm of Loeb Rhoades & Company.         Mrs. Parish is survived by her daughters, Mrs. Gilbert of Hot Springs, Ark., and May Appleton Bartlett of Boston; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Deborah Norden, an administrator for the New York State Council on the Arts, died on Thursday in the USAir plane crash. She was 40 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Norden was also an architect and worked for the firms of Paul Segal, Richard Dattner and Charles Boxenbaum in New York City before joining the arts council in 1985.         She wrote about architecture for magazines and edited a book, "Reweaving the Urban Fabric" (Princeton Architectural Press, 1988). Most recently she had been working on a book about the architect Fay Jones.         She was born in Manhattan and grew up in Hartsdale, N.Y. She graduated from Brown University in 1976 and earned a master's degree in architecture from Princeton University. During the 1991-92 school year, she was a Loeb Fellow at Harvard University.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Barry Magid; her parents, Peter and Ruth Norden, of Hartsdale; a sister, Linda Norden, of Manhattan, and a grandmother, Margaret Norden, of Forest Hills, Queens.       
         Amy Clampitt, known for her dense, ornate and allusive poetry, died on Saturday at her home in Lenox, Mass. She was 74 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Anne Close, her editor at Alfred A. Knopf.         Ms. Clampitt published her first full-length book of poetry, "The Kingfisher," when she was 63. It was a delayed but auspicious beginning. Richard Tillinghast, in The New York Times Book Review, wrote that the author "immediately merits consideration as one of our most distinguished contemporary poets." The work, which challenged readers with long strings of dependent clauses, an often obscure vocabulary and arcane literary allusions, ran counter to the prevailing taste for pared-down, plain speech. Instead, she offered "baroque profusion, the romance of the adjective, labyrinthine syntax, a festival lexicon," the poet Alfred Corn wrote in a review.         Ms. Clampitt was born in New Providence, Iowa, and grew up on a 125-acre farm. After earning a bachelor's degree with honors in English at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, in 1941 she studied at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research.         She worked as a secretary and a writer at Oxford University Press from 1943 to 1951 and as reference librarian at the National Audubon Society from 1952 to 1959. Through the 1960's and most of the 70's, she was a freelance writer, editor and researcher. From 1977 to 1982 she was an editor at E. P. Dutton. Initially Self-Published         In college, Ms. Clampitt succumbed to the spell of Gerard Manley Hopkins, but she wrote little poetry at the time. In the 1950's, she made unsuccessful stabs at novel writing. It was not until the 60's that she began writing poetry in earnest, initially without success. In 1974, at her own expense, she published a poetry chapbook, "Multitudes, Multitudes." The work caught the eye of Howard Moss, the poetry editor of The New Yorker, who began publishing Ms. Clampitt regularly. In 1981, a second small collection, "The Isthmus," was published.         "The Kingfisher," published in 1983 by Alfred A. Knopf, immediately pushed its author to the front ranks of American poets. Organized around the elements earth, air, fire and water, it treated subjects as various as the plants and marine life of New England, John Lennon's murder, the Holocaust and the Vietnam War.         Comparing Ms. Clampitt to Hopkins, Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop, critics noted her pinpoint descriptions of the natural world that led to unexpected metaphysical insights and conclusions. She once referred to herself as "a poet of place," a characterization that she later revised to "a poet of displacement." From Life and Myth         "What the Light Was Like" (1985, Knopf) solidified its author's reputation. Like "The Kingfisher," it began with several poems about the New England coast, notably the book's title poem, an elegy for a drowned lobsterman.         In "Archaic Figure" (1987, Knopf), inspired in part by the author's travels in Greece, Ms. Clampitt used Greek myth to explore what Virginia Woolf called "the ancient consciousness of women." Her other major collections were "Westward" (1990, Knopf) and "A Silence Opens" (1994, Knopf).         She also published an essay collection, "Predecessors, et Cetera" (1991, University of Michigan Press) and edited "The Essential Donne" (1988, Ecco Press).         Ms. Clampitt received a fellowship award for distinguished poetic achievement from the Academy of American Poets in 1982 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1992. She was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.         She is survived by her husband, Harold L. Korn; two brothers, Lawrence, of Brunswick, Me., and Philip, of Auburn Hills, Mich., and a sister, Beth, of Carlisle, Iowa.       
         Faith Cardwell Davis, who with her sisters Hope Cardwell Brock and Charity Cardwell Lawson had been listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest complete set of triplets, died on Sunday at Rolling Plains Memorial Hospital in Sweetwater, Tex. She was 95.         The cause of death was believed to be a heart attack, said Dan McCoy, director of McCoy Funeral Home in Sweetwater.         The three sisters had lived together for more than a decade at a nursing home in Sweetwater, a small city on the plains of West Texas.         Several experts on multiple births said that when the Cardwell sisters turned 95 last May, they were the first set of triplets on record to reach that age.         Mrs. Davis had owned and operated the Silver Spur diner in Roby, Tex., for 25 years before moving to nearby Sweetwater in the early 1980's.         Her husband, J. P. Davis, whom she married in 1920, died in 1980, and her son, James, died in 1986. She is survived by her sisters; two granddaughters, and three great-grandsons.       
         Martha Raye, the big-mouthed, big-hearted entertainer whose career spanned the decades from vaudeville to videos, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         In recent years, she had suffered a serious of ailments, including a stroke and circulatory difficulties. Ron Wise, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai, said, "Her death was an aggregate of that and other problems."         Miss Raye sang, she danced, she acted on Broadway, in Hollywood and on television, but the knockabout comic won perhaps her greatest renown as an indefatigable trouper who traveled thousands of miles through three wars to lift the morale of America's fighting forces.         "They ask so little and give so much," she said during the Vietnam War. "The least we can do back home here is give them the love, the respect and the dignity that they, our flag and our country deserve."         Her real name was Margie Yvonne Reed. She was born on Aug. 27, 1916, into a show-business family in the charity ward of a hospital in Butte, Mont. Her father and mother, Pete Reed and the former Peggy Hooper, were Irish immigrants whose song-and-dance routine, under the name Reed and Hooper, took them to carnivals and vaudeville houses around the United States.         "I didn't work until I was 3," Miss Raye was to say years later. "But after that, I never stopped."         Her mother taught her to read and write while the family, which also included her sister and brother, crisscrossed the country. From time to time, she attended schools in Montana, Chicago and New York.         "Our home was in an old, broken down Pierce Arrow auto which my father drove," Miss Raye remembered. "We put the scenery in the back seat and that was where we slept at night. We cooked on Sterno. And we went from town to town, looking for bookings."         She played burlesque houses, nightclubs and saloons, where she said she worked for tips only. "On a good night, I made a dollar," she said. "On a bad one, 25 cents."         At 15, she was singing, dancing and clowning in a children's act. She picked the name Martha Raye from a phone book and piled up the credits. She was a member of the Benny Davis Revue and the Ben Blue Company, a trouper on the Loew's vaudeville circuit, a member of the Will Morrisey act and a feature performer in "Earl Carroll's Sketchbook" and "Calling All Stars."         Eventually she made her way to Hollywood. And on one of the Sunday nights when stars gathered and entertained one another at the Trocadero nightclub, she got a couple of her friends to play straightmen to her comedy. Their names were Jimmy Durante and Joe E. Lewis. The producer Norman Taurog saw her perform, and the next day she was working with Bing Crosby on the 1936 film "Rhythm on the Range." She did a slapstick drunk scene and sang a song called "Mr. Paganini," and became a star overnight.         Miss Raye appeared in films like "Waikiki Wedding," "College Holiday," "Give Me a Sailor," "Keep 'em Flying" and "Hellzapoppin." In 1940, she starred on Broadway opposite Al Jolson in the revue "Hold Onto Your Hats." She appeared on his radio show and the programs of Eddie Cantor and Bob Hope.         During World War II, she began entertaining troops, and the 1944 film "Four Jills in a Jeep" was based on a U.S.O. tour of bases in England and Africa she made in the company of Kay Francis, Carole Landis and Mitzi Mayfair.         In 1969, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Miss Raye the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her wartime efforts, and she was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993.         She was not happy about her Hollywood career, except for "Monsieur Verdoux," Charlie Chaplin's controversial 1947 black comedy about a Parisian Bluebeard who marries and kills for money. "I must have made 35 or 40 movies and most of them were mindless," Miss Raye said. "But in those days actors didn't fight the system; then we thought we were lucky to be under contract."         Her performance in "Verdoux," in which she portrayed Annabella Bonheur, a raucous, indestructible wife of the killer, was praised as brilliant by Bosley Crowther of The New York Times. "Do you know," she recalled in 1972, "that when Chaplin called to offer me the part, I hung up on him; I thought it was a joke."         She blamed her decline in Hollywood on executives who focused on her shapely legs and ability to fill out a sweater. "They tried to make a glamour girl out of me," the brown-haired, blue-eyed actress complained. "Let's face it, I'm not a glamour girl. I'm a clown."         Despite her setbacks in Hollywood, she was far from finished. Milton Berle gave her a start in television, and by 1954, she was the medium's reigning female comedian. Ahead of her was more success in nightclubs, cabaret and theater.         Offstage, life was darker. "As an entertainer, she's a genius," one of her colleagues once said. "Socially, she's completely unsure of herself."         She married again and again. Among her husbands were the makeup artist Buddy Westmore, the composer David Rose, the businessman Neal Lang, the dancers Nick Condos and Edward Begley and the policeman Robert O'Shea. Her last marriage was in 1991, to 42-year-old Mark Harris, her manager.         She had a daughter, Melody, by Mr. Condos. After Miss Raye suffered a stroke in 1991, she and Melody battled in court over control of the actress's money. In July 1992, Miss Raye filed a lawsuit alleging that the 1991 Bette Midler-James Caan film "For the Boys" wrongfully appropriated her life story. A judge dismissed the $5 million complaint earlier this year.         In her later years, many people knew Miss Raye as the star of Polident commercials.         She is survived by her husband and her daughter.       
         Joan Kahn, a book editor whose imprint was a hallmark of suspense stories for many years, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Miss Kahn edited hundreds of suspense novels and her imprint, "A Joan Kahn Book," represented excellence for discriminating mystery lovers. She started the Harper Novels of Suspense during her 34-year career at Harper & Row, and also edited books for Ticknor & Fields, Dutton and St. Martin's Press, from which she retired in 1989.         Through the years, she signed such writers as Dorothy L. Sayers, Dick Francis, Patricia Highsmith, Michael Gilbert, Julian Symons and John Creasey. After Tony Hillerman showed the manuscript of his first novel to his agent at the time, the agent advised him to stick to nonfiction. But it caught the eye of Miss Kahn, then at Harper & Row, which published the book in 1970 as "The Blessing Way."         "She wouldn't discuss the book with me until I had finished it to my satisfaction, then it was open season," Mr. Hillerman recalled yesterday. "But if we disagreed, she'd let me win the argument. She taught me a great deal about writing and was a wonderful woman."         Miss Kahn was born on April 13, 1914, in New York City and attended the Horace Mann School, the Yale School of Art, Barnard College and the Art Students League. She began her career at Harper Brothers in 1946, editing books about history, art, theater and travel, in addition to suspense novels. She wrote two novels -- "To Meet Miss Long" (1943) and "Open House" (1946) -- and four children's books, and edited 11 mystery anthologies.         In 1985, she received the Ellery Queen Award from the Mystery Writers of America for lifetime service to the industry. On her retirement, she received a special Edgar Allan Poe Award from the association for her distinguished career in the publishing of mystery fiction.         She is survived by a sister, Olivia, of Manhattan, and three nephews, Ely J. Kahn 3d of Cohasset, Mass.; Joseph P. Kahn of Sudbury, Mass., and Hamilton R. Kahn of Wellfleet, Mass.       
         Elizabeth George Speare, an author of historical novels for children, died yesterday in Northwest General Hospital in Tucson, Ariz. She was 84.         The cause was an aortic aneurysm, her family said.         Beginning in 1957 with "Calico Captive," Mrs. Speare wrote a string of novels that soon became familiar to thousands of American schoolchildren. Two of her early works, "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" (1958) and "The Bronze Bow" (1961), were awarded the Newbery Medal by the American Library Association.         Among her other novels were "Life in Colonial America" (1964) and "The Prospering" (1967).         Mrs. Speare's last book, "The Sign of the Beaver" (1983), also won the Newbery Medal, as well as the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction.         In 1989, Mrs. Speare was awarded the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal for her "distinguished, enduring contribution to children's literature." The award cited her "vitality and energy, grace of writing, historical accuracy, and tremendous feeling for place and character."         Her novels have continued to be required reading in classrooms across the country. Her subjects ranged from a boy heroically trying to drive the Romans from Israel to another boy's efforts to survive alone in the wilderness of colonial Maine.         "I have chosen to write historical novels, chiefly, I think, because I enjoy sharing with young people my own ever-fresh astonishment at finding that men and women and boys and girls who lived through the great events of the past were exactly like ourselves, and that they faced every day the same choices, large and small, which daily confront us," she wrote in the New York Times Book Review in 1961.         Mrs. Speare was born in 1908 and reared in Melrose, Mass. She attended Smith College and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Boston University.         She wrote a number of magazine articles and two one-act plays before winning her first award in 1957 with the publication of "Calico Captive," the story of a young woman in 1794 who was carried away to Canada after an Indian raid.         Mrs. Speare is survived by her husband, Alden, and a daughter, Mary Elizabeth Carey of Shaker Heights, Ohio.         Correction:  November 18, 1994, Friday         An obituary on Wednesday about Elizabeth George Speare, an author of historical novels for children, misidentified an award received by her last book, "The Sign of the Beaver" (1983). It was a Newbery Honor Medal from the American Library Association, not a Newbery Medal. The association awarded its top honor, the Newbery Medal, to two of Mrs. Speare's other books.       
         Janet Ahlberg, who created the illustrations for a series of memorable children's books written by her husband, Allan, died on Tuesday in Leicester, England. She was 50.         The cause was cancer, said a statement from the Ahlbergs' publisher, Little, Brown & Company.         Together, Mrs. Ahlberg and her husband produced more than 40 books for young readers. Their first effort, "The Brick Street Boys," appeared in 1975 and was followed by, among others, "Burglar Bill," "Each Peach Pear Plum," "Funnybones," "Peepo!" and "The Baby's Catalogue."         "The Jolly Postman," published in 1986, was highly successful. The rhyming story featured a mailman on a bicycle who delivers letters to familiar fairy tale characters. Inside the book were envelopes with amusing surprises, including a letter of apology from Goldilocks to the Three Bears. "The Jolly Postman" sold more than a million copies and was followed in 1991 by "The Jolly Christmas Postman."         In The New York Times Book Review, Daniel Menaker praised the sequel as "a mild, sweet, amusing book" and said "the authors have taken the secrets of the first book's popularity -- cleverness, detail, surprise and humor -- and amplified them."         Mrs. Ahlberg had completed work on a third volume, "Jolly Pocket Postman," which is to be published next fall by Little, Brown.         She is survived by her husband and a daughter, Jessica.       
         Evelyn Anderson, believed to be the last surviving member of the troupe that danced with Josephine Baker in "La Revue Negre" in Paris in the 1920's, died on Oct. 29 at Misericordia Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 87.         The cause was pneumonia, her family said.         Miss Anderson was 18 and had worked as a dancer in several shows produced by Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake when she was recruited to join a revue, as yet unnamed, going to Paris.         The troupe was formed by a wealthy Chicago woman, Caroline Dudley, who had backed other shows featuring black artists. The star of the revue was to have been a singer and dancer named Maude de Forest. Miss Baker came to the fore when an artist named Paul Colin featured her in a now-famous poster for the show, which the French producers decided to call "La Revue Negre." The show became an instant success and made Miss Baker an international star.         The revue was scheduled to go to Berlin and Moscow after the Paris engagement, but when Miss Baker broke her contract and went to the Folies Bergere, the company broke up. Miss Anderson was among those who chose to remain in Europe, and for the next 15 years she performed in revues and night clubs on the Continent.         When World War II broke out, she was working in the Netherlands, dancing in a cabaret in The Hague, according to Jean-Claude Baker's book about his adoptive mother, "Josephine: The Hungry Heart." When the Germans conquered the Netherlands, they deported her, her partner Harry Watkins and several of her friends.         They were interned first in the Netherlands and later moved to a camp in Germany. In 1943, they were released in a prisoner exchange and made their way back to the United States. In 1944, Miss Anderson married Robert Robbins, an orchestra leader in the Philadelphia area.         She is survived by two brothers, John and Thomas Anderson.       
         Viola Spolin, who as a teacher and author was an inspiration for the improvisational theater movement, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 88.         Her sister, Beatrice Lees, said Mrs. Spolin had three strokes in recent years.         Through her theater games and her book "Improvisations for the Theater" as well as the subsequent work of her son Paul Sills at the Compass and Second City in Chicago and with Story Theater, Mrs. Spolin influenced several generations of actors and directors, including Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Alan Arkin, Severn Darden, Barbara Harris, Anthony Holland, Paul Sand and Avery Schreiber. Although she did not have a career as a professional director, her guidance as a vital and highly demonstrative teacher was to indispensable as actors increasingly responded to the idea of improv.         Various comic techniques came later, but she was a primary source of the practical mechanics of theater games, exercises designed to free actors. Explaining her approach, she once said, "My vision is a world of accessible intuition." Mr. Sills said his mother wanted "to help players hit their intuition" and become more spontaneous.         Most of Mrs. Spolin's theater work was with children. She was born in Chicago, where she trained with Neva Boyd, an educator who used games to help children adjust to life in the city. Mrs. Spolin added the idea of theater games, exercises that led to role-playing. Later she worked for the W.P.A. When Mr. Sills joined David Shepherd in creating the Compass improvisational theater, his mother's games became part of the work process.         Since 1945 Mrs. Spolin had lived in Los Angeles, where she founded the Young Actors Company, which is both a school and theater. She retired in 1980. "Improvisations for the Theater," her best-known book (published by Northwestern University Press) remains a standard theatrical text.         In addition to her sister, of New York City, and her son Paul, of Baileys Harbor, Wis., she is survived by her third husband, Robert Kolmus Greene; another son, William Sills of Oakland, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Frances T. Freeman Jalet-Cruz, a legal-aid lawyer who fought for more humane conditions in the Texas prison system, died on Tuesday at St. Joseph's Manor in Trumbull, Conn. She was 84.         She had suffered a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Jalet (pronounced ja-LAY) was trained in international law but spent much of her career defending prisoners and the indigent. In Texas, newspapers came to label her "St. Frances of Houston" and "Portia of the Poor."         She arrived in the state in 1967 fresh from a course in poverty law at the University of Pennsylvania -- 57 years old and a white-haired mother of five grown children. Supported by a fellowship, she joined the Legal Aid and Defender Society of Travis County in Austin to defend the poor.         A newspaper article about her prompted a Mexican-American inmate and jailhouse lawyer named Fred Arispe Cruz to call her for assistance in appealing his robbery conviction. Hearing of inmates' complaints about what she considered harsh and often illegal treatment from the Texas Department of Corrections, she mounted a campaign on behalf of the prisoners.         She was in the thick of a stormy debate and bitter, costly litigation in the state's prison system in the 1960's and 1970's. She also caused a sensation in 1972 when, at the age of 61, she married Mr. Cruz, 32, after his release from prison. The marriage lasted six years.         The attention eventually led to a broader movement focusing on prison reform, and in the 1980's the Federal courts ordered sweeping changes in prisons statewide.         Her exploits and battle were chronicled in "Texas Prisons: The Walls Came Tumbling Down," by Steve J. Martin and Sheldon Ekland-Olson (Texas Monthly Press, 1987). The book's dedication cited "her unwavering belief in the rule of law."         She was born in Boston and graduated from Radcliffe College before earning advanced degrees at Columbia University Law School, Teachers College and Georgetown Law Center. She worked for the American Association of University Women and in various legal positions in Washington before moving to Texas.         Mrs. Jalet is survived by a son, Tuckerman S. Jalet of Westport, Conn.; four daughters, Jacqueline J. Gordon of Greenwich, Conn., Vanessa Jalet-Stanescu of Manhattan, Roberta J. Kurland of State College, Pa., and Frances Jalet-Miller of Queens, and eight grandchildren.       
         Helen U. Phillips, a sociologist who researched group theory as a means to helping people solve their problems, died on Dec. 3 in the Broomall Presbyterian Nursing Home in Broomall, Pa, a Philadelphia suburb. She was 92.         The cause was heart failure, said the University of Pennsylvania, where Dr. Phillips became a professor emeritus in 1967.         She began her lifelong study of the emerging field of social group work when she worked at a Minneapolis settlement house in the mid-1920's. There she began to see how being a member of a group empowered individuals and helped them solve problems with a minimum of supervision.         Her ground-breaking book, "Essentials of Social Group Work Skill" (University of Pennsylvania, 1973), was used to train students in social work for many years.         Born in Jamestown, N.D., she earned a bachelor's degree at Oberlin College and a master's from Western Reserve University. She taught at the University of Minnesota before joining the University of Pennsylvania, where she received a doctorate in sociology in 1956.         She is survived by a sister, Florence Pollack of Athens, Ga.       
         Elizabeth Glaser, who waged a tireless campaign to draw attention to pediatric AIDS after she unknowingly passed the disease on to her daughter and son, died yesterday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said Josh Baran, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Glaser, the wife of Paul Michael Glaser, a director and actor who starred in the "Starsky and Hutch" television series, was one of several public figures to bring AIDS to the forefront of the 1992 Presidential campaign. She had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion in 1981.         Thousands of delegates, dignitaries and guests stood frozen in place at the Democratic National Convention in New York City as she told of the death of her 7-year-old daughter, Ariel, in 1988 from AIDS.         "She taught me to love when all I wanted to do was hate," Mrs. Glaser said. "She taught me to help others when all I wanted to do was help myself."         In a statement yesterday, President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, said they were deeply saddened by her death. "Elizabeth confronted the challenge of AIDS in her own life and lost her beloved daughter to AIDS at a time when our Government and our country were too indifferent to this illness and the people who had it," he said.         Mrs. Glaser, a former teacher, was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus when she was nine months pregnant with Ariel, her first child. She began bleeding and was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she received seven pints of blood in a transfusion.         The baby was delivered successfully but four years later, became seriously ill. Hospital tests found her red blood count low, and she was later tested with the other members of the family for H.I.V.         Mrs. Glaser tested positive, and doctors found she had passed the virus to Ariel through her breast milk. She had also given the virus to her son, Jake, during pregnancy. Mr. Glaser remained uninfected.         Jake, now 10, has shown no signs that he has developed AIDS.         In 1988, drawing on connections made through her husband, Mrs. Glaser helped to found the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with two friends, Susan DeLaurentis and Susan Zeegen.         The foundation, working out of a donated room with 14 desks and 12 employees, has raised more than $30 million for pediatric education and research, much of it for the Ariel Project, which is searching for ways to block transmission of AIDS from a mother to her fetus.         The foundation is also studying why some children infected with H.I.V. live longer than others.         After she and her husband first described the family's fight with the virus in a magazine story in 1989, Mrs. Glaser became a public crusader for more Government involvement in AIDS research and prevention. She appeared on "60 Minutes" and on the cover of People magazine. She also testified before Congress.         In 1991, she wrote an autobiography, "In The Absence of Angels" (G. P. Putnam's Sons), with Laura Palmer, describing her frustration with the dearth of information on children suffering from AIDS. The book, which was called "a handbook on how the connected make waves in America" in a review in The New York Times, also detailed how she was able to mobilize legislators like Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who sponsored a benefit in Washington for Mrs. Glaser's fledgling foundation.         While she used her celebrity status to further her work, she also promoted her cause through sheer force of will. She was chosen to speak at the 1992 convention only after confronting Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, Mickey Kantor, now the United States Trade Representative, at a Los Angeles picnic, and telling him, "I have words inside me that I have to share."         Elizabeth Glaser was born in New York City and raised in Hewlett Harbor, L.I. She was educated at the University of Wisconsin and at Boston University and worked as a teacher and as a director at the Los Angeles Children's Museum.         She is survived by her husband and son; by her parents, Edith and Max Meyer of Sarasota, Fla., and by a brother, Peter, of Worcester, Mass.

         Janet Oppenheim, a historian on aspects of 19th-century British life like psychological depression, the condition of women and sex roles and stereotypes, died on Friday at Bryn Mawr Hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 46 and lived in Villanova, Pa.         The cause was cancer, said her mother, Elaine Oppenheim.         At her death, Dr. Oppenheim was a professor of history at American University in Washington, where she had taught since 1975.         Her latest book is "Shattered Nerves: Doctors, Patients and Depression in Victorian England" (Oxford, 1991). Praising the work in The New Republic, the author Alfred Kazin wrote, "The scholarship is remarkably full, meticulous and far-reaching." And the Stanford University historian Peter Stansky called it "a fascinating study" that "tells us much about the age itself, its preoccupations and obsessions."         In a 1987 interview, Professor Oppenheim said some feminist historians had suggested that Victorian women had been especially prone to mental and emotional illness because of the confining nature of their lives. But, she said, "for every woman who collapsed in such an illness, there were scores, maybe even hundreds, who soldiered on against the same restrictions and the same limitations on their lives."         Among Professor Oppenheim's other books was "The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914" (Cambridge, 1985), which the journal Victorian Studies called "a major contribution to the history of ideas."         Courses that Professor Oppenheim taught at American University included "Men and Women in Victorian Culture: Gender Roles and Stereotypes" and "Selected Topics on the Condition of Women in Victorian England." She was a visiting professor at Princeton University in 1979 and Bryn Mawr College in 1986, and a Guggenheim Fellow in 1988.         Professor Oppenheim was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Brearley School there and, in 1970, from Bryn Mawr College, where she was summa cum laude. She received a Ph.D. in history from Columbia University in 1975.         In addition to her mother, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, John Salmon, a retired Bryn Mawr history professor; a daughter by a previous marriage, Ashley Minihan of Villanova, and a sister, Barbara Berresford of Manhattan.
