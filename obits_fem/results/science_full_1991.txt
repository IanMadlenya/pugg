         Dr. Harriet M. Griffin, who taught mathematics at the City College of New York for 36 years before retiring in 1966, died on Jan. 13 at Kimball Medical Center in Lakewood, N.J. She was 87 years old and had lived in Lakewood since her retirement.         She died of heart failure, said a spokesman for the D'Elia Funeral Home in Lakewood.         Dr. Griffin was born in Brooklyn, was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Hunter College, and held a master's degree from Columbia and a doctorate from New York University. She taught at Hunter College for four years before joining the City College faculty, where she rose to a full professorship.         She wrote several mathematics texts and was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.         Dr. Griffin is survived by two cousins, Virginia Walsh of Toms River, N.J., and Elizabeth Pirro of Red Bank, N.J.       
         Cipe Pineles Burtin, who broke the sex barrier at the Art Directors Club of New York by becoming a member in 1943 and went on to become the first woman inducted into its Hall of Fame, died on Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. She was 82 years old and lived in Stony Point, N.Y.         Mrs. Burtin, who worked under the name Cipe Pineles (pronounced seep pin-ELL-iss), suffered from chronic kidney disease and died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She was the former head of publication design at the Parsons School of Design and a former art director of British Vogue, Seventeen, Charm and Mademoiselle magazines.         In 1943, she became the first woman to join the Art Directors Club of New York and was inducted into the club's Hall of Fame in 1975 -- the only woman inducted until last year.         In 1967 she became design consultant to Lincoln Center and a member of the faculty at Parsons.         She was a member of the visiting committee for the Harvard University Graduate School of Design and a former board member of the American Institute of Graphic Arts. She was also a former Andrew Mellon Professor at Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.         She was born in Vienna and came to the United States at the age of 13. She attended Bay Ridge High School in Brooklyn and won a Tiffany Foundation Scholarship to Pratt Institute. In 1932 she became assistant to M.F. Agha, the art director of Conde Nast.         Twice widowed, Mrs. Burtin is survived by a son, Thomas Pineles Golden of Stony Point, N.Y.; a daughter, Carol Burtin Fripp of Toronto, and two grandchildren.       
         LuEsther T. Mertz, a general partner in Publishers Clearing House who was known for her extensive philanthropy on behalf of the arts and other causes, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 85 years old and lived in Port Washington, L.I.         She had had several strokes in recent weeks, said her lawyer, William B. O'Connor.         Mrs. Mertz became a general partner in Publishers Clearing House, the magazine-subscription business, soon after its founding in 1953 by her husband, Harold E. Mertz, and their daughter, Joyce Mertz Gilmore. She and her husband were later divorced.         She was the chairman of Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival from 1973 to 1987 and underwrote moving several of its productions from the Public Theater to Broadway, including "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "A Chorus Line."         Recalling her support for the arts and her interest in social justice, Mr. Papp said that despite her wealth, "there was nothing in her that suggested anyone was different from anyone else." He described her as high-spirited but said she "never wanted to be in the spotlight."         Mrs. Mertz, a longtime supporter of dance, was on the board of the Original Ballets Foundation, which operates the Feld Ballets/NY and the New Ballet School. She also supported the New York City Ballet. The Joyce Theater on Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, which opened in 1982 and is devoted to dance, is named in memory of her daughter, who died of cancer in 1974. Literature on Tape         In 1961 she founded Choice Magazine Listening in Port Washington for people who are unable to read regular print. The organization selects articles, fiction and poetry from contemporary periodicals, records them on cassette tapes and distributes the tapes free. To endow the organization, she set up a private foundation, the Lucerna Fund.         The LuEsther T. Mertz Retinal Research Center at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital is named for Mrs. Mertz.         She was a major contributor to many New York City cultural and educational institutions, including Lincoln Center and the New York Botanical Garden, and received the Mayor's Award for Arts and Culture in 1983 and the New York State Governor's Arts Award in 1986.         In recent years, she was chairman of the Joyce Mertz Gilmore Foundation, which supports nonprofit activities in human rights, world security and the environment and New York City cultural and civic programs.         She was a trustee of the Port Washington Public Library and a founding member of the Port Washington League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Mertz, whose maiden name was Turner, was born in Cincinnati and grew up in Williamsport, Pa. She graduated from Syracuse University in 1927 with a degree in library science.         Her son, Peter, died in an accident in 1954. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Miriam Burton Holman, a soprano and actress who appeared on Broadway and in opera, died last Sunday at High Ridge House, a Christian Science nursing facility in the Bronx. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of respiratory failure, her daughter, Diedre Greenway of Manhattan, said.         Miss Burton appeared in many Broadway and Off Broadway productions, including "House of Flowers," "Waltz of the Toreadors" and "The Sunshine Boys." Her film credits included "Cotton Comes to Harlem" and "The Landlord," and she had featured roles in the television series "Search for Tomorrow" and "True Blue."         Miss Burton, born in New York City, studied voice at the Henry Street Settlement. In 1954 she received the Marian Anderson Award, and a year later won an Opportunity Fellowship from the John Hay Whitney Foundation to study in Europe. Her New York debut was at Town Hall in 1958.         She was a soloist at Carnegie Hall with the Symphony of the Air and the Dessoff Choirs, and appeared in several operas, including Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" and the premiere of Carlisle Floyd's "Passion of Jonathan Wade" with the New York City Opera in 1962.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her father, Edward Burton, of Manhattan; a brother, James Burton, of Manhattan, and a sister, Lorraine Burton Koiner, of the Bronx.       
         Gwendolen M. Carter, a teacher and writer who was an authority on Africa and one of the founders of African studies in the United States, died yesterday at her home in Orange City, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Dr. Carter died of congestive heart failure, said Judith Bosford, her nurse.         Miss Carter was a professor of political science at Smith College from 1943 to 1964, where she held the Sophia Smith Chair from 1961 to 1964. She also taught at Northwestern University (1964-1974), where she held the title of Melville J. Herskovits Professor of African Affairs; Indiana University (1974-1984) and the University of Florida (1984-1987). She retired in 1987.         Born in Hamilton, Ontario, she became a naturalized American citizen in the early 1940's.         While teaching at Smith College, Dr. Carter decided to examine the major countries of the British Commonwealth.         She recalled later that in 1948 it was "when I first met South Africa." From then on she specialized in African affairs, particularly southern Africa.         Widely respected as an authoritative scholar, Dr. Carter wrote several books including a carefully documented analysis of apartheid, "The Politics of Equality" (1955, Frederick A. Praeger); "Independence for Africa" (1960, Praeger), and "Government and Politics in the Twentieth Century," with John H. Herz (1961, Praeger).         Dr. Carter did not believe that racial conflict was inevitable.         "I don't believe in inevitability," she said in an interview about the political struggle in South Africa. "I'm optimistic. I favor people who are fighting for things. They are going to have a very hard time. But there are magnificent people there, so much good will, so many whites and blacks who are determined to change the situation. It's a mammoth job."         Dr. Carter graduated from the University of Toronto in 1929. She also received a master's degree from Oxford and a doctorate from Radcliffe College.         There are no immediate survivors.         Correction:  February 22, 1991, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Gwendolen Carter, a scholar on Africa, misidentified a book she wrote about apartheid. It was "The Politics of Inequality."       
         Devorah Heller, the director of employee relations for the Yonkers public school system, died on Monday at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 52 years old and lived in Yonkers.         She died of breast cancer, said her son, Lawrence.         Mrs. Heller joined the Yonkers school system in 1974 as a social studies teacher, worked with disadvantaged youngsters and in 1981 was named coordinator of information services. In 1986, when the Yonkers schools were desegregated under a court order, she was prominent as spokeswoman for the district at a time of great tension. She became director of employee relations in 1987 and handled contract negotiations with school employees. She was a graduate of Bronx High School of Science, Hunter College and Fordham University.         She is survived by her husband, Michael; her mother, Beatrice Gittleman; two sons, Lawrence, of Manhattan, and Mark, of Plainview, L.I., and two sisters, Shula Brudner of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Toby Edelson of Suffern, N.Y.       
         Carol Laise, an American Ambassador who was the wife of an American Ambassador and the first woman to be an Assistant Secretary of State, died yesterday at her home in Dummerston, Vt. She was 73 years old.         Miss Laise died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         She was named Ambassador to Nepal by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966 and remained in the post until 1973. In January 1974 she married Ambassador at Large Ellsworth Bunker, a 79-year-old widower, in Katmandu, Nepal. She kept her maiden name professionally.         It was the first marriage between two American Ambassadors. Miss Laise was a close friend of Mr. Bunker's first wife, Harriet Allen Bunker, who died in 1964, and it was Miss Laise's first marriage.         For nearly six years after their marriage the couple saw each other only once a month when Ambassador Laise would take a plane provided by President Johnson and fly to Saigon, where Ambassador Bunker was trying to stabilize the situation in South Vietnam. Named Director General         In October 1973 she returned to Washington and was sworn in as Assistant Secretary of State in charge of the Bureau of Public Affairs, the first woman to hold so high a post in the department. Before her appointment as Ambassador to Nepal she had been director of the Office of South Asian Affairs,         In 1974 Miss Laise became director general of the Foreign Service, the highest nonpolitical job in the Foreign Service, a post she held until she retired in 1977.         Caroline Clendening Laise began her Government career in 1940 as an occupational coder for the Civil Service Commission. In 1946 she went to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and in 1948 joined the State Department.         From 1956 to 1961 she was an adviser to American delegates to various United Nations agencies and in 1962 was made deputy director of the Office of South Asian Affairs with responsibilty for diplomatic relations with Afghanistan, Ceylon, Nepal, India and Pakistan.         In comparing the economic problems of Nepal with those of India, she said in a 1966 interview with Ann Terry Pincus of The New York Post, "You could explain that Nepal is like Appalachia, and India has the problems of Harlem." An Adviser in New Delhi         When Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey went to India and Pakistan in 1965, Miss Laise went along as his adviser. In the 1962-63 Chinese invasion of India, Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith sent for Miss Laise for advice and she spent about a year in New Delhi.         She was a winner in 1965 of the annual Federal Women's Award for outstanding contributions by women in government service, and in 1973 she received the Career Service Award of the National Civil Service League.         Miss Laise, a native of Winchester, Va., was a graduate of American University and received an M.A. in political science from George Washington University.         Her husband, Ambassador Bunker, died in 1984.         She is survived by a brother, Frederick Laise of Santa Fe, N.M.; two stepsons, Samuel Bunker of Dummerston, Vt., and John Bunker of Wheatland, Wy.; and a stepdaughter, Ellen Bunker of Tucson, Ariz.       
         Marietta Tree, a daughter of privilege who won plaudits as a representative to the United Nations in the 1960's and as a tireless worker for New York City causes, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, her son-in-law, James Sterba, said.         Mrs. Tree was appointed a representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1961 and served also as a special adviser to the United States delegation. She remained at the United Nations until 1967, serving in several         posts, including delegate to the Trusteeship Council.         In the last decade, she was chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a group that tries to help neighborhood groups improve their communities.  She resigned her post because of illness nine months ago.         Mrs. Tree came from a distinguished family and privileged circumstances and could have spent her life quite insulated from the tensions of international diplomacy and the frustrations of a city that so frequently seemed to be in crisis. But that is not what she wanted. Tributes From Friends         Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, a close friend of Mrs. Tree's for many years, said: "Her ambition was to be a combination of Mrs. Roosevelt and Carole Lombard. And that is what she was."         Another close friend agreed. "She was elegant, glorious and sparkling," saidOsborne Elliot, who was founding chairman of the Citizens Committee and who, since her resignation, has returned as chairman. "She set many drawing rooms         afire. But more importantly, she cared deeply about the world, the nation, this city and its people."         Mrs. Tree was born in Lawrence, Mass., the daughter of the Right Rev. Malcolm Endicott Peabody, an Episcopal clergyman, who from 1940 to 1962 was Bishop for Central New York State of the Episcopal Church. Her mother was the former Mary Parkman, daughter of a prominent New England family.         The family believed that it was a responsibility to dedicate at least some of one's life to public service, and the message was received by all five of their children. One of Mrs. Tree's brothers, Endicott, became Governor of Massachusetts.         The Peabodys moved around a bit before World War II. For a time they lived in Philadelphia, where Mr. Peabody was minister of St. Paul's Church in Chestnut Hill and young Marietta attended Springside Academy. She also attended St. Timothy's School in Baltimore and the Petite Ecole Florentine in Florence, Italy. From 1936 to 1939, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she concentrated in political science.         In 1939, she married Desmond FitzGerald, a lawyer and conservative Republican. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. The couple had a daughter, Frances FitzGerald, an author whose nonfiction best-seller "Fire in the Lake,"         about the Vietnam War, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.         Soon after the divorce, Marietta married Ronald Tree, a former Conservative member of the British Parliament. He died in 1976. The two had a daughter, Penelope Tree, who became a model.         During World War II Mrs. Tree worked as a researcher at Life magazine. After the war she became active in liberal Democratic politics in New York. She was on the New York State Democratic Committee from 1954 to 1960 and was one of Adlai E. Stevenson's chief aides when he ran for President against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.         After John F. Kennedy was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Tree to the United Nations job, where she served when Mr. Stevenson was the top United States representative there.         "I work in the political field because I believe that everyone in a community has duties as well as rights," Mrs. Tree said in 1961. "I am impelled by a feeling that I have so many blessings I must somehow try to pay for them in hard         work for the community and in gratitude for being an American. I have to try and pay my debt to God."         After her diplomatic service ended, Mrs. Tree became increasingly interested in urban problems. She was a partner in the city planning firm of Llewelyn-Davies Associates, a British organization, and ran its New York office from 1968 to 1980. She was neither an architect nor a planner but rather, as her brother, Malcolm, recalls it, "a rainmaker" who was able to motivate city officials. She worked on a slum rehabilitation project in Manila and consulted on various projects in Hong Kong, Borneo, Beirut and elsewhere. Held New York City Post         Her interest in New York City was evident early on. In 1944 she was one of the founders of Sydenham Hospital, then hailed as the first interracial voluntary hospital in the United States. Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her to the city's Commission on Intergroup Relations in 1959.         Among her other activites was service on the board of directors of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Foundation, the Marconi International Foundation and the Winston Churchill Foundation. She also was on the boards of         CBS and Pan American World Airways.         Among the survivors are her daughters, Frances FitzGerald of Manhattan and Penelope Tree of Sydney, Australia; four brothers, Endicott, of Hollis, N.H.; George L., of Washington, an educational consultant; , Samuel P., of Manhattan, a philanthropist, and Malcolm E., of Washington, a real-estate developer.         Funeral arrangements are incomplete. Mrs. Tree will be cremated and her remains buried in Northeast Harbor, Me. There will be a memorial service in New York City in September, but the date and location have not yet been selected, the family said.         Correction:  August 17, 1991, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Marietta Tree, a former United Nations representative and campaigner for New York City causes, rendered the name of the founding chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City incorrectly. He is Osborn Elliott.       
         Edythe Lutzker, a historian and author who went to college at age 46, died on Friday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications from lung congestion, her son Michael said.         Mrs. Lutzker wrote a book on the first group of women to get M.D. degrees in England in the 19th century, "Women Gain a Place in Medicine," in 1969. She also wrote a biography of one of them, "Edith Pechey-Phipson, M.D.: The Story of England and India's Foremost Pioneering Woman Doctor."         More recently, Mrs. Lutzker, with Carol Jochnowitz, wrote a biography of Waldemar M. Haffkine, a bacteriologist who discovered vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague.         In 1950, when Mrs. Lutzker was 46, she enrolled in City College. "All my life I've had to postpone going to college," she said. "The problems that arise when a working woman brings up children forced me to put it off." She graduated in 1954 in the college's first arts and science class that included women.         She received her master's degree from Columbia University in 1959.         Mrs. Lutzker is survived by three sons, Michael, of New York City; Arthur, of Oakhurst, N.J., and Paul, of Washington; two brothers, David Levine of Margate, Fla., and Robert Levine of New York City; a sister, Miriam Gindin of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Susan Price Carr, a lawyer with Time Warner Inc., died on Friday at Beth Israel Hospital North in Manhattan. She was 45 years old.         She died of breast cancer, family members said.         In the early 1970's, Ms. Carr was one of several female law students who filed sex discrimination claims against several large law firms. The suits were settled by the firms' adoption of procedures to assure equal opportunities in hiring for future generations of law students.         Ms. Carr had been litigation counsel for Warner Communications, now Time Warner, since 1981. She was a graduate of Vassar College and of Columbia Law School, and she had received a master's degree in political science from New York University.         Ms. Carr is survived by her husband, Anthony M. Radice; a daughter, Julia; her mother, Dorislee Kadis Carr, and a half-sister, Amy, all of New York City.       
         Gladys Gage Dibble, a Michigan horticulturist who wrote widely on gardening, died Friday at the Georgian Bloomfield Nursing Home in Bloomfield, Mich. She was 90 years old.         The William R. Hamilton funeral home in Birminham, Mich., where Mrs. Dibble lived, said she died of complications from a stroke.         Mrs. Dibble, who specialized in small garden plots for city dwellers, wrote about gardening for several publications, including The New York Times, The Christian Science Monitor, American Home and House & Garden.         She is survived by a son, Philip Gage Dibble, and a sister, Kathleen Gage Hutchison, both of Montreal.       
         Margaret L. A. MacVicar, dean of undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an innovator in shaping policies for undergraduate education and science education in public schools, died Monday at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. She was 47 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass., and Lebanon, Me.         She had been ill with cancer for a year, an M.I.T. spokesman said.         Professor MacVicar believed in educating students about their social responsibilities. "It is not technicians that we seek to prepare, nor bench-tied engineers practicing narrow specialities," she said. "Our purpose is to direct the best minds toward inquiries and enterprises concerned with the human condition." Work for Diversity         After becoming undergraduate dean in 1985, she worked for diversity in the admission of women, members of minorities and students with varied interests. She also implemented changes in humanities and science requirements.         Professor MacVicar, a professor of physical science, had held the endowed chair as Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Education since 1980.         As dean, Professor MacVicar's responsibilities included oversight of M.I.T.'s Reserve Officer Training Corps program. Last year, she criticized a Department of Defense policy barring homosexuals from R.O.T.C. programs, saying that such policies "run counter to the values of inclusion and equality which are the foundation of this institution." The faculty voted to have M.I.T. work with other schools for a reversal of the policy. Recipient of Irwin Sizer Award         Margaret MacVicar was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and moved with her family to Flint, Mich., as a child. She received her B.S., in 1964, and her doctorate, in 1967, from M.I.T. For two years, she was a postdoctoral fellow at Cambridge University in England.         In 1973, she was the first recipient of the M.I.T. Class of 1922 Career Development Award to support young faculty members of exceptional promise and unusual devotion to teaching. In 1977, she received the Irwin Sizer Award for the most significant contribution to education at M.I.T., and in 1979, she held the Chancellor's Distinguished Chair at the University of California, Berkeley, in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. In 1985, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Clarkson University.         Survivors include her parents, George and Elizabeth MacVicar of DeBary, Fla., and two sisters, Anne Amato of Brookline, N.H., and Victoria MacVicar of Pepperell, Mass.       
         Marion Letcher Bohmrich, a research analyst with the Office of Strategic Services and with the United States Mission to the United Nations, died on Thursday at Fair Haven Home in Bostic, N.C., where she was a resident. She was 89 years old.         She died of pneumonia and suffered from Alzheimer's disease for 10 years, a spokesperson for the home said. She had requested that her remains be made available for research at the Alzheimer's Research Center at Duke University in Durham, N.C.         Mrs. Bohmrich, a daughter of a Foreign Service officer, traveled and studied in Western Europe, focusing on German culture and tradition. In 1941, she was recruited by the O.S.S., forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, as a social science analyst.         After World War II, she was transferred to the Department of State and sent to the Mission to the United Nations, where she worked with Eleanor Roosevelt when she was chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights from 1946 to 1951.         A native of Turin, Ga., she attended a number of schools in Europe, Mexico and the United States, including Columbia University.         Her first marriage to John Moore McKeehan Woodburn, a writer and editor, ended in divorce. She later married Louis Bohmrich, a Foreign Service officer and lecturer on foreign affairs, who died in 1981.         She is survived by a stepson, Roger Bohmrich of White Plains, and a sister, Adele Letcher Goddard of Sun City, Ariz.       
         Berenice Abbott, a pioneer of modern American photography, died yesterday at her home in Monson, Me. She was 93 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Hank O'Neal, her biographer.         Miss Abbott is best known for her powerful black-and-white photographs of New York City in the 1930's. In these pictures, she used the tools of modernist photographic style -- including dynamically framed compositions, flattened pictorial space, high angles, and great detail -- to capture the enormous energy and variety of the city.         Perhaps her most famous picture, a view of New York at night taken from the top of the Empire State Building, presents the city as a glittering tapestry of light, with massive buildings thrusting up from the criss-crossed streets. In her New York photographs, many of which were collected in the book "Changing New York" (1939), Miss Abbott also provided an invaluable historical record of the physical appearance of the city at a time when it was undergoing rapid transformation.         Miss Abbott first achieved fame as a photographer in Paris in the 1920's with her penetrating portraits of such artists and writers as James Joyce, Janet Flanner and Jean Cocteau. She is also known for a series of photographs illustrating laws and processes of physics. Documentary Advocate         As a participant in the photographic controversies of her day, Miss Abbott was an eloquent and contentious advocate of the documentary approach. In books and articles she argued that photography was uniquely a descriptive medium, and should not be used to simulate effects that could better be achieved in other arts. "Photography can never grow up if it imitates some other medium," she wrote in 1951. "It has to walk alone; it has to be itself."         Miss Abbott was also known as the person primarily responsible for the present-day fame of the French photographer Eugene Atget, whom she met in Paris two years before his death in 1927. For almost four decades Atget had earned a modest living photographing the artistic monuments of Paris and its environs, selling prints to artists, publishers and archivists. In the course of this work he had built up a large file of photographs documenting Parisian life and culture.         Upon his death Miss Abbott bought the almost 1,500 glass-plate negatives and some 8,000 prints remaining in his studio. When she returned to New York in 1929, she brought the materials with her, and in following years arranged exhibitions, print sales and the publication of several books of Atget's work.  The collection remained in Miss Abbott's possession until 1968, when it was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art; it later became the basis for a series of four exhibitions and books that was completed in 1984. Assistant to Man Ray         Atget's photographs, which combine straightforward description with great formal beauty, have exerted a great influence on the development of American photography. Most notably they served as a model for the work of Walker Evans, who first saw them in New York shortly after Miss Abbott's return from Paris. In the years since, Atget has provided an important example of purpose and style to a host of other photographers.         Born in Springfield, Ohio, on July 17, 1898, Berenice Abbott studied briefly at Ohio State University before going first to New York and then, in 1921, to Europe to study sculpture and drawing. She went into photography by accident, going to work in Paris in 1923 as a darkroom assistant for the American Surrealist Man Ray. In 1925 she took up portrait photography as a means of earning a living, but quickly discovered her love and aptitude for the work. In 1926 she opened her own studio, and soon built up a successful career as a portrait photographer.         On a short visit to the United States in 1929 she was excited by the speed and energy of New York, and decided to undertake a project to record the changing face of the city. She moved back to the United States and began to photograph, working first with a small, hand-held camera. By 1932, though, she had switched to a large-format camera that produced 8-by-10-inch negatives capable of recording great detail. 'Changing New York'         For several years she financed the project herself. In 1935, though, she was able to obtain support from the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration and began to produce the pictures that were published four years later as "Changing New York." She focused on architectural details and important historical buildings, as well as bridges and skyscrapers, often aiming her camera up or down to achieve dizzying perspectives. Occasionally she included people in the pictures, but her primary emphasis was on the physical structure of the city. Her pictures of row houses and tenements, elevated trains and automats, warehouses and store fronts, provide a remarkably thorough record of the city in all its diversity.         After completing her documentation of New York, Miss Abbott turned to scientific photography and invention, and in 1958 she joined the physical science study committee of Education Services Inc., in Cambridge, Mass., to take photographs for a new high-school physics text. Many of her pictures from this time have a remarkable geometric beauty while at the same time providing clear illustrations of such physical phenomena as the interference patterns produced by two sets of waves or the refraction of a beam of light through a prism.         Her scientific photographs won her new acclaim both before and after the textbook "Health" was published in 1960. In the opinion of her principal biographer, Mr. O'Neal, her scientific work "may well be viewed in future years as her outstanding contribution to photography." A Major Retrospective         During her years in New York, Miss Abbott was an active freelance photographer. She established the photography program at the New School for Social Research, and published several other books. In 1966 she moved to Maine, where she lived until her death, although she retained a connection to the city through a continuing association with the New York Public Library, which sponsored a major retrospective exhibition of her work in 1989.         The New York exhibition, organized by Julia van Haaften, later traveled to Dallas, Atlanta, Toledo, Ohio, and Tokyo. Over the years Miss Abbott's work was the subject of many other exhibitions at major museums, including the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History and Technology in Washington (1969) and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1970). In 1982 her life and work were summed up in a book, "Berenice Abbott: American Photographer," by Mr. O'Neal.         There are no survivors. A spokesman for the New York Public Library said a memorial service would be held in the library's Celeste Bartos Forum at a date to be announced.         Correction:  December 20, 1991, Friday         An obituary on Dec. 11 about the photographer Berenice Abbott misstated the title of the 1960 textbook in which photographs by Miss Abbott appeared. It was "Physics."
