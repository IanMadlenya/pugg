         Chloethiel Woodard Smith, a Washington architect who worked on the urban renewal of Southwest Washington and the creation of the new town of Reston, Va., in the 1960's, died on Wednesday at her home in Washington. She was 82.         She died of cancer, said Sydney Kasper, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Smith had a variety of projects in Washington and in Syracuse and Rochester, N.Y. She handled both housing and commercial projects and was one of the first women to become well known in American architecture. She retired about five years ago.         She was born in Peoria, Ill., and graduated from the University of Oregon. She earned her master's degree at Washington University in St. Louis.         Mrs. Smith was the widow of Bromley K. Smith, who was a consultant to the National Security Council for many years. He died in 1987.         She is survived by a son, Bromley Smith Jr. of Kenya, and a daughter, Suzanne Arias of Madrid.       
         Lacey Fosburgh, a writer whose books chronicled murder, family passions and mystery in India, died last night at California Pacific Hospital in San Francisco. She was 50 years old and lived in Mill Valley, Calif.         Ms. Fosburgh, who began her writing career as a reporter for The New York Times, died of complications of breast cancer, said a friend of the family.         Ms. Fosburgh's books were the nonfiction "Closing Time" (1977) and the novels "Old Money" (1983), about a woman photographer's painful relationship with her father, and "India Gate" (1991), a sprawling, passionate novel set in India. At her death, she was writing a novel set in present-day New York City under contract to Simon & Schuster.         She was a staff reporter for the Times from 1968 to late 1973. In the last 20 years, she also wrote freelance newspaper and magazine articles, many of them for The Times, taught journalism at the University of California at Berkeley and was a consultant to newspapers, among them The Oakland Tribune.  Murder and Mysteries         A 1973 murder case about which Ms. Fosburgh wrote for The Times became the subject of "Closing Time," which was a selection of the Literary Guild and the Doubleday Book Club. It won a Mystery Writers of America award.         The murder victim was a troubled teacher, Roseann Quinn. The police said she took an Indiana drifter, John Wayne Wilson, home to her apartment on West 72d Street in Manhattan from a nearby singles bar. They said her body had been sexually mutilated. After being held five months on murder charges, Mr. Wilson hanged himself in his jail cell.         In "Contemporary Authors," a series of reference books, Truman Capote is quoted as remarking that the book showed that Ms. Fosburgh "is a skillful, selective reporter and also a literary artist."         Ms. Fosburgh was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Hugh Whitney Fosburgh, a journalist and author who died in 1976, and Helen Edwards Fosburgh. Through her paternal grandmother, Leila Whitney Fosburgh, Ms. Fosburgh was descended from the Whitney family. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and Sarah Lawrence College. She was a debutante at a dinner-dance at the St. Regis Hotel. From 1964 to 1966 she studied in New Delhi on a Fulbright grant.         Her 1973 marriage to Marc Libarle ended in divorce in 1975.         She is survived by her second husband, David Harris, a writer who was a prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, whom she wed in 1977; a daughter from her second marriage, Sophie Whitney Harris of Mill Valley; her mother, who lives in Manhattan, and a brother, Pieter, of Manhattan.       
         Barbara E. Brooks, an editor at three major women's magazines, died yesterday at her sister's home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 39 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lymphoma, said the sister, Suzanne Steinau.         For the last four years Ms. Brooks was the home director of Family Circle, where she was in charge of the magazine's decorating, remodeling, gardening and crafts coverage.         In a project to adapt housing to the needs of modern working women, she and an architect and a builder -- both women -- created what they called the Busy Woman's Dream House, with a design that was streamlined to minimize housework and maintenance. The project was displayed at the National Association of Home Builders' show in Atlanta in 1990.         That same year Ms. Brooks's magazine work won an award from the International Home Furnishing Center.         She started her magazine career as an associate decorating editor at Mademoiselle. Later she was hired to edit major articles at House Beautiful. In 1980 she went to Family Circle, where she started as its decorating editor.         Ms. Brooks was born in Queens. She was a graduate of Boston University and earned a master's degree in fine arts from Sarah Lawrence.         Her sister is the only immediate survivor.

         Annapaola Cancogni, a teacher, writer and translator of French and Italian works into English, died on Wednesday at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 48 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Anne F. Garetta, her companion.         Dr. Cancogni taught at Harvard and at Queens College in New York and in the Paris program of the University of California at Berkeley.         Her translations included Umberto Eco's "Open Work and Other Essays" (1989), Annie Cohen-Solal's "Sartre" (1987), Raymond Radiguet's "Count d'Orgel's Ball" (1989), Francesca Duranti's "Happy Ending" (1990) and Annette Kahn's "Why My Father Died: The Trial of Klaus Barbie" (1991).         She wrote culture and travel articles for Italian newspapers and magazines and book reviews for The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune.         Dr. Cancogni was born in Florence, Italy, and grew up in Tuscany, France and England. She earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin and a doctorate in comparative literature from Harvard in 1979.         In addition to her companion, she is survived by a son, Lance R. Mankowski of Brooklyn; her parents, Manlio and Maria Vittoria of Pietrasanta, Italy, and a sister, Alessandra Cappuccio of Florence.       
         Elizabeth Wood, a public housing pioneer who advocated racial and economic integration and the designing of workable neighborhoods, died yesterday at a nursing home near Atlanta. She was 93.         She suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a broken hip and a stroke, said Gisela Titman, a niece.         Miss Wood was the founding director of the Chicago Housing Authority, an Illinois state housing official and an officer of the National Association of Housing Officials. She was later a housing consultant in New York City and an administrator at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.         Known as "Chicago's largest landlord," she headed the authority from 1937 to 1954, supervising the building and management of homes for thousands of families. Sought Real Neighborhoods         The philosophy she developed over the years was to mix residents by race, economic class and family size. She proposed that social workers help troubled families who might drag down a project.         Miss Wood favored small, dispersed projects rather than high-rise concentrations. A building's height should be limited to the distance that a mother in a window could be heard when calling to a child in a playground below, she said.         She urged planners to include shops, churches, parks and even pubs to turn housing complexes into real neighborhoods instead of human warehouses. Courtyards and indoor gathering places should have an inviting "design for loitering," she said. She sponsored flower-growing contests to brighten the projects.         Political pressure eventually forced Miss Wood out of her Chicago job. She said she fought with officials "and anybody else who stood in the way of getting homes built for the people."         She then went to New York, where she did studies for the City Housing Authority and the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. From 1965 to 1972 she worked at H.U.D. in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations to coordinate housing policy with other social and poverty programs.         She won Guggenheim and Ford Foundation grants to study in Iran and analyze housing in India. She wrote numerous articles and books.         The daughter of a missionary teacher, Miss Wood was born in Nara, Japan, and grew up in Bloomington, Ill. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees in rhetoric at the University of Michigan, she taught English for four years at Vassar College.         After moving to Chicago for doctoral studies, she instead became a social worker for United Charities. She then joined the Home Modernization Bureau, where a major contractor tutored her on the construction industry.         When the New Deal Public Works Administration began building housing, she became a planner. She also served as executive secretary of the Illinois Housing Board when it drafted a law creating housing authorities.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Beth Robertson Cosnow, a longtime community leader on the East Side of Manhattan, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 70.         The cause was lung cancer, said a friend, Lauren Giber.         Mrs. Cosnow, who was born in Dinuba, Calif., graduated from the University of California. She arrived in New York City after World War II and became involved in numerous neighborhood and block associations. As a Democratic district leader, she was a delegate to the 1984 Democratic National Convention and a leader emeritus of the Tilden Midtown Democratic Club.         Mrs. Cosnow, a co-founder of the First Women's Bank in Manhattan, also served in the 1960's as president of Friendly Visitors Inc., a women's volunteer group that provided social and recreational services to inmates of the city's Women's House of Detention in Manhattan. She was appointed an air-and-noise pollution ombudsman in the city's Department of Environmental Protection by Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins.         She was a past member of Manhattan Planning Board 6 and was active in the National Arts Club until the time of her death.         Her husband, Joseph Cosnow, died nine years ago. Survivors include her companion, Cyrus Rudman, and a sister, Laura Mulville, who lives in Florida.       
         Patricia Brooks Mann, a lyric soprano who helped fashion the modern standard for opera performers, died on Friday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 59.         She died of complications of multiple sclerosis, said her husband, Theodore D. Mann, the artistic director and co-founder of Circle in the Square Theater.         In an era when audiences and critics began demanding that opera performers display dramatic as well as musical talent, Ms. Brooks, who performed under her maiden name, arrived with a non-operatic training that fit the bill.         Her distinctive style drew on her earlier career in the theater and dance. Her opera performances won praise for her beauty, acting ability and graceful movements, as well as for her voice. Some classified her as a singing actress rather than an opera singer.         "The public was clamoring that opera performers had to look and act the part, not just sing it, and she was the new wave," said Beverly Sills, her famed contemporary at the New York City Opera. Command Performance         Ms. Brooks starred in numerous City Opera productions in the 1960's and 1970's, when she was in her 30's and 40's. She also sang with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and was a soloist at Carnegie and Alice Tully Halls, Covent Gardens in London and in concerts across the United States. She gave a White House command performance for President John F. Kennedy.         In an early review, Raymond Ericson of The New York Times wrote that as Gilda in "Rigoletto" in 1963, "Miss Brooks was attractive to both eye and ear, a musicianly artist and an intelligent actress." When she co-starred with Placido Domingo in "La Traviata" in 1966, Harold C. Schonberg's review praised her for "acting with a delicacy of detail rare in opera."         Her performances proved popular with audiences. An account of her appearance in "La Boheme" in 1961 said she "very nearly stopped the show." A review of "Tales of Hoffmann" in 1966 said she "brought down the house." And a report of her singing of Bellini with Marilyn Horne in 1971 said listeners were driven "into a frenzy." Studied Dance         Ms. Brooks was born in Manhattan. As a youngster she took lessons in music, ballet and acting and at the age of 10 won a WQXR-radio piano competition. She attended the High School of Music and Art and at 14 began studying dance with Martha Graham.         But a knee injury from a fall turned her from dance to theater. She auditioned for Mr. Mann, who was smitten and confided to his partner, Jose Quintero, that he intended to marry the aspiring actress.         Mr. Quintero cast her in Truman Capote's "The Grass Harp" and in "The Iceman Cometh," with Jason Robards and Peter Falk, and she studied acting under Uta Hagen.         Ms. Brooks began folk singing and appearing in musicals, encouraged by her mother, Eda, a voice coach. While singing in the chorus of nuns in "The Sound of Music" in 1960, Ms. Brooks decided to leave that Broadway hit and switch to opera.         Maturing rapidly in her new medium, she won an enviable array of praise. Critics hailed her performances as charming, bewitching and dazzling. Her voice was described as sweet, velvety, free-floating, delicate, warm and rich. Her acting was called nuanced, subtle, sensitive, elegant, expressive and exciting.         Although it was undisclosed, eventually multiple sclerosis limited her breathing, so she retired from performing in 1977. But she began teaching voice and directing productions at the State University of New York at Purchase and gave private lessons for several years.         When illness forced an end to her teaching, she turned her creative energies to oil and water-color painting.         Besides her husband and mother, Ms. Brooks is survived by two sons, Jonathan and Andrew, both of Manhattan and Mount Kisco; a stepbrother, Alan Brooks, and a sister, Joan Brooks Palermo, both of Manhattan.         A memorial service will be held at noon on Feb. 1 at Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway at 50th Street.       
         Dr. Blanche Bernstein, a prominent welfare expert and former government official whose criticisms of the welfare system provoked stormy policy debates, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said Barbara Rulnick, a niece.         Dr. Bernstein argued that the welfare system's major failing is in fostering continued dependency for people receiving aid, instead of guiding them off the welfare rolls to independence.         "Reduction of dependency is the greatest unmet need in social policy today," she once said. "We have not gotten to the heart of the problem."         Her pronouncements often stirred opposition from other officials, experts and advocates. Some accused her of being unsympathetic to poor people and minorities, which she denied.         Supporters said her aim was to help the truly needy while paring cheaters and ineligible recipients from welfare and reducing erroneous overpayments. High-Ranking Welfare Posts         In 1978-79 she headed the nation's largest local welfare agency when she served as the city's Human Resources Administrator, with more than a million residents receiving aid. Mayor Edward I. Koch appointed and praised her as "terrific."         But during her term more than 100,000 people were pared from the welfare rolls. After she came under fire from a number of black officials, Mr. Koch named a deputy with superseding power over her, and she resigned. The Mayor's action was widely interpreted as a concession to soothe his frayed minority relations.         Dr. Bernstein also served as the State Social Services Department's deputy commissioner for income maintenance from 1975-77, under Gov. Hugh L. Carey. She was in charge of public assistance, food stamps and welfare job programs.         Later she recounted her battles and explained her policies in "The Politics of Welfare: The New York City Experience" (Abt, 1982), which Fortune magazine called "wonderfully instructive."         An economist, Dr. Bernstein earlier held policy posts in the State Department, worked for charities, was an educator and researched a wide array of social problems.         Among the issues she studied were foster care, the effect of welfare on family stability, obstacles to drug treatment for addicts, impoverished Jews, day care, obstacles to employment for welfare recipients, mental health care, welfare spending, family budgets and prenatal care. Director at New School         Dr. Bernstein focused increasingly on the growing and entwined problems of teen-age mothers, single-parent families, poor education, school dropout and unemployment. Unless society "breaks the cycle of dependency and poverty," she said, "we are in danger of creating a permanent underclass."         On leaving government in 1979, she became the director of the Social Policy Research Institute at the New School for Social Research. The institute studied welfare, housing, health care, child neglect and abuse and services for the aged.         After retiring from the New School, she remained in education as a trustee of the City University of New York.         Dr. Bernstein was born in New York City. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree and a doctorate in economics at Columbia.         Her survivors include a brother, Hilliard, of Manhattan.       
         Jeanne Sauve, a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada in the 1980's, died on Tuesday in Montreal. She was 70.         Her death was announced by the office of the Governor General, who represents Queen Elizabeth II. It did not give the cause of death.         A former television journalist and freelance columnist, Mrs. Sauve entered politics in 1972 by winning election as a Member of Parliament from a district outside Montreal now known as Laval-les-Rapides.         After two years as a back-bencher, she was named as a junior minister in the Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, overseeing science and technology and eventually the environment and communications. A Difficult Passage         But it was as Speaker, the keeper of the rules and traditions in the lower house, that Mrs. Sauve broke barriers and gained a national reputation.         When she was named to the post in 1980, she was still best known as part of a political elite that had congregated in Montreal in the 1950's to discuss art and politics and nationalism.         One participant was Mr. Trudeau, then a law professor and editor; another was Rene Levesque, a radio commentator who would later became a secessionist and Premier of Quebec, and a major adversary of Mr. Trudeau.         Her appointment drew criticism. Not only was she the first woman to preside over a forum that is still overwhelmingly male, but she was viewed by the Conservative opposition as lacking established ties to the House and knowledge of its often baroque procedures.         In her first two years, Mrs. Sauve was severely tested by strategists from the opposition who barraged her with points of order and privilege. But eventually even her adversaries paid tribute to her firmness and fairness, and she remained Speaker until 1984. Finally Won Respect         When Mr. Trudeau named her to the largely ceremonial but highly respected position of Governor General, she was also the first woman in that post, where she served until 1990.         Mrs. Sauve was born Jeanne Benoit in Prud'homme, Saskatchewan, on April 26, 1922. She was educated at the University of Ottawa and University of Paris.         In 1948 she married Maurice Sauve, a businessman who also served as a minister to Mr. Trudeau; he died last year. She is survived by a son, Jean-Francois.         Correction:  January 29, 1993, Friday         An obituary headline yesterday about a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada misidentified her. She was Jeanne Sauve.       
         Hannah Wilke, a sculptor and Conceptual artist who made the body and female sexuality the subject of her work, died yesterday at Twelve Oaks Hospital in Houston. She was 52 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications from lymphoma, said her husband, Donald Goddard.         In the late 1960's and early 70's, Ms.  Wilke startled the art world with beautiful sculptures made of latex or ceramic whose layered and folded flowerlike forms were both abstract and yet highly suggestive of female genitalia. This fortune-cookie-like configuration became the artist's signature; it was sometimes small and made of homey materials like chewing gum or laundry lint, or it could be larger and painted with Abstract Expressionist brushstrokes. These forms could hang on the wall, or be marshaled in great numbers across the floor, or be stuck directly to the body of the artist herself, as they were in some of her Conceptual photographic pieces.         In some ways, Ms. Wilke was part of the Post-Minimalist soft-sculpture esthetic that emerged in the early 1970's and that included artists like Eva Hesse and Keith Sonnier. But she brought to this esthetic a stronger sense of the erotic and an often witty political edge. Striking in appearance, she forthrightly made herself the primary subject of her videotapes, performance pieces and photographs, often posing nude or partially clothed in ways that ridiculed the role of the female nude in art. While some critics called her work narcissistic, others saw it as probing the mechanism of narcissism and voyeurism.  Ravages of Cancer         In the late 1970's, Ms. Wilke's involvement with the female body became even more personal when her mother contracted cancer and the artist began to photograph the physical ravages of the disease and its treatments. In 1986, when cancer was diagnosed in Ms. Wilke, she began a series of daily watercolor drawings of her face, her hands or flowers. With the help of her husband, she also turned the camera on herself, documenting her illness in a series of large-scale color photographs.         Ms. Wilke, whose original name was Arlene Hannah Butter, was born in New York City on March 7, 1940. She earned a bachelor of fine arts degree and a teaching certificate from the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia in 1962 and taught sculpture at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan for many years. Since her first one-woman exhibition in 1972, she has been represented by the Ronald Feldman Gallery in Manhattan.         Her work is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Jewish Museum in New York City, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, the Milwaukee Art Museum and the Allen Art Museum in Oberlin, Ohio. A retrospective of her career was organized at the University of Missouri at St. Louis in 1989.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Marsie Scharlatt of Los Angeles, and two stepdaughters, Katie Goddard of Minneapolis and Nellie Goddard of Chicago.       
         Ann Osterhout Edison, a pharmacist and daughter-in-law of Thomas Alva Edison, died on Monday at the Caleb Hitchcock Health Center at Duncaster in Bloomfield, Conn. She was 91 and lived in West Orange, N.J.         The cause of death was heart failure, said her niece, Sandy Karplus.         Born in Oakland, Calif., Mrs. Edison was a 1935 pharmacy graduate of Rutgers University and earned a master's degree in public health at Columbia University in the 1950's.         As a registered pharmacist, she worked at the Merck Institute for Therapeutic Research in Rahway, N.J., in the 1940's as well as in the laboratories of Thomas A. Edison Inc., which consolidated various businesses organized by her father-in-law, the inventor.         Over many years she was associated with New Jersey Orthopedic Hospital and the Hospital Center of Orange, serving on boards and committees and heading several of them. She helped to establish the Child Guidance Clinic of the Oranges and Maplewood.         Mrs. Edison's husband, Theodore M. Edison, died on Nov. 24. She is survived by a nephew and two nieces.       
         Katharine Morrison McClinton, the author of more than 30 books on antiques, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Julianna A. Mortensen, of Darien, Conn.         Mrs. McClinton, a native of San Francisco, graduated from Stanford University in 1921 and received a master's degree from Columbia University. Her books on antiques, published from 1929 to 1982, covered period furniture, American glass, American silver and Victorian furnishings, among other topics. Her best-known books were on the Art Deco movement and included "Art Deco for Collectors" and "Lalique for Collectors." She lectured widely on these subjects and continued writing for magazines until her death.         Mrs. McClinton's first marriage, to Richard Kahle, a San Diego lawyer, ended in divorce in 1935. Later that year she married Harold McClinton, an advertising executive, who died in 1977.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a stepson, Rear Adm. Robert Brock McClinton, retired, of Sequim, Wash., two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Mitzi Berger Hamovitch, an English professor who taught at Queens College for more than 30 years, died on Thursday at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, L.I. She was 68 and lived in Great Neck.         She died after heart surgery, said her husband, William Hamovitch, a retired economics professor and provost at Queens College.         She was the editor of "The Hound & Horn Letters" (University of Georgia Press, 1982). The book was a collection of letters between the editor of the Hound & Horn, a literary magazine published between 1927 and 1934, and the magazine's writers.         Born in Montreal, she moved to Buffalo in 1946 with her husband and earned her master's degree in English at the University of Buffalo. In 1953, the couple began teaching at Queens College. In 1978, she earned her doctorate from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. She retired in 1989.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Susan Hamovitch of Brooklyn, and a brother, Monty Berger of Montreal.       
         Jean Strachan Wilson, professor emeritus of history at Smith College, died Monday at Pennswood Village in Newtown, Pa. She was 89.         She died of heart failure, said Prof. Elizabeth von Klemperer of Smith.         A native of Duluth, Minn., Professor Wilson graduated from Smith in 1924 and earned a doctorate from the University of London in 1927. She joined the Smith faculty that year and taught there until her retirement in 1968.         Professor Wilson was an authority on 17th-century England. In 1963 she was appointed the Sydenham Clark Parsons Professor of History. In 1969, after her retirement from Smith, she taught at the University of Iowa.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Mary Tarleton Knollenberg, a sculptor, died on Dec. 21 at her home in Chester, Conn. She was 88 years old.         She died in her sleep, said Edmund Delaney, her lawyer and a friend.         Mrs. Knollenberg worked in bronze and stone and specialized in female forms, usually nudes.         Her work was exhibited in New York, at Yale University and several galleries in Connecticut.         Mrs. Knollenberg was born in Great Neck, L.I. She won a Guggenheim fellowship to study in Paris. She also studied under Mahonri Young in New York and Heinz Warneke in Washington.         She was married for 35 years to Bernhard Knollenberg, a lawyer, Revolutionary War historian and librarian of Yale's Sterling Memorial Library. He died in 1973.         She is survived by a stepson, Walter Knollenberg of Chatham, Mass.       
         Joyce V. Nadelman, a former Foreign Service aide who was also active in Riverdale, the Bronx, died on Saturday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 75.         She died of heart failure, her husband said.         Mrs. Nadelman, formerly Joyce Cavanah, was born in Mount Vernon, Ind., and graduated from Boston University. She entered the Foreign Service in 1944 and was assigned to the United States Embassy in Warsaw. She also served at the American embassies in Lisbon, London, Prague and Paris.         She resigned in 1947 when she married E. Jan Nadelman, a career Foreign Service officer. They served together in diplomatic posts in Poland, Italy, Germany, and Liberia and at the State Department in Washington.         She is survived by her husband; a son, Philip J., and a daughter, Cynthia J., all of New York.       
         Diana Brewster Clark, an educator and an authority on dyslexia, died at her home in Manhattan on Sunday. She was 56.         Her daughter, Elise S. Pettus of Manhattan, said the cause of death was uterine cancer.         Dr. Clark was recognized for her research on remedial education for dyslexia. Her book, "Dyslexia; Theory and Practice of Remedial Instruction" (York Press, 1988), is a standard text on the subject.         In the preface to this work, Dr. Clark writes that despite considerable knowledge acquired over the last 50 years about the nature of dyslexia, a perception disorder that confuses images, it may be a long time before effective treatment is widely available. Instructional Methods         Noting that remedial practice "cannot afford to wait" for research, she presents a comprehensive study of existing instructional methods and programs for dyslexic students.         At the time of her death, Dr. Clark was an adjunct professor of education at Columbia University Teachers College and an active member of the Columbia Teachers College Alumni Council, of which she was moderator in 1988 and 1989. She was also a trustee of the New York City School Volunteers and a member of the Orton Dyslexia Society, the national advocacy group.         Dr. Clark, who was born in Manhattan, attended Vassar College and graduated from Barnard College in 1959. She received a doctorate in education from Teachers College at Columbia in 1984. Taught at Marymount         As a learning disabilities specialist, Dr. Clark taught the teaching of reading to children and young adults at the Nightingale-Bamford School and at the Communications and Learning Center of Marymount Manhattan College.         Her latest work was a chapter on early reading and instruction in the book, "Learning About Learning Disabilities" (Academic Press, 1991).         She was a board member of the Shaker Museum and the Columbia County Land Conservancy, both in Chatham, N.Y.         Two marriages, to Thomas W. Pettus and to James M. Clark, ended in divorce.         Besides her daughter Elise, Dr. Clark is survived by a daughter, Ashley S. Pettus, and a son, Brewster W. Pettus, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Whitney Armstrong and Janet York of Manhattan, and a brother, Benjamin Brewster, also of Manhattan.       
         Jean Gould, who wrote biographies of Robert Frost, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Amy Lowell, as well as of the artist Winslow Homer, died on Monday at a nursing home in Perrysburg, Ohio. She was 83.         The cause was cancer of the jaw, said her nephew, Dr. James Mann of Perrysburg.         Miss Gould was born in Greenville, Ohio, and grew up in Toledo. She attended the University of Michigan, where Frost was one of her teachers. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Toledo.         In the early 1950's, after writing several literary biographies for young readers, she moved to New York City, where she lived until returning to Ohio last year. She did editorial work for the national education office of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union and for a time worked as a researcher for the National Opinion Research Center in Princeton, N.J.         She continued to write juvenile biographies, notably "Young Mariner Melville" (1956) and "That Dunbar Boy" (1958), about the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. Her first work for adults was "A Good Fight: The Story of F. D. R.'s Conquest of Polio" (1960).         Miss Gould was best known for "Winslow Homer: A Portrait" (1962), "Robert Frost: The Aim Was Song" (1964), "The Poet and Her Book: A Biography of Edna St. Vincent Millay" (1969) and "Amy: The World of Amy Lowell and the Imagist Movement" (1976).         Her 18 published books also included surveys of American playwrights and American female poets.         Besides her nephew, she is survived by two brothers, Arthur, of Belfast, Me., and Bernard, of Ottawa.       
         Joy Garrett, an actress who performed in soap operas and on the New York stage, died on Thursday at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in the Westwood section of Los Angeles. She was 47.         Rich Elbaum, a spokesman for the medical center, said the cause was liver failure.         For the past seven years, Ms. Garrett played the role of the mother figure Jo Johnson on the NBC daytime soap opera "Days of Our Lives." Previously she had performed for a year on another daytime soap opera, "The Young and the Restless," on CBS.         In 1969, she appeared in "Gertrude Stein's First Reader," a musical revue based on works of Gertrude Stein, at the Astor Place Theater on Lafayette Street in the East Village. Ms. Garrett appeared in the 1970 production, at the Edison Theater, of "The Candyapple," playing the mistress of a lapsed Roman Catholic priest.         She also performed in "Silver Queen Saloon" at La Mama E.T.C. in 1978.         She also appeared in movies and stock and touring productions.         She was born in Fort Worth and attended Texas Wesleyan University and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.         She is survived by her parents, Clarence and Kathleen Garrett of Fort Worth.       
         Dorothy K. Willner, a sociologist who persuaded the United Nations to adopt guidelines protecting the rights of consumers, died on Saturday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan and Southampton, L.I.         She had cancer of the small intestine, her husband, Sidney, said.         Mrs. Willner served as the representative of the International Organization of Consumers Unions at the United Nations from 1974 to 1983. She campaigned for the voluntary guidelines, which were a statement of principles to assist governments, particularly those in developing countries, in establishing consumer protection policies. They were eventually adopted by a consensus of the General Assembly in 1985.         "It was really a pioneering piece of work," Rhoda Karpatkin, president of Consumers Union, said of Mrs. Willner's efforts at the United Nations.         She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and earned a doctorate in sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. She taught at the University of Maryland, George Washington University, New York University and Upsala College. She was a visiting scholar at Columbia University and also worked with several other organizations at the United Nations, including Unicef.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Karen Ferguson of Washington and Denise Pavia of Manhattan, and a grandson.       
         Anna Goldfeder, a leader in cancer and radiobiology science who conducted research for 66 years, died on Monday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 95.         Dr. Goldfeder, whose career spanned generations of cancer researchers, made important contributions in her field until her retirement in 1988, when she was 91.         Her honors included an award from the Radiological Society of North America and the presidential gold medal from New York Academy of Sciences. She published an estimated 200 reports in journals.         Legendary for her work habits, Dr. Goldfeder routinely went to her laboratory seven days a week and put in 12-hour shifts. Opera was one of her few diversions. Her philosophy: "Either you keep swimming, or you sink to the bottom." 'The Mystery of Life'         When she first learned about cells as a student, she recalled, she was struck that "this was the mystery of life itself." She saw cancer as a special challenge and said she felt "humiliated" as a researcher when friends died of the disease.         Dr. Goldfeder bred a strain of albino mice whose lack of naturally occurring tumors made them ideal for cancer experiments by researchers around the world. The strain was named X-GF, the GF standing for her last name.         She was a pioneer in growing human breast cancer cells in cultures, researching radiation treatment and the effectiveness of different dosages and showing the importance of lead shielding of normal tissues during radiation.         Most of her career was at the New York City Hospitals Department, where she was the director of cancer and radiological research, with academic affiliations at New York University. She also worked at Harvard and Columbia Universities, Lenox Hill Hospital, Rockefeller Institute and the University of Vienna. Her work was sponsored by grants and money from her own pocket.         In 1977, the city closed Delafield Hospital where she worked. Nevertheless, the diminutive Dr. Goldfeder, 5 feet 2 inches tall, still strode through the deserted hallways to her lab and its colony of mice.         Born in Poland, Dr. Goldfeder earned a doctorate in science at the University of Prague in 1923. In 1922, while completing her degree, she started working at Masaryk University in Brno, Czechoslovakia. Her research drew an invitation to the United States, and she immigrated in 1931.         Dr. Goldfeder, who lost most of her family in the Holocaust, had no immediate survivors.       
         Dr. Roberta G. Simmons, a sociologist who conducted groundbreaking research into the emotional effects of organ transplants, died Monday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh. She was 55 and lived in Pittsburgh.         She had breast cancer for 15 years, said Gabriella Stern, a family friend.         As a professor of sociology and psychiatry at the University of Minnesota and the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Simmons was one of the first to study the psychological consequences of organ transplants for both donors and recipients. She found, for example, that a transplanted organ was considered a priceless gift by some recipients and a burdensome debt by others.         "She was really way ahead of her time," said Lin McGaw, manager of education at the United Network for Organ Sharing in Richmond, which links donors with recipients. "Her work had a lot of sociological value about what donation means to the donor family and the recipient."         Dr. Norman B. Levy, a professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College in Valhalla, said Dr. Simmons's most important research focused on kidney transplants. "Her work essentially has shown that people who donate kidneys adapt better psychologically and sociologically than most people had thought they would," he said.         Dr. Simmons was born in Boston on Nov. 30, 1937. She attended Wellesley College and earned her doctorate in sociology at Columbia University.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Richard L. Simmons; two daughters, Nicole Simmons of Bethesda, Md., and Janine Simmons of Los Angeles, and her father, Dr. Burton C. Grodberg of Saugus, Mass.       
         Adina Blady Szwajger, a pediatrician who struggled to save young lives in the Children's Hospital in the Warsaw ghetto and survived to recount the horrors, died Feb. 18 in Lodz, Poland. She was 75 and lived in Warsaw.         The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, said Jerzy Warman, a friend in Manhattan.         When the Nazis finally shut the hospital Dr. Szwajger (pronounced SHVY-gher), despite her Jewishness, escaped the ghetto with special identity papers, then worked with the resistance.         After the war she resumed work as a pediatrician and occasionally spoke about her harrowing experiences. But she kept the most haunting episode a secret for decades, until she was ill and in retirement.         Her memoirs circulated in a Solidarity underground magazine in the mid-1980's, then were published in the West in 1988.  'Damning and Uplifting'         In a review of the Pantheon edition in The New York Times, Kati Marton said: "Dr. Szwajger's unsentimental, almost matter-of-fact memoir of the German occupation of Poland is the most damning and most uplifting of the many accounts of the Holocaust that I have read. I did not think the well-covered ground of Nazi atrocities could still astonish. 'I Remember Nothing More: The Warsaw Children's Hospital and the Jewish Resistance' proved me wrong."         Her story began with the high hopes of a young medical student from the University of Warsaw. She described herself as bubbling, happy and proud to help youngsters at the hospital.         But soon the hospital was filled with youngsters dying from tuberculosis, typhus and starvation. The Nazis occupiers sealed off the ghetto and eventually marched a steady stream of people to their deaths.         "So we tried to save them with those scraps of food, medicines and injections," she wrote. Some children revived enough to smile -- "except that this was the kind of smile that made your hair stand on end and your flesh crawl." She described "famished skeletons" fighting over the soup pot, spilling it and lapping the slop off the floor.  'Corpses and Living Together'         Every day she went to a square to looking for stray children, befriending a Ukrainian guard with vodka.         "Once he was talking to me when a little girl appeared at a window," she wrote. "He raised his gun, shot her and carried on talking to me. I picked up a child, said goodbye to him and walked away -- only I didn't know how to hold the child so that it wouldn't be hit if the Ukrainian shot at me."         At the hospital, toward the end, "corpses and living all lay together" as soldiers killed some patients and ordered others to the death camps. A nurse pleaded with Dr. Szwajger to inject the nurse's bedridden mother with a lethal dose of morphine.         The doctor agreed. She also decided -- and this secret she kept for 45 years -- to carry out euthanasia on some of the children. In the infants' ward, she spoonfed each of them a fatal dose of morphine.         "Just as, during those two years of real work in the hospital, I had bent down over the little beds," she wrote, "so now I poured this last medicine into those tiny mouths. And downstairs there was screaming because the Germans were already there, taking the sick from the wards to the cattle trucks." 'Why I Was Different'         She told the older children to get into bed, and "this medicine was going to make their pain disappear."         "So they lay down and after a few minutes ----," she wrote. "I don't know how many. But the next time I went into that room, they were asleep. And then I don't know what happened after that."         That memory never left, "and that's why I was always different from everybody else."         Dr. Szwajger's husband, a law student, was killed by the Nazis, who tricked him into turning himself in. Later she became pregnant by a man in the resistance. But she arranged an abortion, and also arranged abortions for three other women, because she was convinced that "children had no right to be born" into such a world.         Dr. Szwajger later married Wladyslaw Swidowski, who died several years ago. She is survived by two daughters, Hanna and Alina, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, all in Poland.       
         Eren Ozker, an actress and a puppeteer with the Muppets, died on Thursday at her home in New York City. She was 44 and also kept a home in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, William Bogert.         Ms. Ozker (pronounced Oscar) was born in Ankara, Turkey, and grew up in Farmington Hills, Mich. After receiving a bachelor's degree in drama from the University of Michigan in 1970, she moved to New York and performed in Off Broadway productions at the Roundabout Theater, the Public Theater and the New Dramatists Guild. In 1975 she joined the Hartman Theater Company in Stamford, Conn., where she took the role of Marya in the theater's first production, "The Government Inspector," and met her husband, also an actor.         In 1976 Ms. Ozker joined the cast of "The Muppet Show," which was beginning its first season. She played the roles of Hilda, the wardrobe lady, and Wanda, an accident-prone vaudeville singer. She also performed in "The Muppet Movie" and "Emmett Otter's Jug Band Christmas," a television special produced by Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets.         In 1989, convinced that puppeteers required their own voice in the acting profession, she founded the Puppeteers Caucus, a working group within the Screen Actors Guild, and was its first chairwoman. In 1991, the guild presented her its Joseph C. Riley Award for outstanding service to the union.         In 1988 she appeared for the last time as a puppeteer in "The Warrior Ant" at the Next Wave Festival in Brooklyn.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by four sisters: Denise, of Brooklyn; Peri, of Newtonville, Mass.; Shawn, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Suzan, of Pompano Beach, Fla.       
         Sydelle Stephany Reisman, owner of the Westport (Conn.) Research Group and active in civic affairs in Westport, died on Wednesday in Norwalk Hospital. She was 65 and had homes in Westport and Carefree, Ariz.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         Mrs. Reisman, known as Syd, was born in New York City, graduated from New York University and held a master's degree in library science from Southern Connecticut State College. She was on the Westport Public Library staff before founding her company in 1985, providing computerized information to clients.         She is survived by her husband, Bert M.; two daughters, Robin Lee Reisman of Manhattan and Jodie Sue Reisman of Wilton, Conn.; a son, Michael J. of Manhattan; and a sister, Irene Topolcic of Virginia Beach, Va.       
         Sally A. Provence, professor emeritus in the Child Study Center and the Pediatrics Department at Yale University, died on Saturday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. She was 76 and lived at Branford.         The cause was cancer, said Dr. Albert J. Solnit, a longtime colleague.         For 35 years, Dr. Provence was director of the center's Child Development Unit. She retired in 1986. A pioneer in child development, both as a teacher and researcher, she documented young children's suffering and recovery from deprivation and trauma.         A founder and past president of the National Center for Clinical Infant Programs, she received many honors, including the C. Anderson Aldrich Award of the American Academy of Pediatrics.         Born in Wills Point, Tex., she graduated from the Baylor University College of Medicine. Among her many publications, she is best known for her book "Working with Disadvantaged Parents and Their Children" (Yale University Press, 1983).         She is survived by her companion and co-worker, Audrey Naylor of Branford, and a sister, Ada Belle Banta of Wills Point.       
         Andrea Boroff Eagan, a journalist, educator, union founder and advocate for women, died on Tuesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 49 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         The interwoven themes of her career were social change, group action, women's rights, health and writing. Her causes grew from beliefs she formed as a campus activist in the turbulent protests of the 1960's.         In a celebrated moment during the Columbia University protests in 1968, she and Richard Eagan were unofficially married in a seized building. A chaplain pronounced them "children of the New Age." They were later legally married by that same chaplain.  Feminist Advice for Girls         Drawing on her personal experiences, Ms. Eagan wrote the first feminist advice book for teen-age girls, "Why Am I So Miserable, if These Are the Best Years of My Life?" (Lippincott, 1976). Later she wrote "The Newborn Mother: Stages of Her Growth" (Little, Brown, 1985), about the psychological changes in women after childbirth.         She also wrote many newspaper and magazine articles, mostly on health and women. She was the editor of the National Women's Health Network Series for Pantheon Books and president of Healthright, a nonprofit organization.         Ms. Eagan was active in local and national efforts for abortion rights and other health and women's issues. She taught about them at New York University and at La Guardia, Manhattan Community and Hunter Colleges.         From 1983 to 1987 she served as the founding president of the National Writers Union, which won contracts for freelance writers at several national magazines. She was also a founding board member of the Writers Room, Manhattan office space for writers free of distractions.         Ms. Eagan, who graduated from Columbia in 1969, reaffirmed her protest-era beliefs in a 1988 interview in The Washington Post: "The fact is, we were absolutely correct in what we perceived as being wrong. We were in error only in that we weren't successful."         Her survivors include her mother, Dorothy Boroff of Manhattan; her husband, Richard, and two daughters, Molly and Daisy, the Tony-award winning child actress in "The Secret Garden."       
         Masha Tumarkin, who helped institute a new technique for teaching English to upwards of 50,000 recent immigrants in New York City, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 49 and was a Manhattan resident.         The cause of death was leukemia, her family said.         For several years she was the director of the English program for the New York Association for New Americans, a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that aids in resettlement. She employed a system by which students start speaking in English within 12 weeks, when conventional methods often take many months longer. She supervised development of texts and curriculum and teacher retraining.         The concept, developed by her predecessor, Ira Goetz, features a fast-paced, question-and-answer format in which the teacher moves about the classroom from one student to another.         Born in Manhattan to Russian immigrants, Ms. Tumarkin grew up in a bilingual home with relatives and neighbors speaking in accents. After graduating from Columbia, she earned a master's at New York University in teaching English as a second language. She taught English at City College before joining the association in 1980.         Her marriage to Ethan Gologor ended in a divorce that drew publicity for a custody accord in which the children shuttled between the mother's and father's homes on alternating days.         Her survivors include her husband of a year, Richard Girard; two sons, Matthew Gologor of Oberlin, Ohio, and Benjamin Gologor of Manhattan; her mother, Suzanne Tumarkin of Manhattan, and a sister, Nina Tumarkin of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Mildred Collins, president of Mildred Collins Inc., a Manhattan-based sales promotion and publicity company, died on Sunday at Tisch Hospital at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         Before founding her business in 1969, Miss Collins was vice president of sales promotion for the Stern Brothers department store chain, a division of the Allied Stores Corporation.         Miss Collins worked on a number of film promotions, among them "The Great Gatsby" in 1974, "Murder On the Orient Express" in 1974 and "Death on the Nile" in 1978.         She was born in St. Petersburg, Fla., and graduated from Wesleyan College in 1945. She began work with the Rich's department store chain in Atlanta, and became the head of its radio school. In 1948, the Association of the Junior Leagues of America brought her to New York as coordinator of its radio and television program. She then joined Stern's, where she was one of Allied's first women executives.         Miss Collins is survived by two sisters, Elsie Jenkins of St. Petersburg and Mary Collins of Manhattan, and several nieces and nephews.       
         Irene Claire Fromer, a retired teacher and artist, died on Tuesday at Doctors Hospital on Staten Island. She was 70 and lived on Staten Island and in St. Croix, V.I.         Her death was a result of a myocardial flu virus, said her husband of nearly 50 years, Dr. Stephen Fromer.         Mrs. Fromer, a graduate of Hunter College, earned a master's degree at Columbia University with a thesis on Herman Melville and the industrial revolution. She taught in the public schools and at one time worked for Merck & Company, writing abstracts on new drugs.         She was an expert in Haitian art and had some of her own work -- paintings, collages and sculptures -- shown at several exhibitions. Together with her husband, she worked at Medical Consultants V.I. in St. Croix, advising doctors on office management.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Fromer is survived by a son, Dr. Carl H., of Staten Island; a daughter, Dr. Sandra A. Stingle of Manhattan; her mother, Bella Siegel of Staten Island; a brother, Jack Siegel of New Rochelle, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Judith Grad, a former counsel to the New York City Board of Ethics who in later life became a psychotherapist, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 68.         The cause of death was heart failure, her family said.         A native of Brooklyn and graduate of Brooklyn College, she put herself through New York University Law School at night by working as a legal secretary. She was an editor of the N.Y.U. Law Review and graduated first in her class. Joined Law Department         During the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay, Miss Grad worked in the city's Law Department, rising to chief of the Opinions and Legislation Division. There, she helped draft the 1974 state law that repealed the requirement for corroboration of testimony in the prosecution of sex offenders.         In 1978, Mayor Edward I. Koch recruited Miss Grad for the Board of Ethics. As counsel, she was involved in the investigation of city officials and employees for financial interests or private interests that were in conflict with the proper discharge of official duties. One case arising during her tenure involved charges of corruption against Donald R. Manes, the Queens Borough President who committed suicide in 1986. She retired after about 10 years in office.         Prior to her ethics work, Miss Grad did pro bono work for Odyssey House, the drug and alcohol treatment organization in New York, and ran group counseling sessions for women there. This stirred her interest in psychotherapy, which she pursued after leaving public service. She trained with the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis and, at the time of her death, was treating patients as a psychotherapist.         She became a board member of the Metropolitan Center for Mental Health, a psychiatric clinic on the Upper West Side that helps people unable to afford private treatment. She was board president of the Metropolitan Institute for Training in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, which is associated with the center.         Miss Grad is survived by her sister, Charlotte Schiff-Jones of Manhattan.       
         Mrs. Silverstone co-founded the Jerusalem center with her husband, the late Murray Silverstone, former president of 20th Century Fox International. Dedicated in 1960, the center was designed to be a place where Jewish and Arab children could learn about their own and other people's cultures.         On a visit to Israel in 1949, Mrs. Silverstone, aided by her three daughters, produced a film titled "The Magnetic Tide" about Jews and Arabs living together. The amateur film was distributed nationally by 20th Century Fox and the proceeds went to Children to Palestine, an interfaith group started to save Jewish children in Europe during World War II.         She was also a patron of the arts. She was founder-director of the Scarsdale Cultural Center and regularly opened her gardens in Scarsdale for benefit concerts.         Mrs. Silverstone, who was born Dorothy Littman in Brooklyn, returned to school after her husband's death in 1969, receiving a bachelor's degree from Fordham University in 1984.         She is survived by three daughters, Marilyn Silverstone of Katmandu, Nepal, Barbara Garrison of Manhattan and Susan Darer of Beaconsfield, England; a brother, Dr. Leon Littman of Manhattan; four grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Kate Reid, an actress whose hundreds of roles included starring onstage in "Death of a Salesman," in the film "Atlantic City" and in television episodes of "Dallas," died on Saturday at her home in Stratford, Ontario. She was 62.         The cause of death was cancer, said her agent, Richard Schmenner.         For more than 40 years she was staple of stage, movies and television in the United States, Canada and Britain. A 1984 New York Times profile said, "Kate Reid may not be a household name to the general public, but she is to the theater industry, which knows her as an actress who works constantly."         Perhaps her most widely praised performance was as the wife of Dustin Hoffman's Willy Loman in the acclaimed revival of "Death of a Salesman" on Broadway in 1984 and for television in 1985.         "In the problematic role of the mother, Kate Reid is miraculously convincing," Frank Rich wrote in The Times, adding that "she somehow melds affection with pure steel." Richard Schickel said in Time magazine that her performance was "in its way as awesome as Hoffman's." A String of Nominations         Twice she was nominated for Tony Awards, first for co-starring with Alec Guinness in "Dylan" in 1964, then for her performance in "Slapstick Tragedy" on Broadway in 1965.         She was also twice nominated for Emmy Awards, for playing Queen Victoria in "The Invincible Mr. Disraeli" in 1963, then Mary Todd Lincoln in "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" in 1964. Both were "Hallmark Hall of Fame" productions.         In the 1981 film "Atlantic City," she won high marks for her portrayal of the reclusive, aging former beauty queen and sometime paramour of the small-time mobster played by Burt Lancaster.         Ms. Reid, whose voice was described as cello-toned, once said: "I'm a chameleon. There is something of everything I play in me."         Her stage work included many Shakespearean parts, especially at the Stratford Festival in Canada in the 1960's. Major Roles on Broadway         In her Broadway debut in 1962, she was praised for her performance as Martha in the matinee cast of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" In 1968, she co-starred in "The Price," by Arthur Miller. She played Big Mama in the 1974 revival of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Elizabeth Ashley, Keir Dullea and Fred Gwynne.         Her films include "The Andromeda Strain" (1971), "A Delicate Balance" (1973) and "Equus" (1977). Her many television roles included recurring appearances in "Dallas" as Aunt Lil Trotter.         Miss Reid was born in London and grew up in Toronto. She began acting while attending Havergal College, the University of Toronto and the Toronto Conservatory of Music, then formally studied acting under Uta Hagen at the Herbert Berghof Studio in New York City.         Her marriages to Michael Sadlier and Austin Willis ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son, Reid Willis of Edmonton, Alberta, and a daughter, Robin Willis of Manhattan.       
         Martha Dalrymple, a co-author of an exhaustive study of New York City landmarks, died on Monday in Portland, Ore., where she had moved 17 years ago. She was 89.         The cause of death was chronic lung disease and heart failure, said her half-sister, Joanna Stuart of Portland.         With Harmon H. Goldstone, a former chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Miss Dalrymple wrote "History Preserved: A Guide to New York City Landmarks and Historic Districts" (1974). The book included city landmarks dating from 1650 to 1930.         Mr. Goldstone, an architect, was a major force in establishing the Landmarks Commission and served as its chairman from 1968 to 1973. Miss Dalrymple worked for several years as a volunteer for the commission, and their collaboration on the 576-page volume was a result.         She was a 1925 graduate of the University of Wisconsin, and began her career as a journalist. She worked for The Chicago Journal and then for The Associated Press, reporting from New York City, Washington, London, Rome and Moscow. She was hired by Nelson A. Rockefeller for the Office of Inter-American Affairs, for which he was the coordinator. She also wrote a history of the American International Association for Economic and Social Development, entitled "The A.I.A. Story: Two Decades of International Cooperation" (1968).       
         Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won several Emmy awards for her work on Olympics broadcasts for ABC Sports, died yesterday at her home in West Tisbury, Mass. She was 63 and also lived in Vail, Colo.         The cause of death was cancer of the uterus, said her son, Robert P. Riger of Manhattan.         In 1973, Ms. Sanger became one of the first female producers in network television sports when she was hired by ABC to develop women's programs. Over the next decade, she produced dozens of programs for the network, including parts of Olympic broadcasts from Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1980 and Los Angeles in 1984.         She left ABC in 1985 and moved to London, but continued working part-time for the network and also produced programs for other organizations. She was a member of several professional groups and also was an adjunct lecturer in the media arts department at the University of Arizona.         Ms. Sanger was born Sept. 15, 1929, in Hong Kong and attended Smith College before earning a master's degree in public law and government at Columbia University. Before joining ABC Sports, she worked for several other television and news organizations.         In addition to her son, she is survived by three other children, Christopher Riger of Myrtle Beach, S.C., Victoria Riger Phillips of New Orleans, and Charlotte Riger Hull of West Tisbury, Mass.; a sister, Helen Sanger of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.         Correction:  March 9, 1993, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won Emmy awards for sports broadcasts, misidentified one of her residences. It was Vail, Ariz., not Colorado.       
         Julia Jones-Pugliese, who took up fencing as a New York University student in 1927 and five years later began a 60-year career as one the nation's premier coaches, died on Saturday after coaching Hunter College's men's team at a meet at St. John's.         She was 84, and according to her family, she suffered a heart attack at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan.         The first woman to coach a collegiate fencing team, Mrs. Jones-Pugliese led N.Y.U. to national championships in 1933 and 1938 and coached the Hunter team to a national title in 1970. She had been the Hunter coach since 1956.         For Mrs. Jones-Pugliese, stature was athletic destiny. Deciding she was too short to join the N.Y.U. basketball team, she took up fencing and helped found the National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association. The association, whose membership grew from 4 to more than 70 colleges, conducts what is considered the oldest collegiate championship for women in any sport.         Mrs. Jones-Pugliese's husband, Anthony Pugliese, a painter and sculptor, died in 1953. She is survived by a sister, Erma Stim of Plainview, L.I.; a daughter, Penelope Shaw, an instructor in modern dance and Yoga at Hunter; two sons, Patri, who teaches physics at Harvard, and Paul, a cartographer for Time magazine; six grandchildren, and one great grandson.       
         May Friend Goodman, who served for two decades as a representative of a leading international Jewish organization at the United Nations, died on Friday at her home in Cedarhurst, L.I. She was 85.         She died of heart failure, a family member said.         In 1952, Mrs. Goodman began her association as a nongovernmental representative at the United Nations through the World Union of Progressive Judaism. As a representative, she attended meetings of the Economic and Social Council and was an accredited spokeswoman for the World Union of Progressive Judaism. The World Union is the international body of Reform, Progressive, Liberal, and Reconstructionist Jews linking 1.5 million people in more than 20 countries.         Mrs. Goodman, who was born and educated in Chicago, graduated in 1930 from the University of Chicago. She wrote a number of plays for children sponsored by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. She also wrote book reviews for Chicago publications. She was married to Rabbi Abram Vossen Goodman, now rabbi emeritus of Temple Sinai of Long Island.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Gail G. Schulhoff of Baltimore, and Judith G. Richter of Merion, Pa., and four grandsons.       
         Ruth Bernice Schnurmacher, a New York philanthropist and benefactor of medical institutions, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital. A resident of Manhattan, she was 83.         Among her principal beneficiaries were the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Beth Israel Medical Center, which named its Schnurmacher Nursing Home last year in recognition of the many years of support received from her and her husband of 61 years, Adolph. She was a member of the Society of Founders at Albert Einstein.         The medical specialties in which she took an interest at those and other institutions included pediatrics, orthopedic surgery, cardiology, geriatric care, the treatment of AIDS patients and optometry.         The State University of New York's College of Optometry in Manhattan named its Institute of Vision Research in the couple's honor.         Mrs. Schnurmacher's husband survives her.       
         Rachel Davis DuBois, an educator who 60 years ago developed multicultural programs promoting respect for ethnic heritage and harmony between groups, died Tuesday at a hospital near her home in Woodstown, N.J. She was 101.         Counter to the philosophy of the time that promoted ethnic assimilation, Dr. Dubois was among the few educators preaching that differences should be celebrated. Her work drew on her own Quaker background and her discovery of children in southern New Jersey who felt inferior and ashamed of their Italian heritage.         "With the diversity of religious and racial groups in this country, tolerance and understanding demand some appreciation of the group contributions in culture," she said in 1933.         Dr. DuBois wrote books and founded several private groups: the Inter-Cultural Education Workshop, Fellowship Farm, Workshop for Cultural Democracy, Livingroom Gatherings and the Atlanta Dialogue Center. Festivals With a Purpose         She developed a widely copied technique called group conversation that uses a common experience, like spring festivals, for people to learn about each other's customs, which often prove similar.         At New York City schools, she organized festivals on the music, dance and food of different cultures and presented plays portraying friction and harmony.         For the U.S. Education Department, she developed a radio series, "Americans All, Immigrants All," in 1940. In 1951 the State Department sent her to Germany to work with peoples resettled after World War II.         She was involved in peace and civil rights efforts and worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Margaret Mead, among others.         A native of Clarksboro, N.J., she graduated from Bucknell University and received a doctorate at Columbia. She taught there and at New York University. Her husband, Nathan, died in 1915.       
         Barbara Stoler Miller, chairwoman of the Asian and Middle Eastern Cultures Department at Barnard College, died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center yesterday. She was 52 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, said Beverly Solochek, spokeswoman for the college.         A member of the Barnard faculty since 1968, she was the Samuel R. Milbank Professor of Asian and Middle Eastern Culture. Professor Miller was best known for translations of Sanskrit literature, including "The Bhagavad-Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War" (Bantam Books and Columbia University Press, 1986).         She was also an adviser to Peter Brooks on "The Mahabharata," performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1987 and broadcast on public television.         Her first marriage, to Dr. James Robert Miller, ended in divorce.         Surviving are her husband, Max Greenwood; a daughter, Gwenn Miller; her mother, Sarah Stoler of Stowe, Vt.; a brother, Will Stoler, of Montpelier, Vt., and her sister, Ann Stoler of Ann Arbor, Mich.       
         Dr. Alice Ettinger, who helped to bring new X-ray techniques to diagnose gastrointestinal illness to the United States and taught radiology for five decades at the Tufts University School of Medicine, died on April 14 at the Norwood Retirement and Nursing Home in Norwood, Mass. She was 93 years old.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said her nephew, Michael Roemer.         Dr. Ettinger was a highly regarded teacher who developed the first radiology residency program at Tufts and practiced at the New England Medical Center in Boston for nearly 40 years.         Alice Ettinger was born in Berlin on Oct. 8, 1899, four years after Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen discovered the X-ray. She received her medical degree from the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg, Germany, in 1924 and went on to a residency at the Charite Hospital of Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. She received intensive training in radiology from Dr. Hans Heinrich Berg, a pioneer in X-rays of the stomach and intestines. A 1932 Trip Is Crucial         At the time, radiologists had a device, the fluoroscope, that used X-rays to cast an image of the bowel on a screen. But it did not leave a permanent record, and Dr. Berg designed and built a machine, the spot-film device, that captured the fluoroscopic image on film so it could be studied later.         When Tufts asked Dr. Berg for the new device, he sent Dr. Ettinger off in 1932 with the machine in her luggage. Her arrival helped to launch modern gastrointestinal radiology in this country.         She joined the faculty at Tufts that year and remained for the rest of her career. She became clinical professor of radiology in 1950 and was chairwoman of the radiology department from 1959 to 1965, when she became professor emeritus. In 1939 she was made roentgenologist-in-chief at the Boston Dispensary and the New England Medical Center Hospital, and in 1965 she became senior radiologist at the medical center.         She continued as a clinician and teacher at Tufts until 1970, when at age 71 she became a consultant and director of student teaching, overseeing the radiology teaching program at the medical school until 1985 and teaching an elective course. For at least 13 consecutive years, she received the faculty teaching award from the graduating class at Tufts.         Dr. Ettinger's efforts also led to one of the earliest formal training programs for X-ray technologists, at Northeastern University. Among the awards she received was the Gold Medal of the American College of Radiology.         In addition to Mr. Roemer, of Yonkers, she is survived by a niece, Marianne Shoopak of Sunnyvale, Calif.       
         Patricia Peardon, the actress who created the central role in "Junior Miss" on Broadway, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said her daughter Christine Noel Cameron of Manhattan.         Miss Peardon grew up in Allendale, N.J., and first began acting at the age of 8 on such radio programs as "Cavalcade of America" and "March of Time."  A Sassy Teen-Ager         In 1941, when she was 17, she made her Broadway debut at the Lyceum Theater in the hit comedy "Junior Miss," after having been discovered in an audition by the play's director, Moss Hart. Miss Peardon originated the role of Judy Graves, a sassy but frequently muddled adolescent.         Miss Peardon "is acting the central part of the younger sister like an inspired bear cub," said Brooks Atkinson in his review in The New York Times.         While starring in the play, Miss Peardon appeared on the cover of Life on Dec. 11, 1941, the week after Pearl Harbor was bombed; it was too late for the magazine's editors to change the cover.         In the early 1950's she acted in the television series "Johnny Jupiter," and in 1955, on Broadway, she played the spitfire younger daughter in the Tony Award-winning play "The Desperate Hours," acting with Paul Newman and Karl Malden.         In the 1950's and 60's, Miss Peardon toured with Arnold Moss's Shakespeare Festival Players in "The Tempest," "Measure for Measure," "Twelfth Night," "King Lear" and "Love's Labour's Lost," and performed in the 1960's at the American Festival Theater at Stratford, Conn.  As a Sculptor         In 1966, she began exhibiting and selling cast bronze sculptures, which were displayed three times in the windows at Tiffany & Company in Manhattan. Her work was also shown at many galleries, at Tufts University, and at the Metropolitan Opera House and Avery Fisher Hall.         Miss Peardon was married three times: to Peter Kalischer, a broadcast journalist; to Peter Brandt Harmon, a writer, and to Richard Horner, a producer. The marriages ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Cameron, she is survived by another daughter, Anne Cameron of Albuquerque, N.M., and a grandson, Alexander Cameron Little.       
         Grace Lansing Lambert, a philanthropist and breeder of champion dogs and horses, died on Thursday at The Medical Center at Princeton, in Princeton, N.J. A resident of Princeton, she was 93.         The cause of death was pneumonia and advanced Parkinson's disease, according to the death certificate.         Mrs. Lambert was the widow of Gerard Barnes Lambert, her second husband, whose family's fortune was built on Listerine mouthwash and the manufacturing concern that became part of the Warner-Lambert Company. Mr. Lambert, an international yachtsman, died in 1967 at the age of 80.         Mrs. Lambert served on the boards of the Pierpont Morgan Library, Princeton University Library and Art Museum, and the University of Pennsylvania, among others. The Lamberts' former Princeton home, Albemarle, now houses the American Boychoir School, one of her beneficiaries.         Mrs. Lambert's Harrowby Kennels in Hopewell, N.J., bred show and field-trial dogs. She also raised Morgan horses, a breed of light horses.         A native of Canandaigua, N.Y., she married Mr. Lambert in 1936 after her first marriage, to John Mull, ended in divorce.         Mrs. Lambert is survived by two stepdaughters, Rachel Mellon of Upperville, Va., and Lily McCarthy of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; seven grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.       
         Tess Cogen, a lawyer, psychotherapist and college professor, died on Thursday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. She was 88.         The cause of death was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         She taught family life and sex education at Pace University for nine years before becoming professor emeritus.         She was a consultant and co-author of a six-volume series on family life and sex education written for students in the fifth to ninth grades.         She was a member of the citywide advisory council of the New York City Board of Education and a member of its curriculum committee on sex education.         Born in Russia in 1904, Mrs. Cogen came to the United States in 1907. She earned a bachelor of laws degree from the Brooklyn Law School of St. Lawrence University in 1925. She practiced law in the late 1920's and early 1930's.         In 1959 Mrs. Cogen graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in psychology from Hunter College, where she was a Phi Beta Kapa. Two years later, she received a master's degree in psychology from Columbia University's Teachers College.         Surviving are her husband of 63 years, Charles Cogen; two sons, Joel, and Edward; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

         Dr. Lillian Batlin Garvey, a family physician who practiced on the Upper East Side for 47 years, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.

She was instrumental in organizing the 150th anniversary commemoration of the 1839 rebellion of 53 kidnapped Africans on the slave ship Amistad who were jailed in New Haven for mutiny but were eventually freed. She called the episode "a tale of triumph."         A native of Mount Vernon, N.Y., Dr. Boone graduated from Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree in social sciences at Columbia.         Next she studied at the University of Ghana, where she became friendly with visiting black Americans, including Malcolm X, Maya Angelou and W.E.B. Du Bois.

She was 98 and also had residences in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., Locust Valley, L.I., and Manhattan.         She died in her sleep.         Mrs. Sanford reigned over Palm Beach society for half a century.

In Palm Beach, they lived in a mansion, Los Incas, near the winter home of Rose Kennedy, who became Mrs. Sanford's close friend. The Sanfords regularly entertained a wide variety of notables, including the King and Queen of Jordan and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.         Mrs. Sanford was a native of Richmond. She attended Cornell University for a year but dropped out to become an actress. She had an early success in the lead role in "Shanghai Gesture" at the Martin Beck Theater on Broadway.         She later went to Hollywood, where she co-starred with Marion Davies in "Five and Ten." Miss Davies introduced her to Mr. Sanfordafter a polo match in Santa Barbara, Calif.         Mrs. Sanford is survived by a niece, A. Maxine Warner of Alexandria, Va., and a grandniece.       
         Dr. Monica Healea, physics professor emeritus and former chairman of the physics department at Vassar College, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 93.         Dr. Healea, who was born in Uhrichsville, Ohio, was a resident of Pleasant Valley, N.Y., until nine years ago. She earned her B.A. and M.A. degrees at Bryn Mawr College and held a Ph.D. from Harvard University. She joined the Vassar faculty in 1933 and retired in 1962.         Dr. Healea published research papers on the interaction of beams of electrons with metal surfaces. During World War II, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she helped develop the magnetron into a power source for an aerial navigation system. Later, she worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory as it was being readied for work on nuclear physics.         After reaching emeritus status at Vassar, she spent several years at Harvard with a group studying the atomic physics of the upper atmosphere.         In retirement she became an artist who exhibited her abstract canvases in Dutchess County and in New York City.  In her 80's, she worked with acrylic paints to explore the interplay of color and design. She was a member of the Dutchess County Art Association and the Mill Street Loft, an arts-education center in Poughkeepsie.         Dr. Healea is survived by a sister, Edith Everett, and a niece, Mildred Barnett, both of Fresno, Calif.       
         Maggie Hemingway, a British novelist, died on May 9, the British press reported late last week. She was 47 and lived in London and in Deal, a seaside resort near Dover.         The cause was defective functioning of the blood-forming organs, The Daily Telegraph said.         Ms. Hemingway won the Royal Society of Literature's Winifred Holtby Prize for her first novel, "The Bridge," which was published in Britain in 1986 and won critical praise there and in the United States.         Reviewing Atheneum's American edition in February 1987 in The New York Times Book Review, Eden Ross Lipson, an editor of the Book Review, wrote, "If you like your tea and fiction delicately seasoned and served exquisitely, this novel may be a perfect midwinter cup."         Ms. Hemingway was a distant relative of Ernest Hemingway, The Times of London said. She was born in Orford, in eastern Suffolk, studied at Edinburgh University and worked in publishing until "The Bridge" came out. Her other published novels are "Stop House Blues" (1988) and "The Postmen's House" (Trafalgar, 1992). She finished a fourth work of fiction, "Eyes," before she died.         Ms. Hemingway was separated from her husband and is survived by two daughters.       
         Elizabeth Montgomery, a costume and set designer and a founding partner of the design company Motley, died on Saturday at her home in London. She was 91.         Miss Montgomery was born in Kid lington, Oxfordshire, and grew up in Cambridge, England. She attended Westminster Art School in London, studying portrait painting with Walter Sickert. In 1932, she and two other art students, Margaret Harris and Sophia Harris, founded a theatrical design group, which they named Motley, an allusion to the line "Motley's the only wear" from "As You Like It."         Motley created its first costumes for "Romeo and Juliet," directed by John Gielgud at Oxford University, and the company soon made its mark with costumes for his production of "Richard of Bordeaux." The Gielgud collaboration continued for the next decade. The company created sets and costumes for more than 30 Old Vic productions. An American Branch         In 1940, Miss Montgomery and Margaret Harris traveled to the United States as the costume designers for "Romeo and Juliet," starring Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. After marrying the writer Robert P. Wilmot, Miss Montgomery took up residence in the United States.         As the American branch of Motley, she and Miss Harris created costumes for Katharine Cornell in "The Doctor's Dilemma" and "The Three Sisters" in the early 1940's. Miss Harris returned to Britain in 1946. Miss Montgomery's later Broadway credits include "Anne of the Thousand Days," "Peter Pan" "South Pacific," "The Most Happy Fella," "Paint Your Wagon" and "Can-Can."         In 1958, her costumes for "The First Gentleman" won a Tony Award. That year she designed sets and costumes for "Il Trovatore" at the Metropolitan Opera.         Motley created the costumes for the David Lean film "Great Expectations," and Miss Montgomery designed the costumes for "Oklahoma!," "Little Women" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night."         The partners in Motley wrote two books, "Designing and Making Stage Costumes" (1964, reissued by Routledge in 1992) and "Theater Props" (1975).         She is survived by a son, John Wilmot of Fremantle, Australia, and four stepdaughters: Patricia Christgau of Woodbury, Conn., Dorothy Zinbardi of Brentwood, L.I., Roberta Wilmot of Idaho and Joan Clarke of Spokane, Wash.       
         Alice Green Fredman, professor emeritus of English and comparative literature at Columbia University and an authority on the 18th- and 19th-century novel, died on Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 68 and lived in Carmel, N.Y.         Her husband, Irwin F. Fredman, said she had had a heart attack.         Dr. Fredman began teaching English at Columbia in 1953 and became a full professor in 1972, retiring in 1991. While most of her career was in the School of General Studies, she also directed graduate studies in the English department from the late 1970's.         She was the author of many articles and books, mainly on English novelists.  At her death, she was working on a critical biography of Mary Shelley.         Her best-known book, "Diderot and Sterne" (Columbia University Press, 1955) won the Clarke F. Ansley Award by Columbia and was reprinted in 1973 by Farrar, Strauss & Giroux. Other books include "Anthony Trollope," published in 1971 by Columbia University Press in its Modern Writers Series.         In 1962, she received a fellowship from The American Council of Learned Societies for postdoctoral research. Twice recently, she refused teaching awards, saying it would be better to encourage younger colleagues.         She was born in New York City. A graduate of Swarthmore College, she earned a master's degree from Smith College and a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1953.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Lisa of Baltimore and Catherine of Manhattan, and a sister, Helen Neuburg of Princeton, N.J.       
         Mary Spencer Nay, a painter and retired art professor, died on Saturday at her home in Provincetown, Mass. She was 80.         The cause was gastrointestinal illness, said her daughter Malu Nay Block of Provincetown.         Ms. Nay was born in Crestwood, Ky., and graduated from the University of Louisville with a master's degree. She began teaching art at the university in 1942 and was a professor of art education when she retired in 1979.         She settled in Provincetown, where she had spent summers since 1937. She was active in the Provincetown Art Association and Museum, the Heritage Museum, the Historical Association and the Visual Artists Cooperative.         Her paintings, mainly abstractions inspired by Provincetown and her travels in Mexico, hang in numerous museums and private collections. The J. B. Speed Art Museum in Louisville presented a retrospective of her work in 1976.         In addition to her daughter Malu, she is survived by another daughter, Fayette Block, also of Provincetown; a sister, Dorothy Nay Carter of Vine Grove, Ky.; a brother, Benjamin Franklin Nay of Bremerton, Wash., and two grandchildren.       
         Maria Tolstoy, a professor of Russian language and a granddaughter of the novelist Leo Tolstoy, died on Monday at home in Manhattan. She was 85.         She had a brief illness, said Cynthia Whittaker, a friend.         Ms. Tolstoy fled her native Russia after the Bolshevik revolution, resettled in Czechoslovakia, then left there in 1939 to escape the Nazis and World War II.         Arriving by ship in America in 1940, she said, "I believe, with my grandfather, that every person, every country, has a right to freedom." She helped Soviet and German emigres publish political material, worked on foreign broadcasts of Radio Liberty and assisted the United States Army.         Ms. Tolstoy, whose mother was Irish, was fluent in both English and Russian. Her parents met when her father visited Ireland to buy race horses. Active in Politics         She taught Russian at Cornell, Columbia and Indiana Universities, at the University of Michigan and at Hunter College. She retired from Hunter in 1980 but continued tutoring students the rest of her life.         Ms. Tolstoy was active in American politics as a Republican but also supported Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and was state co-chairwoman of Republicans for Cuomo.         She was also known for her published Russian poetry on the solitude of the emigre. With the recent fall of Communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, she expressed interest in a return visit to her native country but was too frail to make the trip.         Ms. Tolstoy left the Soviet Union in 1925 at the age of 17. She completed her studies for a doctorate in Slavic linguistics at Charles University in Prague, but the Nazis shut down the school before it granted the degree.         Her marriage to Vladimir Mansvetov ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Tatiana Benetkova of Prague, and two grandchildren.       
         Dorothy B. Hughes, a mystery writer as well as a critic and historian of mystery fiction, died on Thursday at her home in Ashland, Ore. She was 88.         She died of complications from a stroke, said her daughter Suzy Sarna.         Ms. Hughes wrote 14 mystery novels, most of them set in the Southwest and involving an upper-class hero caught up in evil intrigue. Her best-known works include "The Cross-Eyed Bear" (1940), "Ride the Pink Horse" (1946), "The Expendable Man" (1964) and "In a Lonely Place" (1947), which was made into a movie starring Humphrey Bogart. In 1979 she won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America, of which she was a founding member, for her critical biography "Erle Stanley Gardner: The Case of the Real Perry Mason" (1978).         Ms. Hughes was born in Kansas City, Mo., and received a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri. She also studied at the University of New Mexico and Columbia University. After working as a reporter and women's editor in the 1920's, she began reviewing crime fiction for The Albuquerque Tribune, The Los Angeles News, The Los Angeles Mirror and The New York Herald Tribune. In 1961 she began reviewing for The Los Angeles Times.         In 1978, the Mystery Writers of America gave her its Grand Master Award in recognition of her life's work in fiction and criticism.         In addition to her daughter Suzy, of Anacortes, Wash., she is survived by a brother, Frank Flanagan, of Phoenix; a sister, Calla Haye, of Santa Fe; another daughter, Holly Hughes of Rowe, N.M.; a son, Antony A. Hughes, of El Paso, Tex.; 10 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Dame Freya Stark, a resourceful and scholarly travel writer who was the first Westerner to journey through many regions of the Middle East, died on Sunday at her home in Asolo in northeast Italy. She was 100..         Dame Freya, who was born in Paris and grew up in several homes in England and Italy, wrote 24 travel books and autobiographies and eight volumes of letters from the 1930's to the 1980's. Many of the books have been reprinted several times, recently by Transatlantic Arts and Overlook Press, among other houses, and were based on often hazardous journeys by vehicle, camel and donkey.         Dame Freya's books about the Middle East and nearby countries were called lucid, spontaneous and elegant and were lauded for imparting an inspired sense of both history and people. The consensus of reviewers was that she wrote with spirit, authority and humor and that she was a consummate traveler because of her fearlessness, candor, charm, idealism and streak of naivete.         In a foreword to "The Journey's Echo: Selections From Freya Stark" (1964), the writer Lawrence Durrell praised her as a "poet of travel" and "one of the most remarkable women of our age." Many Languages and Dialects         Dame Freya was essentially self-taught. In her youth, she became fluent in Arabic and Turkish, and over the years she mastered other languages and many dialects. It was a talent that served her well in the course of a venturesome life as reflected in the titles of her books: "Baghdad Sketches" (1933 and 1937), "The Valleys of the Assassins and Other Persian Travels" (1934, 1972 and 1978), "The Southern Gates of Arabia: A Journey in the Hadhramaut" (1936 and 1972), "A Winter in Arabia" (1940, 1972 and 1987), "Letters From Syria" (1942), "The Freya Stark Story" (1953), "Alexander's Path" (1958 and 1988) and "Gateways and Caravans: A Portrait of Turkey" (1971).         Freya Madeline Stark was born in Paris on Jan. 31, 1893, to Robert Stark, a British sculptor, and Flora Stark, a painter and pianist. Her parents separated in her childhood, and her formal education was mainly at the University of London and the nearby School of Oriental and African Studies.         In World War I she was a nurse in Italy, and in World War II she worked for the British Information Ministry, earning prominence and honors for enhancing British influence and countering Axis propaganda in Aden, Yemen, Egypt, Iraq and India. In Cairo, she founded the Brotherhood of Freedom, a democratic anti-Fascist movement.         Years later, she observed that Britain eventually lost India and prestige throughout the Middle East because of "a lack of clearness and faith in our own values." Honors and Godchildren         She was awarded a Cross of the British Empire in 1953 and was named a Dame of the British Empire in 1972.         In 1947, when she was 54, she married Stewart Perowne, a diplomat and historian. They separated in 1952 but did not divorce. Mr. Perowne died in 1989. They had no children, but Dame Freya had many godchildren, in many countries.         One godson, Malise Ruthven, wrote a 144-page tribute, "Traveler Through Time: A Photographic Journey With Freya Stark," which was published in 1986. In the book, he observed: "Freya never lost her passion for acquiring fresh knowledge and new skills. Writing, like travel, she saw as the pursuit of truth."         At 93, as she was planning a trip to Spain, Dame Freya was asked about death. She replied, "I feel about it as about the first ball, or the first meet of hounds, anxious as to whether one will get it right, and timid and inexperienced -- all the feelings of youth."       
         Bernice Feinstein, a former lecturer on music history at George Washington University, died on Sunday at King Edward VII Hospital in Bermuda. She was 67 and lived in McLean, Va.         She was stricken during a vacation and died after heart surgery, said her son John, who lives in Bethesda, Md. She was in Bermuda with her family to celebrate her 40 years of marriage to Martin Feinstein, general director of the Washington Opera.         A native of Manhattan, the former Bernice Richman graduated from Smith College and earned a master's degree in music from Barnard College and a doctorate in music from Columbia University.         Her association with George Washington University began after her husband, a former vice president of Sol Hurok Concerts in New York, was named executive director of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. From 1976 until two years ago, she taught courses on the history of Western music and opera history.         In addition to her husband and son John, Mrs. Feinstein is survived by another son, Robert, and a daughter, Margaret, both of McLean, and a brother, Peter Richman of Lexington, Mass.       
         Joan S. Harrison, associate dean of studies at Sarah Lawrence College, died on Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 59 and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.         The cause was complications of lymphoma, her family said.         A native of Orange, N.J., she graduated magna cum laude from Tufts University. She earned an M.A. degree in Arabic history from Harvard University, an M.S. in administration from Bank Street College and, in 1988, a Ph.D. in human development from Union Graduate School in Cincinnati.         She came to Sarah Lawrence in 1973 as an assistant to the dean of studies. She was promoted to assistant dean the following year and to associate dean in 1980.         Graduates and friends of the college's Center for Continuing Education endowed a scholarship in her name last November. In April she received the annual Carol Russett Award from the American Council on Education/National Identification Program for the Advancement of Women in Higher Education Administration.         Dr. Harrison is survived by her husband, David; a son, Andy of Evanston, Ill.; a daughter, Rachel Harrison of Brooklyn; her parents, Rose and Harry Horowitz of Deerfield Beach, Fla., and a sister, Eleanor Dain of Kingston, R.I.       
         Beatrice Bishop Berle, a physician, teacher and author, died on Friday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass.  She was 90 years old.         Her death was caused by complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Beatrice Berle Meyerson.         Dr. Berle, who ran a neighbhorhood health clinic in East Harlem from 1953 until 1962, took a pioneering approach to family medicine by treating the entire family for the effects of heroin abuse by a member. She also helped to establish methadone maintenance as a significant treatment for heroin abuse.         Dr. Berle, who was born on Aug. 6, 1902, in Lenox, Mass, graduated from Vassar College in 1923. She received a master's degree in history from Columbia University in 1924 and a medical degree from New York University in 1938.         In 1927 she married Adolf A. Berle Jr., an economist and lawyer who served during the Roosevelt Administration as Assistant Secretary of State. Dr. Berle worked in the United States Public Health Service in Washington from 1943 until 1944. Worked in Brazil         Traveling to Brazil with her husband, who was Ambassador to Brazil from 1945 until 1946, Dr. Berle volunteered in hospital wards in Rio de Janeiro, where she organized efforts to expand the practice of preventive medicine. She also wrote articles and edited a book on medical problems in Brazil.         Her other books were "Eighty Puerto Rican Families in New York City," a study of the families in her East Harlem clinic, published by Columbia University Press in 1958, and "A Life in Two Worlds," an autobiography published in in 1983 by Walker & Company.         During her career, Dr. Berle was associated with St. Luke's Hospital Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at the Bronx State Hospital, Cornell University Medical College, New York University Medical College and Yeshiva University.         After the death of her first husband in 1971, Dr. Berle in 1975 married Dr. Andre F. Cournand, a physican who was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1956. Dr. Cournand died in 1988.         In addition to Ms. Meyerson, of Washington, Dr. Berle is survived by another daughter, Alice Berle Crawford of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a son, Peter A. A. Berle of Manhattan; 10 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Florence W. Hartstein, a leader in Jewish community organizations in this country and in Israel, died on Friday at the Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her son, Norman.         At the time of her death, Mrs. Hartstein was vice president of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue's Women's Club, co-president of AMIT, the national Zionist organization of religious women, and a board member of Re'uth, an international Jewish social service agency based in Israel.         Mrs. Hartstein lived in Manhattan.  She was the widow of Dr. Jacob I. Hartstein, dean of the graduate schools of Yeshiva University and Long Island University, who died in 1991.         Besides her son Norman of Los Angeles, she is survived by another son, Kalman, of Woodmere, L.I., and three grandchildren.       
         Virginia Moore, a poet and biographer, died on Friday at Westmoreland, a nursing home affiliated with Lake Forest Hospital in Lake Forest, Ill.

She earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Hollins College in Roanoke, Va., and a master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University. She began her career as a poet, publishing three volumes of lyric verse: "Not Poppy" (1926), "Sweet Water and Bitter" (1929), and "Homer's Golden Chain" (1937).         She was on the board of the Jefferson-Madison Regional Library and the Scottsville Museum.         She is survived by John Fitzallen Moore of Libertyville, Ill., a son by her first husband, the poet Louis Untermeyer; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Steinway Chapin, a member of the New York State Council on the Arts and a volunteer for many other cultural organizations, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was bone cancer, said her husband, Schuyler G. Chapin, who is dean emeritus of Columbia University's School of the Arts and a former general manager of the Metropolitan Opera.         Mrs. Chapin was a scion of the piano-making Steinway family. She had been on the Arts Council, which administers grants to arts organizations, since 1978. At her death, she was also the senior trustee of the Harlem School of the Arts.         She retired recently as chairman of the Alliance of Resident Theaters-New York, and from the boards of the Professional Children's School and the New York Revels. In addition, she had been a trustee of the Dalton School, where she was also employed for many years, in a variety of positions.

         Margaret M. Bryant, an expert on grammar, linguistics, proverbs and folklore, died on Monday at a retirement center in Clemson, S.C. She was 92.

         Muriel Clara Bradbrook, a leading British authority on Shakespeare who taught at Girton College at Cambridge University, died on June 11 in Cambridge. She was 84 and lived there.         Professor Bradbrook, who wrote as M. C. Bradbrook, was the first woman to become a professor of English at Cambridge. She held her professorship from 1965 to 1976 and was the Mistress of Girton from 1968 to 1976.         She was known for her conviction that Shakespeare's writing was "the product of the economic, social and theatrical pressures of his time," as The Independent described it in reporting her death on Saturday. Her views were set out in her books "The Rise of the Common Player" (1962) and "Shakespeare the Craftsman" (1969).         In the United States, Professor Bradbrook was in residence at the Folger Library, in Washington, and at the Huntington Library, in California, in 1958 and 1959; a visiting scholar at Kenyon College, in Ohio, in 1977, and an honorary member of the Modern Language Association of America.         Several of her other books are in print in the United States.       
         Pat Nixon, the quiet consort who stood by her husband, Richard M. Nixon, in the White House and out, through victory, defeat, sorrow and illness, died yesterday at their home in Park Ridge, N.J. She was 81.         Mrs. Nixon, who had been ill for several years, died of lung cancer, said Kim Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Nixon family.         She said former President Nixon and the Nixons' two daughters, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, were with Mrs. Nixon when she died at 5:45 A.M. She also said that Mr. Nixon, who visited Russia in February and China in April, was "in excellent health as evidenced by his recent travel schedule."         Commenting on Mrs. Nixon's death, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said, "Pat Nixon was an extraordinarily supportive First Lady, particularly good in her judgment of people."         Former President Ronald Reagan issued a statement that Mrs. Nixon was "a pillar of great strength during a time of turmoil." Dislike of Politics         On the eve of Richard Nixon's inauguration as President in 1969, Pat Nixon was asked if she had ever encouraged her husband to enter politics.         "No," she replied. "I did not. Politics was not what I would have chosen for him because, after all, you don't see as much of your husband as you would like and it's a hard life."         But, she went on, Mr. Nixon was convinced that politics was his duty.         "What could I do?" she said.         What Mrs. Nixon did was subjugate her instinct for privacy and homemaking and become her husband's faithful companion in his turbulent years in the political arena, from the happy early years after his election as United States Representative from California in 1946 until his humiliating resignation as President of the United States in August 1974, under the shadow of impeachment proceedings that grew out of the Watergate scandals.         In Mr. Nixon's years as Representative, Senator, Vice President, candidate for governor of California, Presidential candidate and President, his wife was a fixture at his side, always seeming to listen raptly to his speeches and maintaining a gracious, if thin, smile.         In 1968, the writer Gloria Steinem interviewed Mrs. Nixon aboard an airplane while she was accompanying her husband on the Presidential campaign.  In the New York magazine article, Ms. Steinem quoted Mrs. Nixon as saying: "Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I've stayed interested in people, I've kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank-you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I've never had it easy. I'm not like all you . . . all those people who had it easy." Image as President's Wife         Although her years before the public exceeded those of her two predecessors at the White House, Mrs. Nixon did not seem to stamp her personality on the nation's consciousness. Instead, her image was of a private, dutiful wife seemingly self-contained and impenetrable.         Her composure rarely wavered in her appearances with her husband in such trying circumstances as his televised Checkers speech in 1952, when he denied unethical use of an $18,000 political fund ("Pat doesn't have a mink coat"), the ordeal in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1958, when a stone-throwing, spitting, anti-American mob besieged the Nixon limousine; and the Nixons' grim, hand-in-hand walk down a red carpet from the White House after his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974.         Despite the early traumas and Mrs. Nixon's wish that her husband retire from politics, she was enthusiastic enough on the eve of his nomination as the Republican Presidential candidate in 1968 to say, "This really is the American dream, where people from humble circumstances can, through sheer hard work, go up the ladder." Humble Origins in West         Her own origins had, indeed, been humble. She was born Thelma Catherine Ryan on March 16, 1912, in the small mining town of Ely, Nev. Her father, William, an itinerant miner of Irish-American ancestry, gave her the nickname Pat because of her birth on the eve of St. Patrick's Day.         Before she was a year old, her mother, Kate, a German-born woman with a son and daughter from a previous marriage, prevailed on her husband to leave the mines. The family moved to Artesia, Calif., about 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and started a truck farm on a four-acre plot that had little plumbing and no electricity.         "We all worked hard," Mrs. Nixon recalled years later. "We dug potatoes, we picked tomatoes, we picked peppers, cauliflowers and peanuts."         In 1924, when Pat was 12, her mother died of cancer.         "For the last two or three months I used to sit with her through the night," she said years later. "We couldn't afford a night nurse and she needed attention."         Five years after her mother's death, Pat's jolly, blue-eyed father, whom she adored, died of the miner's disease, silicosis. Cross-Country Trip         The five children in the family soon split up. Pat, at the age of 18, at the height of the Depression, set out for New York, driving an elderly couple across the country in their Packard.         For two years, until 1932, she worked in New York as a secretary and X-ray technician. The money she saved eventually got her back to California and into the University of Southern California, where her major was merchandising. Walk-on parts on Hollywood movie sets helped finance her education.         She graduated cum laude in 1937 and tried unsuccessfully to find work as a buyer for a department store. So she took a job at $190 a month teaching shorthand and typing at a secondary school in Whittier, Calif.         She was also interested in amateur theater, and at auditions for the play "The Dark Tower" one night in 1938, she met Richard M. Nixon, a recent graduate of Duke Law School who had set up practice in Whittier.         Both won parts in the play that night, and the young Nixon proposed to her a few hours later.         "I thought he was crazy," she said in 1969.         Mr. Nixon courted her for two years, sometimes even driving her to meet other beaus, before she accepted the proposal. Married in Riverside         They were married June 21, 1940, in a Quaker ceremony in Riverside, Calif. The bride was 28 years old, and Mr. Nixon was 10 months younger.         After finishing his naval service in 1945, Mr. Nixon decided to run for the House of Representatives. Just before the campaign started, the Nixons' older daughter, Patricia (Tricia), was born, on Feb. 21, 1946. In Representative Nixon's first term, another daughter, Julie, was born, on July 5, 1948.         Two years later, Mr. Nixon began a successful campaign for the Senate. While he generated controversy with his anti-Communist campaign speeches, his wife was portrayed in the press as projecting what would later be called a "20th-century born-in-a-log-cabin image."         She also began projecting the image of game and gracious campaigner, always able to suppress distress and bitterness.         As the President's wife, Mrs. Nixon traveled more than 100,000 miles, campaigning for her husband, accompanying him to foreign countries and, on several occasions, representing him at ceremonies abroad. Foreign Affairs Duties         She was the first wife of a President designated to head a United Nations delegation abroad, to the inauguration of President William R. Tolbert Jr. of Liberia in 1972. She also visited Peru in 1970 to see areas devastated by an earthquake, and in early 1974 she headed the United States delegation to inaugural ceremonies for the Presidents of Brazil and Venezuela.         Mrs. Nixon promoted various education programs and sought to enlist Americans in volunteer aid programs.         She shied away from adopting any publicity-inspiring projects like Jacqueline Kennedy's historical redecoration of the White House. Instead, she seemed to enjoy a more traditional and limited role in the White House, as Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower had.         Nixon White House receptions and dinners were frequent, but small and sedate, with none of the exuberance of the Kennedy and Johnson Presidencies. Only in receiving-line chitchat and in quiet little teas and receptions at the mansion did the real warmth and thoughtfulness of Mrs. Nixon's personality emerge. Seclusion at San Clemente         After her husband's resignation, Mrs. Nixon remained in seclusion for nine months with him at their estate in San Clemente, Calif., and moved to New York in 1980.         In the summer of 1976, Mrs. Nixon suffered a stroke that partly paralyzed her left arm and leg and the left side of her face for about a year. She had another stroke in the early 1980's and fully recovered from it, too. But in recent years she was very frail and suffered from emphysema, and she was hospitalized several times for lung problems, said Kathy O'Connor, Mr. Nixon's chief of staff.         Besides her husband and her daughters, Ms. Cox of Manhattan, whose husband, Edward F. Cox, is a lawyer, and Ms. Eisenhower of Berwyn, Pa., whose husband, David Eisenhower, is a military historian and grandson of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mrs. Nixon's survivors include two grandsons, Christopher Nixon Cox and Alex Richard Eisenhower, and two granddaughters, Melanie and Jennie Eisenhower.         A service for Mrs. Nixon with family members and friends attending will be held at 10 A.M. Saturday in the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., with the Rev. Dr. Billy Graham presiding and eulogies by Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and others. A private burial service will follow on the grounds of the library.         Mrs. Nixon's body will lie in state at the library on Friday. The public will be admitted from 5 P.M. to 9 P.M.       
         Ethel Hausman, a founder and major supporter of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College in Manhasset, L. I., died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         She and her husband, Jack, joined Leonard and Isabel Goldenson and Jane Hoving in 1946 to found United Cerebral Palsy of New York City. All were parents of children with the disease, including the Hausmans' son Peter, who died last year. Their efforts also led to the formation of the national United Cerebral Palsy Associations, which merged similar groups around the country. Efforts Raised Millions         Mrs. Hausman founded the Women's Division of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and oversaw fund-raising campaigns that raised millions of dollars for the agency, which serves adults and children with cerebral palsy and related disabilities. She also was vice president of the International Cerebral Palsy Society in London and a board member of Rehabilitation International.         Mrs. Hausman devoted much of her life to helping others, especially chidren. With her husband, she was a principal donor to North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, where the Ethel and Jack Hausman Department of Pediatrics attests to their support.         North Shore University Hospital opened in Manhasset in 1953. But Mrs. Hausman was already engaged in fund raising in the late 1940's, when local residents pressed for the construction of a hospital in the area. She later served as co-chairwoman of the interior design committee.         Ethel and Jack Hausman endowed chairs bearing their names for a professor of pediatrics at North Shore University Hospital and for cerebral-palsy research at Harvard University.         Born in Manhattan, Ethel Hausman went to work in a restaurant at age 16. In 1927, she married Jack Hausman, whose family fortune derived from the textile business. He is vice chairman and former chairman of Belding Heminway Company, the Manhattan textile concern.         Mrs. Hausman served as a volunteer ambulance driver in World War II. She was an original tour guide at United Nations headquarters and a member of the U.N.'s Department of Public Information from 1949-64.         Besides her husband of nearly 65 years, Mrs. Hausman is survived by two sons, Richard and Michael, both of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Eileen Nic, a lobbyist on environmental and health issues and longtime consultant to Consumers Union, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 42.         The cause was brain cancer, said Robbin Blaine, a colleague at Consumers Union, the nonprofit organization that publishes the magazine Consumer Reports.         Ms. Nic was instrumental in persuading the United Nations to publish a directory of banned and restricted pesticides, chemicals and other consumer products. As representative of the International Organization of Consumers Unions at the United Nations, she organized over 300 groups around the world in a network to work for the banning of the hazardous products listed in the directory, which was published in 1983.         She was co-author of a Consumers Union report in 1990 that named the eight biggest toxic polluters in the New York City area.         Among other activities, she served as a consultant on hazardous substances for the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council.         A native of Philadelphia, she graduated from Temple University and received a master's degree in sociology from Columbia University. She began her career on the staff of the Philadelphia Department of Health.         Surviving are her husband, Thierry Noyelle; her parents, Chester and Irene Nic, and a sister, Mary Ann Nic, all of Philadelphia.       
         R. Louise McManus, a leader in nursing education who spent 36 years on the faculty of Teachers College of Columbia University, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Natick, Mass. She was 97 and had lived in Manhattan before retiring to Massachusetts.         Her death came after a brief illness, the college reported.         On the faculty since 1925, Professor McManus served as director of the Division of Nursing Education at Teachers College from 1947 until her retirement in 1961. At the college she founded the Institute of Research and Service in Nursing Education.         Professor McManus was a native of North Smithfield, R.I.         She was a past chairman of the nursing council of the Florence Nightingale International Foundation. Teachers College named its Nursing Education Alumni Medal after her in 1964.         Professor McManus is survived by four daughters, Joan Lawrence of Natick, Madeline Frankenhauser of Falmouth, Mass., Catherine Myers of Wilmington, Del., and Anna McThaden of Seattle; 23 grandchildren, 37 great-grandchildren, and a great-great-grandchild.       
         Ida Sciolino Antonucci, a retired senior executive and buyer of clothes for young women at Bloomingdale's department stores, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Antonucci, known professionally as Ida Sciolino, worked at Bloomingdale's for 30 years, retiring in 1980. Her expertise included bridal gowns, robes and lounge wear, and junior sportswear, dresses, coats and suits.         Her responsibilities for the main store and eight branches included choosing colors, designs, fabrics and silhouettes. She oversaw budgets, advertising, display and the selection and training of young executives and new sales clerks.         Working with designers and manufacturers, she selected and bought merchandise in this country, European nations, India and Hong Kong.         She believed in American talent, and to find it she scoured ateliers, lofts and garages in the Village and Bowery where some designers had little shops of their own.         A native of Buffalo, she graduated from D'Youville College there and took graduate courses in engineering and fabrics at the University of Buffalo. Before joining Bloomingdale's in 1950, she worked for five years as senior executive buyer of junior wear at Hengerer's Department Store in Buffalo.         Mrs. Antonucci is survived by her husband, Anthony J.; a son, Peter A. of Manhattan; a sister, Marie Oberacker of Amherst, N.Y.; a brother, Anthony Sciolino of Buffalo, and one grandson.       
         Patricia Stanton McLean, a retired educator and leader in the dental-hygienist profession, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center. She was 77 and lived in Pleasantville, N.Y.         The cause of death was heart disease, her family said.         Ms. McLean retired in 1977 as the director of Columbia University's Division of Dental Hygiene and an assistant dean at Columbia's School of Dental and Oral Surgery. She was a former president of the American Dental Hygienists Association.         Under a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, she developed the nation's first curriculum for dental-hygiene educators and administrators. She was also an author of "Pharmacology for the Dental Hygienist."         She was a past chairwoman of the Council of Auxiliaries of the American Association of Dental Schools, president of the Dental Hygienists Association of New York City and an executive board member of the Dental Hygienists Association of New York State. Daughter of Dentist         She was also a consultant to the National Institute of Health and the American Fund for Dental Health.         Ms. McLean, the daughter of a dentist, was born in Buffalo. She earned her certificate in dental hygiene at Columbia, a bachelor's degree in health education at New York University and a master's in administration at Columbia.         After entering private practice and teaching dental hygiene in Tuckahoe, N.J., public schools, she returned to Columbia as an instructor. She was promoted to director of its dental hygiene division in 1964.         She was separated from John McLean, a dentist. He died in 1983.         She is survived by a daughter, Marianne Doran of Pleasantville; three sons, John, of Fort Collins, Colo., Peter of Solebury, Pa., and Paul, of Fresno, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Dr. Helen Quincy Woodard, an authority on bone disease, died at her home in Hartsdale, N.Y., on Sunday. She was 92.         Dr. Woodard was a biochemist at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, which she joined after receiving her Ph.D. in chemistry from Columbia University in 1925. She did groundbreaking work in understanding and identifying cancers induced by environmental radiation.         She published research on phosphate metabolism in bone in the 1940's, and she founded the laboratory that evolved into the Department of Chemistry at the center.         Dr. Woodard also published pioneering papers on radiation-induced osteogenic sarcomas in people who painted radium dials on watches.         She was a consultant to the International Council on Radiation Units and to the New York City Health Department for more than 20 years.         She endowed the Woodard Fellowships at Columbia University, a fellowship at the New York University School of Environmental Medicine and the John Laughlin Professorship at the Sloan-Kettering center. She was an active member of the Nature Conservancy.       
         Arleen Auger, an American soprano who was renowned for both her commanding presence on the opera stage and the subtlety of her song interpretations, died on Thursday at the home of a friend in Leusden, a suberb of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. She was 53 and lived in Hartsdale, N.Y.         Mary Lou Falcone, Miss Auger's publicity agent, said the cause was brain cancer.         Miss Auger's most famous performance was her appearance at the wedding of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the Duke and Duchess of York, on July 23, 1986. She sang Mozart's "Exsultate, Jubilate" as part of the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, which was televised globally and seen by some 500 million people.  Debut in Vienna         Mozart was always at the core of her repertory. Miss Auger (pronounced awe-ZHAY) had exactly the right flexibility, coloring and vocal weight for Mozart opera roles and concert works, and they were the vehicles with which she had her biggest successes. She made her operatic debut as the Queen of the Night in a 1967 Vienna State Opera production of "Die Zauberflote." Nine years later she made her New York debut in the same role at the New York City Opera. Among her recent recordings are highly praised portrayals of Donna Anna in "Don Giovanni" and the Countess in "Le Nozze di Figaro."         She also won great acclaim for her performances of Bach, Handel and Haydn, and although she did not eschew the use of vibrato, as other early-music singers did, she was considered a supremely stylish interpreter of that repertory. Still, she resolutely resisted being typecast. She constantly expanded her repertory, and applied her rich tone and her thoughtful sense of line to everything from Schubert and Schumann lieder and turn-of-the-century French art songs to works by Weill, Berg and Schoenberg. Libby Larsen and Judith Zaimont were among the composers from whom she commissioned new song cycles.         "I sing Bach, Mozart, contemporary music and everything in between," she wrote in an article for Keynote in 1985. "If it's for my voice and my voice can do it well, I'm happy to do it."         But Miss Auger was a late bloomer, musically: she did not begin studying voice until she was out of college and working as an elementary-school teacher in Chicago. And when she auditioned for the Vienna State Opera, she knew only one role, the Queen of the Night.  Taught Elementary Schoolers         Arleen Auger was born in South Gate, Calif., on Sept. 13, 1939. She studied the piano and violin briefly as a child and sang in community choirs, but she later told interviewers that she had had very little exposure to classical music when she was growing up. She attended California State University at Long Beach, where she earned a degree in education in 1963. For the next four years, she taught elementary school in Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.         The world of opera and art song opened for her in 1965, when she was teaching in Chicago and began studying voice with Ralph Errolle. She apparently progressed quickly; two years later, when she was teaching first grade in Los Angeles, she won first prize in the I. Victor Fuchs Competition. The prize included a trip to Vienna to audition for the Volksoper. Her audition repertory included three pieces: the two Queen of the Night arias and Olympia's aria from Offenbach's "Tales of Hoffmann."         As it turned out, the soprano Lucia Popp had just withdrawn from a production of "Zauberflote" at the Vienna State Opera. That company's director, Josef Krips, heard Miss Auger's audition at the smaller Volksoper, and offered her a contract. When she joined the company, she later said, she knew only the one role, had no stage experience and did not speak German. She made her debut without a rehearsal, and had to ask other singers where to go as she was pushed out on stage.  Sought Expanded Repertory         But she prospered in Vienna. During her first two years she added a dozen roles to her repertory, and she remained with the company until 1974, when she began to find the State Opera's repertory expectations too constricting. When she left the company she began singing more frequently at other European houses, including La Scala. She also expanded her recital repertory and took a teaching position at the Academy of Music and Drama in Frankfurt, where she taught until 1987.         She had by then become intent on regulating the pace of her career. She refused to sing roles if she did not consider herself ready for them, sometimes alienating conductors whose invitations she declined. But she said later that those decisions saved her voice and prolonged her career.         By the early 1980's, Miss Auger's European career was thriving, though her concert and opera appearances in the United States had been relatively few. She had cemented her reputation as an early-music singer at the Oregon Bach Festival, directed by Helmuth Rilling (with whom she recorded more than 50 Bach cantatas) and at the New England Bach Festival. But at the time, American listeners knew her mostly through what was already a vast discography.         Miss Auger began to cultivate an American following seriously in January 1984, when she sang Mozart, Schubert, Debussy and Strauss songs at her New York debut recital at Alice Tully Hall. Reviewing that concert in The New York Times, Donal Henahan praised the clarity of her tone and her sensitivity to musical and textual nuances. "Although pure lyricism is obviously Miss Auger's strong point, there is more to her than that," he wrote, adding that she "is a singing actress of some depth." Explored the Nuances         Thereafter, Miss Auger performed more frequently in the United States, and her recitals were high points of the concert season for fans of art song. Statuesque and attractive, she was a compelling and elegant stage personality who invariably gave the impression of having thoroughly explored both the overt emotional resonance and the underlying psychological nuances of the songs on her programs. She continued performing until last season, when her illness forced her to cancel touring plans and recording projects.         Miss Auger made nearly 200 recordings, documenting a vast repertory that ranged from her Bach, Mozart and Handel specialties to a series of both standard and offbeat opera and song projects. Many of her recordings won international awards, including the Grand Prix du Disque, the Edison Prize and the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis.         She is survived by her parents, Everett and Doris Auger, and a brother, Ralph Auger of Healdsburg, Calif. SELECTED RECORDINGS         Arleen Auger's recordings document her talents as opera singer, recitalist and soloist in oratorios and symphonic choral works. These are some of her recordings, all on compact disk.         Brahms: A German Requiem (Telarc)         Canteloube: Songs of the Auvergne (Virgin)         Handel: "Orlando" (L'Oiseau-Lyre); "Messiah" (Archiv)         Handel and Bach Arias (Delos)         Mendelssohn: A Midsummer Night's Dream (Philips)         Monteverdi: "L'Incoronazione di Poppea" (Virgin)         Mozart: "Le Nozze di Figaro" (L'Oiseau-Lyre); "Lucio Silla" (Philips)         Mozart/Strauss/Wolf: Lieder (Sony Classical)         Strauss: Four Last Songs (Telarc)         Wolf: Lieder (Hyperion)         "Love Songs": works by Copland, Britten, Strauss, Schumann, Gounod, Mahler, Foster, others (Delos)       
         Gloria E. Wise, who led a sit-in at a lunch counter in the South in 1960 and became a New York City social work administrator and head of a popular youth program, died on June 7 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 56 and lived in the Bronx.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         For her life's work in promoting racial and ethnic harmony, Mrs. Wise won the John V. Lindsay prize from the Citizens' Committee for New York City earlier this year. She donated the $5,000 award to her Youth Activities Committee, which sponsors after-school and summer programs.         As the student government president of Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C., Mrs. Wise joined four male students in protesting the whites-only rule at the local Woolworth lunch counter in 1960. She was among the first black women to demonstrate.         "Everybody was afraid, because we didn't know what was going to happen," she recalled. "But we did it because we wanted to be able sit down at a lunch counter."         Mrs. Wise was a city social worker for 31 years and became the director of case management resources at the Spofford Juvenile Center in the Bronx.         She retired there last year to devote full-time to her volunteer job as the executive director of the youth committee, which she helped found 17 years ago. It has served more than 20,000 youngsters from Co-op City and its neighborhood with education, recreation, culture and career programs.         Mrs. Wise was born in Manhattan. After graduating from Bennett she earned a master's degree in social work at Columbia University. She was a trustee of the Bronx Trinity United Methodist Church.         She was married to Leroy Wise, who is dead.         Surviving are her parents, Clarise and William E. Brown Sr., of the Bronx; three brothers, William Jr., of the Bronx, and Donald and Rodney, both of Atlanta, and two sisters, Juanita Garrido, of Goose Creek, S.C., and Diane Brown, of the Bronx.       
         Dr. Gladys Lounsbury Hobby, a microbiologist who helped to move penicillin from a laboratory discovery to mass production during World War II, died on Sunday at her home at the Crosslands retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 82.         The cause was a heart attack, Pfizer Inc. said. She had worked at Pfizer's Brooklyn plant.         In her book, "Penicillin: Meeting the Challenge" (Yale University Press, 1985), Dr. Hobby chronicled penicillin's precarious journey from laboratory to factory, beginning with Sir Alexander Fleming's intriguing find of 1928. Discussing the program to make the drug available in large quantities in the face of wartime needs in the early 1940's, she likened its urgency and scope to the Manhattan Project, which produced the atom bomb.         She had first helped to refine penicillin specifically for the treatment of infections as a member of a research team at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. Then, in 15 years at Pfizer, she also worked to develop streptomycin and other antibiotics.         A specialist in antimicrobial therapy, she was among those who did the early work on the broad-spectrum Terramycin and contributed to the understanding of how such drugs work.         A native of Manhattan, Dr. Hobby graduated from Vassar College in 1931 and earned her master's degree and a Ph.D. in bacteriology at Columbia. She was associated with Presbyterian Hospital and the Columbia Medical School from 1934 to 1943, after which she joined Chas Pfizer & Company to continue her research.         She left Pfizer in 1959 to become chief of research at the Veterans Administration Hospital in East Orange, N.J., where she specialized in chronic infectious diseases. Until her retirement in 1977 she also served as an assistant clinical research professor in public health at Cornell University Medical College.         She then worked as a consultant and freelance science writer. She was the author of some 200 publications and for eight years edited Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a monthly she founded in 1972.         Dr. Hobby is survived by a sister, Winifred Evans, also of Kennett Square.       
         Dr. Barbara Whitney, an expert in sex education and a leader in the battle against AIDS in New York City's public schools, died on Friday at a friend's home on Squam Lake, N.H. She was 56 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         For the last two years, Dr. Whitney worked in the School Chancellor's office as director of the H.I.V./AIDS Technical Assistance Project, a privately financed program that teaches AIDS prevention throughout the school system. 20 Years in the Field         Dr. Whitney spent the last 20 years as a trainer, educator and administrator in the field of human sexuality. From 1978 to 1985 she was executive director of Siecus, the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States, in New York City. She was director of health services for the Children's Aid Society and director of the AIDS Training Institute in the New York City Department of Health.         Dr. Whitney, a native of Iowa, graduated summa cum laude from the College of Nursing at the State University of Iowa and earned a master's degree at Boston University's School of Nursing. While pursing her career, she studied psychoeducation at Temple University and not-for-profit management at Columbia University's School of Business. She received a Ph.D. in 1988 from the human-sexuality program in the Department of Health Education at New York University, which entailed studies in Sweden, Japan and Kenya.         Dr. Whitney is survived by her mother, Azalea Boeke of Sun City, Ariz.; a sister, Janice Hayes of Bloomington, Ind., and two daughters, Jennifer Whitney of Port Townsend, Wash., and Katie Whitney of Philadelphia.       
         Mary Ellen Forbes Kramer, who led the campaign to preserve and redevelop the historic mill district in Paterson, N.J., died on Monday at a hospital in Norwalk, Conn. She was 56 and lived in Little Falls, N.J., and Weston, Conn.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Kramer became active in civic affairs as the wife of Paterson's Mayor for 14 years, Lawrence (Pat) Kramer. In her first major issue, she led the efforts that blocked state plans to build a highway that would have destroyed some old silk mills.         After that success, she became the executive director of the Great Falls Development Corporation and worked to preserve the mills, which were built in the early 1800's and used the water power of the 77-foot-high Great Falls. The buildings were adapted to new uses, including the Paterson Museum, offices and artists' residences.         In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford visited the district to proclaim its national landmark status, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave Mrs. Kramer an award. New Career at College         She started a new career in 1980 as the director of community affairs at William Paterson College in Wayne, N.J.         There she was instrumental in founding the Wayne Chamber Orchestra, creating the annual Legacy Awards to raise scholarship funds, collecting more than $300,000 to restore the Hobart Manor on campus and organizing a popular annual lecture series with speakers like Henry Kissinger, Norman Mailer, Alvin Toffler and Beverly Sills.         She also served on the boards of St. Joseph's Hospital and the Straight and Narrow drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, both in New Jersey.         Mrs. Kramer was born in Paterson. After graduating from Mary Washington College she earned a master's degree in clinical psychology from George Washington University and briefly practiced as a school psychologist. She was divorced.         Surviving are her companion, Irving Appleman; her mother, Catherine Forbes of Wyckoff, N.J.; a daughter, Patricia Kimberly Sposa of Vernon, N.J.; two sons, Lawrence 3d, also known as Kip, and Patrick, also known as Kelly, both of Paterson; three brothers, Cyril Forbes of Montclair, N.J., William Forbes of Paterson and Paul Forbes of Morristown, N.J., and two sisters, Joan Forbes of Wyckoff and Nancy Braithwaite of Nassau, the Bahamas.       
         Frances Ruth Grant, who spent her life opposing dictatorships and promoting human rights in the Americas, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 96.         Miss Grant's dedication to Latin American culture, art and human rights began in her childhood. The daughter of a pioneer of New Mexico's statehood, she was born and raised in the remote pueblo of Abiquiu in the foothills of the Valle Grande mountains. It was there that she absorbed the atmosphere of Hispanic-American culture.         She was educated at Barnard College and graduated from Columbia University's School of Journalism in 1918. She also received extensive tutoring in economics, political science, music and the arts. A Museum Founder         She was a founder in 1923 of the Nicholas Roerich Museum in Manhattan, under whose auspices she went to the Far East and wrote about the philosophies and cultures of India and Tibet. She served as a vice president of the museum until 1937.         Miss Grant first visited Latin America in 1929 and after that devoted most of her energy to the republics of the hemisphere. She lectured at virtually all of its universities and centers of learning and started some of the first cultural interchanges, including exhibitions, musical programs and public forums.         Her work was primarily responsible for the Roerich Pact, an inter-American agreement for the preservation of cultural sites signed at the White House by 21 republics in 1935. She founded the Pan American Women's Association in 1930 and the Inter-American Association for Democracy and Freedom in 1950 and headed both of them into her late 80's. A Journal Editor         From 1951 until the mid-1980's, she edited the English and Spanish editions of Hemispherica, a journal published by the Inter-American Association. For this she received a special citation in 1982 at Columbia University from the trustees of the annual Maria Moors Cabot prizes in inter-American journalism.         Recognized as a leader in the defense of civil and politcal liberties, she was a past chairman of the Latin American section and secretary of the International League for Human Rights. The league is a nongovernmental agency accredited by the United Nations whose predecessors date back to the Dreyfus affair in France nearly a century ago.         Jose Figueres Ferrer, then the President of Costa Rica and himself a resolute champion of democracy, paid tribute to Miss Grant in a public address in New York in 1951. He called her "the greatest fighter for democracy and human rights in the hemisphere."       
         Caroline Klein Simon, who overcame early obstacles to women in the legal profession to become a pioneering female judge, politician, state official and champion of laws against discrimination in jobs and housing, died yesterday at home. She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Judge Simon, who was still active as a lawyer at her death, served in state posts under appointments from both Republican and Democratic governors and was the first woman nominated by a major party for citywide office in New York City.         She helped draft the nation's first state law barring job discrimination and later led the nation in imposing regulations against racial "block busting" by real-estate brokers.         Judge Simon's credo was simple. "I am against discrimination in any form," she said.         During her own career, she faced discrimination from the very beginning.         She was rejected for admission to Columbia University's law school in the 1920's because it did not have toilets and other accommodations for female students, her family said. So she earned her law degree at New York University instead. Failed Search for Paying Job         After graduation, despite her strong academic record and passing the bar examination, she was turned down by every firm where she applied to become a law clerk. She finally offered to work free for a year "to convince them that a woman could be a lawyer," she later recalled.         Greenbaum, Wolff & Ernst took her up and after the year was up she was offered a permanent job. But she decided instead to work for indigent clients and family planning groups.         Three decades later, she was a leading candidate to become the Postmaster of New York in 1958 but was vetoed by Federal officials. The New York Times reported, based on officials close to the Postmaster General, "Opposition to the appointment of Mrs. Caroline K. Simon was based on the ground that the job was unsuited to a woman."         In a widely quoted speech the next year, she said: "There are four things a woman needs to know. She needs to know how to look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man and work like a dog." Worked Under Dewey         Her public service began in the 1930's when she was instrumental in changing state laws to entitle women to serve as jurors and was herself among the first called for service.         District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey of Manhattan named her to a panel on revising the Domestic Relations Court Act. During World War II she served as the Office of Civilian Defense's director of group activities in New York, New Jersey and Delaware.         Mr. Dewey, by then Governor, appointed her to the New York State Workers' Compensation Board in 1944-45 and the temporary State War Council's Committee on Discrimination in Employment in 1943-45.         Eager to continue the fight against discrimination, she helped draft the nation's first state law on job bias based on race, religion or nationality and became a founding member of the resulting State Commission Against Discrimination. City Council Race         In 1956, Gov. W. Averell Harriman, a Democrat, appointed her to the new State Youth Commission.         The next year she ran for City Council President as a Republican. Although she lost to Abe Stark by about two-to-one, she still ran some 100,000 votes ahead of her ticket and received the biggest total for a citywide Republican candidate.         In 1958 she served as the legal advisor to the American delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.         In 1959 Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, inducted her as New York's Secretary of State, the second woman to hold that post. It was in that role that she issued the nation's first regulations against block busting, in which brokers manipulated property owners' fears about racial or ethnic changes in the neighborhood to provoke sales.         It was her marriage to Leopold K. Simon, a lawyer, that ignited her interest in the law.         They divorced in the early 1950's. She remarried, to Irving W. Halpern, the chief probation officer of the Court of General Sessions, who died in 1966.         Her survivors include her son, Lee K., of Wilmington, N.C.; a daughter, Cathy Prince of White Plains; a brother, Nathan F. Klein of Titusville, Fla.; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         A service will be held at 11 A.M. Sunday at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street in Manhattan.       
         Doris Jonas Freed, a national authority on family law who headed the American Bar Association's committee on divorce law and procedures, died on July 23 at Keswick Nursing Home in Baltimore. She was 90 and had lived in Manhattan until May.         Her daughter, Gloria Kane, said the cause was heart failure.         Dr. Freed was an expert and practitioner in matrimonial law who wrote extensively on different aspects of family law. She was co-author of the six-volume revision of "Law and the Family, New York" (Lawyers Cooperative Publishing Corporation, Rochester, 1986-90) with the late Henry H. Foster and Joel R. Brandes, and co-author of the original treatise with Mr. Foster in 1966.  Wrote Monthly Column         As head of the American Bar Association's committee on research, she was influential in drafting the 1980 reform of the New York State divorce law, which was based on the premise that marriage is an economic "partnership of co-equals."         Until her death, Dr. Freed co-authored with Mr. Brandes and Carole L. Weidman "Law and the Family," a monthly column in The New York Law Journal. Recent studies include: "Electronic Surveillance of Family Conversations," (January 1993) "Surrogate Parenting Contracts," (February 1993), and "Transfers of Pension Benefits," (June 1993)         Tracking family-law cases and legal trends for the American Bar Association, Dr. Freed was co-author of the annual study "Family Law in the 50 States," initially with Mr. Foster and subsequently with Prof. Timothy Walker. This study appears in The Family Law Quarterly and reviews developments in family law like no-fault divorce, fair distribution of property, homemaker's contribution, rights to retirement benefits, spousal support and child-support enforcement.         Dr. Freed was born in a suburb of St. Louis. She earned her law degrees from New York University School of Law, receiving her doctorate in 1958. Already active professionally, she was named first vice president of the Women's Lawyers Assocation in 1956.         Her practice was based in New York City, where in recent years she was of counsel to the firm of Brandes, Weidman & Spatz. Before that she was counsel to Winer, Neuburger & Sive, and earlier was counsel to the Harvey Sladkus firm.         Dr. Freed received the exceptional merit award from the Family Law Section of the American Bar Association every year from 1980 to 1989. Besides her work for the national association, she chaired the custody committee and the surrogate parenting committee of the New York State Bar Association's Family Law Section.         Her husband, Arthur Freed, died in 1990.         Besides her daughter, who lives in Dallas, she is survived by a granddaughter.       
         Vivian E. Browne, a professor of art at Rutgers University and a painter whose work linked abstraction to nature, died on July 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.         The cause was bladder cancer, said her mother, Odessa Browne.         Ms. Browne joined the Rutgers faculty at Newark in 1970 as an instructor in the art and design department. She headed the department from 1975 to 1978, becoming a full professor in 1985. She taught contemporary black and Hispanic art, painting and other courses.         She was a founder of SoHo 20, a Broome Street gallery, established in 1973, that was one of the first women's art cooperatives in Manhattan. There she had several solo exhibitions, most recently in 1989, when she presented her oil and acrylic landscapes of towers and power lines superimposed on trees.         Her paintings are in many private, corporate and public collections.         Ms. Browne was born in Laurel, Fla. She graduated from Hunter College, earned a Master of Fine Arts degree, and studied for a time in Nigeria. Before joining Rutgers, she taught in high schools and colleges in New York and New Jersey.         She is survived, in addition to her mother, by two sisters, Lenice Pannell and Yvonne Allison, of Wheaton, Md.       
         Madeleine Marshall Simon, a singing coach and concert pianist who taught English diction at the Juilliard School of Music for over half a century, died on Sunday at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from a heart attack, said her grandson, J. Kirby Simon.         Mrs. Simon, whose professional name was Madeleine Marshall, was author of "The Singer's Manual of English Diction," which has been a standard guide on the subject since 1953.         Reviewing her book in The New York Times, Howard Taubman wrote: "What all the advice aims at is the eternal one of learning to make technique the servant of art. As Miss Marshall sums it up, articulation should be 'so persuasive that no one will be conscious of method.' " On the Juilliard Faculty         She joined Juilliard in 1935 as an instructor in English diction and retired in 1986, after providing generations of singers with the tools of being understood, while performing in English. She also trained many teachers of English diction at schools and colleges.         Over the years, she was coach and accompanist for many artists, including Lily Pons, Helen Traubel, Leontyne Price, Lawrence Tibbet and Lauritz Melchior.         Mrs. Simon was on the staff of the School of Sacred Music of Union Theological Seminary for 20 years. She also worked on special assignments for the Metropolitan Opera and the Robert Shaw choral organization.         Born in Syracuse, she was a graduate of Syracuse University. She began her career as a concert pianist and performed as soloist with the New York Philharmonic under Arturo Toscanini and other conductors.         She was married to Robert A. Simon, a music critic for The New Yorker, who died in 1981.         In addition to her grandson, she is survived by a son, John G. Simon of New Haven; a daughter, Peggy Traktman, and a sister, Helen Marshall Borchard, both of New York City, and another grandchild.       
         Sophia Yarnall Jacobs, a lifelong advocate of civil and human rights, died on Wednesday at her home on Mount Desert Island in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 91.         Her daughter, Charlton Yarnall Phelps, said the cause was congestive heart failure.         Mrs. Jacobs was former president of the Urban League of Greater New York and the National Council of Women. She was active in the Urban League movement for more than 20 years and served as vice president and trustee of the National Urban League.         As head of the league's chapter for Greater New York from 1955 to 1960, she fought school segregation, pressed for more public housing on vacant land sites and led action for legislation barring racial discrimination in private housing.  Headed Women's Council         In 1959, Mrs. Jacobs took part in the first "woman-to-woman" exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. She became president of the National Council of Women in 1960 and was chairwoman of the 75th anniversary of the International Council of Women and the national affiliate, in Washington in 1963.         Born in Haverford, Pa., she attended Bryn Mawr College for two years. In 1921, she married Reginald Robert Jacobs, a Philadelphia banker. The marriage ended in divorce in 1937.         While in Philadelphia, she wrote many articles of interest to women, published in Good Housekeeping, Country Life, Harper's Bazaar, Parents, Reader's Digest and other magazines. From 1937 to 1945, she served as executive secretary of the Philadelphia Orchestra Club and then became promotion manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Wrote Historical Novel         In 1945, she went to San Francisco as an observer at the birth of the United Nations.         Mrs. Jacobs moved to New York in 1954, where she was an officer of numerous civic and educational organizations. She was active in the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Committee on Africa, Howard University, Planned Parenthood-World Population and the Rachel Carson Trust for the Living Environment.         She was the author of a historical novel, "The Clark Inheritance," based on her family's history in the develpment of the coal mines of Pennsylvania. She is remembered by many as Sophy, the group leader, in her friend Emily Kimbrough's book, "Pleasure by the Busload."         Besides her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Denholm Muir Jacobs of Northeast Harbor; 6 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth M. Ramsey, whose discovery of a two-week-old embryo during an autopsy began her career as an authority on human embryology, died Friday at a hospital in Washington. She was 87 and lived in Washington.         The cause was a stroke, said the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Dr.  Ramsey worked for 36 years for Carnegie's embryology department on the Johns Hopkins University campus in Baltimore.         Dr. James Ebert, vice president of the National Academy of Science, called Dr. Ramsey "the world's leading student of the anatomy of the placenta."         She won the distinguished service award of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and was named to its hall of fame. In 1987 the Society for Gynecologic Investigation named her its distinguished scientist of the year. She was also a past vice president of the American Association of Anatomists. The Yale Embryo         While conducting a routine autopsy as a pathologist at Yale Medical School in the 1930's, she and her colleagues discovered a 14-day-old embryo. It was believed to be the youngest human embryo studied and came to be known as the Yale Embryo.         "It was the most interesting professional thing in my life," she once recalled.         The discovery led her to publish research on the anatomy of human embryos. Then she began studying monkeys to understand the circulatory system of their embryos and placentas. Later, working with Martin Donner of the radiology department at Johns Hopkins, she used radioactive dyes and X-rays to disclose that the human embryo and placenta have a similar circulation system.         She wrote more than 125 scientific articles and two books, "The Placenta of Laboratory Animals and Man" (1975) and, with Mr. Donner, "Placental Vasculature and Circulation" (1982).         Dr. Ramsey taught and lectured at Johns Hopkins and Georgetown and George Washington Universities and served on the Dean's Council of Yale Medical School. She retired about 20 years ago.         She also served on the boards of the National Symphony Orchestra and the National Cathedral Choral Society.         Born in New York City, Dr. Ramsey grew up in California and graduated from Mills College in 1928. She studied in Hamburg, Germany, then at Yale Medical School, where she graduated in 1932 as one of two women in her class.         For 59 years she was married to Hans Klagsbrunn, a lawyer, who died on June 23. Together they ran a dairy and pig farm in Loudoun County, Va.         She is survived by a brother, Charles C. Ramsey Jr. of Big Timber, Mont.       
         Elizabeth Hannah Waters, a modern dancer and choreographer who performed with Hanya Holm's company in the 1930's and who founded the dance program at the University of New Mexico, died on June 5 at her home in Echo Canyon, N.M. She was 83.         Ms. Waters was born in Salem, Ore. She studied in Colorado at the Perry-Mansfield School and in New York City with Ruth St. Denis, also working as the famed dancer's personal maid and assistant in 1931. When Ms. Holm, a disciple of the German modern-dance pioneer Mary Wigman, opened the American Wigman School in New York, Ms. Waters became a scholarship student. She was a soloist in the Holm company from 1935 to 1939 and was Ms. Holm's teaching assistant at the Bennington School of the Dance in Vermont.         In 1940, she formed her own company, Dancers en Route, with Alwin Nikolais. During World War II, she worked as a welder at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico and taught dance in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Las Vegas, Nev.         Ms. Waters taught at the University of New Mexico from 1946 to 1973; among her students was Tim Wengerd, a principal in the Martha Graham Dance Company in the 1970's and 1980's. Ms. Waters choreographed more than 50 works.         She is survived by a brother and several nieces.       
         Florence Cooper, a Manhattan community organizer of child-care and women's-support services, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Washington Heights.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Cooper, who remained active until her death, was the membership chairwoman of the Upper West Manhattan branch of the League of Women Voters. She served on the boards of Fort George Head Start and the Napeague Institute of Art in Amagansett, L.I.         She played a key role in Womanspace, a program devoted to women's support services at Columbia University. An amateur painter, she served as administrator of the art school at the Museum at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1970's and held private art classes for children.         Born in Brooklyn, she graduated from Adelphi College and earned a master's degree in comparative literature at Columbia University.         Mrs. Cooper's husband, Rudolf, a high school teacher, died in 1968.         She is survived by a daughter, Constance Cooper Batuscheck of Alexandria, Va.; a son, Kenneth, of Manhattan; a brother, David Buxbaum of Milwaukee, and a grandson.       
         Leona Dubnick, coordinator of the gifted-education program for the Huntington, L.I., public schools until her retirement in 1985, died on her 65th birthday Friday at the Williamsburg (Va.) Community Hospital. She lived in Huntington and Pound Ridge, N.Y., until moving to Williamsburg less than two years ago.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A native of New York City, Mrs. Dubnick graduated from Brooklyn College, earned an M.A. at City College and studied for a doctorate at Teachers College of Columbia University. She joined the Huntington school system as a teacher and designed, developed and administered its gifted-education curriculum and program.         In the late 1970's she also created and broadcast "Ask the Teacher" radio programs at the Long Island station WGSM and at WVOX in Westchester. From 1988 to 1991 she was public-relations director, news editor and writer at WPOB-FM in Plainview-Old Bethpage, L.I.         Mrs. Dubnick is survived by her husband of 43 years, Dr. Lester Dubnick; her daughter, Monica L. Mowery of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a sister, Stella Monchick of West Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Arlene Streit Yagoda, an owner and breeder of thoroughbred race horses, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center. She was 51 and lived in Woodmere, L.I.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Carrying on a family tradition, she raced horses throughout the country with her husband, and their son Aaron became a handicapper, starting at the age of 8. The columnist Red Smith wrote about a typical day at Aqueduct when Aaron, then 10, picked six winners, the daily double and an exacta.         Mrs. Yagoda, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Hofstra University. Her grandfather, Aaron, founded the Streit Matzoh Company.         She was married for 30 years to Stanley Yagoda, who was president of the Hot Dogger clothing company.         Besides her husband, her survivors include her parents, Ruth and Jack Streit of Brooklyn; two sons, Phillip, of Manhattan, and Aaron, of Manhattan and Hallendale, Fla., and two sisters, Myrna Heilbrun of Manhattan and Nettie Streit of Brooklyn.         Correction:  August 21, 1993, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about an owner and breeder of thoroughbred horses rendered her first name incorrectly, as did the headline. She was Arlyne (not Arlene) Streit Yagoda.       
         Dr. Wilma Thompson Donahue, an expert in the psychology of aging and director emeritus of the University of Michigan Institute of Gerontology, died on Tuesday at her home in Ann Arbor. She was 92.         She had had a long illness, the university reported.         Dr. Donahue was among the country's first clinical psychologists when she began her career at Ann Arbor in 1935 as a practitioner of the branch of psychology that deals with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of personality and behavior problems. Her reputation widened in the 1950's as her name appeared in journals and books on housing, medical care and other subjects concerning the elderly.         She served on state commissions on aging and was founding president of the Michigan Society of Gerontology. Ten years ago, she was in the first group inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.         Nationally, Dr. Donahue took part in White House Conferences on Aging in 1961, 1971 and 1981 and was a member of related policy boards for Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter. She served for 10 years as director of the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, a post she left 10 years ago.         Born in Mitchellville, Iowa, she earned three degrees in psychology at the University of Michigan, including a doctorate in 1937. She practiced at the mental hygiene clinic of the Student Health Service starting in 1935 and was appointed an instructor in the department of psychology three years later.         In 1951, she became the founding director of the university's division of gerontology and took the same position at the transformed Institute of Gerontology in 1966. She retired in 1970.         At the time, the university's Regents cited her ultimate mission as apolitical and purely educational: "She sought to elicit the truth about old people, especially those distressed in mind, body, or estate."         Dr. Donahue's husband, Lester, died in 1963 after 41 years of marriage.       
         Dr. Mildred Gordon, a cell biologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, Mount Sinai reported.         She was a pioneer in molecular biology as it helped illuminate the process of human reproduction, the hospital said.         Her research broke new ground on the elemental structures of human sperm and the endometrium, or inner lining, of the uterus, that can be detected only with an electron microscope.         Among other things, her work added to the knowledge of nuclear events in the endometrium at the time an embryo is implanted. She was frequently cited for her theories on the role of calcium in the function of the spermatocyte, a stage in the developing male sex cell. At Mount Sinai and City College         Dr. Gordon joined the faculty of the department of cell biology and anatomy at Mount Sinai in 1981 as a professorial lecturer, the title she held at her death. From 1978 until two years ago, she also was a medical professor at the School for Biomedical Education of the City University Medical School at City College and, until 1985, a member of the college's graduate faculty of biochemistry and biology.         Mildred Kobrin Gordon was born in Manhattan and was a biology graduate of City College, with an M.S. in zoology from Tulane University and a Ph.D. in anatomy from Yale University School of Medicine. She had various teaching and research jobs at Yale before joining the State University of New York in Buffalo as an associate professor of anatomical sciences in the mid-1970's.         A statement from City University yesterday said her studies there had furthered in vitro fertilization, adding: "She was always deeply concerned about minority issues, and provided strong suport for minority students, and was a longtime advocate for women in science and medicine."         Dr. Gordon, who was divorced, is survived by two sons, Marc, of Manhattan, and Dr. Jon W. of Chappaqua, N.Y.; a daughter, Sara, of Cambridge, Mass.; a sister, Maya Wallace of Woodland Hills, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Kathrine Koller, a Renaissance scholar who became the first woman to head a department at the University of Rochester, died on Aug. 17 at a Rochester nursing home. Dr. Koller, a resident of Rochester, was 91.         She had a long illness, the university reported.         Dr. Koller, a gifted speaker who joined the Rochester faculty in 1942, was chairman of the English department from 1946 to 1958. Beyond her expertise in 17th-century English literature, she was known for her belief in the need of a firm footing in the humanities for young people to help them learn self-discipline and integrity.         She was born in Hudson, N.Y., graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wittenberg University and received a doctorate at Johns Hopkins University in 1932. She taught high school English in Ohio and was an assistant professor at Bryn Mawr College before she went to Rochester.         There, she was named Joseph H. Gilmore Professor of English in 1948. Under her guidance, the English department nearly doubled its faculty to 20 members and instituted a Ph.D. program for future English teachers.         Her articles on Renaissance literature appeared in scholarly journals. She reached emeritus status in 1967.         In 1950, Dr. Koller married William Diez, professor of political science at Rochester. He died three years ago.       
         Reva Clamage Shwayder, an artist who was the subject of a documentary film that won an Academy Award, died at her home in Franklin, Mich., on Thursday. She was 91.         The cause was complications of a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Shwayder was married for 62 years to Benjamin Shwayder, who with his four brothers founded the Samsonite Corporation.         She took an interest in the business and sat in on family discussions guiding the growth of the company, said her grandson, Mark Shwayder.         Samsonite developed and became the world's largest manufacturer of hard-sided luggage, then expanded into the production of folding chairs and tables. Mr. Shwayder, who invented devices for the company, was its president.         Starting in 1950, Mrs. Shwayder became a painter, doing large worksin acrylics and water colors that featured bright flowers and landscapes in an abstract style.         When she retired two years ago, she had produced hundreds of paintings and had held many exhibits. She sold her works to private collectors and corporate clients including Ford, Chrysler, I.B.M. and Kresge, as well as to the Detroit Institute of Arts and Pennsylvania Academy of Arts.         Her husband died in 1981, and five years later she married Louis Gothelf, a painter, but she retained her original married name.         Mr. Gothelf's daughter, Sue Marx, joined Pamela Conn in directing "Young at Heart," which was shown at the New York Film Festival and won the Academy Award in the short subject category in 1988.         The movie focused on Mrs. Shwayder's career and remarriage late in life, and how she coped with the losses of her first husband and sons Warren, who died in a scuba diving accident, and Richard, who died of cancer soon after.         Mrs. Shwayder was born in Chicago and studied at the University of Chicago.         Her survivors include her husband; a sister, Anne Klein of Laguna Beach, Calif.; six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

         Miriam Irene Eolis, a lawyer, accountant and theatrical producer, died Wednesday at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. She was 80.         The cause was complications from a recent fall, her family said.         She was a graduate of Hunter College and one of the first women to graduate from St. John's University School of Law. She also held a graduate degree in tax law from Columbia University and was a certified public accountant.         Ms. Eolis was a tax consultant in private practice and served on the faculty of the New York University Tax Institute and Pace University. She also was treasurer and president of the New York State Society of Public Accountants.         She had a lifelong interest in the theater and toured Europe with the Pegasus Players and was a producer of the Westchester County, Yonkers and Kennebunkport playhouses for 10 years.         She was married to Alexander L. Eolis and, after his death, married Mortimer M. Kassell. They later divorced.         She is survived by three daughters, Sharon and Wendeen of Manhattan, and Susan Kassell of Potomac, Md.       
         Muriel R. Carbery, a retired nursing school dean and hospital nursing director, died on Tuesday at home in Port Jefferson, L.I. She was 81.         From 1952 to 1974 Miss Carbery served as the director of the nursing service at New York Hospital. From 1958 to 1970 held the dual post of dean of the Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing.         After stepping down as dean, she continued as a professor and associate dean of the nursing school's continuing education division.         Miss Carbery, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Hunter College, where she trained to become a teacher of Greek and Latin. Because of the scarcity of jobs in the Depression, she worked briefly in a library, then decided to become a nurse and combine that profession with teaching. She graduated from New York Hospital School of Nursing in 1937 and later earned a master's degree in nursing education at Catholic University.         Her first nursing job, at New York Hospital, paid $65 a month plus board and room for a 48-hour week. She worked in surgery and private nursing and started teaching in 1940.         During World War II she served four years in the United States Army Nurse Corps in the Pacific. Her assignments included working in a 600-bed tent and tin-roof hospital in the jungles of New Guinea and in a 2,500-bed hospital in West New Guinea that was bombed in the fighting during Gen. Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines.         She reached the rank of major during active duty and retired from the reserve in 1970 as a colonel.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Morgan, of Marietta, Ga.       
         Linda M. Martelli, a copy editor at The New York Times for the last 11 years, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 43 and lived in Manhattan and Brigantine, N.J.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Martelli was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Pennsylvania State University. She worked at The Danbury News-Times in Connecticut and The Delaware County Daily Times in Pennsylvania before joining The Philadelphia Bulletin in 1980.         She joined The New York Times in 1982, and worked as a makeup editor and as a copy editor on the metropolitan desk and the national editions. At her death, she was a copy editor for the Connecticut Weekly section.         Ms. Martelli is survived by her father, Fred L. Martelli of Ridley Park, Pa.; and a brother, Fred J. Martelli of West Chester, Pa.       
         Stella Kramrisch, an authority on Indian art, a teacher and a curator, died on Tuesday at her home in Philadelphia. She was 97 and lived near Philadelphia.         Born in Mikulov, Austria, on May 29, 1896, Professor Kramrisch earned a doctorate of philosophy in Vienna in 1919. When she became the first professor of Indian art at the University of Calcutta in 1923 and published "Principles of Indian Art" in 1924, Professor Kramrisch laid the foundations for the systematic study of Indian art.         She personified that systematic study in the series of books that followed: "Indian Sculpture" (1932), "A Survey of Painting in the Deccan" (1937), "Indian Terracottas" (1939), "The Hindu Temple" (1946) and "Arts and Crafts of Travancore" (1948).         From 1932 to 1950 the professor co-edited the Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art. From 1937 to 1941 she lectured on Indian art at the Courtauld Institute in London. In 1950 she moved to the United States, where she was both professor of South Asian art at the University of Pennsylvania, and curator of Indian art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 1964 she was appointed professor of Indian art at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.         Apart from teaching and writing, she was highly regarded as an exhibition organizer. Examples of her skill were "The Art of Nepal and Tibet" (1960), "Unknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and Village" (1968) and "Himalayan Art 700-1900" (1978), all at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.         She produced a show, "Manifestations of Siva," for the Philadelphia Museum in 1981. The professor's last exhibition was "Painted Delight," a show of Mogul paintings, also at the Philadelphia, in 1986.       
         Dr. Barbara Biber Bodansky, a leading researcher in child psychology and early education for nearly half a century, died on Tuesday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Medical Center. She was 89.         Her family said she had had a long illness.         Dr. Biber -- the name she used professionally -- was chairman of the child development faculty of the Bank Street College of Education from 1931 to 1960. She directed its research division from 1950 to 1963.         In those positions, she played a central role in creating several new graduate and research programs dealing with early education theory, child psychology and social policy.         In 1973 she became a Distinguished Research Scholar Emeritus at the college, which is on 112th Street near Broadway and was founded in 1916 as a center for training and research in early childhood education. Strong Self-Images         As a teacher, Dr. Biber believed that the best early education programs develop the emotional life of children as well as their intellects, foster strong self-images, encourage responsibility to others, and support imagination and curiosity.         Toward that end, Dr. Biber, along with her colleagues at the college, helped to establish teacher workshops in New York City public schools in the 1940's and 50's.         In the 1960's she directed a study of schools and mental health with a $1 million grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health. At the end of that decade, she began devising the basic principles for federally financed day care and Head Start programs.         At the age of 80, she completed "Early Education and Psychological Development" (Yale University Press, 1984). She also was co-author of two books reporting major research studies: "Child Life in School" (1942) and "The Pyschological Impact of School Experience" (1969).         Dr. Biber, who was born in Brooklyn, first attended Barnard College and then graduated from the University of Chicago. She received a Ph.D. in psychology in 1942 from Columbia University.         In 1929, Dr. Biber was married to Dr. Oscar Bodansky, chief of clinical biochemistry at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He died in 1977.         She is survived by a daughter, Margery B. Franklin of Manhattan; two grandsons, Kenneth and David Frankin, and a sister, Lilian Uviller Pilat.       
         Ellen Joyce Alter, a Detroit civic leader and bankruptcy lawyer, died on Saturday at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Pontiac, Mich. She was 44.         Her family said the cause was a cerebral aneurysm.         Born in Cambridge, Mass., Mrs. Alter graduated from Brandeis University and the University of Michigan law school. She was an adjunct professor of law at the University of Detroit and a member of the Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish Welfare Federation of Metropolitan Detroit.         She was a partner in the law firm of Jaffe, Raitt, Heuer & Weiss, and specialized in the rights of creditors and debtors.         She is survived by her husband, Peter; a son, Daniel; a daughter, Jessica, and her parents.       
         Diana Vincent-Daviss, a professor of law and law librarian at Yale University Law School, died on Tuesday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 50.         A spokeswoman for the university said she died of a cerebral aneurysm.         She was appointed law librarian at Yale in 1991 after serving in a similar capacity at New York University for eight years, during which she supervised the expansion of the law library, doubling its physical size.         She was known for her work on the preservation of library materials and was a consultant to more than a dozen law libraries, including libraries in Chile, which she assisted under a grant from the United States Agency for International Development.  Author of Handbooks         She was also involved in the promotion of international human rights and was recently named deputy director of the Orville H. Schell Jr. Center for International Human Rights at Yale. The center promotes research and assists lawyers and organizations concerned about preserving individual rights and freedoms and acts as a clearing house for information.         She was the author of many articles and handbooks, including a three-part research guide on human rights law that was published by New York University.         She was born in Birmingham, England. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in law at Cambridge and a master's degree in library science at Columbia University in 1972.         Her marriage to Stephen Elias ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Megan Elias of San Rafael, Calif., and two sisters, Elizabeth Christenfeld of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Lucy Vincent-Daviss of Evesham, England.       
         Dr. Daphne A. Roe, a dermatologist and nutrition expert, died on Wednesday at a community hospital in Ithaca, N.Y., after having been injured earlier in the day in an automobile accident near Trumansburg, N.Y. She was 70.         Dr. Roe was a professor emeritus of nutritional sciences at Cornell University. Her expertise ranged from the role of beta carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in protecting the human immune system from sunlight to nutritional deficiencies in the elderly to interactions between drugs and nutrients.         In the last 15 years she taught nutrition to graduate students from North America, Europe, Asia and Africa.         Awards in 1987         Dr. Roe was a fellow of the American Institute of Nutrition. Her honors included the American Medical Association's Joseph B. Goldberger Award in Clinical Nutrition in 1987, and, the same year, the Lederle Award of the American Institute of Nutrition, which described her as "a major contributor to the recognition of drug-induced nutritional deficiencies."         Her most recent research was in nutrition and aging, particularly the role of carotenoids, including beta carotene, in the protection of the immune systems of older people. She found that moderate doses of beta carotene can protect people from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light on the immune system. She also established a link between overexposure to sunlight and reduction of beta carotene in plasma. In Time, the Priesthood         Beta carotene is a nutrient that the human body converts to vitamin A; some researchers believe it plays a role in reducing the risk of cancer.         In 1984, she found that the recommended dietary allowance for riboflavin was insufficient for women who exercise, and proposed a doubling of that level.         Her books included "Drug-Induced Nutritional Deficiencies" (1976), "Alcohol and Diet," (1980), "Nutrition and the Skin" (1986) and "Geriatric Nutrition" (1992).         At the time of her death she was in divinity school, a candidate for the Episcopal priesthood.         Dr. Roe was born in London. She was graduated from the University of London in 1945, where she received her M.D. degree five years later. In 1963, she joined the Cornell faculty.         She is survived by two sons -- Adrian, of Pittsburgh, and David, of Portland, Ore.; a daughter, Laura, of Hartford, and a grandson.       
         Bessie Boris, a painter of landscapes and portraits known for their rich colors and expressive distortions, died on Thursday at her home in Lee, Mass. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Rachel Klein, of La Jolla, Calif.         Miss Boris, who was born in Johnstown, Pa., studied at the Art Students League in the early 1930's and worked for the Works Progress Administration, teaching classes in a settlement house. Although she spent most of her life in New York City and Massachusetts, she had her first one-woman exhibition in 1949 at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., where her husband, George Klein, worked briefly as a psychologist at the Menninger Clinic.         Miss Boris specialized in a seemingly naive style that placed great emphasis on color and psychologically charged distortions of form. Throughout the 1960's, she was represented by the Cober Gallery in Manhattan; in the late 1980's and early 90's, she exhibited at the Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery in SoHo. In 1987, she had a retrospective at the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Mass.         Her work is represented in the collections of the Denver Art Museum, the Newark Art Museum, the Smith College Museum in Northhampton, Mass., and the Berkshire Museum.         Miss Boris's husband died in 1971. She is survived by her daughter and a grandson.       
         Lillian Ruth Kessler, founder of the Kessler International Corporation, which exports railroad parts, electronics and heavy industrial equipment to Asia, Africa and South America, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Washington. She was 85.         Her daughter, Elinor Fuchs, said her mother had Alzheimer's disease.         Ms. Kessler founded the company in 1946. It is now based in Rockville, Md.         Before she established the business Ms. Kessler served for a year as an analyst for the Foreign Economic Administration, a Federal agency, conducting studies of postwar industrialization in Ethiopia and China. She then worked as an industrial economist for an international engineering firm and as a foreign markets consultant for the Sinclair Oil Corporation. W.P.A. History Project         While still a doctoral student in economic history in what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ms. Kessler was asked to direct a pilot history project for the Works Progress Administration, the New Deal program established in 1935 to provide employment through public works projects; eventually, the history project grew into the W.P.A.'s Historical Records Survey.         Ms. Kessler was named the director of the project for Ohio in 1939. During her work with the W.P.A. she wrote a guidebook to American folk songs, "Songs of Yesterday: A Song Anthology of American Life," with Philip D. Jordan.         She was born in Cleveland and attended Radcliffe College before enrolling at the Cleveland university, where she received an undergraduate degree in 1929.         In 1930 she married Joseph Fuchs, the violinist, who was then with the Cleveland Orchestra. They divorced in 1940.         Besides her daughter, Ms. Kessler is survived by a brother, Dr. Edwin S. Kessler of Washington, and two granddaughters.       
         Nina Berberova, a Russian-born poet, novelist, playwright, critic and professor of literature whose biography is a classic of the Russian emigre Diaspora, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Philadelphia. She was 92.         She died of complications from a fall last March, said Dr. Murl G. Barker, a friend, who is chairman of the Russian department at Rutgers University.         Miss Berberova is best known for her 1969 autobiography, "The Italics Are Mine," written during the years 1960 to 1965. Many of the figures in the worlds of emigre arts and politics -- including Anna Akhmatova, Alexander Blok, Vladimir Nabokov, Maxim Gorky and Fyodor Sologub -- come vividly alive in her reminiscences.         "She has brilliantly evoked the atmosphere of literary Petrograd," wrote a critic in The New York Times Book Review in 1969, adding that the memoirs "have yielded some remarkable portraits and vignettes." The book was re-issued last year by Alfred A. Knopf in a revised translation.  A Film From Her Novella         Recognition for her fiction came late, but French, German and English critics have compared Miss Berberova's sharp, incisive writing to that of Turgenev's and Chekhov's. Her 1934 novella "The Accompanist," about a young woman pianist who accompanies and competes with a soprano, was made into a film this year by the French director Claude Miller.         A selection of Miss Berberova's novellas, "The Tattered Cloak and Other Novels," was published by Knopf in 1991. Michiko Kakutani, writing in The Times, said: "Long overdue in America, this collection of stories deserves a wide and appreciative audience, while Miss Berberova herself deserves recognition as one of the most captivating Russian writers alive today."         Her fiction has been on best-seller lists in France, and she was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Government in 1989.         Miss Berberova (pronounced bur-BEAR-uh-vuh) was born in 1901 in St. Petersburg; her father was an Armenian civil servant; her mother was Russian. She attended Rostov University and was involved in the literary and artistic ferment in that city until she left in 1922, accompanying the poet Vladislav Khodasevich. Together they traveled about Europe as members of the household of Maxim Gorky, before settling in Paris in 1925. Reported the News         Miss Berberova then began a 15-year affiliation with the Russian-language daily Poslednye Novosti, reporting news events and writing book reviews, critical articles, short fiction and theater and movie reviews. She was also one of the founders of the emigre weekly Russkaya Mysl' in 1947.         She wrote four novels and "Tchaikovsky," a biography of the composer. Appearing in 1937, the book created a sensation because it dealt openly with the composer's homosexuality.         In 1950 Miss Berberova immigrated to the United States, working at a variety of jobs until she became the editor of the journal Mosty. In 1958 she joined the Slavic department at Yale University, and in 1963 she moved on to Princeton, where she taught until 1971.         Miss Berberova was the partner of Khodasevich until the 1930's, but they were never married. She married Nikolai Makeyev, a journalist, in 1937; and in the 1950's, George Kochevitsky, a musician who died last month. Both marriages ended in divorce.         Miss Berberova, who became a United States citizen, returned to Russia in 1989.         She received an honorary doctorate from Middlebury College in 1983, and another from Yale University last year. She moved from Princeton to Philadelphia in 1990.       
         Alice S. Morris, for many years a figure on New York's literary scene, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 and lived in Greenwich Village.         The cause was sudden respiratory failure, her family said.         From 1951 to 1968, Mrs. Morris was the literary editor of Harper's Bazaar. Herself a writer and critic of modern fiction, she helped to introduce many fresh American authors to the reading public.         PEN International awarded her a Sue Kaufman Lifetime Achievement Award in 1977 for the editorial assistance she had given to new and emerging writers.         Born in Manhattan, she grew up in Morristown, N.J.         After retiring from Harper's Bazaar at the age of 65, Mrs. Morris, who had no college degree, started a new career at Columbia University teaching short-story writing. She later lectured at the New School, where she continued to hold classes until she turned 80.         She was the editor of "An Uncommon Reader" (Avon Books, 1965), a selection of 35 outstanding short stories she had steered toward publication in Harper's Bazaar. She also wrote a book of poems, "Crane on the Hackmatack." At her death she was working on a series of humorous poems.         Mrs. Morris's marriage to Harvey Breit, playwright and novelist, ended in divorce. Mr. Breit died in 1968 at 58.         She is survived by a son, Luke Breit of Mendocino, Calif.; a daughter, Miranda Breit of Piney River, Va.,and three grandchildren.       
         Barbara Taylor Schoen, an author and the founder and director of the writing program at the State University of New York at Purchase, died on Thursday at her Purchase home. She was 69.         She had been ill for a long time, her family said.         Mrs. Schoen, a native of Manhattan, graduated from Bryn Mawr College, cum laude, and Boston University, where she earned a master's degree in physics. While pursuing a doctorate in physics at Boston, she worked on isotope analysis as a technician in the Department of Biophysics of Harvard Medical School.         While raising four children, she began a writing career in the 1950's and saw her short stories first published in Seventeen magazine. Over the years, she also contributed articles on education, personal computers and other subjects to various periodicals.         She was the author of two well-received novels for young readers, "A Place and A Time" (1967) and "A Spark of Joy" (1969), both published by Crowell.         Mrs. Schoen (rhymes with phone) became a teacher-counselor in 1970 at the Cooperative College in Mount Vernon, which was later merged into the College of Letters and Sciences at SUNY-Purchase. At Purchase she became an assistant professor of language arts in 1973 and an associate professor five years later.         A tenured faculty member, she was teaching nine undergraduate courses covering various aspects of writing from poetry to essays to fiction and science. She had been director of the college's Writing Program since 1984. As such she developed a series of courses and a set of creative-writing classes for literature majors hoping to write professionally.         Mrs. Schoen is survived by her husband of 47 years, Donald R.; two sons, Robert of Southport, Conn., and John of Riverside, Conn.; two daughters, Claire Werner of Norwalk, Conn., and Susan Terray of Woods Hole, Mass.; her mother, Caroline Colgate Taylor of Manhattan; a sister, Alice Day of Canberra, Australia; a brother, Howard C. Taylor 3d of Jericho, Vt., and six grandchildren.       
         Mary Grace Carpenter, a Connecticut schoolteacher who was an expert on the American Shakers, died on Saturday at the Greenery, a rehabilitation center in Hyannis, Mass. She was 74.         Mrs. Carpenter had Parkinson's disease. She died after a fall, said her husband, Charles. She had been a resident of New Canaan, Conn., since 1951 and a summer resident of Nantucket since 1963.         She lectured at museums on the Shakers and with her husband wrote extensively on Shaker furniture and other American decorative arts. Their jointly written books include "Tiffany Silver" (1978) and "The Decorative Arts and Crafts of Nantucket" (1987).         She was born Mary Grace Winnett in Pittsburgh. She graduated from the University of Pittsburgh and received a master's degree from Bridgeport University.         From 1963 to 1984 she taught in Center School in New Canaan, where she was assistant principal and head of the mathematics program.         In 1990, Mrs. Carpenter's family established the Mary Grace Carpenter Award for Excellence in Elementary Teaching in the New Canaan school system.         She was on the Visiting Committee of the Department of American Decorative Arts and Sculpture of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.         She is survived by her husband of 50 years, Charles; two daughters, Susan Curcio of Chatham, Mass., and Shelley Brown of Glen Ellen, Vt.; a son, Philip Atwood Carpenter of Chester, Vt.; a brother, Robert Winnett of Pittsburgh, and eight grandchildren.       
         Jean Eckart, who designed sets with her husband, William, for many Broadway shows, including "Fiorello!" and "Damn Yankees," died on Monday at her home in Dallas. She was 72.         The cause was lung cancer, her husband said.         Throughout the 50's and 60's, the Eckarts established themselves as among the most versatile and productive theatrical designers in the business, often working on costumes and lighting as well as sets. They were associated especially with musicals, including "The Golden Apple," "Li'l Abner," "She Loves Me" and "Mame," and received a Donaldson Award and two Tony nominations.         They also did design work for television, notably for the 1957 CBS broadcast of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella." In 1959, they were co-producers, as well as the designers, of "Once Upon a Mattress," which starred Carol Burnett. Their film work included "Damn Yankees," "The Pajama Game" and "The Night They Raided Minsky's." The Goal: 'Light and Airy'         "We tried to do things that were light and airy and that suited the character of each show," Mr. Eckart said yesterday. "In some ways, we were more interested in the movement of the scenery, and how that contributed to the show." In a review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson described the Eckarts' work in "Once Upon a Mattress" as "effortless and cheerful -- a shining fairy-story production designed out of affection and good humor."         Mrs. Eckart, whose maiden name was Jean Levy, was born in Chicago on Aug. 18, 1921. She met her future husband, whom she married in 1943, when they were both students in New Orleans, and they attended the Yale School of Drama together. In 1971, the Eckarts moved to Dallas to teach at Southern Methodist University, while continuing to take on occasional free-lance design projects.         Mrs. Eckart received a master's degree in social work from the University of Texas and co-founded the Community Psychotherapy Center, a nonprofit institution in Dallas.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her brother, Edwin Levy of Topeka, Kans.; a half-sister, Linda Levy of Boulder, Colo.; a son, Peter, of San Francisco; a daughter, Julie Johnson of Norwalk, Conn., and a grandson, Travis Johnson, also of Norwalk.       
         Joan R. Sovern, a sculptor, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 57.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Michael, who stepped down in June as president of Columbia University.         Mrs. Sovern, who was born and grew up in Manhattan, majored in art at Bennington College. She later studied sculpture with William Zorach and John Hovannes at the Art Students League. Her early works were large abstract pieces in bronze, terra cotta and marble, but in recent years she turned to assemblage, making small, angular forms out of slate, stone and driftwood. She had solo exhibitions at the Nora Haime Gallery in 1988 and the Kouros Gallery in 1991.         Mrs. Sovern also served on the Columbia Art History Advisory Council and helped create the Henry Moore Sculpture Reserve at Columbia's campus in Harriman, N.Y.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a brother, Edward Rosenthal of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.; a daughter, Hannah Wit of Oakland, Calif.; a son, David Wit of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Julie Sovern of New York City and Elizabeth Sovern of Mount Kisco, N.Y.; two stepsons, Jeffrey Sovern of Queens and Douglas Sovern of Oakland, and four grandchildren.       
         Lenore Blanchard Stoughton, a New York City lawyer who specialized in trademark and copyright law for 65 years, died on Aug. 30 at a nursing home in Kingston, N.Y. She was 88.         Her family said she had had a long illness.         Mrs. Stoughton had lived in New York, where she was a senior partner in the firm of Rogers Hoge & Hills. For many years she was one of the few women in her profession.         She was born in Otsego County in New York in 1905. She received her law degree at the Albany Law School of Union University and was admitted to the bar in 1927.         When she came to New York City, she was unable to find work as a lawyer. Determined to work, she became a switchboard operator in the offices of Rogers & Ramsey. She then became secretary to the senior partner, Edward S. Rogers, who was an expert in trademark law.         She later joined the legal staff as an associate attorney, assisting James F. Hoge. She became a partner in the successor firm of Rogers Hoge & Hills in 1947 and a senior partner in 1952. She retired in 1980 but remained counsel to the firm until its trademark practice was merged with the firm of Pennie & Edmonds in 1987.         She was the widow of Philip Van Everen Stoughton. She is survived by a daughter, Lenore Ridgway of Kingston, N.Y., three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Small Gaynor, the first black woman to head a major teaching hospital in the United States, died on Sept. 16 at Christiana Medical Center in Newark, Del. She was 72.         She died unexpectedly after a sudden brain hemorrhage, said her son, Wardell.         Mrs. Gaynor, a registered nurse by training, rose through the ranks of administration at several large New York hospitals at a time when there were few women or blacks in such positions. In February 1971, she was chosen from a field of 20 candidates, the rest of them male, to be executive director of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem, making her the first black woman ever to head one of the city's municipal hospitals.         Eighteen months later she accepted a job in New Jersey, as executive director of Martland Hospital in Newark, a 600-bed teaching hospital operated by the state's medical school. Now part of the the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, it was then the state's largest hospital. Struggle to Become Nurse         Born in Jersey City, the fourth of six girls, Mrs. Gaynor fought racial barriers from the time she graduated from high school, at the age of 15, to get training to become a nurse. The first nursing school where she applied, at Jersey City Medical Center, turned her down because it did not admit blacks.         She worked at a doll factory and at an electric plant to help support her family and then applied the nursing school at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. She graduated as a registered nurse in 1946 and worked first at Queens General Hospital.         After a stint as a public-health nurse in East Harlem for New York City's Health Department, she worked as head nurse at Francis Delafield Hospital in Washington Heights and as a school nurse with the Board of Education in Newark.         At the same time she was pursuing a bachelor's degree in nursing and then a master's degree in public health at New York University. She spent the summer of 1965 at the University of Oslo in Norway studying the Scandinavian health system.         When she returned, she pursued a career in hospital administration, starting in the pediatrics department of Lincoln Hospital, which is staffed by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. After a series of promotions, she was named assistant administrator in 1970.         After heading Sydenham Hospital and Martland Hospital, she left the Northeast to serve from 1976 to 1980 as director of hospital and health services at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, a historically black school that has produced many of the nation's black doctors.         From 1980 until 1984, she was director of the West Philadelphia Community Mental Health Consortium in Philadelphia. For two years, before she retired in Wilmington, Del., she worked again as a school nurse, in Los Angeles.         She is survived by two sons, Wardell Michael Gaynor of Brooklyn and Matthew Small Gaynor of Cincinnati; a daughter, Brenda L. Gainer of Wilmington; 10 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Kay Nolte Smith, the author of "The Watcher" and other mystery novels, died on Saturday at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, N.J. She was 61 and lived in Tinton Falls, N.J.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, Judith Nolte Heimer of Manhattan.         Ms. Smith was born in Eveleth, Minn., and grew up in Baraboo, Wis. In 1952 she earned a bachelor's degree in the liberal arts at the University of Minnesota. She was awarded a master's degree in speech and theater at the University of Utah in 1955.         After moving to New York City, she worked as an advertising copywriter and as an actress in summer stock and Off Broadway theater under the name Kay Gillian. She also taught speech and writing at Brookdale Community College in Lincroft, N.J.         In 1980 she published "The Watcher," which won the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America for the best first novel by a mystery writer. Her other novels included "Country of the Heart," "Elegy for a Soprano," "Mindspell," "A Tale of the Wind" and "Venetian Song," to be published next year by Villard Books.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by her husband, Phillip J. Smith; her father, Clifford Nolte of St. Louis, and a brother, Douglas, of St. Louis.       
         Charlotte Catherine Campbell, a retired professor who advanced the knowledge and treatment of infections caused by fungi, died on Friday at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. A Boston resident, she was 78.         She had had a brief illness, said a spokesman for J. S. Waterman & Sons funeral homes in Boston.         A specialist in medical mycology, the study of fungi, Professor Campbell wrote or was the co-author of more than 100 treatises, particularly on the causes and cures of histoplasmosis, lung diseases caused by fungus. For her work, she received the highest award of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology in 1979. Although she never finished her doctorate, this was one of many honors she received.         Born on a farm near Winchester, Va., she became fascinated with fungi that form in garden soil and get into the blood, brain and lungs of humans, where the fungi grow and cause trouble. She told an interviewer after the 1979 award that the fungi "are molds like the ones that grow on bread in the fridge or on damp shoes in the closet."         She trained at Ohio State University, American University, George Washington University and Duke University as well as on the job as a microbiologist. In 1948, she became chief of medical mycology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington.         She left in 1962 to become an associate professor of medical mycology at Harvard University's School of Public Health and advanced to full professor in 1970. Three years later she accepted an appointment as professor of medical sciences at Southern Illinois University and also served as department chairwoman from 1974 until her academic retirement in 1977.         She then worked on foreign-student exchanges for the American Society of Microbiology in what was then the Soviet Union for three years. More recently, she worked as a volunteer at Brigham & Women's Hospital and with battered women in the Boston area.         Professor Campbell is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Flint of Daytona Beach, Fla.       
         Helen Adam, a poet and composer of Scottish ballads, died on Sept. 19 at a nursing home in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. She was 83.         A master of ballads and classical English poetry, she was nevertheless closely associated with the Beat authors and the San Francisco school of poets. She read her work alongside friends like Allen Ginsburg and Robert Duncan.         Ms. Adam was born in Glasgow, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. She was a child prodigy who had small books of poems published while she was still a teen-ager. After attending Edinburgh University and working as a journalist in London, she moved to New York with her family and then settled in San Francisco with her mother and sister, Pat, who often collaborated with her.         Her poems were collected in "Selected Poems and Ballads," published by Helikon Press in 1975. She also wrote a musical play with her sister. Called "San Francisco's Burning," it was produced in the 1960's at the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village. The score was written by the Rev. Al Carmines.         The experimental film maker Rosa von Praunheim featured Ms. Adam in several films, including a biographical documentary. Ms. Adam's last public appearance was in the public television series "Poetry Minute" in 1988. She became a recluse after her sister died later that year.       
         Anne Thompson MacDonald, the founder of Recording for the Blind, a nonprofit organization that has put more than 80,000 books on tapes for blind and learning-disabled students since 1948, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Huntington, L.I. She was 96 and had lived in Manhattan.         She died in her sleep, said her daughter, Anne Thomas.         Mrs. MacDonald started the recording service while working for the Women's Auxiliary of the New York Public Library. She was inspired by a program that provided recordings for blind veterans attending college on the G.I. Bill of Rights.         She established a recording studio in a two-room office on West 44th Street in 1951 and became president of Recording for the Blind in 1952. That year, she persuaded friends to establish other studios in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Athens, Ga. Volunteer for Several Groups         The organization, now based in Princeton, N.J., has grown to 32 studios in 16 states, with about 4,000 volunteers making recordings of fiction and nonfiction books for students from the fifth grade to graduate school. Last year, about 33,000 people requested copies of the recordings.         Mrs. MacDonald began working as a volunteer for several organizations during World War II. She was appointed assistant director of the Nurses' Aide Corps of the American Red Cross in 1942 and later helped set up a program to house and feed British soldiers released from Japanese prison camps who stopped in New York on their way home.         In May 1988, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Yale University for her volunteer work.         She was the wife of Ranald H. MacDonald, a governor of the New York Stock Exchange, who died in 1988.         She is survived by her son, Ranald H. Jr. of Denver; her daughter, Anne M. Thomas of Locust Valley, L.I.; 10 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Christine O'Reilly, one of the tennis-playing triplets from Ridgewood, N.J., died on Sunday at the University of California hospital at Irvine. She never regained consciousness after suffering a severe head injury in an automobile accident in Irvine early Saturday morning. She was 25.         John Korff, a tennis promoter from Mahwah, N.J., said that Miss O'Reilly had been in California scouting sites for a balloon festival next year. He said she was the lone passenger in a car driven by Steven Allan Evans, 29, the pilot who had flown her over prospective sites. Mr. Evans was killed instantly when the car struck a utility pole.         The youngest of identical triplets, Miss O'Reilly and her sisters, Patty and Terri, were celebrities in Ridgewood almost from the moments they were born on Jan. 18, 1968.         Until injuries knocked her out for her senior season, Christine played No. 1 singles at Duke, compiling a 69-19 record.         After graduating with degrees in economics, all three joined the women's tour, but never cracked the top 100. Christine and Terri left the tour last year to join Korff Enterprises.         In addition to her sisters, Miss O'Reilly is survived by her parents, Eugene and Dolores O'Reilly, and three older brothers, Gene, Brian and John.

         Dr. Harriet L. Hardy, a pioneer in occupational medicine and the first woman to become a full professor at Harvard Medical School, died on Wednesday in Boston. She was 87.         Dr. Hardy died from lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system, at the Massachusetts General Hospital, where she had worked since 1940, hospital officials said.         Dr. Hardy set out to become a country doctor but developed an early interest in toxicology and environmentally related illness. Her investigation of respiratory illness among factory workers in Lynn and Salem, Mass., in the mid-1940's led to the discovery that they had come down with berylliosis, an often fatal disease caused by exposure to the light metal beryllium.         Berylliosis results from inhaling dust or fumes containing beryllium, but the symptoms may not emerge until 10 to 20 years after exposure to even a small amount of the metal. The disease, which develops in only a small percentage of people who are exposed, can produce coughing, shortness of breath, weight loss and scarring of the lungs. Created a Model Registry         Dr. Hardy set up a registry of beryllium illness that the hospital still maintains. The registry became a model for tracking other occupational hazards and establishing guidelines for their control.         In 1947, Dr. Hardy created an occupational medicine clinic at the hospital and remained its director until she retired in 1971. Dr. Hardy also led the occupational medical service at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge for more than 20 years and advised the institute on safety considerations relating to its first nuclear reactor. She also helped coordinate the study of industrial diseases at Dartmouth College.         Dr. Hardy was not the first woman appointed to the Harvard Medical School faculty but was its first full professor. That appointment did not come until the end of her career, in 1971, when she was made clinical professor of medicine.         Dr. Homayoun Kazemi, chief of pulmonary and critical care at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said Dr. Hardy was "very kind, yet bombastic, never hesitating to express her opinions."         "She spoke her mind, and there was no ambiguity about what she said," Dr. Kazemi said. Began as School Doctor         Harriet Louise Hardy was born in Arlington, Mass., on Sept. 23, 1905. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1928, received her medical degree from Cornell University in 1932, and went on to train as an intern and resident at Philadelphia General Hospital.         She began her career as school doctor at the Northfield School in western Massachusetts. In 1939, Dr. Hardy became college doctor and head of health education at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, where she developed an interest in women's growth and physical fitness.         Her lifelong interest in beryllium poisoning developed from her investigation of a mysterious respiratory illness that had occurred among workers making fluorescent lamps at the General Electric and Sylvania plants on Boston's north shore. Many of those affected were women.         At the time, Dr. Hardy was working on problems of lead poisoning with Dr. Joseph Aubt in Boston. He had been informed of the outbreak and told Dr. Hardy, "Something is happening in the factories, and they don't know what is going on." He encouraged her to investigate.         In linking the illness to beryllium, Dr. Hardy went back to work done in Russia and Germany in the 1920's and 1930's. Wrote a Standard Textbook         She described acute and chronic beryllium poisoning in papers in 1946 and 1947. About the same time, other groups described a similar illness among workers exposed to beryllium in Ohio.         The work of Dr. Hardy and others led to precautions that allowed safer use of beryllium.         Dr. Hardy worked with the Atomic Energy Commission in Los Alamos, N.M., to study hazards associated with nuclear energy. Beryllium is used in nuclear energy plants and the aerospace industry.         Dr. Hardy was a crusader against diseases caused by occupational exposure to dangerous substances. In 1954, she was among the first to link asbestos and cancer. She studied mercury poisoning and anthrax, a bacterial disease, among farm workers and was a pioneer in using drugs known as chelating agents to treat lead poisoning.         Dr. Hardy and Dr. Alice Hamilton, another occupational medicine pioneer, wrote a standard textbook on industrial toxicology. Dr. Hardy was the author of more than 100 scientific papers.         She is survived by four nephews.       
         Joan Sibley, a fashion designer whose work is included in the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Tuesday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. She was 52.         The cause was Burkitt's lymphoma, a rare form of cancer, said her husband, Peter Powell.         Ms. Sibley started her career in a small design studio she established on East 58th Street in Manhattan. She founded Sibley Coffee Ltd. with a fellow designer, Dory Coffee, in 1966. The company's popular silk jersey body dresses were sold in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, and private customers included Jacqueline Onassis, Babe Paley and Candice Bergen.         Born in Gipsy, Pa., she attended the Moore College of Art in Philadelphia and received a fellowship to travel and study in Europe, where she attended design classes at the Sorbonne.         Sibley Coffee was made a part of the Bendel's Studio Group in 1973 and closed in 1977. Ms. Sibley went on to work as associate designer for Ellen Tracy until 1980, when she left to work as a display designer and sales representative for Yale Burg, an antiques importing company in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband and a son, Gus Powell, who attends Oberlin College in Ohio.       
         Tamara Dembo, a psychologist who developed a method to study anger in social situations, died on Sunday at Memorial Hospital in Worcester, Mass. She was 91 and lived in Worcester.         Professor Dembo, who had taught at Clark University in Worcester, did important early work in Gestalt psychology in the United States, particularly in rehabilitation psychology. She developed a method to provoke anger in the subjects of experiments and developed a theory, in keeping with the Gestalt school, that the onset of anger depends more on situations than personality.         She was head of Clark University's Rehabilitation Psychology Training Program from 1962 to 1972 and was one of two recipients of the first research awards from the Division of Rehabilitation Counseling of the American Personnel and Guidance Association. Her research, which focused on problems in returning to a normal life after the loss of limbs or disfigurement, was applied after World War II to help injured veterans. At Clark, she also directed research with children suffering from cerebral palsy. Native of Russia         Professor Dembo was born in Baku, Russia, and grew up in St. Petersburg. She earned her doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1930 and emigrated to the United States before World War II to do research at Smith College, which she continued at Cornell University, the University of Iowa, Mount Holyoke College and Stanford University.         In 1948, she became an associate professor at the New School for Social Research in New York and then a research fellow at Harvard University in 1951. She joined the faculty at Clark University in 1953.         Professor Dembo, who lived on the Clark University campus, retired from active teaching in 1972 and was made a professor emeritus.       
         Mary E. Clark, a lawyer who successfully campaigned for a change in Florida law so that people with major illnesses would not lose a large part of their medical insurance coverage, died here on Saturday. She was 37.         The cause was colon cancer, said her husband, Keith Westerberg.         After discovering she had cancer in 1988, Ms. Clark thought her group insurance policy would cover her medical expenses up to $1 million. But after she retired because of her health, she discovered that her $1 million policy had been reduced to $250,000.         She took her case to court and to the public. Statewide Campaign         For four years she traveled across the state, arguing before newspaper editorial boards and at legislative meetings that insurance companies should not be able to reduce the medical benefits of people forced to retire because of illness.         She also sued her insurance company and won the right to medical benefits up to $1 million. But that decision was overturned on appeal.         In 1992, however, she persuaded the Legislature to increase minimum lifetime medical insurance benefits for individuals to $500,000.         "Most people in Mary's position do not have the time, energy, financial resources or legal resources to contest this sort of inequity," Mr. Westerberg said. "Mary did, and she helped change this unfair law for everyone."         Born in Washington, she moved to Sarasota to attend New College and later studied law at the University of Virginia. She was the managing attorney with Gulfcoast Legal Services, providing legal aid to people who were unable to afford lawyers.         In addition to her husband, survivors include her parents, William M. and Dorothy Clark of Arlington, Va., and a brother, John, of Sarasota.       
         Liza Anne Bosworth, a partner in a Manhattan law firm, died on Oct. 18 in San Francisco, where she was on a business trip. She was 35 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was accidental drowning, her family said.         A native of Manhattan, Ms. Bosworth graduated from Amherst College and, in 1983, from Columbia University Law School. She was admitted to the bar the following year, and joined the firm of Reboul, MacMurray, Hewitt, Maynard & Kristol in 1988 as an associate. She became a partner last year. She specialized in litigation in the firm's international practice.         Ms. Bosworth is survived by her husband, Nicholas Pearson, a sculptor; two children, Lukas and Julia; her parents, Stanley Bosworth, headmaster of Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights, and Anne Bosworth, head librarian of the school, which they jointly founded in 1965; a sister, Virginia Frisch of San Francisco, and a brother, Adam Bosworth of Seattle.       
         Beryl Emmer Menon, a journalist who edited the staff newspaper of Unicef, the United Nations relief organization, and who traveled and wrote widely in India and the Himalayas, died on Oct. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 50.         She had decided to discontinue kidney dialysis after 19 years of treatment, friends said.         Ms. Menon began her career as a freelance writer and photographer in Asia in the late 1960's after graduating with a journalism degree from New York University. She was a contributor to Ms. magazine, The Calcutta Statesman and The Bengali-American Reporter, taking assignments in Sikkim, Nepal and the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, which was then closed to outsiders by order of the Indian Government.         Indian officials began proceedings to deport Ms. Menon from Calcutta because of her violation of the travel ban, but she was allowed to remain after she married Bhaskar P. Menon, then a columnist for The Calcutta Statesman.         She returned to New York with her husband in 1970 and for the next three years worked as a reporter for The Record of Bergen County, N.J. In 1973, after learning she had kidney disease, she decided to travel again, to Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan.         In 1986, she became editor of Staff News, which is distributed to Unicef's employees around the world. She served in this position until last year.         She is survived by two brothers, William Kartel of Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., and Ted Kartofsky of Manhattan, and a sister, Sandra Kartfel of San Francisco.       
         Dr. Dorothy Borg, a Columbia University historian of United States-East Asian relations, died last Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Her family said she had had a brief illness.         From 1966 until her retirement several years ago, Dr. Borg was a senior research associate at Columbia's East Asian Institute, lecturing and directing academic conferences. She served as a mentor to generations of scholars since the 1940's when she was associated with the American Institute of Pacific Relations.         She was the author or editor of a number of books, including "The United States and the Far Eastern Crisis, 1933-1938" (Harvard University Press, 1965), for which Columbia awarded her its Bancroft Prize in American History. Based on research in personal papers of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and high officials dealing with East Asian affairs, it chronicled events leading to Pearl Harbor, starting with Japan's invasion of Manchuria.         She was the co-editor, with Waldo Heinrichs, of "Uncertain Years: Chinese American Relations, 1947-1950" (Columbia University Press, 1980), which remains in print. Defended Targets of McCarthy         A native of Elberon, N.J., she graduated from Wellesley College and earned master's and doctoral degrees at Columbia University. She spent two years in Beijing and Shanghai in the 1940's as a staff member of the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations.         A few years later, the Institute was a target of a campaign by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy to find out "who lost China" to the Communists. Dr. Borg set aside her career for some time to help defend Owen Lattimore, the historian, and other colleagues who came under fire from the Senator.         Before she joined the institute at Columbia, she was a researcher at Harvard University where she helped organize area programs that, starting in the 1960's, trained scholars in American and East Asian history.         Dr. Borg is survived by two nephews, John Loengard of New York City and Richard Loengard of Basking Ridge, N.J.       
         Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress and philanthropist whose bittersweet life was woven of luxury, disputes and interludes of deep unhappiness, died yesterday at her house in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80 and had her main residence in Somerset County, N.J. She also had homes on Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, in Newport, R.I., and Hawaii.         The cause was progressive pulmonary edema resulting in cardiac arrest, said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Bernard Lafferty, a friend and adviser to Miss Duke who was with her at her death.         Her manifold interests as a philanthropist ranged from animal rights to AIDS, historical preservation to orchids. By some accounts she was an astute manager of her assets, and a person familiar with her affairs said that she had left nearly all her estate of more than $1 billion to charity.         Late one evening in Rome in 1945, Miss Duke, who was then 33 years old, told a friend that her vast fortune was in some ways a barrier to happiness.         "All that money is a problem sometimes," Miss Duke told her companion, a young American journalist, over a glass of wine at the Hassler Hotel. "It happens every time. After I've gone out with a man a few times, he starts to tell me how much he loves me. But how can I know if he really means it? How can I ever be sure?" An Inheritance With a Double Edge         At that stage of her life, Miss Duke, then between marriages and working as a foreign correspondent based in Rome, was known and liked by other American expatriates for her friendly, unassuming ways, her warmth, and her love of jazz and ballroom dancing. But her words that night showed that her life had been profoundly affected, even scarred, by her wealth.         Miss Duke was not only rich; she was also thought for years to be the richest woman in the world. And she had that reputation during the Depression, when her wealth stood out in especially stark contrast to widespread poverty and suffering. As a result, she was always a celebrity, and one who literally stood out, standing six feet one inch tall.         Her millions, and the elegant life they made possible, seemed to be of great importance to her two husbands, James H. R. Cromwell, an American sportsman and advertising man, and Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican playboy and diplomat. She divorced them both.         The Duke millions also attracted cranks and photographers and ordinary curious people, and to avoid them Miss Duke lived a partly secluded life in her later years. In recent years, she traveled extensively and spent much time in Somerville, Newport, Hawaii and Beverly Hills. A Generous Giver With Many Interests         Her many philanthropic activities included paying for the restoration of numerous old buildings in Newport. She also established the Duke Gardens Foundation at Somerville in 1958. The Duke Gardens' trellised greenhouses, open to the public part of each year, contain French, English, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Islamic gardens and a collection of rare orchids.         As a philanthropist, Miss Duke was also active in support of environmental causes and animal rights. This year she contributed $2 million for AIDS research at Duke University in Durham, N.C., which was named for her family, and $1 million to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.         In addition, she was the president of the Doris Duke Foundation, based in Somerville, whose areas of interest have ranged from social and health services to cultural programs. The foundation reported $775,000 in charitable contributions in the 1992 fiscal year.         The president of Duke University, Nannerl O. Keohane, said yesterday, in a statement released by the university, that Miss Duke's "recent gift in support of AIDS research at Duke is but one of many programs here that she supported, from our Primate Center to other programs across the campus." She added: "Many of her gifts were made anonymously."         A spokesman for the university, John F. Burness, declined to say what, if anything, it might receive from Miss Duke's estate.         In an act of personal generosity in 1988 that involved an old friend, Miss Duke posted $5 million bail for Imelda Marcos, the wife of the former Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos, who died in 1989. Mrs. Marcos had been indicted in New York on Federal racketeering charges.         At various times, Miss Duke's millions, and the publicity they generated, also helped to draw her into lawsuits and disputes, including tax litigation in New Jersey, the site of her 2,700-acre estate, Duke Farms. In 1964, she took legal action in Hawaii to obtain a court order forbidding a jazz musician, Joseph Castro, from maintaining, as had been rumored, that he was her husband. A Bomber for Travel And Clean Kitchens         Her fortune also made possible many pleasures, large and small. She once bought a B-25 bomber and had it refurbished for luxury travel. She had her Hawaii house fixed up with ceiling-high goldfish tanks.         She entertained gracefully there and at her various other residences and tried to put shy guests at their ease. As a hostess, she was calm, quiet and a little shy herself, friends said, although she was sometimes angered by sloppiness in the kitchen, as in other realms.         Miss Duke liked fine porcelain and jewels and enjoyed building her jewelry collection, which included notable Indian pieces and heirlooms from her mother. She liked to bake, and friends said her whole-wheat bread was delicious. She enjoyed relaxing, now and then, with a glass of white wine or a spot of Champagne.         Nonetheless, Miss Duke seemed to experience more than her share of unhappiness. Beyond the two divorces, there was the death of her father, the multimillionaire James Buchanan Duke, in 1925, when she was 12 years old. In July 1940, her premature daughter, her only child, died in a Honolulu hospital after only 24 hours of life.         And in 1966 there was the accidental death of Eduardo Tirella, an interior decorator who was a close friend, when the car she was driving slammed him against a gate on Rough Point, the Newport estate. Fenced with barbed wire and guarded, Rough Point was part of her inheritance from her father, known as Buck, who was president of the American Tobacco Company and had other extensive business interests. A Father's Fortune And a Young Heir         What made Miss Duke so enormously rich was the fact that she was his only child. She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 22, 1912, to his second wife, Nanaline Lee Holt Inman Duke.         Miss Duke, a shy, golden-haired child, had private tutors and for a time attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, where her father had built a three-story, 54-room mansion on the northeast corner of 78th Street and Fifth Avenue. The building now houses the Fine Arts Institute of New York University.         When Mr. Duke died, his total estate was valued at more than $100 million. His daughter's share of the estate was appraised in 1927 at more than $50 million, most of it in trust funds.         As a teen-ager and a young woman, Miss Duke spent much of her time at the 78th Street mansion, to which she sometimes referred jauntily in later years as "the rock pile." She took piano lessons, was tutored in French and Italian, went out to dinner at fashionable restaurants, and frequently went to the theater, although to avoid crowds she did not go to opening nights.         She also acquired a love of travel that was to stay with her through her life.         Miss Duke, who was known to some as Dee-Dee, was guarded by private detectives and sometimes traveled under an assumed name. "It saves trouble," she once said, "and keeps people from paying more attention to me than to anyone else."         Nevertheless, she was continually harassed by cranks, and there was some fear that she might be kidnapped.         Her half-brother, Walker Patterson Inman, who often traveled with her, once said: "Everywhere we go, it's the same. She gets to see a few of the sights, goes out to dinner a few times, and then her identity becomes known and we have to rush off somewhere else. We can't take any chances. When word gets out that she's in town, it's like telling gangsters: 'Here's a lot of money. Come and get it.' "         "But that's not the worst of it," he added. "Mail comes in by the bagful, and every crank in town wants to see her. Every imaginable plea for money comes by mail, to say nothing of threats against her because she's supposed to have so much money."         In hopes of seeing her, reporters gathered outside the 78th Street mansion on the evening of Nov. 21, 1933, but she eluded them and slipped out for a quiet dinner with friends. What made that night newsworthy, it was reported at the time, was that at the stroke of midnight, when she turned 21, she acquired control of one-third of the assets that had been held in trust for her.         Although no precise figures were released, it was estimated that the total value of her inheritance had shrunk by then, because of the financial crash and the Depression, to roughly $30 million. As stipulated in her father's will, Miss Duke acquired control over additional large parts of her inheritance on her 25th and 30th birthdays. Tobacco Queen As Married Woman         Soon after turning 21, Miss Duke began being seen in the company of a dashing, strong-jawed older man. It was James Cromwell, the son and grandson of prominent yachtsmen and the stepson of a partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company.         Mr. Cromwell and Miss Duke had first met in 1929 in Bar Harbor, Me., when she was a long-legged teen-ager and he was already 10 years out of the University of Pennsylvania.         Rumors of an engagement blossomed, were denied, blossomed again. And then, with little advance notice, the couple were married in a civil ceremony on Feb. 13, 1935, in the 78th Street house. The bride was 22, the groom 38. They sailed off on a prolonged honeymoon.         Visiting Agra, the Indian city that is the site of the Taj Mahal, the bride told a a questioner happily, "I'm a married woman now," and remarked that she did not like it when people called her "the world's richest girl" and "the tobacco queen."         "Tobacco queen -- what a name!" she said.         Back in the United States, the Cromwells set up housekeeping in ducal style at Duke Farms, with its 30-room stone manor house, its private movie theater (she loved movies) and 42 miles of private roads. For a change of scene, they built an elegant vacation house on the coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.         As time passed, relations between the Cromwells soured, and after protracted legal wranglings Mrs. Cromwell was granted a divorce in Reno in 1943 on grounds of cruelty. She resumed the use of her maiden name. Later, she testified that Mr. Cromwell had demanded an "endowment" of $7 million in return for the divorce. Learning to Work And Enjoying It         In 1944, Miss Duke went to Egypt to help the United States war effort by working, for $1 a year, for the United Seaman's Service, which operated canteens for American merchant seamen.         "I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something real to help in this war," she said at the time. "This may sound funny, but I honestly believe I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life. I feel I'm doing something worthwhile, earning the right to be friends with a lot of swell, interesting people that I've somehow missed before. I've discovered, I guess, that it's fun to work."         Relishing the overseas life, she went on to Europe, where she wrote dispatches in 1945 and 1946 for International News Service, an American news agency that is now defunct, getting around Rome on a bicycle.         Miss Duke was entertaining an American couple in her Rome apartment one day when a suave and handsome Latin American came to call. He was carrying a guitar, which he was to play while she accompanied him on the piano. It was Porfirio Rubirosa, the high-spirited Dominican society figure.         The harmony beween Mr. Rubirosa and Miss Duke proved so compelling that they were married on Sept. 1, 1947, in a civil ceremony at the Dominican Consulate in Paris, where she had gone to work for Harper's Bazaar magazine. He was 39; she was 34. By some accounts the formalities included the bridegroom's signing a legal document that affirmed the bride's control over her fortune.         They spent their honeymoon at Cap d'Antibes, on the French Riviera, where they swam, sunbathed and went motorboating. Not long afterward, he became the Dominican Republic's Ambassador in Buenos Aires.         Despite his charm, the marriage foundered. Miss Duke obtained a Reno divorce from Rubirosa on Oct. 27, 1948, after charging him with extreme mental cruelty.         As time went on it became clear that Miss Duke preferred to remain single. The life she fashioned for herself was largely centered on her estates, and it involved some frivolity and some high seriousness, along with much unobtrusive travel.         It included both new and old interests. She served as a trustee of Duke University, which her family had built up with donations of many millions, and in her later years she became fascinated by the search for alternative sources of energy. Cultivating Gardens And Saving History         At Duke Farms, she laid out a series of interconnected, glassed-in gardens, totaling thousands of square yards, that were opened to the public in 1964 after much labor by her and her workers.         "Sometimes when we're hanging the flowers I spend 16 hours a day," she once told a friend, adding cheerfully, "I work like a stevedore."         She also had a small museum set up on the New Jersey estate to house her collection of Asian art.         Over the years, Miss Duke and the foundation that bore her name made contributions to many other causes, ranging from the advancement of Russian studies at Princeton University to architectural restoration in Newport. She poured millions into the Preservation Society of Newport County, whose mission was to reclaim the city's rundown 18th-century buildings.         The project was welcomed by many Newporters because, among other reasons, it enhanced property values. They were careful to respect Miss Duke's desire for quiet and privacy, and some came to refer to her, almost reverentially, as "the lady."         In 1988, when she was 75, Miss Duke adopted Charlene Gail Heffner, then 35, a former adherent of the Hare Krishna religious group. But by February 1991, Ms. Heffner, known as Chandi, had become persona non grata at Miss Duke's residences, according to an unauthorized biography of Miss Duke, "The Richest Girl in the World" (Putnam, 1992), by Stephanie Mansfield. The author wrote that Miss Duke told a friend later that adopting Ms. Heffner had been "the greatest mistake I ever made."         Later, Ms. Heffner sued Miss Duke for breach of contract. This month, a New Jersey judge ruled against lawyers for Miss Duke, who had sought to have the suit dismissed.         Miss Heffner survives, as does Miss Duke's nephew, Walker Inman Jr. of Georgetown, S.C., and several cousins.       
         Genevieve Sanchez Klein, a former member of the New York State Board of Regents and an outspoken critic of sex education and busing to integrate schools, died on Monday at her home in Daytona, Fla. She was 79.         The cause was cancer of the brain and lungs, said Howard Hurwitz, a friend.         Ms. Klein was appointed to the regents board by the New York State Assembly in 1974, after working for nearly 30 years as a physical education instructor and administrator in New York City public schools.         She was chairwoman of the physical education department at Jamaica High School in Queens from the early 1960's until 1973, when she retired from the school system. Before that, she had taught at Bayside High School in Queens. Denied Re-Election         She was working an assistant professor of health at Lehman College of the City University of New York when she was appointed as the second woman ever to serve on the Board of Regents, which supervises all education in the state.         During her three-year term, she frequently voted in the minority to oppose measures on forced busing of children to further integration of schools. She also voted against a set of guidelines to help school districts select textbooks that dealt with sex or included profanity, saying the rules did not protect the right of parents to object to such material.         She sought re-election to a full seven-year term on the board in 1977, but she was defeated by a vote of 108 to 99 by the Assembly, then controlled by Democrats.         After leaving the board, she was active in the anti-abortion movement and lectured on policy for public schools. She was also active in the Family Defense Council, a group based in Queens that campaigned against curriculum changes advocated by former Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez. She moved to Daytona in 1990.         Ms. Klein graduated from New York University in 1936 and received a master's degree in education from Colorado State College of Education in 1937.         She is survived by two sons, John F., of Orange Park, Fla., and James V., of Bellmont, Calif; a sister, Muriel Zeigler, of Malverne, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.         The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.         In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet. From Old West to Fall River         In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.         A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.         She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.         Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.         Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."         But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."         Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.         "The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."         Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.  She Felt Destined To Be an Artist         Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.         Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.         After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.         Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.         Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.  Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's         After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.         She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.         She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.         Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.  Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'         Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.         "Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.         "Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.         Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.  Created 'People And Not Automata'         Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."         Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."         Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.         Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.         Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."  Her Final Work Dealt With Death         In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.         Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.         Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.         Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."         Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.         Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.       
         Dr. Barbara Feitel, a clinical psychologist and research scientist associated with the Nathan Kline Research Institute, Phoenix House and Covenant House, died on Saturday at White Plains Memorial Hospital. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Feitel retired in April from the research institute, at Rockland County Psychiatric Center, in Orangeburg, N.Y., where she had worked for more than 10 years. She developed a program for the retraining of therapy aides, which was the subject of a film distributed by the New York State Department of Mental Health. She also organized a halfway house.         For Covenant House in New York she researched the backgrounds of sexual abuse in the lives of runaway teen-agers. At Phoenix House, she developed interviews to determine whether young drug addicts had suffered severe abuse during childhood. She used the interviews to evaluate hundreds of youngsters at Phoenix House in New York and California.         Dr. Feitel was born in Manhattan, graduated from Hunter College and earned master's and doctoral degrees in psychology at Columbia University's Teachers College. Before joining the Nathan Kline Institute, she was on the faculty of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.         Dr. Feitel is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Fieman of Denver; two sons, Thomas of Summit, N.J., and Charles of Manhattan; a sister, Patricia Leeds of Albuquerque, N.M., and six grandchildren.       
         Mary Shea Giordano, for many years a leader of Roman Catholic philanthropic groups in New York, died on Tuesday at St. Patrick's Home for the Aged in the Bronx. She was 90.

         Heather Farr, the professional golfer whose four-and-a-half-year battle with cancer won her scores of admirers from inside and outside the golf world, died Saturday night in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 28.         Since being diagnosed with breast cancer in July 1989, Farr underwent more than 15 operations, ranging from a radical mastectomy to breast reconstruction to bone marrow transplants and spinal surgery.         Through all the setbacks, she persevered, which characterized her approach to golf as well. Although she was just 5 feet 1 inch, she seemed bigger in stature.         "One of the things I always remember about her was that she walked so erect," said JoAnne Carner, the Hall of Fame golfer. "It was like she was saying, 'I'm not 5-1, I'm 6 feet.' "         Lessons at 7         Farr, born and raised in Phoenix, began her golf career at the age of 7, when she first took lessons from Bob Day, then the professional at Coronado Golf Course in Scottsdale. It was an unusually young age to begin lessons, but Farr's father, Gerald, convinced Day that Heather was ready.         "He told me that she followed him around all 18 holes every weekend," Day told The Arizona Republic. "I said: 'Stop right there. Anybody who can walk 18 holes and watch somebody else play golf, well, she's ready.' "         Because of her small stature, Farr could not hit the ball as far as many of her peers. But she made up for that with an excellent short game, a wonderful putting stroke and passionate aggressiveness.         She quickly developed into one of the country's most successful amateurs. At 13, she won the Arizona State Amateur. By the time she was 15, she was named the American Junior Golf Association player of the year for the first of two times.         'Like an Ambassador'         Under the tutelage of Arch Watkins, her game continued to develop in college at Arizona State University, where she was named to two all-America teams. Farr's coach at Arizona State, Linda Vollstedt, said Farr's influence there was enduring.         "She was like an ambassador for our golf program," Vollstedt said. "Everywhere she went, people sought out Heather."         Farr played on the 1984 Curtis Cup team and the 1984 World Amateur team. Two years later, at 20, she became the youngest player from the 1985 Ladies Professional Golf Association's qualifying school to make the L.P.G.A. Tour.         Her indefatigable nature and relentlessly upbeat attitude quickly won Farr many friends on the very competitive L.P.G.A. circuit. Twelve L.P.G.A. players were at the Scottsdale Memorial Hospital-North Saturday night when Farr died. "She never quit," said a former L.P.G.A. president, Judy Dickinson.         Spirit of Perseverance         In an interview last year, Farr characterized her philosophy on dealing with all of her problems. "You play through it," she said. "That's what you do. You just play through it."         She applied that philosophy to the golf course and to her medical battles. Like many rookies, Farr struggled in her first season, going eight tournaments without winning any prize money. But in her three L.P.G.A. seasons before the discovery of breast cancer, she improved each year. The 1988 season was her best. She won $75,821 and finished tied for third at the Mazda Classic. In the middle of the next season, the lump in her breast that originally had been diagnosed as benign was found to be cancerous.         Eleven months after Farr's first chemotheraphy treatments ended, doctors found that the cancer had spread to her skull and spine. A tumor on her back was removed, followed by a bone-marrow transplant. After the bone marrow transplant, a tumor on her skull and lesions on her hip were discovered. In March, while the cancer was in a brief remission, Farr was married to Goran Lingmerth, a former kicker for the Cleveland Browns. She is survived by her husband; her father, Gerald; her mother, Sharon, and her sister, Missy Farr-Kay, all of Phoenix.       
         Jane G. Judge, who spent five decades as a social worker, educator and child advocate, died on Wednesday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 91.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         For many years Mrs. Judge was associated with Sarah Lawrence College, where she was professor emeritus of childhood development, and the Community Service Society of New York. A vivacious woman who cared passionately about her causes, she came to the Community Service Society in 1932 and worked there into the 1950's, finally as a consultant on its child-care program.         From the 1930's until 1947, she ran the society's district office in Harlem. Appalled that the office was staffed entirely by white social workers trying to serve a mostly black community, she convinced the board of the need to bring in trained black workers.         She first came to Sarah Lawrence in 1937, teaching part time at the invitation of Constance Warren, then college president. She retired as a professor in 1971 but remained a consultant and director of its early-childhood center for five more years. Over the years, she also taught at Columbia and New York Universities.         Born Jane Griswold in Madison, Wis., she was a 1924 graduate of Smith College and held a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work, now part of Columbia University.         She collaborated with Dr. Benjamin Spock to develop treatment centers for children in Westchester, which did not exist in the 1940's, and to organize the Mental Health Association of Westchester. When the Federal Government set up the Headstart program for pre-schoolers, she served as a consultant.         Her husband, John S. Judge, died in 1973. Mrs. Judge is survived by a daughter, Jennifer Judge Howes of Great Neck, L.I.; a son, Jeremy of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Jacqueline Shearer, a producer and director of documentary films about black Americans, died yesterday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 46.         The cause was colon cancer, said her brother Clement.         Ms. Shearer's works included "A Minor Altercation" (1978), about the Boston school-busing crisis; "The Keys to the Kingdom" and "The Promised Land" (1989), which were in the civil-rights television series "Eyes on the Prize," and "The Colored 54th Regiment" (1991) for the PBS series "The American Experience."         Ms. Shearer was born in Boston and graduated from Brandeis University. She helped found Boston Newsreel, a documentary company, and worked at WCBN radio and WCVB television in Boston.         Besides her brother Clement, of Northfield, Minn., she is survived by her mother, Erline, of Boston; two sisters, Debbie, of Boston, and Linda Gossage, of San Francisco; and another brother, Charles, of Boston.       
         Evelyn Venable, an actress whose films include "Death Takes a Holiday" with Fredric March, died on Nov. 16 in Post Falls, Idaho. She was 80.         Miss Venable was born in Cincinnati. After attending Vassar College and the University of Cincinnati, she played Shakespearean roles in a theater company headed by Walter Hampden. She made her first film, "Cradle Song," for Paramount in 1933; others were "Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch" (1934), "Alice Adams" (1935), "The Little Colonel" (1935) and "The Frontiersman" (1938). She was also the voice of the Blue Fairy in Walt Disney's "Pinocchio" (1940). She retired from the screen after making "He Hired the Boss" in 1943.         For many years she lectured in classics at the University of California at Los Angeles, where she earned a bachelor's and a master's degree in Latin in the 1950's.         She was married to Hal Mohr, a cinematographer, who died in 1974. She is survived by her daughters, Rosalia and Dolores.       
         Joan Weidemann Harris, a retired Brooklyn community worker and former board member and executive director of the Y.W.C.A. of Brooklyn, died on Thursday at her home in Warren, Conn. She was 63 and also lived in Brooklyn Heights.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         Mrs. Harris was a graduate of Mount Holyoke College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work. Over the years, she worked at the Maimonides Community Mental Health Center, the Mayor's Office for the Aging, community groups assisting the elderly and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. In the 1980's she worked at the Private Industry Council.         During her years in Brooklyn she was active on community boards, including those of the Colony South Brooklyn Houses, the Brooklyn Heights Association and the Brooklyn Teen-age Pregnancy Network.

Mrs. Reno was an alumna of Washington University in St. Louis and of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. From 1945 to 1970, she collaborated with her first husband as the freelance writing team of Jhan and June Robbins, whose articles appeared in Readers' Digest, McCall's, Redbook, Good Housekeeping and This Week.         Her second husband, Earl Reno, died in 1975.         She is survived by two daughters, Penny, of Haydenville, Mass., and Meg, of Northampton; two sons, Tom, of Brooklyn, and David, of Roxbury, Mass., and nine grandchildren.       
         Alice Basto Tondel, coordinator of the Harvard University Band for 37 years, died on Thursday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. She was 80 and a lifelong resident of Cambridge.         She died of respiratory failure, said Thomas Everett, the band's director.         Mrs. Tondel was an unpaid volunteer who traveled on road trips with the band, edited its Bass Drum Journal and offered counsel to students. The band will pay tribute to Mrs. Tondel today before the start of the Harvard-Penn game at Harvard Stadium.         Mrs. Tondel graduated from Wheelock College in Boston and was an artist in the Boston area for many years, maintaining a graphic arts business.         She is survived by a son, Mark Tondel of Lee, Mass.       
         Nancy Lyman Roelker, a retired professor of European history at Boston University, died Saturday at her home in East Greenwich, R.I. She was 78.         Dr. Roelker was best known for her work on 16th-century France. Her books included "The Paris of Henry of Navarre, as Seen by Pierre de l'Etoile" (1958), and "Queen of Navarre, Jeanne d'Albret 1529-1572" (1968). She also edited and translated French scholarly papers.         Her last book, "One King, One Faith: The Parliament of Paris and the Reformations of the 16th Century," is scheduled for publication next year by the University of California Press, which placed it on its "centennial roster" of the 100 most distinguished books it has published since 1895.         In 1985, Professor Roelker was awarded the Gold Medal of Paris for her contributions to the city's history.         She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Radcliffe College and received her master's and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University. Her teaching career began at the Concord Academy in Massachusetts in 1937. She later taught at the Winsor School in Boston for 22 years, and in 1963 joined the faculty of Tufts University.         Dr. Roelker came to Boston University as a full professor in 1971 and retired in 1980.         She is survived by a sister, Helen Roelker Kessler of Cambridge, Mass., a nephew and three nieces.       
         Anne Spencer Lindbergh, a writer and the elder daughter of the aviation pioneer Charles A. Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, died Friday at her home in Thetford Center, Vt. She was 53.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Noel Perrin.         Ms. Lindbergh was one of six children of her famous parents; she was born eight years after the kidnapping and killing of Charles A. Lindbergh Jr.         She grew up in Darien, Conn., and, after studying at Radcliffe College for three years, moved to Paris to continue her education. While there she met and married a fellow student at the Sorbonne, Julien Feydy, who became a political scientist and university professor. They later divorced.         She later married Jerzy Sapieyevski, a composer and conductor she met in Europe and with whom she moved to Washington. They also divorced.         In her career as a writer, Ms. Lindbergh wrote 14 books, most of them for children. Her two most recent works are "Three Lives to Live" and "Travel Far, Pay No Fare." She was the recipient of several honors for her work, including an award from the International Reading Association.         Two of her more popular books are "The People in Pineapple Place" and "The Prisoner of Pineapple Place," both written in Washington, where she was then living. Many of the scenic backgrounds were taken from areas in Georgetown close to her home. She also taught school in Washington.         She moved to Vermont in 1987, and the next year she married Mr. Perrin, a writer and professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College. Ms. Lindbergh also taught for several years at the Riverside School in Lyndonville, Vt.         Ms. Lindbergh's mother, who is a poet and essayist, lives in Darien and Barnet, Vt.

         Elizabeth L. R. Coates, a Connecticut lawyer active in community affairs, died on Thursday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 44 and lived in New Canaan, Conn.         The cause was a viral infection following a bone marrow transplant, said her husband, Charles E. Coates 3d.         Mrs. Coates was born in Salem, Mass., was an honors graduate of Wellesley College and received her law degree from Boston University. She worked for the General Electric Company as a lawyer for seven years before going into private practice in Greenwich, most recently with the firm of Hopper & Krause.         She was a past president and board chairman of the New Canaan Community Nursery School, president of the Southern Connecticut Wellesley Club and an elder of the First Presbyterian Church of New Canaan. She also was a supporter of South School in New Canaan, where she was an officer of the Parent-Teacher Council.         Besides her husband, also a lawyer in Greenwich, Mrs. Coates's survivors are her three daughters, Susanna, Margaret and Catherine; her parents, Donald T. and Betty Richardson of Fairfield, Conn.; and her three sisters, Susan R. Duncan of Simsbury, Conn., Leslie B. Richardson of Yardley, Pa., and Lisa Richardson-Bach of Marblehead, Mass.       
         Dr. Mabel Satterlee Ingalls, a bacteriologist who was the last surviving grandchild of J. Pierpont Morgan, died on Tuesday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 92.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Sandra van Heerden.         For almost 30 years Dr. Ingalls was associated with a variety of medical and scientific groups, including the Columbia School of Public Health, where she was an adjunct associate professor from 1958 to 1964, and the Albany Medical School, where she taught bacteriology from 1936 to 1943.         She also worked as a liaison officer between the World Health Organization and the United Nations, conducting surveys of health services in developing countries.         Dr. Ingalls was a graduate of Barnard and Radcliffe Colleges and in 1937 received a doctorate in bacteriology and immunology from Columbia University.         She was a fellow of the Pierpont Morgan Library, a life member of the Metropolitan Museum, and a founding board member of Goodwill Industries.         In addition to Mrs. van Heerden of Manhattan, Dr. Ingalls is survived by three grandchildren.       
         Rita Klimova, a former dissident who served as Czechoslovakia's first Ambassador to the United States after the ouster of the Communist Government, died yesterday in a hospital in Prague. She was 62.         Her death was reported by The Associated Press, which quoted C.T.K., the official news agency of the Czech Republic. She had recently undergone treatment for leukemia.         Mrs. Klimova was diagnosed as having the disease shortly after she was named Ambassador to Washington in February 1990. She stepped down from the post in August 1992, less than four months before her country split into two nations, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.         After her retirement from the Czech diplomatic service last year, she lectured on Czech affairs at several universities, including the New School in Manhattan. Schooling in New York         Mrs. Klimova was born in Europe but spent part of her youth in Manhattan, where her family fled in 1939 after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. Her father, Batya Bat, was a journalist and writer who used the pen name Stanislav Budin.         She attended grade school and junior high school in New York. In 1946, her family returned to Czechoslovakia, where she attended high school and college.         Mrs. Klimova became a member of the Communist Party in 1948. She worked as a translator and taught political economics at Charles University in Prague.         She was dismissed from her university post after Soviet-led troops of the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush the liberal reforms of Alexander Dubcek.         She devoted her efforts to defending human rights and the political opposition, and she was expelled from the party in 1970. In 1989 Mrs. Klimova became the spokeswoman for the peaceful revolution that toppled the Communist Government and elevated her fellow dissident, the playwright Vaclav Havel, to the presidency. Voice of the Revolution         When the Communist regime began to disintegrate in November of 1989, she nearly missed the big moment.         She had been in Hungary meeting with two Czechoslovak exiles, and she drove home on the night of Nov. 19. There she found a message from Mr. Havel saying he wanted to meet with her the next morning.         Arriving at his apartment, she found him facing television cameras and photographers. Mr. Havel had called a news conference to mobilize the anti-Communist opposition, and he wanted to be sure Mrs. Klimova would be there to convey his message in American English.         She sat down next to him and began interpreting. For the next several weeks, as the old order crumbled, hers was the English-language voice of the "Velvet Revolution," an expression that she coined.         She is survived by a son, Vladimir Mlynar, and a daughter, Michaela Barlova, both of Prague.       
         Florence Bibo Alexander, a Manhattan agent for illustrators of children's books for many years, died on Tuesday at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 89.         The cause was pneumonia, said a friend, Meredith Charpentier.         Mrs. Alexander began her career in publishing in Philadelphia and later moved to Manhattan, where she entered the advertising business. She later set up her own agency, which represented artists and cartoonists.         Joseph Alexander, whom she married in 1927, joined her in the agency.       
         Susan Resnick Fisher, a family therapist who specialized in stepfamily problems, died yesterday at her Manhattan home after a long illness. She was 50 and practiced in Manhattan and Mount Kisco, N. Y.         Mrs. Fisher was a founder of Yeshiva University's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, a benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera and a board member of the Make a Wish Foundation.         She is survived by her husband, Sandford; four children from an earlier marriage, Joshua, Daniel, Jordanna and Benjamin Abrams; her mother, Pearl Resnick, widow of Jack Resnick, the New York real-estate developer; a sister, Marilyn Katz; and two brothers, Burton and Ira, all of Manhattan.       
         Alice Tully, a philanthropist who was an important figure in New York City's musical life for almost half a century, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Her lawyer, James McGarry, said the cause was the flu. She had not been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 1991.         Miss Tully, for whom Lincoln Center's chamber-music hall is named, was as respected for her knowledge of music and its practitioners as for her generosity.         As a singer who had a modest operatic and recital career in the 1930's, she was keenly aware of the problems performers face, and throughout her life was a friend and supporter of singers, pianists and composers. After she inherited her family's wealth -- her maternal grandfather was Amory Houghton, the founder of Corning Glass Works -- she donated many millions of dollars to the arts. A Birthday Portrait         For many years Miss Tully made her contributions anonymously, and when she agreed to underwrite a chamber-music hall in the Juilliard Building at Lincoln Center, she stipulated that her name not be associated with it. Eventually, John D. Rockefeller 3d, Lincoln Center's first chairman, persuaded her to allow the hall to be named in her honor. In 1987, to celebrate her 85th birthday, Lincoln Center commissioned Thomas Buechner to paint a full-length portrait of her, which hangs in the hall's main foyer. Miss Tully always refused to tell how much of the hall's cost she contributed, but she did not dispute reports that said she paid most of the $4.5 million.         She did say that one reason she was hesitant to accept the hall's dedication at first was that Philharmonic Hall and the New York State Theater had been acoustical disasters. "I did not want my name associated with a hall that would have bad acoustics," she told an interviewer in 1987. She changed her mind when Lincoln Center engaged Heinrich Keilholz, who had revamped Severance Hall in Cleveland in 1958, as acoustician.  More Space, Fewer Seats         She took an active hand in the hall's design, selecting the colors of the walls, seat covering and foyer carpeting. She paid particular attention to adequate leg room.         "I had spent so many, many hours cramped in narrow spaces, both here and in Europe, and I felt that this was something we should have," she said in the 1987 interview. "The architects disagreed, because what I wanted would have meant having three fewer rows. So I went to William Schuman, who was president of Lincoln Center at the time, and I said: 'You're a tall man. Wouldn't you like to sit comfortably? Do let us have one comfortable hall in New York City.' "         Mr. Schuman agreed, Miss Tully said. "So I drew a breath of relief. But I had to keep my eye on it just the same."         Later, after much personal research in Europe, she was deeply involved in selecting the Theodore Kuhn Company to build the hall's organ, which experts said cost well over $250,000.         When the hall was in the planning stages, Miss Tully encouraged the creation of its resident ensemble, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and was the chairwoman of its board for many years. She also served on the boards of the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and the Juilliard School of Music. Myriad Beneficiaries         In addition to her involvement with Lincoln Center, Miss Tully was an active supporter of dance, art and humanitarian organizations. She gave generously to the Martha Graham Dance Company and Eliot Feld's ballet troupe, and she was a board member of numerous other arts and educational institutions. She contributed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Frick Collection and the Morgan Library, among others.         Michael J. Spencer, a pianist who founded Hospital Audiences, which provides access to the arts for the disabled, said yesterday that when he began playing concerts in state mental hospitals in the 1960's he sought funds everywhere and only one organization responded. "It was something called the Maya Corporation, and it was only in the early 70's that I found out it was Alice Tully providing the funds." Miss Tully had founded the corporation to disperse cash gifts anonymously. Mr. Spencer added that he received a Maya donation only last week.         Miss Tully never wanted the extent of her largesse known. Irwin Scherzer, the manager of the Chamber Music Society in its early days and a close friend of Miss Tully, said: "She wouldn't know herself how much money she had donated. She did what she thought was best, where she thought it would do the most good."         Alice Bigelow Tully was born on Sept. 11, 1902, in Corning, N.Y. Her father, William J. Tully, was a lawyer and a two-term New York State senator. The actress Katharine Hepburn is her second cousin. When Mr. Tully became general counsel to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1908, the family moved to New York City, where Miss Tully attended Mrs. J. D. Randall MacIvor's School. Later she continued her studies at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn.  A Recital Inspired Her         Miss Tully often said that she decided to devote herself to music when she was 14 or 15 years old, after hearing a recital by the pianist Josef Hofmann. But although piano studies were part of her schooling, her first musical love was singing. In 1922, after studying voice in New York for three years, she went to Paris for seven years of study with Jean Perier, the baritone who created the role of Pelleas in Debussy's opera "Pelleas et Melisande," and with Miguel Fontecha and Therese Leschetizky.         Beginning as a mezzo-soprano and then moving to the dramatic soprano repertory, Miss Tully made her professional debut in 1927, when she sang works by Gluck, Franck, Chausson and Faure with the Pasdeloup Orchestra in Paris. Six years later she made her operatic debut at the Hippodrome in New York, singing Santuzza -- her best role, by her own estimation -- in a Salmaggi Opera production of Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana."         She also sang the title role in a production of Bizet's "Carmen" at the Manhattan Opera House in 1935, and through the late 1930's she performed frequently as a recitalist in Europe and the United States. Reviewing a 1937 Town Hall recital in The New York Times, Olin Downes wrote that Miss Tully's program was of "rare interest and artistic distinction" and praised her "musicianly zeal and catholicity of taste."         Miss Tully, looking back on her career in a 1982 interview with Harold C. Schonberg of The Times, said: "It may not have been the biggest career, but it was a good one. I was always concerned with the best in music, and I think I had something individual to offer."  Avid Amateur Pilot         With the outbreak of World War II, Miss Tully settled permanently in New York and continued her vocal studies. But she suspended her career to devote herself to the war effort. An avid amateur pilot, she joined the Civil Air Patrol and flew on submarine scouting missions. But she decided to "be of more use" and became a Red Cross nurse's aid at the French Hospital in Manhattan.         In 1950, Miss Tully stopped singing professionally because, she later said, she felt that her voice was losing its flexibility. Upon the death of her mother, Clara Houghton Tully, in 1958, Miss Tully inherited a substantial estate, and began her career as a philanthropist. It was at about that time that her cousin, Arthur Houghton Jr., one of the founders of Lincoln Center, approached her with the idea of contributing toward the concert hall that now bears her name.         The hall opened on Miss Tully's 67th birthday, Sept. 11, 1969, with a program by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. It was judged a superb setting for chamber music, both acoustically and visually, and the most successful of Lincoln Center's concert halls.         Miss Tully, who never married, was a tall, slender, regal woman with a friendly smile, a wry sense of humor, and a comprehensive knowledge of musical literature and the world of performers. After chamber music and art songs, her love was opera, particularly Wagner, and well into her 80's she regularly traveled to Europe to see new productions, keep track of singers and directors, and serve on competition juries. She was especially fond of the Spoleto Festival in Italy; its founder, Gian Carlo Menotti, wrote "Cantilene e Scherzo" and "Nocturne" for her. Others who dedicated works to her include Mr. Schuman, who wrote "A Round for Alice," and Riccardo Malipiero, who composed "Serenata per Alice Tully." Recipient of Many Honors         In 1970, Miss Tully was awarded a Handel Medallion, New York City's highest cultural award. She received the Gallatin Medal from New York University in 1976 for "contributions of lasting significance to society," was a recipient of the first National Medal of Arts in 1985, and received the American Red Cross Humanitarian Award in 1988. A devoted Francophile for most of her life, she received many honors from the French Government, and was made an officer in the French Legion of Honor.         Miss Tully's only sibling, a younger sister, Marion Tully Dimick of Washington, died in 1981.
