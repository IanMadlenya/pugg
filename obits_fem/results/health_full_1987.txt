        Inna Kitrosskaya Meiman, the wife of a Soviet dissident, died yesterday at the Lombardi Cancer Research Center of Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, three weeks after she was allowed to go abroad for treatment of an inoperable tumor on her neck. She was 53 years old and had been waiting years for permission to travel.         Inna Kitrosskaya Meiman, the wife of a Soviet dissident, died yesterday at the Lombardi Cancer Research Center of Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, three weeks after she was allowed to go abroad for treatment of an inoperable tumor on her neck. She was 53 years old and had been waiting years for permission to travel.         Gerald Strober, a spokesman for the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, which helped to plead her case, said Mrs. Meiman was admitted to the center on Jan. 20. In asking to go abroad, Mrs. Meiman said she wanted to undergo specialized radiation treatment, her only remaining hope for survival. Complications Reported         According to Mr. Strober, she had various tests complicated by low blood pressure, drug-induced diabetes and infection.         ''Basically she was still being evaluated for the start of chemotherapy,'' Mr. Strober said.  She was the wife of Prof. Naum Meiman, a mathematician who himself had long been denied an exit visa on the ground that he did secret work 30 years ago. Professor Meiman, 76 years of age, was a member of a now-disbanded group that monitored Soviet compliance with the Helsinki accords of 1975.         Professor Meiman said last month that he did not think officials might relent and let him follow his wife now that her health had become precarious. He said that his wife had undergone chemotherapy and four operations and that her only chance lay in American experimental treatment.         Mrs. Meiman, a teacher of English, was married to Professor Meiman in 1981.         Word that she might be able to leave first came from Senator Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat and possible Democratic Presidential candidate, while he was on a visit to Moscow in December. He said he had made a special plea for her to Mikhael S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.         Later, in a meeting, with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Senator Hart was informed of that the case was being ''reconsidered.'' Another Soviet cancer patient, Rimma Bravve, left Moscow on Dec. 18 in Senator Hart's company to receive treatment in New York. Left With Mixed Feelings         At the time of her own departure, Mrs. Meiman said she was leaving with ''mixed feelings'' since her husband had to stay behind. She said she had been feeling weak for some weeks and was eager to enter the Georgetown center.         Donna Hartman, the wife of Ambassador Arthur A. Hartman, accompanied Mrs. Meiman through routine customs and passport controls.         Mrs. Meiman is survived by a son from a previous marriage, Leo Kitrossky, a scientist in Moscow with three children. Also surviving is a daughter of Professor Meiman by a previous marriage, Olga Plam of Boulder, Colo.         INNA MEIMAN, EMIGRE, DIES AT 53       
        Sarah Connell, a social worker and former New York City regional director for the State Office of Mental Health, died of cancer Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 56 years old.         Sarah Connell, a social worker and former New York City regional director for the State Office of Mental Health, died of cancer Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 56 years old.         Mrs. Connell, who served as regional director from 1979 to 1985, was one of the principal architects of the state policy of financing street outreach programs for the homeless mentally ill. She helped initiate programs to send state, city and voluntary agency workers into shelters to assist and to place the homeless.         Mrs. Connell was born in the Bronx and was a graduate of Hunter College. She received a master's degree from Columbia University.         She is survived by her husband, Sydney Connell, a retired social worker; a sister, Rita Hirsch of Manhattan, and two stepsons, Joseph, of Brooklyn and Eric, of Manhattan.       
        Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Since 1981 the actress had been under the care of her second daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, who by publicizing her mother's tragic illness had drawn national and international attention to Alzheimer's disease, about which little was known until recent years.         According to Princess Yasmin, Miss Hayworth's health had steadily deteriorated over the years and she lapsed into a semicoma in February.         The ''courage and candor'' of Miss Hayworth and her family in bringing attention to Alzheimer's disease was praised by President Reagan in a statement yesterday.         ''Rita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars,'' he said. ''Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on the stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl.         ''Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend whom we will miss.'' The Epitome of Glamour         Rita Hayworth was the epitome of Hollywood glamour and allure, a stunningly beautiful actress and dancer.         During World War II, her pinup pictures decorated barracks walls and ships' bulkheads wherever servicemen went, and over two decades her often tempestuous romantic life thrust her into the headlines.         Fred Astaire, who co-starred with her in two movies, said in his autobiography that she was his favorite dancing partner, and dancing was, indeed, one of her genuine talents.         As a singer, however, she was not similarly gifted, even though she was cast in many musicals. Anita Ellis dubbed Miss Hayworth's songs in four movies, including ''Pal Joey'' and ''The Loves of Carmen,'' and other ''ghosts'' did the singing for her in other films.         But that mattered little to Hayworth fans, who admired her chiefly for the sensuality she exuded, playing temptresses in movies such as ''Blood and Sand'' and ''The Lady From Shanghai.'' The Temptress of 'Gilda'         A particularly memorable temptress role was the title one in ''Gilda,'' in 1946, in which she did a striptease, demure by today's standards, inasmuch as it was limited to removing her arm-length gloves. While the controversial strip scene dazzled tens of thousands of young males, it upset more conservative people across the nation.         So did Miss Hayworth's open affair, in the late 1940's, when such behavior was far less commonplace than it is today, with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the spiritual leader of millions of Ismaili Moslems. They were married in 1949, but she divorced him, as she did four other husbands, including Orson Welles.         As Miss Hayworth grew older, she successfully shifted from her glamour image and took on mature roles in movies such as ''Separate Tables'' in 1958 and ''They Came to Cordura'' in 1959. But by the late 1960's she was appearing in minor movies, most of them made in Europe.         And ultimately, the once-idolized star's health was ravaged by Alzheimer's disease - senile dementia, a devastating mental illness that affects the brain, brings on loss of memory, and ravages bodily functions - which left her ''utterly helpless,'' according to Princess Yasmin.         Miss Hayworth was truly born to show business, in New York City, on Oct. 17, 19l8. Her father, Eduardo Cansino, was a Spanish-born dancer and her mother, the former Volga Haworth, had been a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl. They named their daughter Margarita Carmen Cansino, but she shortened the name to Rita Cansino when she began dancing professionally at the age of 12, and kept that name for her first 10 movies. Spotted by a Fox Producer         Mr. Cansino's career took the family to Los Angeles, where his daughter attended school through the ninth grade. Then she joined her father's act and performed in clubs in Tijuana and Agua Caliente, Mexico, where, when she was 16 years old, she was spotted by a Fox Film Company producer, who signed her to a contract.         Making her film debut in 1935 in ''Under the Pampas Moon,'' Rita Cansino appeared in a succession of lesser roles, such as that of a dance hall girl in a Spencer Tracy movie called ''Dante's Inferno.'' Other films in her Cansino period included ''Charlie Chan in Egypt,'' ''Human Cargo'' and ''Meet Nero Wolfe.''         The Fox company's merger with 20th-Century Pictures left the young dancer without a contract, but in 1937 she met and married the man who was to become her Svengali and dramatically change her career fortunes. He was Edward Judson, a shrewd businessman 22 years her senior, under whose guidance she had her eyebrows and hairline altered by electrolysis and transformed herself from a raven-haired Latin to an auburn-haired cosmopolitan.         As her manager, Mr. Judson also changed his wife's professional name, choosing her mother's maiden name of Haworth and adding a ''y'' to clarify the pronunciation. He hired press agents to get the name and picture of Rita Hayworth into newspapers and fan magazines, and ultimately won her a seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures.         But low-budget B movies continued to be Miss Hayworth's lot, except for the 1939 ''Only Angels Have Wings,'' with Cary Grant, in which the director, Howard Hawks, cast her as an unfaithful wife. It was the secondary female role, but one that got the actress her first good critical notices. A 'Love Goddess' Emerges         Beginning in 1941, Miss Hayworth rapidly developed into one of Hollywood's most glamorous stars, inspiring Winthrop Sargent, a Life magazine writer, to dub her ''The Great American Love Goddess,'' a sobriquet that she welcomed and that caught the public's fancy.         On loan to Warner Brothers, Miss Hayworth appeared opposite James Cagney in ''Strawberry Blonde'' in 1941 and, back at Columbia, she achieved full star status when she was cast as Mr. Astaire's dancing partner in ''You'll Never Get Rich,'' a 1941 hit that got her a Time magazine cover article and instant celebrity. In 1942, she appeared in three hit movies, ''My Gal Sal,'' ''Tales of Manhattan'' and ''You Were Never Lovelier,'' the last again as Mr. Astaire's co-star.         Her performance in ''Cover Girl,'' with Gene Kelly in 1944, earned Miss Hayworth the attention of Life magazine, which printed a photograph of her, posed seductively in black lace, that became famous around the world as an American servicemen's pinup. In what was intended, no doubt, as the ultimate compliment, the picture was even pasted to a test atomic bomb that was dropped on Bikini atoll in 1946.         Miss Hayworth, unlike stars who claimed to deplore their own publicity, reveled in hers. ''Why should I mind?'' she said. ''I like having my picture taken and being a glamorous person. Sometimes when I find myself getting impatient, I just remember the times I cried my eyes out because nobody wanted to take my picture at the Trocadero.''         A great boost to Miss Hayworth's career was ''Gilda,'' which ran into censorship trouble in some areas because of the so-called strip scene. In it, she wore a clinging black satin strapless gown and, while coyly peeling off long black gloves, sang a mildly suggestive song called ''Put the Blame on Mame.'' Actually, the voice was that of Anita Ellis. Marriage to Orson Welles         Miss Hayworth, who had divorced her first husband, married Orson Welles in 1943, and they had a daughter, Rebecca. While Mr. Welles was directing her in one of her best films, ''The Lady From Shanghai'' (1949), she filed for divorce from him. Miss Hayworth had met and fallen in love with Prince Aly Khan and, since neither was divorced at the time, their travels together through Europe provoked some public indignation.         When they were married in 1949, the fact that Miss Hayworth was visibly pregnant was widely reported. She divorced Aly Khan two years later and was subsequently married to and divorced from the singer Dick Haymes and then James Hill, a movie producer.         Miss Hayworth's more than 40 films also included ''Affair in Trinidad'' (1952), ''Salome'' and ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953), ''Fire Down Below'' (1957), ''The Story on Page One'' (1960), ''The Poppy Is Also a Flower'' (1967), and ''The Wrath of God'' (1972).         She attempted a stage career in 1971, but it ended abruptly because she was unable to remember her lines. Six years later, a court in Santa Ana, Calif., named an administrator for her affairs on the recommendation of a physician who said she was disabled by chronic alcoholism.         Despite her heavy drinking, however, it later appeared that the diagnosis of alcoholism might have been erroneous and that Miss Hayworth was actually suffering from the first stages of Alzheimer's disease.         In June 1981, a court in Los Angeles declared the actress legally unable to care for herself and she was put in the care of Princess Yasmin, who took her to New York to live. In 1985 the Princess married a Greek shipping executive, Basil Embiricos, but the marriage was short-lived. They had a son, Andrew. Miss Hayworth's other daughter, Rebecca Welles, lives in Tacoma, Wash.         Princess Yasmin, testifying in 1983 before a Congressional committee concerned with appropriating funds for Alzheimer's disease research, said that the disease had reduced her mother to ''a state of utter helplessness.''         The Princess's appearance was among her many efforts in recent years to draw attention to Alzheimer's disease. She has taken a major role in the growth of the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc., which has headquarters in Chicago and more than 130 chapters and affiliates, backing some 500 family-support groups. She is vice president of that organization and president of Alzheimer's Disease International, which she helped organize in 1985.         A funeral service for Miss Hayworth will be held Monday at 10 A.M. in the Church of the Good Shepherd, Beverly Hills, Calif.

Roslyn Lindheim, a professor of architecture at the University of California at Berkeley who was known for her work in hospital design, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in Berkeley. She was 65 years old.         Professor Lindheim was born in New York City and graduated from Radcliffe College and the Columbia University School of Architecture. She moved to California in the 1950's and practiced in both California and New York. She joined the Berkeley faculty in 1963.         She was an expert on health and environmental factors in hospital design and had directed a design team to remodel Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx.

        A woman accused of throwing six of her seven children into a bayou, where two of them drowned, was sentenced to probation today after pleading no contest to murder and attempted capital murder.         A woman accused of throwing six of her seven children into a bayou, where two of them drowned, was sentenced to probation today after pleading no contest to murder and attempted capital murder.         The woman, Juana Leija, entered the pleas as part of an agreement in which three charges of attempted capital murder were dismissed, her lawyer said.         The lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, said Mrs. Leija's 10-year probation called for her to remain under the care of Harris County Mental Health and Mental Retardation officials.         ''They agreed that she was mentally ill at the time that it happened,'' he said. ''She knows that at the time it happened she thought what she was doing was right.''         Mrs. Leija, 30 years old, said at the time the world was a terrible place, and that her children would be better off dead.         The prosecutor, Carol Davies, said probation was too light a sentence.         ''There are a lot of women out there in difficult circumstances with children, and I would hate to think that anyone would think that this is an appropriate way to solve your problems,'' Ms. Davies said. Two of Mrs. Leija's children, 5-year-old Juana and 6-year-old Judas Dimas, drowned in the muddy waters of the bayou on April 18, 1986, but nearby workers heard the childrens' screams and rescued the other four.

Nellie Obendorf, who along with her husband, Orville, survived almost two weeks in a Kansas snowdrift last April, died Saturday in a nursing home. She was 65 years old.         Mrs. Obendorf had periodically been hospitalized and remained disoriented and weak after the couple's ordeal, which began when they embarked on an automobile trip to Kansas on March 15. They were beset by bad weather, ill health and numerous wrong turns. At one point, they were stranded for 13 days with nothing to eat but a few cookies.

Burgess, a founder and former vice president of the Westchester County Mental Health Association, died Sunday at her home in Rye, N.Y. She was 81 years old.  Mrs. Burgess, who was born in Brooklyn, was also a founder and board member of the Center for Preventive Psychiatry, with headquarters in White Plains. The center specializes in treating very young children and families in crisis.         Mrs. Burgess was a writer and had been an editorial adviser to Charles Scribner's Sons, the publisher. She was responsible for the publication of ''The Magic Years'' by Selma Fraiberg, dealing with the first six years of a child's life. Mrs. Burgess wrote a mystery novel, ''Death Will Find Me,'' published in 1949. It received the Dodd Mead Red Badge award.         Her husband, George, a consulting engineer, died in 1979.         Surviving are a brother, Newton I. Steers of Bethesda, Md.; a sister, Charlotte Van Winkle of Hamden, Conn.; a son, Van Burgess of Summit, N.J.; a daughter, Claire Phillips of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
        Margie Lynn Inman, who performed on the wings of airplanes in her youth and later battled local officials for the right to live in a lean-to with a menagerie of pets, has died at the age of 76.         Margie Lynn Inman, who performed on the wings of airplanes in her youth and later battled local officials for the right to live in a lean-to with a menagerie of pets, has died at the age of 76.         Mrs. Inman died Sept. 30, the day she was to have entered a nursing home after weeks of failing health, friends said.         She performed as a wing-walker in the 1920's and '30s in the Inman Brothers Flying Circus with her husband, Rolley Roger Inman, a pilot. He died in a crash in 1944.         Mrs. Inman began living in a lean-to on her property near Fort Lauderdale after her house collapsed in 1976. She spent much of her Social Security checks on food for her pet cats, dogs and rats, which she called ''my kids.'' Her disputes with neighbors and local officials over the animals ended when local people pitched in to help her clean up the property.       
        Eleanor M. Johnson, founder of The Weekly Reader, which has brought the news of the world to schoolchildren for nearly six decades, died of cancer Thursday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. She was 94 years old.         Eleanor M. Johnson, founder of The Weekly Reader, which has brought the news of the world to schoolchildren for nearly six decades, died of cancer Thursday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. She was 94 years old.         Miss Johnson, a dedicated and energetic educator for half a century, produced the first issue of the newspaper on Sept. 21, 1928, and remained active in planning its contents until 1978, when she was 85.         Originally called My Weekly Reader, the slim periodical, typically four or eight pages an issue, was read by two-thirds of today's American adults when they were in elementary school, according to the publisher, Fields Publications of Middletown, Conn.         With its clear, straightforward prose, The Weekly Reader has explained to generations of American children the compelling events of the day: the Depression, World War II, assassinations, the Vietnam War, civil rights struggles and the Iran hostage crisis. 'They Were Missing Knowledge'         ''Part of Eleanor's genius was she knew how to connect kids to the world,'' said Terry Borton, The Weekly Reader's editor in chief for the last 10 years.         Miss Johnson conceived the idea of a newspaper for elementary school pupils in 1927, when she was an administrator overseeing curriculum in the public schools of York, Pa.         ''In her work with kids,'' Mr. Borton said, ''she noticed most of the reading they did was fairy tales and fantasy, which she felt was fine, but she felt they were missing a knowledge and understanding of the real world, which she thought they would like.''         She proposed the idea to William Blakey, president of American Education Publications, which already published a newspaper for high school students. He agreed. Hoover vs. Smith         The cover article of the first Weekly Reader profiled the two principal candidates in the 1928 Presidential election, Herbert Hoover and Alfred E. Smith, focusing on their childhood. Its headline said, ''Two Poor Boys Who Made Good Are Now Running for the Highest Office in the World.'' The leading articles in two of the most recent Weekly Readers discussed a controversy over cigarette advertisements and the growing concern about air travel.         Circulation reached 100,000 the first year and grew to a high of 13 million in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when The Weekly Reader expanded to seven editions, one for each grade level from preschool to sixth grade. Nine million schoolchildren subscribe today, at a cost of about $2 for the 27 issues of the school year.         All the while, according to the newspaper's publisher, The Weekly Reader has retained its original aim: ''to present selected, well-written news of interest and value to children with accuracy and fairness, colorful but uncolored.'' A Farmer's Daughter         Eleanor Murdock Johnson was born Dec. 10, 1892, in Washington County, Md., a daughter of a farming couple.         Miss Johnson, a fragile-looking woman who stood about 4 feet 10 inches, began her career in education as a first-grade teacher in Oklahoma. She worked as a consultant to The Weekly Reader during its early years while continuing to hold administrative jobs in York and then in the Lakewood, Ohio, school system.         In 1935, she left public schools to preside over the magazine full time as editor in chief, a job she held until 1961. Then, after retirement, she continued to serve the paper as a consultant until 1978.         Miss Johnson, who held master's degrees in education from the University of Chicago and Columbia University, was also a co-author of several children's books, including the Child Story Readers and the Treasury of Literature Readers, and wrote more than 50 elementary school workbooks that offered exercises in reading, arithmetic and geography. She also wrote numerous articles in education journals and was an active public speaker.         Miss Johnson, whose cancer was diagnosed about a month ago, is survived by a sister, Maria Johnson, with whom she lived at the Herman M. Wilson Health Care Center of the Asbury Methodist Retirement Center in Gaithersburg.         A memorial service will be held Monday afternoon at St. Marks Lutheran Church in Wolfsville, Md.       
        Dr. Emily Mumford, a sociologist known for her work on the effect of psychotherapy in lowering later medical care costs, died of complications of a brain tumor Oct. 3 at her home in Manhattan. She was 66 years old.         Dr. Emily Mumford, a sociologist known for her work on the effect of psychotherapy in lowering later medical care costs, died of complications of a brain tumor Oct. 3 at her home in Manhattan. She was 66 years old.         Dr. Mumford was professor of clinical sociomedical sciences in psychiatry and public health at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University and chief of the division of health utilization and policy research at the New York Psychiatric Institute.         Studies in which she took part reported that the person who undergoes psychotherapy develops a healthier style of living and is less apt to require unneeded hospitalization. Thus the cost of psychotherapy is offset, the studies showed.         Dr. Mumford's writings included a textbook on medical sociology, ''Interns: From Students to Physicians.''         She was born in Missouri and graduated from the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma. While working as a magazine editor, she took courses at Columbia University that drew her toward sociology. She received a master's degree and doctorate in sociology from Columbia.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Herbert J. Schlesinger, who is Albert J. Marrow Professor of Psychology at the New School for Social Research.

She was 61 years old.         Diana Loeb, until recently vice president of the board of trustees of the Public Education Association, a nonpartisan advocacy group that monitors the performance of New York City's schools, died of lung cancer Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 61 years old.         Mrs. Loeb had been with the organization since 1947, two years after graduating from Bryn Mawr College. Her first position was assistant to the executive director. She later became a trustee and treasurer. She resigned only recently because of ill health.         She is survived by her husband, John; a son, David, of San Francisco; a daughter, Virginia, of Cambridge, Mass.; her mother, Diana P. Haslam of London; three half brothers, Michael, John and Nicholas Haslam, all of London, and two grandsons.       
        Edith Luckett Davis, Nancy Reagan's mother, died of a stroke today at her home in Phoenix, Ariz. She was 91 years old.         Edith Luckett Davis, Nancy Reagan's mother, died of a stroke today at her home in Phoenix, Ariz. She was 91 years old.         President and Mrs. Reagan will travel to Phoenix Tuesday morning, and the President will return to Washington Tuesday night, leaving Mrs. Reagan behind. Mr. Reagan will return to Arizona for the funeral, when arrangements are completed, the White House said.         Mrs. Davis, who went by the name ''Lucky,'' had been in poor health for the last several years. The White House said she died at 12:15 P.M., mountain standard time. Mrs. Reagan was at the White House when told of her mother's death. Career as an Actress         Mrs. Davis began work as an actress at the age of 15 and appeared in several films, including ''The Other Girl'' in 1915. She also acted on stage, in New York and with several regional stock companies. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1928 when she played with Walter Huston and Kay Francis in ''Elmer the Great.''         Her first marriage, to Kenneth Robbins of Pittsfield, Mass., ended in divorce. In 1929 she met and married Dr. Loyal Davis, a Chicago neurosurgeon.         Mrs. Davis performed volunteer work in various areas of health care for more than 50 years. She served on several boards and foundations. She also served as honorary chairman of the women's division of United Cerebral Palsy.         After Dr. Davis retired as head of the surgery department at Northwestern University in 1963, she moved with him to Phoenix. Dr. Davis died in 1982.         In 1983 Mrs. Davis was awarded the Arizona Lifetime Achievement Award by the Association for Retarded Citizens.         She is survived by one daugther, Mrs. Reagan; one son, Richard Davis of Philadelphia, and seven grandchildren.       
        Jane K. Butcher, the first woman ever appointed to the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, died after a long illness last Thursday. She was 64 years old and lived in White Plains.         Jane K. Butcher, the first woman ever appointed to the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, died after a long illness last Thursday. She was 64 years old and lived in White Plains.         Mrs. Butcher, who was born in Pittsburgh in 1923, attended Chatham College, Columbia University and Hofstra University but did not earn a degree. An early marriage, ended in divorce and she married William L. Butcher, a prominent Republican industrialist, in 1968. Mr. Butcher died in 1976.
