         Mary Frances Rice, known as Sister Berenice of the Order of St. Ursula, a retired faculty member and trustee of the College of New Rochelle, died on Sunday at the Marian Residence in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 89 years old.         Sister Berenice was a member of the Ursuline Convent of St. Teresa, having entered the Ursuline Order in 1925. Three years later, she became an English instructor at her alma mater in New Rochelle, an independent women's college founded by the order in 1904.

         Bettina Louise Chow, an internationally acclaimed model, restaurateur, jewelry designer, sculptor and fashion collector, died on Friday at her home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. She was 41 years old.         Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said. She worked with AIDS organizations and talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission.         Mrs. Chow, known professionally as Tina Chow, began her career at the age of 16, modeling for Shiseido, a leading cosmetics company in Japan. Soon she found herself working at fashion shows and for photographers, appearing on major magazine covers and in pictures for advertisements and fashion news articles. She was a favorite model of Cecil Beaton, among other photographers.         In the early 1970's, she married Michael Chow and worked with him in running his Mr. Chow restaurant in London, a fashionable restaurant featuring Peking cuisine. Later they moved to Manhattan, opening a branch of the restaurant on 57th Street, and then to California to create a third branch in Beverly Hills. Crystals on Cords         She began designing jewelry in the mid-1980's and was a trendsetter for her use of quartz and other crystals as amulets and rings in a variety of settings and as pendants on silk cords. She had outlets in leading stores in several cities, including in Manhattan at Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue and at the Ted Muehling Shop in SoHo.         More recently she had shifted into abstract and organic sculpture in crystal and furniture design.         Regularly listed as one of the best-dressed women, she acquired a large collection of designer clothes and patterns, part of which is to be shown at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan starting March 16. Rizzoli Publishing is working on a book on the collection.         She remained professionally active while fighting her illness and worked with Angel Food, an organization that delivers food to AIDS patients.         Mrs. Chow was born in Lakeview, Ohio. As a teen-ager she moved with her family to Tokyo, where her father, Walter Edmund Lutz, worked in international trade. Mrs. Chow was educated at Sophia University in Tokyo.         She was divorced from Mr. Chow. She is survived by her parents, Mr. Lutz and Mona Furuki, who now live in Los Angeles; a son, Maximillian, and a daughter, China, both of Pacific Palisades, and a sister, Adelle Lutz of Manhattan, who is the wife of the rock musician David Byrne.

She was 41 years old.         Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said. She had talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission, and even before she knew she would be stricken, she was active in AIDS organizations because of the epidemic's toll on colleagues and friends.

         Mary Virginia Gaver, who championed the cause of school libraries in America, died Tuesday at the Roman Eagle Memorial Home in Danville, Va. She was 85 years old and died of Parkinson's disease, her family said.         Miss Gaver helped develop national school library standards in 1960 and headed a $1.1 million campaign promoting their adoption nationwide and creating eight model libraries.         She served as president of the American Library Association in 1966-67, the American Association of School Librarians in 1959-60 and the New Jersey School Library Association in 1954-55. Taught Librarians         She was also an educator of librarians at several universities. Her longest tenure was at Rutgers University, where she taught from 1954 to 1971.         Growing up in the cotton mill town of Schoolfield, Va., she accompanied her mother, a teacher, as she went door-to-door collecting $100 to start a school library. Mill company executives matched the donations.         Decades later Miss Gaver summarized what she saw as her mission in the title of a pamphlet she wrote: "Every Child Needs a School Library."         She earned a bachelor of arts degree from Randolph-Macon Women's College and bachelor of science and master's degrees from Columbia University, where she studied under a Carnegie fellowship. High School English Teacher         In the 1920's and 1930's she worked as a high school English teacher and librarian in Danville and served as technical director of a Federal Works Project Administration library program for Virginia.         She moved to New York to be a school librarian in Scarsdale from 1939 to 1942. She was a librarian and professor of library service at New Jersey State Teachers College in Trenton from 1942-54, with a two-year leave as a visiting professor at the University of Teheran and library adviser to Iran. She also taught at the University of Virginia and Emory University.         After her retirement from Rutgers, she served as a library consultant and later vice president of Bro-Dart Inc., a wholesale book supplier. She wrote and edited numerous articles and books on libraries.         Her survivors include a sister, Lydia Harvey, also of Danville.       
         Francesca Primus, a writer and theater critic, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 45 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said her brother, the actor Barry Primus.         Ms. Primus, who was born in New York City and whose full name was Ronnie Francesca Primus, was a critic, columnist and feature writer for Backstage and also wrote for other theatrical periodicals. Her subject was frequently the role of women in the theater. She also served as a dramaturg for regional companies and playwriting festivals.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by her father, George, and a sister, Natalie Fewsmith, all of New York City.       
         Rear Adm. Grace Murray Hopper, retired, a mathematician and pioneer in data processing who was a legendary figure among both computer scientists and industry executives, died New Year's Day at her home in Arlington, Va.         Admiral Hopper, who was 85 years old, had been in ill health recently, family members said, and died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes.         She had been in the Navy, as an active-duty officer or a reservist, since World War II, and received a special Presidential appointment to the rank of rear admiral in 1983. In 1982, with the retirement of Adm. Hyman J. Rickover, Admiral Hopper became the oldest officer on active duty in the armed service, which she remained until retiring herself in 1986.         Admiral Hopper made several vital contributions to the development of modern computing systems, including helping invent the Cobol programming language, which is still in widespread use in business.  Award from President         In September, President George Bush awarded her the National Medal of Technology "for her pioneering accomplishments in the development of computer programming languages that simplified computer technology and opened the door to a significantly larger universe of users." She was the first woman to receive the award individually.         At the time of her death she was a senior consultant to the Digital Equipment Corporation. She joined Digital in 1986, shortly after her retirement from the Navy.         "Grace took every opportunity to challenge people young and old to consider the infinite possibilities of technology," said Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital Equipment's president.         Admiral Hopper was born Grace Brewster Murray on Dec. 9, 1906, in New York City. After receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale, she taught math at Vassar College, her alma mater, where she later became an associate professor. She was divorced in 1945 but kept her married name.         In 1949 she worked as a mathematician at the Eckert-Mauchly Corporation. The company was formed by Dr. John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, who in 1946 had developed one of the world's first electronic computers, ENIAC, at the University of Pennsylvania. Eckert-Mauchly was then building the Univac I, the first commercial electronic computer. The company was later bought by the Remington Rand Corporation.         Earlier, in 1943, Dr. Hopper had joined the Navy. As a lieutenant assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University, she worked as a programmer on a calculating device called the Mark I, a precursor electronic computers.  Recalled by the Navy         Leaving the Navy in 1946, she remained at Harvard as a faculty member in the computation laboratory. She continued to work on early Navy computers and maintained her Naval career as a reservist. Although retired from the Navy reserve in 1966, then-Commander Hopper was recalled within a year to active duty to oversee a program to standardize the Navy's computer programs and languages.         In 1962, she was elected a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. In 1969, the Data Processing Management Association selected her as its first computer sciences "Man of the Year."         Her work led to the first practical compiler for modern computers. A compiler is a program that translates instructions written by a human programmer into more specific codes that can be directly read by a computer.         Among her many contributions, Admiral Hopper is known for coining the term "bug," which is widely used to refer to mysterious computer failures.         The first bug actually was -- a moth, as Admiral Hopper told the story. It was discovered one August night at Harvard in 1945 inside the Mark I.         "Things were going badly, there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long, glass-enclosed computer," she is quoted as saying. "Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using ordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth. From then on, when anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it."         Like another Navy figure, Admiral Rickover, Admiral Hopper was known for her combative personality and her unorthodox approach.         A self-described "boat rocker," she once said in a speech that she hoped to live until the year 2000. "I have two reasons," she said. "The first is that the party on Dec. 31, 1999, will be a New Year's Eve party to end all New Year's Eve parties. The second is that I want to point back to the early days of computers and say to all the doubters, 'See? We told you the computer could do all that.' "         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Roger F. Murray II of New Hampshire, and a sister, Mary Murray Westcote of New Jersey.       
         Dorothy Uris, a Broadway and Hollywood actress and voice teacher known professionally as Dorothy Tree, died yesterday at the Actor's Fund Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 85 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her son, Joseph Uris of Manhattan.         Mrs. Uris, who was born in Brooklyn, started her acting career in the late 1920's by playing a succession of parlor maids on Broadway. Her best-known film roles were the mother of Knute Rockne (played by Pat O'Brien) in "Knute Rockne: All American" (1940), and Louis Calhern's invalid wife in "The Asphalt Jungle" (1950). Mrs. Uris was also a founding member of the Screen Actor's Guild.         Educated at Cornell and Teachers College of Columbia University, she taught voice and English diction at the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music.         She published four books, including "Everybody's Book of Better Speaking" and "To Sing in English."         In addition to her son, she is survived by a sister, Mimi Shapiro of Manhattan.       
         Dr. Carole Chenitz-Manley, a nursing administrator, educator and researcher who became an advocate for women with AIDS, died Tuesday at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, Calif. She was 45 years old and lived in Greenbrae.         The cause of death was AIDS-related pneumonia, her family said.         When Dr. Chenitz-Manley learned she had AIDS in 1988, she quit her job at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in San Francisco and began speaking around the country for the National Association of People with AIDS. Her focus was on women. She did not disclose how she was infected except to say it was not by exposure to an AIDS patient in medical work.         Dr. Chenitz-Manley was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from Kings County Hospital Center School of Nursing and Boston College and earned a master's degree and a doctorate at Columbia University.         At her retirement she was the associate chief for research in the nursing service at the hospital and an assistant professor at the University of California at San Francisco. She also worked in family therapy at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto.         Her first marriage, to William Chenitz, ended in divorce. Surviving are her husband, Ray Manley; two daughters, Rebecca Chenitz of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Kim Manley of Greenbrae; a sister, Lucille Allison of Greenbrae, and her mother, Yvette Allison of Summerfield, Fla.       
         Jane Pickens Hoving, a popular singer on Broadway, radio and television for 20 years and later an organizer in numerous philanthropies and society events, died on Friday at her home in Newport, R.I.         She was 83 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Hoving was the musical leader of the Pickens Sisters, a trio born on a Georgia plantation that reached national stardom in the 1930's with its own radio show, concert tours and records.         The group earned $1 million in five years but dissolved when two sisters dropped out to get married and a fourth, who was the group's manager, also departed.         Mrs. Hoving pursued her music career alone and had wide-ranging success, from musical comedy to opera and nightclub engagements as well as her own shows on NBC radio and ABC television. The World-Telegram said in 1940: "She's probably the most beautiful woman on Broadway with a voice."         She frequently performed benefits for charitable causes, including events for orphans, hospitals, youths, veterans and the disabled. When her career tapered off in the late 1950's, she turned to running hundreds of fund-raising affairs. Among her favorite causes were the Salvation Army and research on heart disease and cerebral palsy, a condition that afflicted her daughter.         She became a noted figure at balls and other society events in New York City, Long Island and Newport. After her career peaked she was married twice to prominent businessmen. First was William C. Langley, a Wall Street broker. After he died, she married Walter Hoving, who had owned Tiffany & Company and Bonwit Teller. He died three years ago.         In 1972 she ran as the Republican-Conservative challenger to United States Representative Edward I. Koch in the Silk Stocking district on the East Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Hoving also painted. Flowers were her favorite subject, roses in particular. She exhibited in galleries and sold dozens of paintings for charity.         The Pickens sisters were born in Macon, Ga., and grew up there and in Atlanta. Their parents taught them to harmonize. Their father, a cotton broker, played the piano and their mother sang.         At first the sisters sang for friends, then at churches and schools. The family moved to Park Avenue in Manhattan in 1932, and a test recording for Victor made such an impression with radio executives that they hired the sisters unseen. Promoted as Three Little Maids From Dixie, they appeared in "Thumbs Up" on Broadway and in a movie, "Sitting Pretty." Serious About Her Music         Mrs. Hoving, who arranged the group's numbers, was the most serious about music. She studied at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and the Fontainbleau in France and won fellowships at the Juilliard School. Several times she dropped out of public appearances to resume formal training.         She sang in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 in a cast that included Fanny Brice and Gypsy Rose Lee. In 1940 she played opposite Ed Wynn in "Boys and Girls Together" on Broadway. Brooks Atkinson's review said she had "a most attractive voice."         A turning point came in the 1940's when, unsatisfied with her career, she consulted Robert Alton, a music arranger. He told her that she came across as aloof, which he attributed to her feeling defensive. His analysis was a revelation. "I woke up the next morning absolutely healed," she said. "That wall was just gone."         In 1949 she won raves for starring in the lead of "Regina," the musical version of "The Little Foxes." One review said her performance was "in every way admirable." Jack Gould wrote that she "sings and acts with the ferocity of a poisonous snake."         An early marriage to Russell Clark ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, Marcella Clark McCormack of Newport and Manhattan, and a sister, Patti Shreve of Bethlehem, Pa.

Serious About Her Music         Mrs. Hoving, who arranged the group's numbers, was the most serious about music. She studied at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and the Fontainbleau in France and won fellowships at the Juilliard School. Several times she dropped out of public appearances to resume formal training.         She sang in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 in a cast that included Fanny Brice and Gypsy Rose Lee. In 1940 she played opposite Ed Wynn in "Boys and Girls Together" on Broadway. Brooks Atkinson's review said she had "a most attractive voice."         A turning point came in the 1940's when, unsatisfied with her career, she consulted Robert Alton, a music arranger. He told her that she came across as aloof, which he attributed to her feeling defensive. His analysis was a revelation. "I woke up the next morning absolutely healed," she said. "That wall was just gone."         In 1949 she won raves for starring in the lead of "Regina," the musical version of "The Little Foxes." One review said her performance was "in every way admirable." Jack Gould wrote that she "sings and acts with the ferocity of a poisonous snake."         An early marriage to Russell Clark ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, Marcella Clark McCormack of Newport and Manhattan, and a sister, Patti Shreve of Bethlehem, Pa.       
         Isabelle Siegel, a sculptor, died on Tuesday at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 49 years old.         She took her own life, her family said.         Between 1984 and 1990, Ms. Siegel had three one-person shows at the Kraushaar Galleries in New York City. She also had shows at the Pace Gallery in New York and at other galleries in the United States and in Brazil and Peru.         She was born in New York and received a bachelor's degree at Sarah Lawrence College; she also studied at Columbia University, the Art Students League, the Delehanty Institute and the Escola de Artes Visuals in Rio de Janeiro.         She is survived by a son, Justin Greene of New York; two brothers, Martin and William Paul Siegel of Fort Worth, and a sister, Caryl Stern of New York.       
         Elinor White Montgomery, until recently the board chairwoman of the New York City School Volunteer Program, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 54 years old.         She died of complications of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Montgomery's volunteer work also included her serving as a trustee of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., and the Thacher School in Ojai, Calif. She also served on committees of the Environmental Defense Fund.         The school volunteer program includes a reading project in which hundreds of New Yorkers, including celebrities like Mike Wallace and Christopher Reeve, read aloud to third graders to help spur their interest in reading.         She was born in Oyster Bay, L.I. She graduated from Smith College and for several years taught at the Brearley School in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband of 32 years, George C., an investment banker; a daughter, Diana, of Manhattan; two sons, George, of Riverside, Conn., and Jonathan, of Manhattan; a sister, Sheila English of New Haven; a brother, Alexander White of Manhattan and Chatham, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Ellen H. Johnson, an influential art historian and curator who taught at Oberlin College in Ohio for 38 years, died yesterday at her home in Oberlin. She was 81 years old.         She died of cancer, said Elizabeth A. Brown, the curator of modern art at the museum.         At the time of her death, Miss Johnson was emerita professor of art at the college and honorary curator of modern art at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin.         On a national level, Miss Johnson was a powerful force in the promotion of contemporary art. She gave the work of several prominent New York artists early exposure through her curatorship of the Allen Art Museum's well-known Young Americans series. She was the first to show the black-striped paintings that established Frank Stella's reputation, and she also exhibited works by Claes Oldenburg, Larry Poons and Bruce Nauman before the artists were widely known. Mr. Oldenburg's first site-specific sculpture, "Three Way Plug," was commissioned by Miss Johnson in 1970 for the Oberlin campus.         Miss Johnson's persistence in seeking out young artists and urging acquisition of their work helped make the Allen Museum one of the country's leading institutions in the contemporary art field. And generations of students, among them Agnes Gund, now the president of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, were influenced by the popular course in modern art that she initiated at Oberlin.         Miss Johnson left her eclectic art collection, ranging from Cezanne to the American contemporary artist Judy Pfaff, to the Allen Art Museum, where it is currently on view. In her honor, the main portion of an addition to the museum, designed by Robert Venturi and opened in 1977, was named the Ellen Johnson Gallery of Modern Art.         Ellen Hulda Elizabeth Johnson was born on Nov. 25, 1910, in Warren, Pa. Her affiliation with Oberlin began early. She earned both her undergraduate and master's degrees there, and went on to postgraduate study at Uppsala university in Stockholm and the Sorbonne in Paris.         After a short stint as a lecturer and cataloguer at the Toledo Museum of Art, she returned to Oberlin in 1938 as a part-time instructor, and soon became a member of the regular teaching faculty. Her interest in Scandinavian art also led her to serve as visiting professor in the field at the University of Wisconsin in 1950-51, and to teach American art at Uppsala University in 1960.         In Oberlin, Miss Johnson lived in a Frank Lloyd Wright house, built for another owner between 1948 and 1950. Over a period of years, she painstakingly restored it and it became a showcase for her collection. She bequeathed the Wright house to Oberlin.         She is survived by a sister, Evelina Johnson McAvoy, of Erie, Pa., and a brother, Harry Johnson, of Warren.       
         Nancy Walker, who played Rhoda's mother, McMillan and wife's housekeeper and a paper-towel-promoting waitress in television commercials, along with a string of brassy, loudmouthed cutups on Broadway, died on Wednesday at her home in Studio City, Calif. She was 69 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said Frank Liberman, a family spokesman.         A long-faced, red-haired, petite actress, Miss Walker said she was never able to play what she called a "gray character."         "I don't understand it myself," she said in 1976, "but I have this effect on people, so when I walk onstage, they start laughing."         That is pretty much what happened when through a case of mistaken identity she got her big break on Broadway at age 19. Her father, who was an acrobat, asked his agent to send her to see the producer George Abbott, who was auditioning actors for a new comedy, "Best Foot Forward."  Genesis of a Comedian         She was introduced as Miss Walker -- Mr. Abbott and Richard Rodgers had been expecting a singer named Helen Walker -- and began belting out a song called "Bounce Me Brother With a Solid Four." Mr. Abbott built up the "blind date" role in "Best Foot Forward" from five lines to a leading role, making her an instant success.         She knew from age 10, she said, that she wanted to be a performer. But she said she did not realize that she could be a comedian until she started getting laughs in "Best Foot Forward."         "After that," she said, "people just kept writing parts for me."         But she said it was not a case of art imitating life. "Not so talkative" was how she once compared herself with the chatty characters she played onstage and on television.         "I've always thought people who are         on         , offstage, save very little for onstage," she said in 1976. "You can't keep the mask on all the time: it flakes." Stealing a Show         Miss Walker, whose name was originally Anna Myrtle Swoyer, was born on May 10, 1922, in Philadelphia. Her father changed his name to Dewey Barto when he joined a vaudeville act called the Three Bartos. When Miss Walker was 3 weeks old, her mother went back on the vaudeville circuit herself, and Miss Walker slept backstage. She crawled out into the spotlight one night when she was 10 months old and stole the show.         After her success in "Best Foot Forward," M-G-M flew her to Hollywood and signed her to a seven-year contract. She appeared in the movie version of the play and in "Girl Crazy" and "Broadway Rhythm," playing variations of the blind-date character she had mastered on Broadway. She also appeared in "Lucky Me," which starred.         On Broadway, she also starred as the jaded cabdriver Brunnhilde Esterhazy in "On the Town" in 1944 and later appeared in "Pal Joey," "Wonderful Town," "Look, Ma, I'm Dancin"' and "Do, Re, Mi," a spoof of the jukebox industry in which she played Phil Silvers's long-suffering wife. 'The Quicker Picker-Upper'         She was also the face that launched a million rolls of paper towels in television commercials beginning in the 1970's, saying: "Bounty. It's the quicker picker-upper."         She was not defensive about making commercials. "One minute's work done well is just as important as one hour," she said. "Look, if it were a bad minute, I'd feel terrible, because I get paid very well, and that would be cheating. I'm not cheating anybody. I mean, an artist is an artist no matter what he does. Besides, if I weren't doing those commercials well, I'd not have gotten on the Mary Tyler Moore show."         On "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," she played Rhoda Morgenstern's overbearing mother, and went on to a regular role when Valerie Harper, as Rhoda, got a series of her own. In 1974, when Rhoda was finally married after a long run as Miss Moore's unmarried best friend, all Rhoda and Joe wanted was a small ceremony before a justice of the peace. But as Rhoda's mother, Ida Morgenstern, Miss Walker was determined to have a slightly more elaborate ceremony in her Bronx apartment. Rhoda wanted no more than a dozen guests. Ida invited 79.         The show "Rhoda" ended in 1978, after a five-year run. Miss Walker also appeared in the series "McMillan and Wife" from 1971 to 1976, playing a sassy housekeeper. She was also the host of "The Nancy Walker Show," which had a brief run in 1976.         Miss Walker's most recent work was a starring role in "True Colors," a sitcom on Fox.         Miss Walker is survived by her husband, David Craig; a daughter, Miranda Craig, and a sister, Betty Lou Barto, both of Los Angeles.       
         Anita Colby, perhaps the nation's first "supermodel" and known as "The Face" after her picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine, died yesterday at her home in Oyster Bay, L.I. She was 77 years old.         Miss Colby died of lung disease, her sister, Francine Okie of East Greenwich, R.I., said.         Although her career was launched and revolved around her widely acclaimed beauty, Miss Colby became an author, a newspaper columnist, an advertising executive, chief assistant to Hollywood moguls and a host on the "Today" show -- as well as a model and film actress.         Born Anita Counihan in Washington, on Aug. 5, 1914, Miss Colby was the eldest daughter of Bud Counihan, a cartoonist for the New York Evening World and the artist for the Betty Boop series. A Stunning $100 an Hour         At the age of 19, Ms. Colby moved to New York and soon became the nation's most famous and highest-paid model, working for the John Powers agency. With her willowy, ash-blonde beauty, she was the first model ever to receive $100 an hour -- a stunning figure in those days -- and she once appeared on the covers of 15 magazines in a single month, including Time.         "She was the first great model," Miss Colby's longtime friend, Frances Koltun, said yesterday. "She was an extraordinarly stylish woman, and I hate to use that word because it sounds superficial, but she had exquisite taste."         Realizing that she had chosen a short-lived career, Miss Colby moved to Hollywood after only one year as a model and, while on contract with R.K.O., appeared in nine movies, including "Mary Queen of Scots" and "Brute Force." A New Career         But her reviews were hardly raves, and Miss Colby returned to New York in the early 1940's to take a position selling advertising for Harper's Bazaar. A column about her in The Herald Tribune on Jan. 4, 1950, written by Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg, said, "Her contract called for a salary of $55 a week, plus -- and that proved to be a big plus -- 10 percent of all the advertising she brought into the magazine." Miss Colby's sister, Francine, said yesterday, "She sold more advertising than all of them."         To her friends, according to the Herald Tribune column, she said: " 'If I ever go to Hollywood again, I'll tell those stars what to do.' And she did."         In 1944, Miss Colby was hired by David O. Selznick as his studio's "feminine director." Ms. Falkenburg, who became a close friend of Miss Colby, said yesterday: "She was in charge of coordinating all of these stars of the Selznick stable, on screen and off. She decided how they should be photographed, how they would dress, how public they should become, what interviews they should do. She was the den mother for the top beauties in America." Turned Down Clark Gable         And in the process, Miss Colby became friends with Ingrid Bergman, Jennifer Jones, Shirley Temple, Joan Fontaine, Katharine Hepburn and others. She also turned down marriage proposals from Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart, but let them down easy. "I introduced them to their wives," she told a reporter in 1970 on the occasion of her first and only marriage, to Palen Flagler, a business executive. Mr. Flagler died in 1980.         In 1947, after working for the Selznick organization, Miss Colby served as a $150,000-a-year executive assistant to the head of Paramount Pictures. She later started a public relations company in New York, wrote "Anita Colby's Beauty Book," bought and sold the Women's News Service, for which she wrote a syndicated newspaper column called "Anita Says," and appeared for six months on the "Today" show with Dave Garroway. There he hired Barbara Walters to write her scripts.         Miss Colby is survived by her sister.       
         Naome Lewis, a longtime magazine editor, died on March 18 at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.         She died of bone marrow cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Lewis began working at Trains magazine in Milwaukee before World War II. In the mid-1940's she joined McFadden Publishing in Manhattan as an articles editor at True Detective. Several years later she became an associate fiction editor at Collier's.         In 1958 she joined Good Houskeeping, where she was the fiction editor from 1960 until her retirement in 1989. At the magazines, she condensed and adapted numerous best-selling novels, including works by Erich Marie Remarque, Jessamyn West, Arthur Hailey, Pearl S. Buck, Daphne du Maurier and Virginia Holt.         Mrs. Lewis, who was born in Deerfield, Wis., was drawn to editing by her fondness for reading.         Surviving are her husband of 30 years, Robert E. Lewis, a literary agent; two daughters, Ellen J. and Sarah E., both of Manhattan; a brother, James Simonson of Minneapolis, , and a sister, Sonja Schrag of La Crosse, Wis.       
         Betty Lou Haydnet Ourisman, a former board member of the Arena Stage and Ford's Theater in Washington, who was long active in philanthrophic and cultural organizations in the capital area, died yesterday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 66 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         She is survived by her husband, Mandell J. Ourisman; two sons by a previous marriage, Daniel L. Korengold, of Washington, and Thomas E. Korengold, of Chevy Chase; three stepsons, David J. Ourisman of Eatontown, N.J., John M. Ourisman of Bethesda, Md., and Robert B. Ourisman of Washington; her mother, Hannah Haydnet of Minneapolis; a sister, Patricia Chanin of New York City, and 12 grandchildren.       
         Leueen MacGrath, an actress and playwright who co-wrote the 1955 Broadway musical "Silk Stockings" with her third husband, George S. Kaufman, died on Friday at her home in London. She was 77 years old.         Her stepdaughter, Anne Kaufman Schneider, said Miss MacGrath died after complications of a stroke last November.         As a playwright, Miss MacGrath collaborated on three Broadway shows with Mr. Kaufman while they were married: "The Small Hours" (1951), "Fancy Meeting You Again" (1952) and "Silk Stockings," a lampoon of life in the Soviet Union that starred Don Ameche and Hildegarde Neff. The show had music and lyrics by Cole Porter and a book by Mr. Kaufman, Miss MacGrath and Abe Burrows.         Miss MacGrath (her name was pronunced lew-EEN mac-GRAW) made her Broadway debut in 1948 in a starring role in "Edward, My Son," by Robert Morley and Noel Langley, after first performing in the play in London. She was also cast in the 1949 Hollywood movie version of the play starring Spencer Tracy and Deborah Kerr.         Miss MacGrath's many other New York successes included roles in "The Enchanted" (1950), "The Potting Shed" (1957), "The Love of Four Colonels" (1959), "Farewell, Farewell Eugene" (1960), "Ghosts" (1961) and "A Tribute to Lili Lamont" (1976).         Her screen credits also included "Pygmalion" and "Three Cases of Murder."         In 1976, when Miss MacGrath appeared as the grand actress Irina Arkadina in Chekhov's "Seagull" at the Manhattan Theater Club, Clive Barnes, writing in The New York Times, said her work was "one of the best individual performances on view anywhere in New York at present."         Miss MacGrath's final London appearances were in "Voyage Round My Father," opposite Alec Guinness, in 1966, and in "A Bequest to the Nation," with Zoe Caldwell, in 1970.         Miss MacGrath was born on July 3, 1914, in London. A graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, she made her debut in a West End production of "Beggars in Hell." During World War II she performed for the troops in an acting unit with Emlyn Williams.         She was married and divorced five times. Her husbands were Christopher Burn, Desmond Davis, Mr. Kaufman, Stephen Goodyear and Stephen Quinto.         She is survived by a sister, Eila Phillips, who lives in England, and Ms. Schneider, of New York City.       
         Mary Osborne, one of the few women to gain jazz stardom as a guitarist and the first woman to play the electric guitar professionally, died on Wednesday at Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield, Calif. She was 70 years old.         She died of liver failure as a result of cancer, said her son Ralph Scaffidi Jr.         Both her parents were guitarists, and Ms. Osborne -- whose family name was Orsborn -- became fascinated by stringed instruments as a child. She began playing the ukulele when she was 4 and at 10 she joined a string band led by her father in which she played banjo. She had started playing guitar a year earlier, and while she was in grammar school she was playing jazz violin. 'The Most Startling Thing'         She sang and played guitar in her hometown, Bismarck, N.D., in her teen-age years. When she was 17 some fellow musicians urged her to hear the Al Trent Sextet, which was playing a one-night stand in Bismark. One musician played an instrument she had never seen or heard before: an electric guitar. The guitarist was Charlie Christian.         "The only electric guitar I knew of was the Hawaiian guitar," she said. "I'd listen to all the jazz guitarists of the time, but they all played acoustic. But here was Charlie Christian playing Django Reinhardt's 'St. Louis Blues' note for note but with an electric guitar. It was the most startling thing I'd ever heard."         The next day, she found a guitar like Christian's. It cost $85; for $45, a friend built an amplifier for her. From then on, she was an electric guitarist.         She went on the road with an all-female trio. When they played St. Louis, Buddy Rogers, the movie star-turned-band leader, heard them and added them to his band. The Rogers band broke up when it reached New York, but Ms. Osborne quickly got jobs at radio stations and recording studios and joined in jam sessions in clubs on West 52d Street. She eventually formed her own trio.         With her husband, Ralph Scaffidi, a trumpet player, she moved to Bakersfield in 1968 where they formed and ran the Osborne Guitar Company, which later became the Osborne Sound Laboratories, a manufacturer of amplifiers and public-address systems. She appeared at the Kool Jazz Festival in New York in 1981 and played at the Village Vanguard two years ago.         In addition to her son, who lives in Bakersfield, she is survived by her husband, another son, Peter, of Clovis, N.M.; a daughter, Susan Chidgey of Bakersfield; a brother, Elvy Orsborn, and a sister, Louise Orsborn.       
         Inez Camprubi Mabon, a former publisher of the La Prensa Spanish-language newspaper in New York City, died on Friday at her home in Southbury, Conn. She was 80 years old and also lived in Greenwich, Conn.         She died of cancer, a relative said.         Mrs. Mabon ran La Prensa from 1950 to 1963, when it was sold and merged with El Diario. Her father, Jose Camprubi, founded the publication as a general interest daily paper in 1913, and she took over after he died. It circulated nationally and claimed to be the oldest Spanish-language newspaper in the continental United States.         Mrs. Mabon was born in New York City. She studied at the Art Students League in Manhattan and continued portrait and landscape painting as a hobby the rest of her life.         Her husband was John Scott Mabon, a publishing executive who was the acting director of University of Michigan Press. He is deceased.         She is survived by a son, Ferdy C. of Greenwich, and a sister, Leontine Tintner of Vienna, Austria.       
         Betty Lou Haydnet Ourisman, a former board member of the Arena Stage and Ford's Theater in Washington, who was long active in philanthrophic and cultural organizations in the capital area, died yesterday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 66 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         She is survived by her husband, Mandell J. Ourisman; two sons by a previous marriage, Daniel L. Korengold, of Washington, and Thomas E. Korengold, of Chevy Chase; three stepsons, David J. Ourisman of Eatontown, N.J., John M. Ourisman of Bethesda, Md., and Robert B. Ourisman of Washington; her mother, Hannah Haydnet of Minneapolis; a sister, Patricia Chanin of New York City, and 12 grandchildren.       
         Eve Merriam, an award-winning poet, playwright and author of more than 50 books for adults and children, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Merriam's work ranged from light-hearted verse, to an Obie-winning musical about sexism, to a theater piece on pioneer women presented at the White House, to poems on inner-city poverty that spurred calls to ban the book from schools and libraries. Honors From Teachers         Most of her books were poetry, fiction and nonfiction for children, and her work was honored by the National Council of Teachers of English. Her work included "It Doesn't Always Have to Rhyme" (Atheneum, 1964), "Blackberry Ink" (Morrow, 1985) and "Halloween ABC" (Macmillian, 1986).         Her musical "The Club," was staged by Tom O'Horgan in 1976. It portrayed men in a private club making derogatory remarks about women -- with the men played by actresses.         "Out of Our Fathers' House," her portrayal of prominent American women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was presented at the White House in 1978 and shown on public television's "Great Performances" series.         Her book of urban poems, "The Inner City Mother Goose" (Simon & Schuster, 1969), drew attacks from a judge, police officials and others who said it glamorized crime and denigrated people with lines like "Run, run father, go away; Welfare worker is due today." She defended the book as misunderstood; others praised its realism. Feminism Was a Theme         Feminism was an early and recurring theme in her works, including "After Nora Slammed the Door: the Women's Unfinished Revolution" (World, 1964) and a children's book, "Mommies At Work" (Knopf, 1960). For CBS television she wrote "We the Women" the first network documentary on women's rights. She worked on programs to eliminate sexism in schools in Minneapolis and Connecticut.         Her word play and social commentary often displayed incisive wit. Her book "Figleaf" (Lippincott, 1960) punctured the fashion industry with a glossary of garment gab that defined exclusive as "a product offered to the broadest possible mass market" and timeless as "a style that remains fashionable for more than one season."         Born in Philadelphia with the given name Eva Moskovitz, she grew up enjoying Gilbert and Sullivan, reciting poetry and writing her own verses. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937.         Under the pen name of Eve Merriam, she held a variety of jobs in the 1940's, including that of an advertising writer, a CBS radio script writer, and a poetry program host on WQXR. Her first published book of poems, "Family Circle" (Yale University, 1946) won Yale's Younger Poets Prize, and in 1949 she won a Collier's prize for fiction. Taught Short-Story Writing         She taught short-story and critical writing at City College for four years in the 1960's and dramatic writing at New York University for several years in the 1980's.         She served on the Tony nominating committee and was an officer of the Dramatists Guild and Authors League.         Two of her books will be published this fall, and she recently finished a series of poems with musical background.         Her fourth husband, Oscar-winning screenwriter Waldo Salt, died in 1987. Her prior marriages ended in divorce. Surviving are two sons, Dee Michel of Los Angeles and Guy Michel of Brooklyn; a brother, Lou Martin of Wyncote, Pa., and a sister, Helen Abramson of North Miami Beach.       
         Louise Speers Croix, a chemist who worked on anesthetics, died on Monday at the King James Care Center in Chatham Township, N.J. She was 72 years old and lived in Summit, N.J.         The cause of death was cancer, said a friend, Walter Mac Williams of Bernardsville.         Dr. Croix was born in Nanking, China, where her Presbyterian-missionary parents taught at the university. She graduated from Vassar College in 1940 with a chemistry major and earned her Ph.D. in chemistry at Columbia University in 1949.         She started a 35-year-career in 1949 with the Ohio Chemical and Surgical Division of the Air Reduction Company. Working in its laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., she specialized in anesthetics and related products. She retired in 1984. The company now is the Airco Gases Division of Britain's BOC Group.         She is survived by her brother, James Speers of Pensacola, Fla., and a sister, Elizabeth Bagley of Rock Hill, S.C.       
         Miriam Borgenicht Klein, the author of 17 suspense novels under the name of Miriam Borgenicht, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 76 years old.         She died of lymphoma, her family said.         Mrs. Klein graduated from Barnard College in 1936 and worked for the Works Progress Administration during the Depression.         Mrs. Klein's first mystery, "Corpse in Diplomacy," was published in 1949, and her most recent, "No Duress," came out in 1991. She completed her last, yet unpublished, by dictating the conclusion to a daughter from her hospital bed.         She is survived by her husband, Milton; three daughters, Elizabeth Hersh, of Washington; Emily Abel, of Santa Monica, Calif., and Margaret Nelson of Middlebury, Vt.; two sons, James, of Takoma Park, Md., and Thomas, of New York; a sister, Joan Aron, of Washington, and 12 grandchildren.       
         Stowe Whitman Hausner, a prominent authority on social work, died on Saturday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hausner, a 1944 graduate of Hunter College, was a founding director of the social services division at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, and chief social worker for the Westchester County Community Health Board.         In the late 1960's she became a program manager in the alcohol, mental health, and drug division of the National Institute of Mental Health, supervising the Federal agency's programs in the New York metropolitan area, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Later, she taught social work at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and maintained an active practice in cognitive therapy.         She is survived by her husband, Gabriel; a son, Jeffrey, of Arlington, Mass.; a daughter, Jan Doughery of Sedona, Ariz; a brother, Martin Whitman of New York City; a sister, Judge Phyllis Beck of Philadelphia, and a granddaughter.       
         Dr. Rosa Lee Nemir Audi, a pulmonary and pediatrics specialist who worked 60 years as a doctor, teacher and researcher, died on Monday at Tisch Hospital at New York University in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Dr. Nemir, who used her maiden name professionally, died of lung fibrosis, her family said.         Among the first American women to become a full professor of pediatrics, Dr. Nemir promoted medical careers for women as president of the American Medical Women's Association, North American vice president of Medical Women's International and its representative to the United Nations.         Tuberculosis was a major focus of her work. Before the discovery of antibiotics to treat the disease, Dr. Nemir studied the effects of steroids in tuberculosis patients. She also was the first to use rifampin, which became a standard drug for TB, to treat children and followed one group of patients from childhood through the next 30 years.         Her entire career was at New York University's medical school and Bellevue Hospital Center, where she remained active until her recent illness. She had served as director of the Bellevue Children's Chest Clinic, medical director for the Adolescent Girls Clinic at the Judson Health Center and director of Pediatric Laboratories at Gouverneur Hospital.         She was also an officer of the Young Men's Christian Association, Brooklyn chapter manager for the American Red Cross and a member of the boards of the Irvington House for Children, the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society and the Willoughby House Settlement.         Born in Waco, Tex., she graduated from the University of Texas in 1926 and Johns Hopkins University Medical School in 1930.         Her husband of 35 years, E. J. Audi, who ran a furniture and carpet business, died in 1968.         She is survived by two sons, Alfred, of Syracuse, and Robert, of Lincoln, Neb.; a daughter, Elaine Audi Macken of Brooklyn; a sister, Aline Nemir Speer of Austin, Tex., and eight grandchildren.       
         Musa McKim Guston, a poet and painter who was the widow of the Abstract Expressionist artist Philip Guston, died on Monday at Kingston Hospital in Kingston, N.Y. She was 83 years old and lived in Woodstock, N.Y.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Musa Mayer of New York City.         Mrs. Guston was born on Aug. 23, 1908, in Oil City, Pa. She studied at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles, where she met Mr. Guston, and had an early career as a painter. In the Depression, she worked on mural projects for the art agencies established by the Works Progress Administration, and in 1941 she collaborated with her husband on a mural for the United States Forestry Sevice in Laconia, N.H.         In later life, she turned to poetry, publishing in small literary magazines. She also modeled for Mr. Guston in many of the figurative paintings he did in the latter part of his career.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Josephine McKim Chalmers, also of Woodstock, and two grandsons, David Kadish of White Plains and Jonathan Kadish of Hoboken, N.J.       
         Melissa Stutsman Topping, an executive of the Henry Luce Foundation, died on Friday at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 49 years old and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.         She died of complications from cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Topping was the vice president and secretary of the Henry Luce Foundation in Manhattan and principal staff officer of its Clare Boothe Luce Fund. She administered $21 million in grants for scholarships, fellowships and professorships for women in science, to help remedy their under-representation in that field.         She was born in St. Louis and graduated from Vassar College in 1964. After working for a law firm and Citibank, she joined the foundation in 1969, where she progressed from research assistant to program associate, program officer, associate director and vice president.         Mrs. Topping was also a trustee of Pratt Institute, manager of the National Society of Colonial Dames in New York, an advisory council member of the New York Women's Foundation and a past board member of the Women's Prison Association and was also active in the Trust for Cultural Resources.         Surviving are her husband of 14 years, Henry J. Topping Jr., a private investor; her mother, Helen Eades Stutsman of St. Louis; a sister, Nancy Lamb of Cambridge, Mass.; a brother, Albert C. Stutsman Jr. of St. Louis; and two stepchildren, Henry J. 4th, and Samantha S. Topping, both of Manhattan.       
         Thelma Saks Bradford Ingersoll, an artist and the widow of the editor and publisher Ralph A. Ingersoll, died on Saturday at her home in West Cornwall, Conn. She was 81 years old and died of kidney failure, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Ingersoll, who was born in Manhattan, taught crafts at the Henry Street Settlement House and the City and Country School in Manhattan. In her own work, she specialized in ceramic pots, vases, bowls and plates in an Art Deco style.         She was married for 32 years to Francis Scott Bradford, a noted painter, until his death in 1961. In 1964 she married Mr. Ingersoll, an author and the former managing editor of The New Yorker and publisher of Time and a founder of Fortune and Life magazines, the newspaper PM and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. He died in 1985.         She is survived by a sister, Ethel Montague of Mill Valley, Calif.       
         Molly Picon, the comedic actress and singer who lightened and brightened the often dolorous themes of Yiddish theater with shows that were sprightly operettas, died yesterday in Lancaster, Pa. She was 94 years old.         She died in her sleep at the home of her sister, Helen Silverblatt, said Seymour Rexite, president of the Hebrew Actors Union.         Miss Picon, who was an indefatigable performer well into her 80's, had a stage career that dated from first efforts when she was 5 years old. With her sparkling         ganayvishe oygen,         or mischievous eyes, and her sturdy delivery of Yiddish songs with appropriate gestures and intonation, she reigned supreme in more than 200 productions along the Yiddish theater row that was lower Second Avenue during the 1920's.         She also appeared on Broadway, achieving her most notable success in a two-season run of "Milk and Honey," a hit musical that opened in 1961, when she was in her mid-60's. When she co-starred with Robert Morley in a London production of "A Majority of One," she was acclaimed by critics.         But it was in Yiddish theater, where audiences often measured their enjoyment by the volume of tears on both sides of the footlights, that Miss Picon established an international reputation by playing for laughs. An Idol in Jewish Neighborhoods         To millions of Jews in major cities of the United States, Europe, South America, Africa and Australia, "our Molly" meant the slender, vivacious comedian with the dark, dancing eyes and elfin face whose songs, dances and mimicry provided hilarious joy. Among the songs she helped turn into hits were "The Story of Grandma's Shawl" and "The Working Goil." She was idolized in Jewish neighborhoods, where children and clubs were named after her during her heyday in the 1920's.         Hers was the expansive, emotional style that would have been restricted by the colder performances tailored to the realism of Broadway. When she performed her first English-speaking starring role, in 1940 in Sylvia Regan's drama "Morning Star," Brooks Atkinson, who did not care for the show itself, wrote about Miss Picon in The New York Times, "To coin a phrase, she is a darling."         This was the universal sentiment that she aroused in critics and audiences alike with her talent for generating warmth and rapport. Miss Picon loved the uninhibited audiences of the Yiddish theater.         She had a flair that averted staleness and repetition. On the Yiddish stage, she used Broadway dance routines as much as possible and flooded the dialogue with English. Jacob Kalich, her husband and colleague from 1919 until his death in 1975, wrote more than 40 scripts for her, and Joseph Rumshinsky, the well-known composer, did most of her music. Mr. Kalich wrote for her one of her most sustained presentations, the play "Yankele," a sort of Yiddish Peter Pan story in which she portrayed a little boy. She later said she had appeared in it 3,000 times, a figure that might be taken merely to mean that it went on quite often. Her Yiddish Was Acquired         Curiously, Miss Picon had to develop her knowledge of Yiddish. She was born on Broome Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, on June 1, 1898, to an immigrant couple. They moved to Philadelphia when she was a child, a migration that made her English sound a bit alien in later years to Jews with the accent of East Side New York.         At the age of 5, Miss Picon won a teddy bear in a burlesque-house amateur program. Her mother recognized her talent and encouraged her, and young Molly started singing for 50 cents a night.         At age 15 she joined a Yiddish repertory company and toured as Topsy in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," switching languages -- English or Yiddish -- to suit the ears of the audience. Because she thought of a future in English-language theater, Miss Picon drifted into the cross-country vaudeville circuits, where she perfected her timing and her uncanny instinct for audience response. Made a Film With Sinatra         Her career changed suddenly when her vaudeville troupe was stranded in Boston. There Mr. Kalich persuaded her to join the Yiddish company he managed. After their marriage she went with him, in 1919, to Eastern Europe, where she perfected her Yiddish. Upon their return in 1923, she made her stage debut as the star of "Yankele."         In more recent decades, Miss Picon did less Yiddish theater, of which there was less to do. After "Milk and Honey" she worked mostly in English-language undertakings, in such plays as "Paris Is Out" in 1970 and "Something Old, Something New" (later called "The Second Time Around") in 1977 with Hans Conried. She appeared in the films "Come Blow Your Horn," which starred Frank Sinatra, and "For Pete's Sake," with Barbra Streisand.         In 1959, after an interval of many years, she returned to Second Avenue to star in a Yiddish vehicle, "The Kosher Widow." She wrote the lyrics to the music by Sholom Secunda, and the book was by Mr. Kalich and Louis Freiman. She had two roles in it, and the audience determined the story's outcome with an applause meter.         Miss Picon was particularly touched in 1946 when she and her husband were among the first entertainers to visit European camps for displaced people.         As she recalled in an interview years after the visit, "A woman came up with a child and said, 'My child is 2 years old and she has never heard the sound of laughter.' "         Her husband told Miss Picon: "Molly, that's our job. Make them laugh!"         In 1960, "Molly!," an autobiography written with Jean Bergantini Grillo, was published by Simon & Schuster.         Miss Picon is survived by her sister.         Correction:  April 8, 1992, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the actress and singer Molly Picon misstated the publication date of her autobiography, "Molly!" It was 1980.       
         Madeleine Feldman Gutman, who promoted free music, art and other cultural events in Greenburgh, N.Y., died on May 10 at St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers.         She was 68 years old and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She died after an accident at home, her family said.         For 22 years Mrs. Gutman headed Greenburgh's Arts and Culture Committee, first as chairwoman and then as executive director. Financed by government, business and private donations, the committee presents concerts, exhibitions and lectures, drawing audiences from throughout Westchester County.         She emphasized cultural diversity that included Indian art, Sufi music, poetry competitions, chamber music, discussions on religion and Cambodian dance. She insisted on free admission and encouraged people to sample events and feel comfortable about leaving ones that did not appeal to them.         Mrs. Gutman was born in Manhattan. She privately studied piano, art and dance and graduated from New York University. Before running the cultural committee, she worked as an interior designer.         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Jeremiah, a lawyer in Manhattan; three daughters, Mara Ferris of Brookline, Mass., and Thea Gutman and Rebecca Menon, both of Manhattan; a sister, Naomi Fatouros of Bloomington, Ind., and two grandchildren.       
         Moira Dryer, an abstract artist known for working in glowing colors on sheets of plywood, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 34 years old.         She died of cancer, said James McKinley, a friend.         Ms. Dryer's distinctive painting method involved applying diaphanous washes of either casein or acrylic paint to big squares of wood, creating veiled, undulating patterns that could suggest an open landscape, the sea or a soft freehand tapestry. This process was inspired by the thin paint surfaces of the Italian Renaissance frescoes she saw on a trip to Florence in 1978. But her paintings rested firmly within the tradition of American postwar abstraction and related in particular to the work of Milton Avery, Morris Louis and the young Frank Stella.         Ms. Dryer was born in Toronto, a daughter of Pegeen Synge, an architect, and Douglas Dryer, a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto. She attended Sir George Williams University in Montreal and then transferred to the School of Visual Arts in New York City. There she studied with the painter Elizabeth Murray and graduated with honors in 1981. In January 1982 she married Victor Alzamora, a fellow student at the School of Visual Arts, who died in June 1983.         Since the early 1980's, Ms. Dryer's work has been included in numerous group exhibitions in museums and galleries around the country. Her first solo exhibition was held in 1986 at the John Good Gallery in Manhattan, and there were subsequent solo shows at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, the Fred Hoffman Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., and the Mario Diacono Gallery in Boston.         She is survived by her father, Ellis Dryer of Toronto; a brother, Matthew, of Buffalo; a sister, Dr. Dagny Dryer Murray, of Prince Edward Island, Canada, and a grandfather, John L. Synge of Dublin.       
         Katherine Whelan Reynal, a vice chairwoman and a member of the board of directors of the New York Chapter of the American Red Cross in the 1950's, died on Monday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         She died of a lung infection, her family said.         Mrs. Reynal began her more than 30 years of volunteer work with the Red Cross in New York as a First Aid instructor in 1942. In the 1950's she also served as chairwoman of the volunteer training program.         In 1935 she was married to Louis Reynal, an industrial display designer. He died in 1960.         Mrs. Reynal is survived by a brother, Robert W. Whelan of Washington Depot, Conn.; her sister, Eleanor W. Ewart of Manhattan, and eight nieces and nephews.       
         Dr. Alexandra Symonds, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who was deeply involved in broadening the consideration of women's issues in her field, died on May 20 at her home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         Dr. Symonds died of pancreatic cancer, said Lily Harmon, her sister-in-law.         This month Dr. Symonds, a Fellow and former Trustee of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, received the organization's Presidential Award for Distinguished Service and Scientific Contributions.         Dr. Symonds earned a bachelor's degree at New York University in 1940 and a master's degree in pscyhology from the University of Wisconsin in 1944. She earned a medical degree from New York Medical College in 1948 and served her internship and residency at the Marine Hospital on Staten Island and at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. Dr. Symonds developed a long relationship with Bellevue Hospital.         In addition to her private practice, Dr. Symonds, at the time of her death, was an associate attending in psychiatry at Bellevue. She was also an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine, an associate psychoanalyst at the Karen Horney Clinic and a lecturer in family counseling at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was also the author of many articles on loneliness in adolescents, the problems of obesity and women's issues.         Dr. Symonds was a Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and chair of its Women's Caucus. She was also founder and first president of the Association of Women Psychiatrists and editor of its publication, News for Women in Psychiatry.         Among many honors, Dr. Symonds was a recipient of the Susan B. Anthony award of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, and the first recipient of the Association of Women Psychiatrists' Alexandra Symonds Award for her efforts on behalf of women.         Dr. Symonds is survived by her husband, Dr. Martin Symonds, a psychiatrist and deputy chief surgeon of the New York City Police Department; a sister, Edith Zuaro, of Long Island, two brothers, Milton Schacter and Dr. Sherman Schacter, both of Manhattan, two nephews and three nieces.       
         Marlene Dietrich, the magnetic movie star and singer who was an international symbol of glamour and sex for more than half a century, died yesterday at her home in Paris. She was 90 years old.         In her films and record-breaking cabaret performances, Miss Dietrich artfully projected cool sophistication, self-mockery and infinite experience. Her sexuality was audacious, her wit was insolent and her manner was ageless. With a world-weary charm and a diaphanous gown showing off her celebrated legs, she was the quintessential cabaret entertainer of Weimar-era Germany.         The Dietrich image, personified by Lola-Lola, the seductive cabaret singer in top hat and silk stockings whom she portrayed in "The Blue Angel," was that of a liberated woman of the world who chose her men, earned her own living and viewed sex as a challenge. Audiences were captivated by this creature out of no one's experience but out of everyone's imagination. 'Most Vulnerable Fantasies'         Her manner, the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, was that of "a serpentine lasso whereby her voice casually winds itself around our most vulnerable fantasies."         "She has sex but no positive gender," Tynan wrote. "Her masculinity appeals to women and her sexuality to men."         Her friend Maurice Chevalier said: "Dietrich is something that never existed before and may never exist again. That's a woman."         The Dietrich image was born in the Berlin of the 1920's, when she appeared in plays, cabaret, and film roles of varying importance (she was an extra in G. W. Pabst's 1925 "Joyless Street," which featured Greta Garbo). Her mentor, the American director Josef von Sternberg, made her an international star with "The Blue Angel," which was filmed in 1930 in both German and English. Although in the movie's offstage scenes her 5-foot-5-inch frame seemed a bit blowzy and her manner a bit too Teutonic, her portrayal of Lola-Lola, who degrades and destroys an infatuated elderly professor (Emil Jannings), won her a Hollywood contract. She shed 30 pounds, and in six more von Sternberg movies the director and his star molded the legend.         Her hair became a golden blond, makeup and lighting made her cheekbones and nose appear patrician, and her dreamy blue eyes were framed by thinly penciled, sweepingly arched brows.         Perhaps the best description of her face was provided by Erich Maria Remarque, her longtime friend, in his novel "Arch of Triumph":         "The cool, bright face that didn't ask for anything, that simply existed, waiting -- it was an empty face, he thought; a face that could change with any wind of expression. One could dream into it anything. It was like a beautiful empty house waiting for carpets and pictures. It had all possibilities -- it could become a palace or a brothel." A Lifelong Task Of Creating an Image         Working with von Sternberg, the actress became a thorough professional and perfectionist, expert in makeup, lighting, clothes and film editing. In later decades, she repeatedly had cosmetic surgery to keep her face taut, and adroitly had herself filmed with soft-focus, gauze-covered lenses.         "Glamour," she observed, "is assurance. It is a kind of knowing that you are all right in every way, mentally and physically and in appearance, and that, whatever the occasion or the situation, you are equal to it."         In clothes, she was a trend setter. Both on screen and off, she often wore trousers and mannish costumes. By proving that a woman could still look feminine in such clothes, she established "the Dietrich silhouette," emphasizing trimness and inconspicuous hips and bust.         The Dietrich-von Sternberg collaboration produced "Morocco" (1930), in which Miss Dietrich, again a cabaret singer, spurns and then pursues a French legionnaire (Gary Cooper) in the Sahara; "Dishonored" (1931), about a spy who betrays her country for love of a worthless man (Victor McLaglen), and "Shanghai Express" (1932), a melodrama in which she is a China Coast prostitute who offers herself to a warlord (Warner Oland) to save the life of a former lover (Clive Brook).         The last three Dietrich-von Sternberg films were "Blonde Venus" (1932), a mother-love soap opera; "The Scarlet Empress" (1934), an opulent and visually stunning melodrama about a lascivious Catherine the Great, and "The Devil Is a Woman" (1935), an erotic tale about a soldier-corrupting vamp in turn-of-the-century Seville.         Because it displayed her beauty most effectively, "The Devil Is a Woman" was her particular favorite. But it angered Spanish officials, at whose demand Paramount Pictures soon withdrew it and destroyed the master print. Miss Dietrich gave her own print of the film to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it is shown frequently.         The von Sternberg movies were increasingly self-indulgent, lyrical, exotic romances with pallid plots that trapped the actress in elaborate decor and special effects. They were losing a fortune, so Paramount's top executives, to protect their big investment in Miss Dietrich, barred von Sternberg from directing her again.         Seeking variety, she made her first comedy, "Desire," in 1936. It was a satire about an urbane jewel thief who steals a choice necklace from a Parisian jeweler and, in efforts to keep it, becomes involved with a hayseed Detroit engineer (Gary Cooper).         A second comedy, "Destry Rides Again," a 1939 spoof of the Old West, was even more successful. The actress, as a freewheeling saloon entertainer, seduces a valiant sheriff (James Stewart) and has a hair-pulling, face-pummeling brawl with a competitor (Una Merkel).         Miss Dietrich was a Berliner who was an early and passionate opponent of Nazism. When Hitler started arresting Jews, she financed the escape of several friends. Rejects Germany; Films Are Banned         In 1937, while filming the melodrama "Knight Without Armour" in England, she was approached by agents of Hitler offering her an almost blank check to return to Germany to star in movies of her choice. She angrily rejected the offer, and her films were banned in Germany. Soon after, she applied for American citizenship, which was granted in 1939.         During World War II, Miss Dietrich became somewhat of a symbol of free Germany. She made anti-Nazi broadcasts in German, took part in many war-bond drives and, in three years, entertained half a million Allied troops and war prisoners across North Africa and Western Europe.         Tirelessly and good-humoredly, she roughed it with the G.I.'s, standing patiently in food lines, washing with snow and sleeping in dugouts and ruins, often near the front lines. She sang her movie songs, the international wartime ballad "Lili Marlene" and some current songs, and even played a musical saw, a skill she had mastered for the Berlin stage. The troops loved her.         After the war, she was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor the United States Government bestows. France named her a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor and Belgium dubbed her a Knight of the Order of Leopold.         Her most noteworthy movie roles after the war were as an exotic gypsy in Mitchell Leisen's "Golden Earrings" (1947), with Ray Milland; a manipulative Berlin cabaret singer in Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair" (1948); a saloon manager hiding outlaws in Fritz Lang's "Rancho Notorious" (1952); a duplicitous wife in Mr. Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution" (1958); a cynical brothel-keeper in Orson Welles's "Touch of Evil" (1958) and an aristocratic widow in Stanley Kramer's "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961).         "Touch of Evil" provided Miss Dietrich with one of her most memorable lines. She admonished the character played by the corpulent Welles to "lay off the candy bars."         Her last film was a small part in the forgettable 1979 melodrama called "Just a Gigolo." In 1986, Maximilian Schell made a documentary about her, entitled "Marlene"; she did not appear on screen because of vanity, but she was interviewed and her voice is heard almost continuously.         Miss Dietrich began her cabaret performances in 1954, and for more than two decades, for fees up to $30,000 a week, she hypnotized audiences in such disparate cities as London, Las Vegas, Paris, New York, Montreal, Johannesburg and Tokyo and Tel Aviv (where she sang in German with some apprehension, but with stunning success). Her manner matched her movie image: at once intimate and elusive.         In 1960, also with trepidation about wartime animosities, she sang in Berlin. There were a few hecklers, but the vast majority of Berliners welcomed her home.         To keep her shows up to date, she interspersed the nostalgia with new songs, and in 1963 she performed in London with -- or perhaps against -- the youthful Beatles.         Marie Magdalene Dietrich was born in Berlin on Dec. 27, 1901. Her father, Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, who was a police lieutenant and a former cavalry major, died when she was 9 years old.         Her mother was Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine Felsing, the daughter of a well-to-do watch merchant, who soon after being widowed, married Edouard von Losch, a cavalry lieutenant. He was killed on the Russian front in 1918.         The young Marie Magdalene and her elder sister, Elisabeth, were brought up strictly in an upper-middle-class Prussian home. Marie Magdalene attended a private school in Weimar, studied French and took violin lessons, hoping for a concert career. But when she was 18, a hand injury threatened that dream and she decided to try dramatics, contracting her two given names to Marlene because her family disapproved of acting.         She failed an audition with Max Reinhardt and joined the chorus of a touring musical revue. A year later, she passed a second audition and was admitted to Reinhardt's drama school.         Soon after, she won small roles on the stage and in German films. Her only substantial role was in the film "Tragedy of Love" (1923). She was assigned the part by Rudolph Sieber, a young Czechoslovak production assistant. They were married on May 17, 1924, and the next year had a daughter, Maria.         After the early years of their marriage, Mr. Sieber was rarely seen with his wife. He held movie jobs in New York and Hollywood and, in 1953, became a chicken farmer in California in the San Fernando Valley. They never divorced, but lived apart for most of their remaining years. He died in 1975.         In the late 1920's, Miss Dietrich won increasingly important leading roles on the German stage and was likened in the German press to Greta Garbo. A Director's Search For a Cruel Temptress         In early 1930, von Sternberg arrived in Berlin to make "The Blue Angel," based on the Heinrich Mann novel "Professor Unrat." The director had been searching for an actress who could exude the electric eroticism of the movie's cruel temptress. He saw Miss Dietrich in a play and knew his search was over.         Two decades later, the actress was referred to by the press as "the world's most glamorous grandmother." Her daughter, also an actress, married William Riva, a scenic artist, in 1947, and had four sons. Miss Dietrich was often seen with her grandsons in Manhattan, wheeling their carriages in Central Park, later seeing them off to camp at Grand Central Terminal and even carrying their laundry.         She was deeply devoted to her family, worked hard to advance her daughter's career and helping her daughter and son-in-law financially. To be with her family, Miss Dietrich lived in Manhattan when not touring, but in 1972 she moved her chief residence from Park Avenue to Paris, where she lived in a four-room apartment on Avenue Montaigne, in the Eighth Arrondissement.         She was a close friend of many famous people, including Ernest Hemingway and Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. She also had widely reported love affairs with the writer Erich Maria Remarque and the actors Jean Gabin, Michael Wilding and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. "I've always been attracted to intelligent men," she once said. "I can pick 'em in a full room, just like that. I don't care what age they are."         Miss Dietrich kept in touch with friends around the world by telephone and letter. She often cooked delicacies for friends, as well as for stagehands and doormen. Her specialties included goulash and apple strudel. She was also knowledgeable about antiques, and owned paintings by Delacroix, Cezanne, Utrillo and Corot. A Faith in Astrology, For Herself and Others         Deeply influenced by astrology, she regularly had horoscopes prepared for friends. On that subject, she once remarked: "Astrology! Of course. After all, everyone knows that the moon pulls the sea away from the land, and farmers don't plant when the moon is wrong.         "Why should humans escape?"         She granted occasional interviews to friendly journalists, but over the years she grew impatient with those who asked questions she regarded as stupid or pointless.         In her memoirs, "Marlene Dietrich's ABC," published in 1962, she wrote: "Once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast."         Miss Dietrich, who stopped performing in the mid-1970's, lived the last years of her life as a virtual recluse in her Paris apartment.         A photograph of her in "Shanghai Express" was chosen to publicize this year's Cannes International Film Festival, which starts Thursday. The poster adorns billboards all over France.       
         Sylvia Syms, one of the most admired pop-jazz singers of her generation, died of a heart attack in Manhattan early yesterday morning after a performance in the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel. Moments after she had finished singing a program of songs associated with her longtime friend Frank Sinatra, the 74-year-old singer and actress collapsed and was taken to St. Clare's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.         "It was at the very end of the second show, and she was getting a standing ovation," said Steve La Spina, her bass player. "She put her right hand up, and the next thing we knew she fell back and hit the ground."         With her deep, grainy contralto, I've-been-through-it-all air of sophistication, and sinuous phrasing that echoed her idol, Billie Holiday, Miss Syms was a quintessential saloon singer, a term she said she preferred to cabaret singer. In the saloon tradition of Mr. Sinatra, she treated everything she sang as an intimate personal communication.         "When you perform it's a one-to-one love affair with the people out there," she once said. "That's how it has to be."         Although she enjoyed only one bona fide pop hit, "I Could Have Danced All Night," from the musical "My Fair Lady," in 1956, among musicians and a coterie of admirers she had a stature that was matched by perhaps only a dozen other veteran popular singers.         Foremost among those admirers was Mr. Sinatra, who produced and conducted her 1982 album of standards, "Syms by Sinatra," for Reprise Records. Not long after they met in the 1940's, Mr. Sinatra gave the plump, moon-faced singer the nickname "Buddha." She in turn referred to him by his full name, Francis Albert. Miss Syms took credit for giving Billie Holiday her trademark gardenia as camouflage after the legendary jazz singer had burned her hair with a curling iron.         Miss Syms was born on Dec. 2, 1917, in Flatbush, Brooklyn. She was only 15 years old when she discovered the jazz clubs of West 52d Street and became friendly with many of the musicians who performed in them. She inaugurated her nightclub career at Kelly's Stable in 1941. Five years later, she made her first recording, "I'm in the Mood for Love," with the Freddie Greene Band. The Clubs and the Labels         It was while appearing at the Cinderella Club in Greenwich Village in 1948 that she was discovered by Mae West, who gave her the part of Flo the Shoplifter in a revival of "Diamond Lil." Favorable notices from the show helped propel her into a dual career in nightclubs and the theater. Her musical comedy roles included Bloody Mary in regional productions of "South Pacific" and Dolly Gallagher Levi in a regional production of "Hello, Dolly!" Her favorite stage role was Gypsy in Tennessee Williams's "Camino Real," which she performed at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and later at Lincoln Center.         In a nightclub career that spanned 51 years, the New York rooms in which she performed included the Bon Soir, the Ruban Bleu, the Living Room, the Village Vanguard, the Cafe Carlyle, Freddy's, Michael's Pub, the Cookery, Marty's, and Eighty-Eight's.         Miss Syms recorded 15 albums for Decca, Columbia, Atlantic and Prestige, among other labels. Her most recent recording, "Along Came Bill," a tribute to the jazz pianist Bill Evans, was released in 1990 on DRG. She recently completed her final recording, "You Must Believe in Spring: The Words of Alan and Marilyn Bergman," which Cabaret Records is to release next month.         She is survived by a brother, Burton Blagman, of Wyckoff, N.J., and a sister, Muriel Bailey of Chesterfield, Mo.         A funeral service is to be held today at 2:30 P.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.       
         Theodora K. Sklover, a former director of the Governor's Office of Motion Picture and Television Development who worked to broaden public access to film and television, died May 11 at her home in Manhattan. She was 53 years old.         Ms. Sklover died as a result of jumping out of her apartment window, Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said, in what the Medical Examiner ruled yesterday as a suicide.         Ms. Sklover developed an interest in media from studying dance and drama at Bennington College and using television as a teaching tool for preschoolers at the Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan.         Her interest led to efforts to use television teaching on a wider scale and ultimately led her in the late 1960's to organize Open Channel, a nonprofit organization that lobbied for community access to cable systems and public programming. Ms. Sklover soon came to be recognized as an authority on public programming and was a consultant to several cities on how to set up public-access channels.         In 1979 Ms. Sklover created the state's office of film and television, the purpose of which was to entice filmmakers to include other sites in New York State besides New York City. She helped bring film and television productions worth more than $800 million to the state.         Ms. Sklover is survived by a sister, Marcia Kleinman, and a brother, Stanley Klein, both of New York City.       
         Dr. Beth Anspach Bernstein, a psychoanalyst for children, died on May 8 at her home in Manhattan. She was 76 years old and died of breast cancer, her family said.         Dr. Bernstein had a longtime private practice in Manhattan until she retired a year ago because of illness.         She was born in Chicago and grew up in Manhattan. After graduating from Hunter College, she earned a master's degree in English at Yale. Turning to psychology, she earned a master's degree at New York University and a doctorate from the University of California.         Her husband of nearly 50 years, Dr. Benedict J. Bernstein, also a psychoanalyst, died last year.         She is survived by a daughter, Carola Chase of the Bronx; two sons, Jonathan of Manhattan and Michael of Chicago; a sister, Jean Farr of British Columbia, Canada, and five grandchildren.       
         Cathy E. Bennett, who pioneered new strategies for picking and persuading juries, died Tuesday at her home in Galveston, Tex. She was 41 years old.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bennett was considered the nation's leading authority on jury selection. Last year the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers gave her a lifetime achievement award.         Morris Dees, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., with whom she worked on several prominent cases, said, "If Rosa Parks was the mother of the civil rights movement, Cat Bennett is the mother of modern criminal law practice in America."         As a consultant in 850 civil and criminal cases she helped lawyers select jurors, and she promoted her approach in articles, speeches, seminars and courses at the National Criminal Defense College in Macon, Ga.         In her last famous case, she assisted the successful defense of William K. Smith against rape charges.         She was also an adviser in trials that won $20 million in judgments against the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance Group and skinheads.         Her work started with the case of the Oglala Sioux Indians prosecuted for a shootout with Federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973, and developed into a full-time career. Among her other cases were the dispute over Howard Hughes's will and the 1984 trial in which John Z. DeLorean was acquitted of cocaine charges.         She recommended that lawyers ask prospective jurors not if they were for or against an issue but open-ended questions to elicit their own thoughts, which she found to be more revealing.         Ms. Bennett was born in Tampa, Fla. After graduating from the University of Florida, she earned a master's degree in psychology at West Georgia College in Carrolton, Ga. and taught psychology at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Fla.         Surviving are her husband, Robert B. Hirschhorn; her parents, Glenn and Jimmie Ellis of Hot Springs, Ark.; a brother, William Glenn Ellis of Houston, a sister, Rebecca Ellis Christy of Dallas; and a stepson, Matthew Hirschhorn of Arvada, Colo.       
         Jacqueline Smith, a television producer who led ABC Entertainment's daytime programming to six consecutive years of top ratings from 1978 through 1983, died on June 3 at her home. She was 59 years old and lived in Santa Monica, Calif.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Smith had also worked at CBS and NBC, where she oversaw daytime programming until last year. She was known in the industry for creating concepts in story development and production quality and for furthering the talents of actors and casting directors. Awards for Children's Programming         Ms. Smith was a native of Philadelphia, and attended Antioch College before starting her broadcasting career as a writer and producer at KPIX, the CBS affiliate in San Francisco. She received three Peabody Awards for children's programming there.         In 1963, the CBS network put her in charge of all its children's programming. She later became the director of special programs for the network in Hollywood, overseeing variety specials, award shows and dramatic specials.         Ms. Smith joined ABC in 1977 and, as a vice president, was responsible for the production, writing and performances on its daytime serials "All My Children," "Ryan's Hope," "One Life to Live" and "General Hospital." She enlisted guest appearances by many celebrities, Elizabeth Taylor among them, and wove aspects of adventure, fantasy, comedy and science-fiction into the accustomed fare of romance and family crises.         She stepped down in 1987, remained as a consultant for another year, and then formed her own company, Pygmalion Productions. She returned to the network wars to take charge of daytime programming for NBC Entertainment for two years until 1991.         Ms. Smith's companion was Ed Fisher, the cartoonist.         She is survived by her mother, Gertrude Feldenkreis of Atlantic City; a daughter, Eleanor Smith, and a son, David A., both of Santa Monica; a sister, Nancy Wurman of Philadelphia, and a brother, Howard Feldenkreis of Leominster, Mass.       
         Joyce Macwatty Black, called "the ultimate volunteer" for her nearly 40 years as an officer of more than 75 charitable organizations and government panels, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 65 years old, and her primary residence was in Manhattan.         She died of metastasized breast cancer, her family said.         As a leader in many causes, Mrs. Black became an expert on volunteerism and served as a consultant and coordinator of volunteer activities at local, state and Federal levels.         Last year, President Bush appointed her to the National Community and Service Commission. She was also an officer in the National Center for Voluntary Action and co-chairwoman of the National Congress on Volunteerism and Citizenship.         Mrs. Black served as the co-chairwoman of New York City's Voluntary Action Council under Mayors John V. Lindsay, Abraham D. Beame, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. Since 1986, she had been the executive director of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Office for Voluntary Service, the only paid job she ever held. Won Mayoral Award 3 Times         In 1988, Leonard W. Stern, executive director of the National Assembly, a coalition of charitable organizations, called her "the ultimate volunteer."         "She has probably done more work in more organizations at higher levels and had more influence than any private citizen," he said at the time.         Three times she won the Mayoral Award for Outstanding Voluntary Service. She was also honored by the New York Medical Society, the Hospital Association of New York State and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         Children and health were her major themes and she was a leading advocate of improving day and foster care.         At her death, she was president of the Day Care Council of New York City. She had also headed the Child Welfare League of America, the Y.M.W.C.A. Day Care Corporation and the New York State Advisory Committee on Day Care.         Appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, she was the first woman to serve on the New York State Banking Board. She was also the first woman to become the local and national president of Big Brothers-Big Sisters of America and the first to serve as a trustee of New York University Medical Center. 'Born Into a Good Life'         Born in Englewood, N.J., Mrs. Black grew up in in Ridgewood, N.J. While studying at Skidmore College, where she graduated in 1948, she volunteered as a nurse's aide.         She attributed her career to her family roots, a pledge she made during an illness and guidance from an educator. Her grandfather, James Harkness, was a prosperous and civic-minded businessman. "I was born into a good life," she said, "and was encouraged to give back what I could."         Stricken with polio as a young adult, she said she vowed to help others if she recovered. When she considered becoming a social worker, she said Dr. Alex Rosen, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, had told her, "You will do a lot more good going on boards, raising money and getting involved in direct service to meet community needs."         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Hiram D. Black, a retired lawyer and financial consultant; a daughter, Suzanne O'Toole of Darien, Conn.; a sister, Suzanne Morris of Delray Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Minnie Mazer Nathanson, a philanthropist involved in the founding of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.         She died of lymphatic cancer, said her daughter, Bobbie Abrams of Manhattan.         At the time of her death, she was a member of the boards of the Brooklyn Museum and the Jewish Museum and chairman of the B'nai B'rith Hillel-Jewish Association for College Youth.         She and her three brothers and a sister jointly donated the funds for the construction, in the mid-1950's, of the first dormitory at Albert Einstein College. Mrs. Nathanson and her siblings gave the Mazer Building in memory of their father, Abraham Mazer, who died in 1952. Mr. Mazer was a founder and chairman of the Hudson Pulp and Paper Company, based in New York City and later sold to Georgia-Pacific.         Over the years, Mrs. Nathanson was also a vice president and trustee of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, an officer of the Council of Jewish Federations and a member of the board of the New York Association for New Americans.         She was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Adelphi College.         Her husband, Dr. Louis Nathanson, a radiologist and member of the Albert Einstein College faculty, died in 1968.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Dr. Noel Nathanson of Great Neck, L.I.; a sister, Anna Lopin, and a brother, William Mazer, both of Manhattan; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Cathy E. Bennett, who pioneered new strategies for picking and persuading juries, died on Tuesday at her home in Galveston, Tex. She was 41 years old.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bennett was considered the nation's leading authority on jury selection.

         Grace T. Hamilton, a pioneer in racial integration who worked to give blacks a political voice in Atlanta, died on Wednesday at the Briarcliff Haven Nursing Home in Atlanta. She was 85 years old and lived in Atlanta.         Mrs. Hamilton was in the forefront of efforts to improve the lives of blacks and the poor through jobs, education, housing, health care and child care.         She was known for her diplomacy. Julian Bond, the former State Senator in Georgia, called her "a real pathfinder."         She was the first black woman elected to the Georgia Legislature, where she served in the General Assembly from 1966 to 1984.         As a legislator, Mrs. Hamilton was instrumental in expanding black representation in Atlanta's City Council. She drafted a law that authorized a revision of the city charter, then served as the charter commission's vice chairwoman. In 1973 the charter amended the citywide Council elections by adding 12 district seats, enabling heavily black areas to elect black candidates.         Earlier, Mrs. Hamilton headed the local Urban League for 18 years, starting in 1943, when blacks were largely excluded from power. Democratic candidates were virtually guaranteed of winning general elections, but only whites were allowed to vote in the party's primaries.         Mrs. Hamilton also promoted voter registration and fought for more aid to black schools, and she worked to end segregation across the South as the associate director of the Southern Regional Council and as a leader in the Highlander Folk School, a training institute.         She was a trustee of Clark Atlanta University and Meharry Medical College and served on the boards of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority and the National Young Women's Christian Association.         Mrs. Hamilton was born in Atlanta. Her father, George Towns, was a professor at Clark Atlanta University. She graduated there in 1927 and received a master's degree in psychology from Ohio State University in 1929.         In 1930 she married Henry C. Hamilton, a dean at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. She taught there and also worked on a Federal survey of black workers and on a college integration program. She returned to Atlanta in 1943 when her husband joined Morehouse College. He died in 1987.         She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Payne of Atlanta; a sister, Harriet Jenkins of Shaker Heights, Ohio; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         M. F. K. Fisher, the writer whose artful personal essays about food created a genre, died yesterday afternoon at her home on the Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, Calif. She was 83 years old.         She died after a lengthy battle with Parkinson's disease, her daughter Kennedy Wright said. "I think it was probably the effects of the disease coupled with the fact that she was 83 years old," Ms. Wright said.         In a career spanning more than 60 years, Mrs. Fisher wrote hundreds of stories for The New Yorker, as well as 15 books of essays and reminisences. She produced the enduring English translation of Brillat-Savarin's book "The Physiology of Taste," as well as a novel, a screenplay, a book for children and dozens of travelogues.         While other food writers limited their writing to the particulars of individual dishes or expositions of the details of cuisine, Mrs. Fisher used food as a cultural metaphor.         Her subject matter, she said in an interview in 1990, "caused serious writers and critics to dismiss me for many, many years. It was woman's stuff, a trifle." But she was not deterred. In 1943 she wrote in her book "The Gastronomical Me":         "People ask me: Why do you write about food, and eating and drinking? Why don't you write about the struggle for power and security, and about love, the way others do. They ask it accusingly, as if I were somehow gross, unfaithful to the honor of my craft.         "The easiest answer is to say that, like most humans, I am hungry. But there is more than that. It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security and love are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it."         In 1963, W. H. Auden called her "America's greatest writer." In a review of "As They Were," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1982) for The New York Times Book Review, Raymond Sokolov wrote, "In a properly run culture, Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher would be recognized as one of the great writers this country has produced in this century."         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F. K.", an hourlong docummentary by a California filmmaker, Barbara Wornum, released in 1992, is a comprehensive view of Mrs. Fisher. Ms. Wornum followed Mrs. Fisher for four years, she said, because the single mother and writer "is the most poetic voice of the working woman in the 20th century."         Mrs. Fisher was the first child of Rex Kennedy, a small-town newspaper owner, and his wife, Edith. Mrs. Fisher wrote of her entrance into the world: "I began in Albion, Mich., and was born there on July 3, 1908, in a heat wave. I leapt forth only a few minutes before midnight, in a supreme effort from my mother, whose husband had assured her that I would be named Independencia if I arrived on the Fourth."         She had two younger sisters, Anne, who died in 1965, and Norah, and a brother, David, who died in 1942. Before she entered kindergarten, Mrs. Fisher's father purchased The Whittier News, a newspaper in Whittier, a predominently Quaker town near Los Angeles, where the Kennedy clan grew up "on the outside looking in," she said.  She was an Episcopalian, and, she said, she was never invited to the home of a Quaker.         "Episcopalians were the third world in Whittier," she said in a recent interview. "I wrote a book about my childhood, and I wanted to call it 'Child of an Inner Ghetto.' " Lessons From the Family Cook         Instead, the book, which was published in 1970, was called "Among Friends." On its cover, a sepia-toned family photograph shows Edith Kennedy, tall, hatted and veiled, looking into the distance, her arm protecting a pouting Anne. Mary Frances stood alone, biting her full, lower lip, staring at the camera. "I was a haughty child," she told an interviewer.         She was removed enough to become a keen observer, and her sharp blue eyes remained pinned on significant moments of communion. She described herself, a well-loved little girl, by depicting a meal that her mother once served: "deep rich, floating puddles of hot cocoa for supper, with buttered toast sogging deliciously in them."         Her tastes and her eye for nuance continued to sharpen through adolescence. Apprenticing with the family cook, she became accomplished in the kitchen.         She also became, she said, "an insatiable reader and scribbler." After brief sojourns at Illinois College, Whittier College, Occidental College and the University of California at Los Angeles, she married a doctoral student, Alfred Fisher, in 1929 and moved to Dijon, France, where he would complete his doctorate in literature.         A beauty and an enchantress, Mrs. Fisher was photographed by Man Ray, but by her own lights, she said, "I wasn't so pretty that I didn't have to do something else." She said she "spent hours in my kitchen cooking for people, trying to blast their safe, tidy little lives with a tureen of hot borscht and some garlic-toast and salad, instead of the fruit cocktail, fish, meat, vegetable, salad, dessert and coffee they tuck daintily away seven times a week."         Her writing had the same ornery passion, the same impetuous urge to soothe her readers, while shaking their souls. Her first book, "Serve it Forth," published by Harper Brothers in 1937, took America by the shoulders and said, "Look, if you have to eat to live, you may was well enjoy it." The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941. Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         In 1943, she published "The Gastronomical Me," (Duell, Sloan & Pearce) followed by "Here Let Us Feast (Viking) in 1946. Her novel, "Not Now But Now," was published by Viking in 1947. Her translation from French of "The Physiology of Taste" was published in 1949, the same year that "An Alphabet for Gourmets" appeared.         "A Cordiall Water," a slender volume of folk cures, was published by Little, Brown in 1961. Three years later, the same publisher brought out "A Map of Another Town," a reminiscence of the years she spent in Aix-en-Provence. In 1968, Putnam published "With Bold Knife and Fork," and Mrs. Fisher joined Julia Child and Michael Field as consultants to the Time-Life book "The Cooking of Provencal France."         Throughout these decades, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters. Her marriage to Mr. Fisher ended in divorce in 1937 and that same year she married the painter Dilwyn Parrish, who died after a lingering illness in 1941. Her daughter, Anna, was born in 1943 and in 1945, she married Donald Friede, a literary agent. Her second daughter, Kennedy, was born in 1946, and she divorced Mr. Fried two years later. An Appetite for Writing         In 1952, Mrs. Fisher and her sister, Norah, rented houses on neighboring vineyards in St. Helena, Calif., an area that, with the exceptions of stays in the South of France, would remain home.         In 1971, she moved to Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, where her house of two sprawling rooms became a salon for visiting writers and food worshipers. She made her final trip to Europe in 1978, writing about Marseilles in "A Considerable Town," published that year by Viking.         Since then, Mrs. Fisher has worked and entertained at Bouverie Ranch. "My life is simple," she said in an interview several years ago. "When I can't write, I read. When I can't read I cook."         Bedridden in recent years, she cooked less and less. But she continued to write. "Sister Age," was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1983. Northpoint Press (which released new editions of many of her earlier books), published "Dubious Honors," a collection of introductions that Mrs. Fisher wrote for others' books. "The Boss Dog," a book for children, was published by Northpoint in 1991.         In an interview in 1991 she said: "I've lost my appetite. But my mind and heart have never been clearer."         Plagued by diminishing sight and crippling arthritis, her voice reduced to a whisper by Parkinson's disease, she spoke of waking up before 4 A.M. and writing stories in her mind for the hours before her secretary came in to take dictation. According to her agent, Robert Lescher, the writer "has been working on a number of manuscripts which will be published posthumously."         "The purpose of living is to get old enough to have something to say," she said last year. "But by that time, your voice doesn't work and your hands won't obey you so it's tough as hell to find a way to say it all."         Mrs. Fisher is survived by her sister, Norah Barr; two daughters, Anna Parrish, of Portland, Ore., and Ms. Wright of Alameda, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Sister Margaret Carthy, former president of the College of New Rochelle and dean of its graduate school, died on Sunday at the Marian Residence in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She was known as Mother Mary Peter during her long career as a Roman Catholic college administrator.         She had Alzheimer's disease and died of pneumonia, said Sister Eileen Fane, prioress of the Convent of St. Teresa, an Ursuline community in New Rochelle.         Sister Margaret was born and raised in Manhattan and graduated from the College of New Rochelle in 1933. She worked for several years in the business office at Teachers College at Columbia University but, after taking her vows in the Order of St. Ursuline in 1939, she returned to New Rochelle to teach at the Ursuline School. A Former Dean         Sister Margaret began her years in the administration at the College of New Rochelle as assistant registrar in 1941 and served as dean of the college from 1950 to 1957 and then as president until 1961. She earned a master's and, in 1957, a Ph.D. in American church history at Catholic University in Washington.         She added a master's degree in theology from the University of Notre Dame in 1962 and worked for four years as staff editor of The New Catholic Encyclopedia while also lecturing at Catholic University. She then taught at the University of Maryland, becoming assistant director of the general ecducation program and then assistant dean of graduate studies.         In 1975, she returned to her alma mater to accept the post of dean of the graduate school, which she held until her retirement in 1979.         Both before and after her retirement, Sister Margaret wrote articles and books about American church history, including "Catholicism in English-Speaking Lands" (Hawthorn Books, 1964). Much of her writing focused on the Archdiocese of New York, including "A Cathedral of Suitable Magnificence" (St. Patrick's, 1984). In addition, she served as archivist for the Eastern Province of the Ursulines.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Connolly of Jericho, L.I., and many nieces and nephews.       
         Deborah R. Linfield, a senior litigation attorney for The New York Times Company, died yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 38 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her family said Ms. Linfield, who had never smoked, died of lung cancer, which was diagnosed 19 months ago. She had recently been accepted into a research treatment program conducted by the National Institutes of Health at the Garden State Cancer Center in Newark and had been there last week for an initial treatment with radiated monoclonal antibodies.         Ms. Linfield, a 1978 graduate of the New York University School of Law, where she was awarded the American College of Trial Lawyers Medal for Excellence in Advocacy, had been a litigation associate at Willkie Farr & Gallagher for two years and then at Baer Marks & Upham for seven years before joining the Times Company in 1987. She received a Bachelor of Science with honor in psychology from Tufts University. First Amendment Cases         At the Times Company, Ms. Linfield was active in a number of areas of litigation, but her specialty was First Amendment cases involving the press's right of access to court proceedings. She successfully argued for The Times in broadening access rights in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the prosecution of Mario Biaggi, and in New York State's Appellate Division for both the Howard Beach racial-attack case and Joel B. Steinberg child-brutality case.         She was an active member of the City Bar Association and served on both the Committee on Communication Law and the Committee on Women in the Profession.         Ms. Linfield is survived by her 9-year-old daughter, Sarah Linfield Mattingly; by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jordan L. Linfield of Brooklyn, and by her sister, Susan Linfield of Manhattan.       
         M. F. K. Fisher, the writer whose artful personal essays about food created a genre, died on Monday at her home on the Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, Calif. She was 83 years old.         She died after a long battle with Parkinson's disease, her daughter Kennedy Wright said.         In a career spanning more than 60 years, Mrs. Fisher wrote hundreds of stories for The New Yorker, as well as 15 books of essays and reminiscences. She produced the enduring English translation of Brillat-Savarin's book "The Physiology of Taste," as well as a novel, a screenplay, a book for children and dozens of travelogues. While other food writers limited their writing to the particulars of individual dishes or expositions of the details of cuisine, Mrs. Fisher used food as a cultural metaphor. Ignored for Years         Her subject matter, she said in an interview in 1990, "caused serious writers and critics to dismiss me for many, many years. It was woman's stuff, a trifle." But she was not deterred. In 1943 she wrote in her book "The Gastronomical Me": "People ask me: Why do you write about food, and eating and drinking? Why don't you write about the struggle for power and security, and about love, the way others do. They ask it accusingly, as if I were somehow gross, unfaithful to the honor of my craft.         "The easiest answer is to say that, like most humans, I am hungry. But there is more than that. It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security and love are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it."         In 1963, W. H. Auden called her "America's greatest writer." In a review of "As They Were," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1982) for The New York Times Book Review, Raymond Sokolov wrote, "In a properly run culture, Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher would be recognized as one of the great writers this country has produced in this century." 'On the Outside Looking In'         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F. K.", an hourlong documentary by a California film maker, Barbara Wornum, released in 1992, is a comprehensive view of Mrs. Fisher. Ms. Wornum followed Mrs. Fisher for four years, she said, because the single mother and writer "is the most poetic voice of the working woman in the 20th century."         Mrs. Fisher was the first child of Rex Kennedy, a small-town newspaper owner, and his wife, Edith. Mrs. Fisher wrote of her entrance into the world: "I began in Albion, Mich., and was born there on July 3, 1908, in a heat wave. I leapt forth only a few minutes before midnight, in a supreme effort from my mother, whose husband had assured her that I would be named Independencia if I arrived on the Fourth."         She had two younger sisters, Anne, who died in 1965, and Norah, and a brother, David, who died in 1942. Before she entered kindergarten, Mrs. Fisher's father purchased The Whittier News, a newspaper in Whittier, a predominantly Quaker town near Los Angeles, where the Kennedy clan grew up "on the outside looking in," she said.  She was an Episcopalian, and, she said, was never invited to the home of a Quaker.         "Episcopalians were the third world in Whittier," she said in a recent interview. "I wrote a book about my childhood, and I wanted to call it 'Child of an Inner Ghetto.' "         Instead, the book, which was published in 1970, was called "Among Friends." On its cover, a sepia-toned family photograph shows Edith Kennedy, tall, hatted and veiled, looking into the distance, her arm protecting a pouting Anne. Mary Frances stood alone, biting her full, lower lip, staring at the camera. "I was a haughty child," she told an interviewer. Lessons From the Family Cook         She was removed enough to become a keen observer, and her sharp blue eyes remained pinned on significant moments of communion. She described herself, a well-loved little girl, by depicting a meal that her mother once served: "deep rich, floating puddles of hot cocoa for supper, with buttered toast sogging deliciously in them."         Her tastes and her eye for nuance continued to sharpen through adolescence. Apprenticing with the family cook, she became accomplished in the kitchen.         She also became, she said, "an insatiable reader and scribbler." After brief sojourns at Illinois College, Whittier College, Occidental College and the University of California at Los Angeles, she married a doctoral student, Alfred Fisher, in 1929 and moved to Dijon, France, where he would complete his doctorate in literature.         A beauty and an enchantress, Mrs. Fisher was photographed by Man Ray, but by her own lights, she said, "I wasn't so pretty that I didn't have to do something else." She said she "spent hours in my kitchen cooking for people, trying to blast their safe, tidy little lives with a tureen of hot borscht and some garlic-toast and salad, instead of the fruit cocktail, fish, meat, vegetable, salad, dessert and coffee they tuck daintily away seven times a week."         Her writing had the same ornery passion, the same impetuous urge to soothe her readers while shaking their souls. Her first book, "Serve it Forth," published by Harper Brothers in 1937, took America by the shoulders and said, "Look, if you have to eat to live, you may as well enjoy it." The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941:         "An oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life. Indeed, his chance to live at all is slim, and if he should survive the arrows of his own outrageous fortune and in the two weeks of his carefree youth find a clean smooth place to fix on, the years afterwards are full of stress, passion and danger. . . ."         "Men have enjoyed eating oysters since they were not much more than monkeys, according to the kitchen middens they have left behind them. And thus, in their own one-minded way, they have spent time and thought and money on the problems of how to protect oysters from the suckers and the borers and the starvers, until now it is comparatively easy to eat this two-valved mollusk anywhere, without thought of the dangers it has run in its few years. Its chilly delicate gray body slips into a stew-pan or under a broiler or alive down a red throat, and it is done. Its life has been thoughtless but no less full of danger, and now that it is over we are perhaps the better for it." Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         She saw little room at the table for caution. In "An Alphabet for Gourmets," (Viking, 1949), she wrote: "A complete lack of caution is perhaps one of the true signs of a real gourmet: he has no need for it, being filled as he is with a God-given and intelligently self-cultivated sense of gastronomical freedom. He not only knows from everything admirable he has read that he will not like Irish whisky with pineapple chilled in honey and vermouth, or a vintage Chambertin with poached lake perch; but every taste bud on both his actual and his spiritual palate wilts in revulsion at such thoughts. He does not serve these or similar combinations, not because he has been         told         , but because he         knows         ."         Throughout the 1940's, 50's and 60's, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters. Her marriage to Mr. Fisher ended in divorce in 1937 and that same year she married the painter Dilwyn Parrish, who died after a lingering illness in 1941. Her daughter, Anna, was born in 1943 and in 1945, she married Donald Friede, a literary agent. Her second daughter, Kennedy, was born in 1946, and she divorced Mr. Friede two years later.         In 1952, Mrs. Fisher and her sister, Norah, rented houses on neighboring vineyards in St. Helena, Calif., an area that, with the exceptions of stays in the South of France, would remain home.         In 1971, she moved to Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, where her house of two sprawling rooms became a salon for visiting writers and food worshipers. She made her final trip to Europe in 1978, writing about Marseilles in "A Considerable Town," published that year by Knopf.         Since then, Mrs. Fisher has worked and entertained at Bouverie Ranch. "My life is simple," she said in an interview several years ago. "When I can't write, I read. When I can't read I cook."         Bedridden in recent years, she cooked less and less. But she continued to write. "Sister Age," was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1983. Northpoint Press (which released new editions of many of her earlier books), published "Dubious Honors," a collection of introductions that Mrs. Fisher wrote for others' books. "The Boss Dog," a book for children, was published by Northpoint in 1991. The Tablet of Her Mind         In an interview in 1991 she said: "I've lost my appetite. But my mind and heart have never been clearer."         Plagued by diminishing sight and crippling arthritis, her voice reduced to a whisper by Parkinson's disease, she spoke of waking up before 4 A.M. and writing stories in her mind for the hours before her secretary came in to take dictation. According to her agent, Robert Lescher, the writer "has been working on a number of manuscripts which will be published posthumously."         "The purpose of living is to get old enough to have something to say." she said last year. "But by that time, your voice doesn't work and your hands won't obey you so it's tough as hell to find a way to say it all."         Mrs. Fisher is survived by her sister, Norah Barr; two daughters, Anna Parrish, of Portland, Ore., and Ms. Wright of Alameda, Calif., and four grandchildren. A Delicious Meal Of a Bookish Kind         Here are nine of the better-known books written by M.F.K. Fisher over the course of six decades. She wrote a total of 15.         "The Gastronomical Me" (Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1943), collected essays.         "Here Let Us Feast (Viking, 1946), collected essays.         "Not Now But Now" (Viking, 1947), a novel.         "An Alphabet for Gourmets" (Viking, 1949), collected essays.         "The Physiology of Taste," (Heritage Press, 1949) an English translation of Brillat-Savarin's treatise.         "A Cordiall Water," (Little, Brown, 1961), folk cures.         "A Map of Another Town," (Little, Brown, 1964), reminiscence of years in Aix-en-Provence.         "With Bold Knife and Fork," (Putnam, 1968), collected essays.         "The Cooking of Provencal France," (Time-Life, 1968); Mrs. Fisher served as a consultant with Julia Child and Michael Field.       
         Yoshiko Uchida, a writer of children's books about the Japanese-American experience, died on Sunday at the Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif. She was 70 years old and lived in Berkeley.         She died after a stroke, said her literary agent, Barbara Kouts.         Ms. Uchida wrote 29 books from 1949 to 1991. They included 27 books for children, a volume of memoirs "Desert Exile: the Uprooting of a Japanese-American Family," which the University of Washington Press published in 1982, and "The Invisible Thread," an autobiography written for teen-agers and published by Julian Messner in 1991.         "The graceful and lively books of Yoshiko Uchida have drawn on the author's own childhood to document the Japanese-American experience" in fiction for her young audience, Patty Campbell wrote in a review of Ms. Uchida's "Happiest Ending" (Atheneum, 1985) in The New York Times Book Review.         She was born in Alameda, Calif., to parents who were both born and educated in Japan and then immigrated to California early this century. She was reared in Berkeley and received a B.A.  degree from the University of California at Berkeley and a master's degree in education from Smith College.         She is survived by a sister, Keiko Kakutani, who lives outside New Haven.       
         The Rev. Page E. Smith Bigelow, one of the first women to be ordained in the Episcopal Church, died Wednesday in St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. She was 69 years old and lived in Maplewood, N.J.         She died of cardiac arrest after a lengthy illness, her family said.         A graduate of Wells College and the General Theological Seminary in New York City, she was ordained in January 1977 after spending two years as a deacon. She served as a priest in the city's Episcopal Church Center, then as a vicar in West Milford, N.J. For the past six years her home parish had been St. George's Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Newark.         She is survived by her husband, William S.; a daughter, Page E., also of Maplewood; two sons, John O. 3d of Maplewood and William S. Jr. of Lebanon Township, N.J.; a sister, Thalia B. Husted of Mantoloking, N.J., and one grandchild.       
         Helen Olheim, a mezzo-soprano who sang with the Metropolitan Opera, died on Friday at the Beneva Nursing Pavilion in Sarasota, Fla. She was 87 years old.         She died of natural causes, said her sister, Dorothy Dry of Berwick, Pa.         Miss Olheim, whose name was Oelheim off the stage, was a member of the Metropolitan Opera from 1935 to 1944. Among her roles were Mercedes in "Carmen" and Siebel in "Faust."         Miss Olheim was born in Buffalo and studied at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. She sang with the American Opera Company and was a member of the Community Concert Series, which presented concerts around New York City. She also appeared in recital around the United States and in Europe, and was a guest on many radio programs.         After retiring from the Met, she taught for 10 years at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts before moving to Sarasota.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by a brother, Bennett C. Oelheim of Pacific Grove, Calif.       
         Novetah Holmes Davenport, an early pilot who became an executive in the aircraft industry, died July 3 at a nursing home in Pompano Beach, Fla. She was 90 years old.         Mrs. Davenport received her pilot's license in 1930, continued to fly for many years and, at the age of 60, earned a license for hot-air ballooning. She was a friend of Amelia Earhart and was active in International Women Pilots, which Miss Earhart founded.         At various times in a long career, Mrs. Davenport worked for Sikorsky Aviation as its advertising and publicity manager, for Flying magazine as an associate editor and for Fairchild Aviation and the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation in administrative posts.         Her pilot training helped her survive as a passenger aboard a Pan American World Airways plane that crashed and sank off San Juan, P.R., in 1952. She looked out a window and saw engine trouble, so she warned others on board to prepare for an emergency landing. She managed to escape and to rescue a child whose parents were among the 52 people killed. Only 17 people survived.         Mrs. Davenport was born in Piermont, N.Y., and was educated in San Juan and New York City. She was active in the Girl Scouts of America and wrote two books on Scouting.         She was married for more than 40 years to Guiles Deane Davenport, who is deceased. Her survivors include a sister, Margaret Holmes Scarborough of Norfolk, Va., and Manchester, N.H.       
         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Helen M. Serfling, an art director for national magazines, advertising agencies and department stores, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said Milton Simpson, her companion.         Ms. Serfling's clients in recent years included People, Sports Illustrated and McCall's magazines and the Chiat-Day advertising agency.         She was divorced. Surviving are a son, Richard P. Mathias of Wiesbaden, Germany; two daughters, Natalie Wolfe of Manhattan and Sasha Wolfe of Brooklyn; a brother, Rudy Zerabica, and a sister, Josephine Simmons, both of Trafford, Pa., and one granddaughter.       
         Ruth Batchelor, a songwriter and radio and television reporter, died on July 23 at South Miami Hospital in Florida. She was 58 years old and lived in Key Biscayne, Fla.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Peter Kory.         Ms. Batchelor began her career as a songwriter, writing songs for Elvis Presley. She also wrote several musicals, including a version of "Tom Jones" for CBS-TV. In 1971, she released an album of women's liberation songs called "Reviving a Dream" on Femme Records, a company she began.         Ms. Batchelor founded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association in 1975, and was its president and executive director for three years. She was an entertainment reporter for ABC Television's "Good Morning America" and a film critic for National Public Radio.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Douglas, of Covelo, Calif.; her parents, Lil and Albert Tarshis of Las Vegas, Nev.; a sister, Lolo Berkoff, and a brother, Stanley Gordon, both of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.       
         Jean Baer Fensterheim, a writer of personal self-help books and magazine articles aimed especially at women, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Herbert Fensterheim.         A native of Chicago and a 1944 graduate of Cornell University, Ms. Baer scored her first success as an author in 1965 when Macmillan began "Follow Me!," a travel guide for single women looking for a husband abroad. At the time, she was single and the publicity director for Seventeen magazine. The book grew from her experiences during more than a dozen trips to Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world.         This was followed in 1968 by "The Single Girl Goes to Town" (Macmillan). Months after its publication, she married Dr. Fensterheim, a clinical psychologist who also became her co-author. Together, they focused on psychological writings.         Their latest book was "Making Life Right When It Feels All Wrong" (Macmillan, 1988).         Outside the genre, Ms. Baer wrote "The Self-Chosen" (Arbor House, 1982), a book about what she called "the world of the Jewish elite" in the United States since World War II.         She was the secretary of the Overseas Press Club and served on its board of directors.         Ms. Baer is survived, in addition to Dr. Fensterheim, by a sister, Carol Norr of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a brother, Robert Baer of Woodstock, N.Y.       
         Sister Josephine Morgan, whose work as director of the Pius X School of Liturgical Music at Manhattanville College helped raise the standards of sacred music, died on Friday at Kenwood Convent of the Sacred Heart in Albany. She was 83 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Sister Mary Lyman, the convent's pastoral care minister.         Sister Morgan, who was born in New York City, entered the Society of the Sacred Heart in 1923. A decade later, she began teaching music at Manhattanville College, in Purchase, N.Y.         During her tenure as director of the Pius X School from 1952 to 1969, she helped renew an interest in Gregorian chants and other forms of music used in the Roman Catholic liturgy. In 1961, Pope John XXIII cited the school for its role in improving the quality of liturgical music.         From 1971 until her retirement in 1977, she served as superior of the Kenwood Convent, where she continued to live.         She is survived by a brother, Arthur J. Morgan of Westhampton Beach, L.I.       
         Peggy Zinsser Douglas, who helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the arts and other charitable causes in 60 years of volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 94 years old.         Her family said she died of unspecified natural causes.         Mrs. Douglas raised more than $100 million for the Metropolitan Opera and a few times more than that for all her other causes, said John O'Keefe, a longtime friend who worked with her for Lincoln Center. She lived much of her life in Manhattan.         She served on the boards of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Red Cross, the United Negro College Fund and Lincoln Center and was chairwoman of funds, committees and benefits for these organizations.         "Peg Douglas has been one of our secret weapons," Amyas Ames, the chairman of Lincoln Center, said in 1980 when Mrs. Douglas retired from the board of directors. "Whenever we had a tough nut of a corporate chief to crack, we'd send Peg to see him. She'd go in and in her quiet, forceful manner, she netted millions of corporate dollars."         Mrs. Douglas was also a leader in the English-Speaking Union, Women's Volunteer Service in London, Volunteer Parents, Child Adoption Service, a New York State panel on education and the Institute of International Education, an organization for exchange students. She also supported Lenox Hill Hospital and Shakespearean theater.         For 54 years she was married to Lewis W. Douglas. He was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first budget director, Ambassador to England under President Harry S. Truman and president of McGill University and the Mutual Life Insurance Company.         An active partner in his career, she helped him campaign for Congress and entertain dignitaries in London. The Douglases became friends of Winston Churchill and were among the few Americans invited to attend his funeral.         Concurring in her husband's break with President Roosevelt, Mrs. Douglas supported the Republican candidate in 1940, Wendell L. Willkie. Mrs. Douglas presided over the unveiling of a giant poster in Times Square saying, "No Third Term!" Mr. Douglas rejoined the Roosevelt Administration to help direct shipping in World War II.         Mrs. Douglas was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and graduated from Smith College.         Her family founded the Zinsser Chemical Company. Her sister, Ellen, married John J. McCloy, an adviser to several American Presidents, and a cousin married Konrad Adenauer, a Chancellor of West Germany.         Surviving are a daughter, Sharman Douglas of Manhattan; two sons, James of Tucson and Lewis Jr. of Denver; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Flast, the chairwoman of the New York Committee on Public Education and Religious Liberty, died on Saturday at her home in Novato, Calif. She was 71 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Blanche Lewis, the treasurer of the committee, which is known as Pearl, of which Mrs. Flast was a national vice president.         She was a principal in a suit -- Flast v. Gardner -- in the United States Supreme Court that gave individual taxpayers the right to go to Federal court to challenge laws that, in their opinion, provide public funds for non-public schools. Mrs. Flast was one of seven taxpayers who sued John W. Gardner, then the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to establish that principle under the doctrine of separation of church and state.         The plaintiffs contended that H.E.W. was violating the Constitution by disbursing tax money to benefit private and parochial schools. The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in the case in 1967 after a lower court held that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue because the amounts of their taxes involved were negligible. Other Taxpayer Suits         The Court's ruling in 1968 came in an 8-to-1 decision, and other taxpayer suits have followed in which plaintiffs challenged acts of Congress.         When she went to court, Mrs. Flast was the president of the United Parents Associations of New York City, an umbrella group of parent and parent-teacher organizations representing the parents of more than 250,000 public-school pupils.         She also served as an officer of the Community Service Society, one of the city's oldest and most prestigious civic organizations.         Born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Mrs. Flast graduated from Hunter College, and was elected to the Hunter Hall of Fame in 1975. She received an Americans United Award in 1969 for serving the cause of public education and church-state separation.         She is survived by her husband, Howard; two sons, Robert, of Westfield, N.J., and Barry, of Novato; a brother, Arnold Fassler of Williamsville, Vt.; a sister, Sue Kellerman of San Rafael, Calif., and three grandchildren       
         Lillian Libman, a manager, press agent and personal representative for many leading instrumentalists, opera singers and dancers, died on Monday at her sister's home in Larchmont, N.Y. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said her sister Bernice Lewis.         From the early 1950's, when she established Lillian Libman Associates, Miss Libman represented Jan Peerce, George London, Roberta Peters, Peter Schickele, Rudolf Nureyev and many other artists. She also represented the Mannes School of Music, the Aspen Music Festival and other institutions.         Miss Libman was a personal representative for Stravinsky. Her 1972 book about the composer, "And Music at the Close: Stravinsky's Last Years," created a controversy in the music world by challenging previously published portraits of the artist. In a front-page article in The New York Times, Donal Henahan said the book called into question "Stravinsky's character, his interest in new music, his appetite for prolonging feuds with colleagues and critics, and his brilliance as a writer and polemicist." An Associate of Sol Hurok         She was born in Boston. A graduate of Wellesley College, she studied archeology in Greece and the Middle East under a Rockefeller grant. Her interests turned to the performing arts in 1952.         She was associated with the impresario Sol Hurok, acting as the press representative for many of his foreign attractions. She later became the executive producer of classical attractions for the Nederlander Organization. In 1986 she joined International Creative Management Artists as a consultant.         Miss Libman's husband, Harry A. Woodward, died in 1975.         In addition to Mrs. Lewis, she is survived by another sister, Anna Shore, of Lakeville, Mass.       
         Karena P. Somerville, the manager of Consolidated Edison's Customer Outreach program, died on Thursday. She was 46 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         Mrs. Somerville died in an automobile accident on the Hutchinson River Parkway near the Orchard Beach exit in the Bronx. Her car struck a tree early Thursday morning in a construction area, the police said.         Mrs. Somerville, a native of Manhattan, was a graduate of Syracuse University. In 1973 she joined Con Edison's public-affairs department in Westchester. In 1987 she was named director of public affairs for Con Edison's Westchester customer service unit, and in 1990 she was named assistant to the chairman of Consolidated Edison.         Mrs. Somerville is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Kelley; a son, Chad; a twin sister, Tamara Westover, all of Rye, and her father, Paul Buiar of Pound Ridge, N.Y.       
         Esther K. Gayner, a painter, sculptor and printmaker, died on Wednesday at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park. She was 78 years old and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         She died of pneumonia, which was a complication of leukemia, her family said.         Mrs. Gayner, a native of Trenton, began her training at the Trenton School for Industrial Arts in 1929 and graduated from New Jersey Teachers College in Trenton. She took postgraduate art courses at several schools, including that of the Museum of Modern Art, and her work was exhibited widely in New York, New Jersey and as far away as Italy and Israel.         Over the years, she worked to gain recognition for female artists. She was a board member and past president of the National Association of Women Artists and was active in the Artists Equity Association, the American Society of Contemporary Artists and the Alliance of Queens Artists.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Irving C. Gayner; two sons, Stephen, also of Forest Hills, and Jay D., of Manhattan; a sister, Dorothy Kasman of Manhattan, and one granddaughter.       
         Alice Woodard Fordyce, a philanthropist whose support of medical research in the last five decades included her involvement in the awarding of one of science's most prestigious prizes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fordyce died of heart failure, her son, James Woodard Fordyce, said.         For almost 50 years, Mrs. Fordyce and her sister, Mary Woodard Lasker, were the driving forces behind the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, which awarded the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards.         The $15,000 awards, given for significant achievement in basic and medical research, have long been considered second in prestige only to the Nobel Prizes. Forty-nine Lasker Award recipients were later awarded the Nobel Prize.         The foundation and the awards program were founded by Mrs. Fordyce, Mrs. Lasker and her husband, Albert, in 1944 to draw attention to major achievements in basic and clinical medical research and stimulate Federal financing of research. Mr. Lasker died in 1952.         Mrs. Fordyce served as executive vice president of the foundation and director of the awards program until December 1990. She remained a member of the foundation's board and a consultant to the awards program until her death.         Mrs. Fordyce, who was born in Watertown, Wis., the daughter of a bank president, graduated from Smith College in 1928 and studied at the Sorbonne and the University of Grenoble in France. The sisters' interest in supporting medical research stemmed from the ear infections that Mary Lasker endured and from both their mother and father's suffering from hypertension.         Mrs. Fordyce served on many governmental committees and with health-related organizations, including the United States branch of the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the International Council for Coordinating Cancer Research, the United States Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation, the Rockefeller University Council, the Geriatric Advisory Council of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Psychiatry Department at Columbia University.         Mrs. Fordyce was also involved with civic activities that included the American Museum in Britain, the Leeds Castle Foundation, Bargemusic and the Port of Entry Program at Queensboro College, which helps Chinese students learn American customs and practices.         Mrs. Fordyce's husband, A. Grant Fordyce, an architect, whom she married in 1939, died in 1972. She is survived by her sister, Mary Lasker of Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn.; her son, James of Greenwhich, and three grandsons.       
         Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, the director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, died on Sept. 3 at the institute, where she lived. She was 63 years old.         She died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes, the institute said.         Sister Scaglione had worked as an educator since joining the Sisters of Mercy, a Roman Catholic order, in 1947.         The order operates Grace Institute, which was founded by William Russell Grace and is now headed by his grandson, J. Peter Grace, the chairman of W. R. Grace & Company.         The institute provides free occupational training, mostly for secretarial work, and other adult education, including nutrition, cooking and clothing classes, for women. It enrolls about 1,000 students a year.         As the director, Sister Scaglione helped adapt the institute's program to the changing needs of the city's minority and immigrant women. She introduced new courses, including English as second language, and added night sessions and classes in the Bronx.         Before working at Grace, Sister Joseph taught at St. Raymond's Academy and Spellman High School in the Bronx and was the director of St. Joseph's Academy in Greenwich Village.         A native of New Jersey, she grew up in Manhattan and Queens. After graduating from the College of Mount St. Vincent, she earned a master's degree in business education from the College of St. Rose.         Surviving are a brother and sister, Jack and Rosalie Scaglione, both of Queens.         Correction:  September 26, 1992, Saturday         An obituary on Sept. 12 on Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, misidentified her Roman Catholic order. The order, which runs the institute, is the Sisters of Charity, not the Sisters of Mercy.       
         Esta Brodey Huttner, a founder and longtime board member of the Karen Horney Foundation, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.         Her family said she died of cardiopulmonary failure.         She underwent psychotherapy with a disciple of Karen Horney, the German-born psychoanalyst whose methods departed from Freudian orthodoxy. She then befriended Dr. Horney and was so impressed with the analyst's work that she joined a group of people who decided to carry it on.         When Dr. Horney died in 1952, the Karen Horney Foundation was formed. It raised funds to start a clinic that would offer affordable or free services and serve as a training center for psychotherapists.         The Karen Horney Clinic opened in Manhattan in 1955. Mrs. Huttner was vice chairman of the board of directors from then until 1975, and continued as a director into the 1980's.         Mrs. Huttner, who was born in Brooklyn, started a business career as a millinery buyer for a department store. From 1946 to 1960, she operated a Brooklyn glass factory, Peerless Art, creating hand-painted designs on glass.         In 1975 she became the first national administrator for the Cancer Research Institute in Manhattan, which finances immunological research looking for a cancer cure. Mrs. Huttner retired in 1983.         Mrs. Huttner is survived by a son, Dr. James F. Brodey of West Hartford, Conn.; a stepson, Richard Huttner of Middletown, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Hilary Fylstra of Lake Tahoe, Nev.; a sister, Celia Hartley of New Port Richey, Fla.; and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Barbara McClintock, one of the most influential geneticists of the century, died on Wednesday night at Huntington Hospital on Long Island. She was 90 years old and lived nearby at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where she had conducted research for more than 50 years.         She died of natural causes, said Lisa Gentry, a spokeswoman for the lab.         Dr. McClintock had an uncanny ability to understand the nature of genes and how they interact decades before biologists discovered the molecular tools to dissect genetic material. Working with corn all her life, she is best known for her discovery that fragments of genetic material move among chromosomes, regulating the way genes control cells' growth and development.         Modern genetics has known no figure quite like Dr. McClintock, who worked alone and chose not to publish some of her revolutionary observations for years, explaining later that she thought no one would accept the findings. She never gave lectures, as most scientists do to build their careers. Instead, until her last days, she worked in her laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor 12 hours a day, six days a week. Until 1986, she did not have a telephone, requesting that anyone who wanted to talk to her write a letter instead.         Dr. McClintock's findings were so profound that she garnered honors and prizes throughout her long career, including membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1944, president of the Genetics Society in 1945, the National Medal of Science in 1970, the first MacArthur Laureate Award, for $60,000 a year for life, in 1981, and a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983.         She was the first woman to win an unshared Nobel Prize in that category and the third woman to win an unshared Nobel science prize. The first was Marie Curie in 1911 and the second was Dorothy C. Hodgkin in 1964, both for chemistry.         "She was a giant figure in the history of genetics," said Dr. James Shapiro of the University of Chicago. "I think she is the most important figure there is in biology in general."         Dr. James Watson, director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, the chemical that makes up genes, said Dr. McClintock was one of the three most important figures in the history of genetics, one of "the three M's," he said. The other two, Gregor Mendel and Thomas Hunt Morgan, lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries and laid the groundwork for notions of inheritance.         In the 1930's, she was a discoverer of the fact that chromosomes break and recombine to create genetic changes in a process known as crossing over, a discovery that explained puzzling patterns of inheritance. She also discovered a structure called the nucleolar organizer of the chromosome, which seemed to order the genetic material during cell division, a finding that was not explained by molecular biologists for three more decades.         J. R. S. Fincham of Edinburgh, Scotland, writing in the Aug. 20 issue of Nature, a British science journal, said that Dr. McClintock's "solitary style of work, total independence of thought and extraordinary record of getting things right have elevated her to the status of a prophet in the eyes of some."         Dr. McClintock spent her professional life working on corn, using the telltale patterns of colored kernels to disclose the breaking, joining and rearranging of genes and chromosomes inside the cells. Because the pigments of the kernels are inherited, Dr. McClintock could trace genes through the changes in the kernels.  Astonishing Earlier Discoveries         To the astonishment of molecular geneticists, whose precise tools now allow them to cut and snip submicroscopic genes, Dr. McClintock's discoveries about the nature of genes and inheritance were made at a time when no one even knew what DNA was.         In the 1930's, Dr. McClintock established her reputation by becoming one of the scientists to develop an understanding of chromosomes as the basis of heredity, work that was honored by her National Medal of Science.         Dr. McClintock's Nobel Prize was for her discovery that the genetic material is not fixed, but instead is fluid. Small fragments of DNA, called transposable elements, actually move from place to place and, in doing so, they control the expression of genes.         Dr. McClintock made this discovery nearly 40 years before she won the Nobel Prize, at a time when genetics was still so rudimentary that her ideas baffled other scientists and were often dismissed outright or ignored.         In an introduction to a volume of papers about Dr. McClintock, produced in celebration of her 90th birthday, Dr. Nina Fedoroff of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and Dr. David Botstein of Stanford University described Dr. McClintock's plight.         Her ideas about transposable elements, they wrote, were "ahead of her time and Barbara found herself in an anomalous and unique position," adding, "She was universally respected and admired as one of the leading geneticists of her era, yet the reaction to her latest and perhaps most profound discoveries and insights was often uncomprehending or indifferent and not infrequently dismissive or even hostile." Filed Her Early Data         Concluding that she could never convince the scientific community, Dr. McClintock doggedly carried on with her work, carefully filing her data away and writing them up only in her annual reports to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, which supported her work.         In her biography of Dr. McClintock, "A Feeling for the Organism," Dr.  Evelyn Fox Keller of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote that geneticists were baffled by Dr. McClintock's ideas because they seemed too much at odds with the very nature of Darwinian evolution. The theory of evolution holds that changes occur randomly in genes, giving rise to variations that may or may not prove beneficial.         Dr. McClintock, however, was saying that purposeful changes occur in genes, that transposable elements jump to specific places to insert themselves into genetic material and alter it.         Another stumbling block, Dr. Keller said, was that Dr. McClintock was working with corn, a species whose complex patterns of development were clear to her but not to many others. And she had done her work alone without the benefit of long discussions trying to explain her ideas to colleagues.         Finally, in the late 1970's, when molecular biologists isolated transposable elements in bacteria and then discovered that they were universally used by cells to control genes, Dr. McClintock's work was rediscovered and widely celebrated as prescient.         Dr. Shapiro said: "I think the implications of this work are just being realized. The idea that the genome is capable of repairing itself, and that it is capable of reconstructing itself, that there are systems in the cell that can detect damage and do appropriate things to repair it, has tremendous implications for evolution as well as for genetics." Knew Where 'Mysteries Lie'         Because Dr. McClintock worked alone, emphatically rejecting reductionism, because she was so often right and saw so clearly when others were muddled, she has gained a reputation as almost a mystic. But Dr. Shapiro said she was more "someone who understands where the mysteries lie than someone who mystifies."         Dr. McClintock "understands the complexity of the genome and the limits to our understanding of it," he said, adding, "She appreciated that the problems we are addressing are enormously deep and complex."         Dr. Keller described Dr. McClintock as a person who from infancy valued her solitude and independence.         Barbara McClintock was born on June 16, 1902, in Hartford. The daughter of a doctor, she grew up in Brooklyn and learned to love science while attending Erasmus Hall High School there. When she was 17, she enrolled at Cornell University's College of Agriculture, a university that had been extremely hospitable to women.         When she was a junior she was invited to take the university's graduate course in genetics and became, unofficially, a graduate student. From the time she received her Ph.D. in 1927 until 1941, she worked at Cornell University and at the University of Missouri, collaborating with some of the country's most eminent geneticists. From 1941 until her death, Dr. McClintock worked at Cold Spring Harbor, following her own course.         Dr. McClintock is survived by a sister, Mignon Crowell, who lives in Florida, and a brother, Thomas N. McClintock of Newtown, Conn.       
         Anne G. Wilder, who led the expansion of Playwrights Horizons, a nonprofit developmental theater in Manhattan, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Wilder joined the Playwrights Horizons board in 1976 and was its chairwoman for the last 11 years. She helped raise money and guide the purchase of its building at 416 West 42d Street, which houses two theaters and administrative offices.         The organization sponsored many productions, some of which moved to Off Broadway, including Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You," Jonathan Reynolds's "Geniuses" and Wendy Wasserstein's "Isn't It Romantic."         Among the writers, composers and lyricists supported by Playwrights Horizons have been Ted Tally, A. R. Gurney, Alfred Uhry, James Lapine, William Finn and Albert Innaurato.         Mrs. Wilder also produced two Off Broadway shows that received critical and popular note: "A . . . My Name Is Alice," a musical revue, and a trilogy of one-act plays, "Win/Lose/Draw."         Before her involvement in the theater, Mrs. Wilder was a volunteer, lecturer, trainer and board member of the New York City School Volunteer program.         She was born in Bayonne, N.J., and grew up in Englewood, N.J. She graduated from Connecticut College in 1950.         She is survived by her husband, Robert C. Wilder; a daughter, Rachel W. Smeragliuolo of Baltimore; two sons, Clinton D., of San Francisco, and Robert D., of Washington; a sister, Doris Gould of Atlanta, and a granddaughter.       
         Shirley Booth, an actress whose warmth and versatility brought her acclaim on stage, screen and television, died on Friday at her home in North Chatham, Mass. She was 94 years old.         She died after a brief illness, said David Hunt of the Nickerson Funeral Home in Chatham, who announced her death yesterday.         Miss Booth was celebrated for never giving a bad performance. She portrayed many quick-witted women with acerbic tongues, but gained her greatest recognition for playing an ingratiating but drab, garrulous housewife clinging to wistful illusions in "Come Back, Little Sheba."         In "Sheba," she captivated audiences as Lola Delaney opposite Sidney Blackmer in William Inge's 1950 Broadway play, and then co-starred with Burt Lancaster in the 1952 movie version. Miss Booth's portrayals of a woman struggling to cope with her husband's alcoholism and their barren life together garnered every dramatic award, including a Tony and an Oscar.  'I Like My Work'         In a lighter vein, on television, the actress played the title role of an irrepressible maid on "Hazel" from 1961 to 1966, for which she received two Emmys. When associates deplored her doing the sitcom as demeaning her talents, she gently took issue with them. "Why not enjoy Hazel's success?" she said to a colleague. "I'm as pleased as I can be. I like my work."         She said the only other work she might enjoy as much as acting was interior decorating. For many years, she enjoyed remodeling her Manhattan apartment and 1810 cottage in Cape Cod, Mass.         In 1973, Miss Booth starred in a second television sitcom as a perky widow in "A Touch of Grace." Thirty years earlier, on radio, she had been a wisecracking cashier, Miss Duffy, on "Duffy's Tavern."  In Praise of Talents         She learned her craft by performing in 600 plays in stock companies before she appeared in some 40 plays on Broadway and in a few movies. On the stage she was a gangster's moll in "Three Men on a Horse" (1935), an inquisitive photographer in "The Philadelphia Story" (1939), a caustic writer in "My Sister Eileen" (1940), an anti-fascist teacher in "Tomorrow the World" (1943) and an exuberant gossip columnist in "Hollywood Pinafore" (1945).         Also on Broadway, Miss Booth was an urbane secretary in "Goodbye My Fancy" (1948), a freewheeling aunt in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" (1951), a romantic tourist in "The Time of the Cuckoo" (1952) and an ingratiating researcher in "The Desk Set" (1955).         Her films included "About Mrs. Leslie" (1954), "Hot Spell" (1958) and Thornton Wilder's "Matchmaker" (1958).         In comedies and musicals as well as dramas, reviews of her performances resembled love letters. The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson, reviewing a 1954 Broadway musical, "By the Beautiful Sea," wrote that Miss Booth's acting "radiates all through a large theater and draws an audience close together."         "The stage begins to glow the moment she steps on it and the audience melts, like a crowd of children whose imagination has been captured by someone they trust," he continued. "No one else in the theater has made native decency so human, so triumphant and so captivating."         The actress was born in Manhattan to the former Virginia Wright and Albert J. Ford, a business executive. The young Thelma Booth Ford attended public schools in Brooklyn and Hartford, and dropped out at 14 to seek a stage career, despite angry opposition by her father.         She made her first professional appearance in 1921 in Hartford in a thriller, "The Cat and the Canary," and appeared in stock theater in New Haven for more than a year, under the name Shirley Booth. She made her Broadway debut in "Hell's Bells" in 1925, along with another newcomer, Humphrey Bogart, and then interspersed stock engagements with short-lived Broadway plays for a decade.  For Room and Breakfast         She gained notice in New York by appearing in skits by Dorothy Parker at the Barbizon-Plaza Hotel in return for a room and breakfast. The performances led George Abbott, the producer and playwright, to give her the ingenue's role in "Three Men on a Horse." The comedy's two-year run elevated her from stock and led Mr. Abbott to remark, "I have worked with more actresses than I can count, and to me Shirley is easily tops."         Appraising her own views on acting, Miss Booth said: "I'm lucky. I play characters, not types. I don't care what the part is as long as it's a person I'm interested in, someone I want to introduce to people."         In an interview in 1971, she said: "I'd rather have affection than admiration. Affection is warmer and it lasts longer. I love a good critic. I don't care if he pans me, if he does it elegantly."         Miss Booth was married to Ed Gardner, the Archie of "Duffy's Tavern," from 1929 until their divorce in 1942. Her second husband, William H. Baker Jr., an artist and farmer, died of heart disease in 1951.         She is survived by a sister, Jean Coe of Los Angeles.       
         Janet Viertel, an underwater photographer, died on Wednesday at Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco. She was 77 years old and lived in Bedford Hills, N.Y.         She died of complications from breast cancer, her family said.         A native of Newark, she attended public schools and the School of Dramatic Art, New York University. She married Joseph Viertel and lived in Stamford, Conn., where she took part in civic activities. She became water resources chairman of the Connecticut State Board of the League of Women Voters, which awakened her interest in the coastal waters and oceans.         At the age of 50, when her children had grown up, she decided to become an underwater photographer, learned to dive and moved to St. Croix with her husband. The results were three books published by Grosset & Dunlap: "Undersea Gardens of the Virgin Islands" (1969); "Blue Planet, the Ecology of the Oceans" (1973), intended for high-school students, and "Underwater Holidays" (1978), a diving-and-snorkeling guide.         Her work was exhibited in one-woman shows at the Eastman Kodak galleries and at Grand Central Terminal in New York and at colleges and galleries around the country. She showed her work on television talk shows.         She always maintained a sense of humor about her work. Asked by a television interviewer which she enjoyed more, the scuba diving or photography, she replied: "The part I like best is when I come back to the surface and have a gin and tonic."         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Viertel is survived by a daughter, Alice Krieger of Manhattan; two sons, Tom of Manhattan, and Jack of Tarrytown, N.Y.; a sister, Joy Golden of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Laurie E. Colwin, a novelist and writer of short stories on modern urban romance and life, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 48 years old.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Ms. Colwin's writing won praise for its intelligence, wit and style. Critics said she displayed a keen ear and eye for the ways of the middle- and upper-class New York characters she portrayed. Her stories were noted for refreshingly happy endings in tales of love, both in and outside of marriage.         A New York Times review said she "uses her elegant, delicately colored prose to explore the effects of a relationship on a psyche." The Village Voice said her work "conjures up Manet's picnic painting as it might be reinterpreted by Koren," the cartoonist.         Judith Rascoe said in Rolling Stone: "I can't give you plot summaries that you can retell at your next party. But when you've read the stories, your next party might may seem to you as if Laurie Colwin had written it."         Ms. Colwin's four novels were "Goodbye Without Leaving" (Poseidon, 1990), "Family Happiness" (Knopf, 1982), "Happy All the Time" (Knopf, 1978) and "Shine On, Bright and Dangerous Object" (Viking, 1975). A Focus on Food         Her three collections of short stories were "Another Marvelous Thing" (Knopf, 1986), "The Lone Pilgrim" (Knopf, 1981) and "Passage and Affect" (Viking, 1974). Some of her work was adapted for stage and television.         She also worked as a translator for Isaac Bashevis Singer and wrote for The New Yorker, Mademoiselle and Redbook.         In 1987 Ms. Colwin won a Guggenheim fellowship.         Food was also a focus of her life.  During the campus uprisings at Columbia University in 1968, she cooked forstudent protesters occupying buildings. Later she was a volunteer and a cook for the Coalition for the Homeless and the Antonio Olivieri Shelter for Homeless Women.         She was also a food columnist for Gourmet magazine and wrote two volumes of essays and recipes, "Home Cooking" (Knopf, 1988) and "More Home Cooking" (HarperCollins, 1990).         Born in Manhattan, Ms. Colwin grew up in Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., Chicago and Philadelphia. She attended Bard College and Columbia University.         She worked for literary agents and on publishers' editorial staffs at Viking, Putnam, Pantheon and Dutton.  Then she began trying her own hand at writing and sold her first story to The New Yorker.         Surviving are her husband of nine years, Juris Jurjevics, the editor in chief of the Soho Press, and the couple's daughter, Rosa Audrey. She is also survived by her mother, Estelle Snellenberg, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Leslie Friedman, of Philadelphia.

She is also survived by her mother, Estelle Snellenberg, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Leslie Friedman, of Philadelphia.       
         Dottie Green, the savvy, strong-armed catcher for the original Rockford (Ill.) Peaches, who dominated the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League from its inception in 1943 to its demise in 1954, died on Monday at her home in Natick, Mass. She was 71 years old.         According to Mary Bond, the longtime friend who took care of her during her final illness, she died of cancer.         Although Miss Green had the same first name, and played the same position on the same team as the character portrayed by Geena Davis in "A League of Their Own," the 1992 movie based on the famous women's league, that was merely a coincidence, according to those familiar with the league and the movie, including Kelly Candaele, whose story was the basis of the movie. Handled Pitchers Well         "Dottie was a popular name back then and we had a lot of Dotties," said Dottie Collins, a former member of the Fort Wayne Daisies, who recalled Miss Green yesterday as a smart catcher who handled her pitchers well and had a dead-eye throw to second.         "I was a pitcher and I know catchers," said Mrs. Collins, who also serves as the treasurer of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association, the nonprofit organization that owns the rights to the league's name and emblems.         Dorothy M. Green, who was born in Natick, grew up as an all-round athlete and was captain of the girls' softball, basketball and field hockey teams in her senior year at Natick High School.         After graduation, she played semipro softball for the Olympettes, a women's team that played in Boston Garden.         When Philip K. Wrigley, the owner of the Chicago Cubs, decided to start a women's baseball league to keep up the nation's interest in the sport during World War II, Miss Green was one of several Olympettes recruited by the new league.         Assigned to the Rockford Peaches, one of the four teams that began play in 1943, she played four seasons, until a knee injury forced her to abandon her career. She was later a chaperone with the league. Rooted for the Red Sox         She became a recreation officer at the state prison for women at Framingham, Mass., and was captain of the guards when she retired several years ago.         According to Miss Bond, Miss Green was not a fan of major league baseball until later life, when she began rooting for the Red Sox.         "She thought the men were too slow," Miss Bond said. "She said she didn't care to watch them."         Miss Green is survived by a brother, John H. Green, and a sister, Beatrice Clews.       
         Ruth Marguerite Vande Kieft, a professor emeritus of English at Queens College and an expert on Southern literature, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for the college said.         Professor Vande Kieft retired last year, ending a 30-year career at the college. She had lectured on African-American literature and the work of novelists like Flannery O'Connor, William Faulkner and Eudora Welty. Her book "Eudora Welty," published in 1962 by Twayne Publishers, was the first full-length study of that writer. A review in The New York Times called it thorough and discriminating.         Surviving is a sister, Clarice Ribbens of Front Royal, Va.       
         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz, a great-grandniece of Chief Sitting Bull, who devoted her life to making American Indian culture available to other Americans, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 85 years old and had lived in Forest Hills, Queens, and Douglaston, Queens, since 1928.         She died of cancer, said Marjorie Weinberg, a family friend.         As director of the Indian Village at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island from 1930 to 1950, Rosebud, as she preferred to be called, enthralled legions of visitors with information about and stories from Indian culture.         Rosebud, who was born near Rapid City, S.D., was a descendant of the Lakota-Oyate, called the Sioux by the white settlers. Through her family's prominence, she came to know many well-known figures like President Calvin Coolidge, whom she helped induct into Lakota membership in 1927; Cecil B. DeMille, who tried to persuade her to star in his films, and the planner Robert Moses, who hired her for the Jones Beach post.         Last year Edward Castle, a reporter for The Las Vegas Sun, contended that it was her name that inspired Orson Welles to make "Rosebud" the last word spoken by Charles Foster Kane, the protagonist of his 1941 film classic, "Citizen Kane." He based his assertion on what he said were recently discovered daily sign-in sheets for the CBS Radio Network, where both Mr. Welles and Rosebud worked on several dramatic shows during the late 1930's.         Mr. Welles, who died in 1985, never revealed the source for the name "Rosebud."         After leaving her post at Jones Beach in 1950, Rosebud continued to lecture and write on Indian culture. Her book, "The Album of the American Indian," was published in 1969 by Franklin Watts Inc., and a second book, "Tonewaya and the Eagles," was published in 1979 by Dial Press.         In 1989 Rosebud received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from the University of South Dakota. She had attended the university from 1925 to 1927.         Rosebud's first husband, Arthur de Cinq-Mars, died in 1949. A sister, Chauncina Yellow Robe White Horse, died in 1981.         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz is survived by her husband, Alfred Frantz; a daughter, Tachawin Moy, of Brooklyn; a granddaughter, Karen Winona Moy, of Manhattan; and a sister, Evelyn Robe Finkbeiner, of Bad Pyrmont and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.       
         Fairy D. McIntire, a religious leader and the wife of Dr. Carl McIntire, president of the International Council of Churches, died on Sept. 13 at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 85 years old and lived in Collingswood, N.J.         She died of cancer, said a daughter, Celeste M. Bashaw of Princeton, N.J.         Mrs. McIntire was deeply involved in the work of Mr. McIntire's church, the Bible Presbyterian Church, in Collingswood, and in the international council, an organization of more than 500 fundamentalist churches.         She was president of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Faith Theological Seminary in Elkins Park, Pa., and chairwoman of the auxiliary to the Christian Admiral Bible Conference and Freedom Center in Cape May, N.J.         In addition to her husband and daughter, she is survived by a son, Carl T., of Toronto; another daughter, Marianna M. Clark, of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a sister, Oleta McCarty, of Pensacola, Fla.; 13 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Gertrude Farber Koskoff, a three-term Representative in the Connecticut General Assembly and former member of the State Board of Parole, died on Thursday at her home in Plainville, Conn. She was 81 years old.         She died of complications from pancreatic cancer, said her son, David.         Active in the Republican Party, Mrs. Koskoff served as a state legislator from 1953 to 1958. She focused on civil rights, the rights of the handicapped and prison reform.         During riots at the state's prisons in the 1950's, Representative Koskoff acted as a mediator at the request of the prisoners. In 1968, she was named to the Parole Board by Gov. John Dempsey, where she served until her retirement in 1990.         Besides her son, of Plainville, she is survived by her husband, Milton M. Koskoff; a daughter, Harriet K. Ziering of San Francisco; two brothers, Alan and Daniel Farber, both of Worcester, Mass; a sister, Lillian Feinberg of New York City, and a grandson.       
         Dr. Gloria Glikin Fromm, a professor of English at the University of Illinois in Chicago, died Nov. 12 at Governors Park, a nursing home and rehabilitation center in Barrington, Ill. She was 61 years old and lived in North Barrington.         She died of complications from lung-cancer, said her husband, Harold.         Dr. Fromm specialized in biography and modernist studies, covering writers in the first half of the century, particularly T. S. Eliot. Ezra Pound and Virginia Woolf. She was the author of many essays and "Dorothy Richardson: A Biography" (University of Illinois Press, 1977), the life of the pioneering English writer of stream-of-consciousness fiction.         Born in Newark, she received her undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees from New York University. She began her academic career at Brooklyn College in 1961 and, in 1970, moved to the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois, where she became a full professor in 1978.         Besides her husband, Dr. Fromm is survived by her sister, Selma Margolis, and her brother, Nathan Glikin, both of Union, N.J.       
         Hadassah, a pioneer of Israeli and Indian dancing in America, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Milton Epstein.         Hadassah, who was born in Jerusalem and whose original name was Hadassah Spira, became interested in Indian dancing at an early age. She studied dance in the United States and abroad, learning a wide range of Indian styles along with Javanese court dance, Japanese dance and modern dance. Her teachers included Ram Gopal and Jack Cole.         Hadassah, a performer of special eloquence, made her professional debut in 1945 and continued to perform Indian, Israeli, Javanese and Balinese dance through the mid-1970's. She appeared at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., four times in the 1950's and 60's and toured India in 1959-60.         Among Hadassah's best-known works was "Shuvi Nafshi" ("Return, Oh My Soul"), based on Psalm 116. Her "Tagore Suite," commissioned by the Tagore Centenary Committee, was performed for the first time in 1961.         Hadassah was also a popular teacher, known for her great warmth, who taught Israeli and Indian dance across the United States and abroad. She was a faculty member, board member and chairwoman of the ethnic division at the New Dance Group Studio in Manhattan and continued teaching through the mid-1980's.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Harriet Silverstein of San Diego, and three brothers, Simon, also of San Diego, Israel, of Delray Beach, Fla., and Abraham, of Yardley, Pa.       
         Diana Hirsh, an editor and author, died on Nov. 14 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York in Manhattan. She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Hirsh died of pneumonia, said her sister, Hadassah Hirsh of Manhattan, who reported her death yesterday.         Miss Hirsh was an editor at Newsweek from 1938 to 1946, and at the Kiplinger organization's Changing Times from 1946 to 1949.         In 1950 Miss Hirsh became the chief articles editor at Collier's magazine. In the 1950's and 1960's Miss Hirsh wrote campaign speeches for Senators John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy.         In 1963 Miss Hirsh joined the book division of Time Inc. and edited several multivolume series. In 1969 she wrote "The World of Turner, 1775-1851," an examination of the work of the artist Joseph Mallord William Turner, published by Time-Life Books. She retired from Time in 1980.

         Ilse Sass, a pianist and voice teacher, died on Wednesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old and lived in New York City         She died of a pulmonary embolism, said her sister, Leine Seligmann.

She is survived by her husband, Aubey Neill, of Baldwin; a sister, Myrna Shrouder; a brother, Ken Chong, and her parents, Zena and Linton Shrouder, all of the Bronx.       
         Barbara Reach, a former mayoral assistant in New York City and a housing and city planning expert, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of kidney failure, said a friend, Eleanor Stier, who lived with her.         Ms. Reach was born in New York and attended private schools in the city and in Switzerland. A housing specialist with the Community Service Society, a civic group, she was appointed by Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1965 as chairman of the Citizens' Advisory Committee of the Housing and Redevelopment Board. Mayor John V. Lindsay named her in 1969 to a board that oversaw the city's rent-control law.         In 1974, Mayor Abraham D. Beame named Ms. Reach one of four mayoral assistants -- believed to be the first woman to serve in that capacity -- and an adviser on housing matters. She helped to organize the city's Commission on the Status of Women and later was appointed to the staff of the City Planning Commission.         She was cited by the National Park Service for helping to preserve parkland in the New York metropolitan region and establishing the Gateway National Park recreation area.         Since 1986, she was a lay member of the state Supreme Court Appellate Division's Disciplinary Committee, the unit that reviews misconduct complaints against lawyers.         Ms. Reach was divorced in 1960 from James Reach, a playwright and author, who died in 1970.         She is survived by a sister, Mildred Bright of Northridge, Calif., and a stepdaughter, Carol Reach of Van Nuys, Calif.       
         Merline Foster, a health care worker and advocate for AIDS patients, died on Tuesday at her home in Boston. She was 46 years old.         She died of complications from hepatitis and AIDS, her family said.         Ms. Foster had said she acquired the diseases in a medical accident involving a broken test tube and needle puncture while drawing blood from a patient at Southwood Hospital in Norfolk, Mass. A suit she filed against the manufacturer of the medical equipment was settled out of court under undisclosed terms.         Ms. Foster campaigned for better safety precautions to protect patients and health care workers and to find a cure and vaccine for AIDS.         Surviving are her daughter, Sherry Quist of Boston; two brothers, James Foster of Westport, Mass., and Russell Foster of Rehobeth, Mass., and a sister, Barbara Marchand of Franklin, Mass.       
         Barbara Kauder Cohen, the author of more than 30 books for children and young adults, died on Sunday at her home in Bridgewater, N.J. She was 60 years old.         Her family said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Cohen's first book, "The Carp in the Bathtub," was published in 1972 when she was 39 years old. It won acclaim as a modern classic, enough to encourage her to leave her teaching position and devote more of her time to writing.         The book, like many of those that came later, was published by Lothrop and remains in print.         The range of her themes was unusually wide. A 1990 novel, "The Long Way Home," tells of a family coming to terms with cancer. "Molly's Pilgrim" (1983) is the story of a Jewish immigrant girl who enhances the meaning of Thanksgiving for her entire third-grade class; a movie version won an Academy Award in 1986 in the short-subject category.         "Canterbury Tales" (1988) re-creates the flavor of the time and the spirit of Chaucer's words for young readers. Graduated With Honors         A native of Newark, Mrs. Cohen was a 1954 graduate of Barnard College (magna cum laude; Phi Beta Kappa), and earned an M.A. from Rutgers University. She started a teaching career in 1955, in public schools in New Jersey.         She was inducted into the New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame last year. Four of her books are to be published posthumously.         Mrs. Cohen's husband, Eugene, died in 1990. She is survived by her daughters, Leah Cohen Chatinover of South Windsor, Conn.; Sara Cohen of Kibbutz Ketura, Israel, and Rebecca Cohen Stewart of Bridgewater, N.J.; her mother and stepfather, Florence and Ed Nash of Bridgewater; a brother, Louis Kauder of Alexandria, Va.; a sister, Susan Schwirck of Rahway, N.J.; and three grandchildren.       
         Kathryn Beck Kris, a psychoanalyst and psychiatrist, died Sunday at her home in Brookline, Mass. She was 59.         Dr. Kris died of cancer, said Harvard University, where she worked.         Dr. Kris, who received her M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1959, was assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the medical school and psychiatrist to the University Health Services. The major themes of her scholarly work were the emotional development of students and their interactions with teachers and counselors.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Anton O. Kris; two sons, David S. and Michael M. Kris, and a sister, Mary Ellen B. Wohl.       
         Stella Adler, an exponent of Method acting whom many considered the leading American teacher of her craft, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Irene Gilbert, the director of the Stella Adler Conservatory in Hollywood.         Miss Adler was born into a celebrated acting family rooted in the Yiddish theater. She made her stage debut at the age of 4, appeared in nearly 200 plays in the United States and abroad, and occasionally directed productions. She also shaped the careers of thousands of grateful performers, including Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty and Robert De Niro, at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting, which she founded in Manhattan in 1949 and where she taught for decades.         Mercurial, with honey-blond hair and expressive gray-green eyes, Miss Adler was aristocratic, physically and vocally, and her teaching was passionate, scholarly and volatile, delivered with evangelical showmanship, wicked wit and pungent phrases. She kept her students spellbound by raging, purring, cursing, cajoling and, from time to time, complimenting. 'She Dares Her Students'         Her classroom performances were among the most energetic in New York, Foster Hirsch wrote in his 1984 book "A Method to Their Madness." "Stella," he wrote, "is theatrical royalty who instills in her students a sense of the nobility of acting. She dares her students to         act         , to lift their bodies and their voices, to be larger than themselves, to love language and ideas."         Miss Adler counseled: "The teacher has to inspire, to agitate. You cannot teach acting. You can only stimulate what's already there." Often blunt, she told one actress: "You've got no talent! Nothing affects you!" As a young actor mumbled through a monologue, she shouted, "Everything is Hoboken to you!"         Miss Adler's most frenetic years were with the Group Theater, the experimental Depression-era company founded by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It was a pivotal movement in the growth of American performing arts, uniting writers, directors and actors in working to shape socially relevant theater. Members of the ensemble were leading interpreters of the Method, the technique based on the work and writings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, the legendary Moscow Art Theater actor and director, who died in 1938. The Two Methods         The Method revolutionized American theater. Classical acting instruction had focused on developing external talents, while Method acting was the first systematized training that also developed internal abilities, sensory, psychological, emotional.         Strasberg, who headed the Actors Studio until his death in 1982, rooted his view of the Method on what Stanislavsky had stressed in his early career, that the actor should perform extensive "affective memory" exercises, improvising and conjuring up "the conscious past" to convey emotion: for example, dwelling on a personal tragedy to show anguish.         Miss Adler, opposing this approach, went to Paris and studied intensively with Stanislavsky for five weeks in 1934. She found he had revised his theories to stress that the actor should create by imagination rather than by memory and that the key to success was "truth, truth in the circumstances of the play."         "Your talent is in your imagination," she taught. "The rest is lice." She discussed plays as scripts for actors, exploring the texts for performance clues. She also believed that the art, architecture and clothes of an era were important in shaping a role. The Limits of Reality         One student volunteered, "When you told me to imagine a lake in Switzerland, I couldn't help but remember a real lake I had seen in Switzerland."         "Then put your lake in Morocco," Miss Adler replied. "You must get away from the real thing because the real thing will limit your acting and cripple you. To think of your own mother's death each time you want to cry onstage is schizophrenic and sick."         "Don't use your conscious past," she advised. "Use your creative imagination to         create         a past that belongs to your character. I don't want you to be stuck with your own life. It's too little."         She encouraged students to read about Stanislavsky's exercises to ease muscular tension and aid concentration, but she did not teach them. Strasberg contended that she had abandoned the internal emphasis of the Method and that her classes were ineffectual. She argued that he so exceeded Stanislavsky's intent that his teaching was psychologically and emotionally intimidating and dangerous, producing neurotic, self-indulgent actors.         Their approaches were vastly different, but the results could be similar. Ellen Burstyn, who studied with both teachers, as many other actors did, concluded: "Stella stresses imagination and Lee stresses reality. You use Stella's imagination to get to Lee's reality. They are finally talking about the same thing." 'You Can't Be Boring'         Miss Adler demanded not only craftsmanship but also self-awareness, calling it the key to an actor's sense of fulfillment. When students failed to understand roles, she acted them out, insisting: "You can't be boring. Life is boring. The weather is boring. Actors must not be boring."         "Get a stage tone, darling, an energy," she advised, "         Never         go on stage without your motor running."         Stanislavsky, she said, created a way for actors to bring the truth to audiences to lift their spirits and enrich their lives. One student accused Miss Adler of expecting too much of young people who "haven't gone out in the world and done all that experiencing she talks about." But most of her students shared the view of another who concluded, "Stella Adler taught me more in five minutes today than any of my other teachers have taught me in five years."         Besides teaching principles of characterization and script analysis at her school, Miss Adler had been an adjunct professor of acting at the Yale School of Drama and for many years headed the undergraduate drama department at New York University. Born to a Stage Family         Stella Adler was born in Manhattan, on Feb. 10, 1901, the youngest daughter of Jacob Pavlovitch Adler and the former Sara Levitzky. The Russian immigrant couple, who led the Independent Yiddish Art Company, were the leading classical Yiddish stage tragedians in the United States. Stella's five siblings, most notably Luther, were also actors.         She started on the stage in 1905 at the Grand Street Theater on the Lower East Side. Over the years, she played both girls' and boys' roles and then ingenues in a wide variety of classical and contemporary plays in this country and abroad.         Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible she studied at public schools and New York University. She was introduced to Stanislavsky's theories in 1925 when she began taking courses at the American Laboratory Theater school, founded by Richard Boleslavski and Maria Ouspenskaya, former members of the Moscow Art Theater.         In the Group Theater, Miss Adler won high praise for performances in such realistic dramas as "Success Story" by John Howard Lawson and two seminal Clifford Odets plays, "Awake and Sing!" and "Paradise Lost." She was also hailed for directing the touring company of Odets's "Golden Boy." 'More to Give to People'         Recalling her decade with the company, she deplored above all a dearth of good roles for women in what she regarded essentially as "a man's theater aimed at plays for men." But she credited the company with evoking in her an idealism that shaped her later career. "I knew that I had it in me to be more creative, had much more to give to people," she said. "It was the Group Theater that gave me my life."         She also appeared in three films: "Love on Toast" (1938), "Shadow of the Thin Man" (1941) and "My Girl Tisa" (1948). Her later stage roles included a fiery lion tamer in a 1946 revival of the drama "He Who Gets Slapped" and, in London, an eccentric mother in a 1961 black comedy, "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad." Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green-Kurt Weill antiwar musical "Johnny Johnson."         Miss Adler restated her theories in "Stella Adler on Acting," published by Bantam Books in 1988. In an interview in The New York Times, she said she hoped the book would "help actors who had no foundation and no place to get a foundation, and no culture in which a foundation was encouraged." In the past, she had often deplored the highly commercialized Broadway theater, the growing cult of the director and what she termed the "thoughtless, naturalistic" style of most American actors. Her lectures on playwrights and script interpretation are to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.         For many years Miss Adler lived in a spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that she had decorated in elegant Italian Renaissance style.         Her third husband, Mitchell Wilson, a physicist and novelist, died in 1973. Her previous marriages, to Horace Elea scheff and Harold Clurman, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen, of Manhattan; a sister, Julia, of Englewood, N.J., and two grandchildren.         Funeral services will be private. The family said a memorial service would be held later.       
         Carol Bondhus Fitzgerald, head of readers' services at the Mina Rees Library of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, died on Tuesday in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 51 and lived in Bedford Hills, N.Y.         Professor Fitzgerald died of cancer at Northern Westchester Hospital Center, said Christy DeBoe Hicks, a City University spokeswoman.         A specialist in American Presidential bibliographies, Professor Fitzgerald was the series editor of three continuing multivolume bibliographies: Bibliographies of the American Presidents, Bibliographies of the United States, and Bibliographies of American Notables. She had been editor of American History: A Bibliographic Review from 1985 to 1991, and history editor of the Bulletin of Bibliography from 1981 to 1990.         She was born in New York City. She graduated from Rosary College in River Forest, Ill., and earned master's degrees at New York University and Columbia University. She joined the Rees Library in 1969.         She is survived by her husband, Kevin; a son, Matthew; three daughters, Anna, Katherine and Margaret, all of Bedford Hills; her mother, Anna Bondhus; her brother, Nelson, of Farmington, Conn., and a sister, Diana Bortolin, of Scarsdale, N.Y.       
         Kay Boyle, a short-story writer and novelist renowned for her deft and powerful style and her keen insights into human nature, died on Sunday night at the Redwoods, a retirement community in Mill Valley, Calif. She was 90 years old and lived at the Redwoods, where she had moved from San Francisco several years ago.         She had been in declining health for a year, said her son, Ian von Franckenstein of Kentland, Calif.         Miss Boyle wrote four dozen books, including many works of fiction, seven books of poetry and four books for children. But it was for her short stories, which were published in The New Yorker, Harper's and elsewhere, that she was particularly acclaimed. Some critics have called "The White Horses of Vienna" (1936) an especially fine collection of her stories.         She won two O. Henry Memorial Awards for short-story writing, one for the title story of that 1936 collection and one for "Defeat" in 1941. She also won a Guggenhiem Fellowship in 1934. The Lady as Radical         The writer Stephen Vincent Benet once described Miss Boyle's style as being "as bright as an icicle and light as the bones of a bird." And the critic Louis Kronenberger once contended that the fineness of her insights was "such as no other writer of our time, in English at least, can match."         Her work, which also included essays and translations, commanded admiration from critics for more than half a century. It was colored by years of living in different parts of Europe -- she moved to Brittany in 1923, then lived in Paris and elsewhere -- and by social and political concerns. Her 1936 novel "Death of a Man" contained material from her life in Austria in the mid-1930's.         Late in her life, Miss Boyle wrote that she saw herself "as a dangerous 'radical' cleverly disguised as a perfect lady." She reported that she could not remember a time beyond the age of 6 when she had not been committed in favor of, or opposed to, something. Her activities ranged from helping the families of conscientious objectors in World War I to supporting human-rights causes and demonstrating against United States involvement in Vietnam. But she also had passionate and abiding literary concerns.         Reviewing a 1988 collection of her short stories, "Life Being the Best & Other Stories," edited by Sandra Whipple (New Directions), Ann Hornaday wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book celebrated her "enduring artistic discipline.' At Home in Europe         "Unlike some of her better-known peers," Ms. Hornaday wrote, Miss Boyle "survived the halcyon days of Paris in the 1920's," and although she "is not as notorious as some of the other Moderns -- those intrepid expatriate writers who set out to change language, mesh literature and social context and expose the dissonance of contemporary life -- she evokes these tensions with a gossamer fineness."         Miss Boyle was born in St. Paul on Feb. 19, 1902, the daughter of Howard P. Boyle and the former Katharine Evans. She spent much of her childhood in Europe and then returned to the United States, where she attended school in Washington for a time.         After financial problems, the family moved to Cincinnati. Miss Boyle took violin lessons at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and attended the Ohio Mechanics Institute from 1917 to 1919, intending to go into architecture.         With her first husband, Richard Brault, a French engineer whom she had met in Cincinnati and married in 1923, Miss Boyle briefly lived in New York City, where she attended Columbia University. The couple then went to Europe, where Miss Boyle stayed for almost 20 years, living in England as well as France and Austria, and taking a fellow American expatriate, Laurence Vail, as her second husband in 1931 after she was divorced from her first.         In that period, she looked more kindly on Europeans than on her compatriots and on many of her fellow female writers. "I like to be with people who work -- English, French, or any foreign working people," she wrote, but "I am ill at ease with Americans."         She observed that most women "do not write simply or violently enough for my taste." She added, "I should like my prose to be lucid, direct and lean." A Poet in Later Years         Miss Boyle and Mr. Vail returned to the United States in 1941. They later divorced, and in 1943 she married Baron Joseph von Franckenstein.After World War II she was a correspondent in Europe for The New Yorker for a time. She went on to become a professor of English and creative writing at San Francisco State University from 1963 to 1979.         Her son said her last new book to be published was was "Words That Must Somehow Be Said: Selected Essays of Kay Boyle" (North Point Press, 1985).         Reviewing "50 Stories," a collection of her work published in 1980, Vance Bourjaily wrote in The New York Times that the stories included such techniques as "literary simplification, rhythmic repetition, the mixing in of vernacular, stream of consciousness, density of impressions, radical imagery and experiments with surrealism." The collection was republished this year by New Directions Books.         Mr. Von Franckenstein said Miss Boyle had continued to write and that most of her recent work was poetry, some of which had been published.         In addition to her son, an actor whose stage name is Ian Swift, she is survived by a sister, Joan Detweiler of Sarasota, Fla.; four daughters, Sharon Cowling of Vezenobres, France; Kathe Vail, who lives outside Paris; Clover Vail of New York City, and Faith Gude of Boston; 17 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Rebecca Ann Donovan, a sociologist and an associate professor at Hunter College, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 46 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said Robert Bazell, a friend.         Professor Donovan was the head of research at the Hunter College School of Social Work. She specialized in the study of the social consequences of economic change, such as the impact of job loss on individuals.         She was born in Peoria, Ill., and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri in 1968 and a doctorate from the Columbia School of Social Work in 1983. Before joining the Hunter faculty, she taught at New York University and Columbia, where she was research director of the school's Industrial Social Welfare Center.         She is survived by her companion, Susan Hajjar; her mother, Sarah Donovan of Winter Park, Fla., and a sister, Janette Harriott of Edmond, Okla.       
         Vivienne Segal, a musical-comedy star who appeared on Broadway in "The Desert Song," "No, No, Nanette," and "Pal Joey," died yesterday in Los Angeles. She was 95 years old and lived in Beverly Hills.         She died of heart failure, said Robert Sidney, a friend.         Miss Segal was born in Philadelphia, where she studied voice. She made her operatic debut in 1915 singing the title role of "Carmen" at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. The next year she took the leading role in "The Blue Paradise" at the Casino Theater in New York City, a show with which she toured for two years. On returning to New York, she appeared in many reviews, musicals and operettas, including "The Little Whopper" and "The Yankee Princess." In 1924, she was featured in the "Ziegfeld Follies." As the 'Fair Young Girl'         The roles capitalized on her fresh-faced beauty and sweet voice. "Just because I was little and could sing and wasn't too bad to look at, I was called a prima donna and was cast repeatedly in operettas and musical comedies as the fair young girl who was good and noble and got what she deserved," Miss Segal complained to an interviewer in 1940.         If Miss Segal found her roles limiting, audiences in the 1920's and 30's doted on her in musical confections like "Florida Girl," "The Desert Song," "The Chocolate Soldier," "Music in the Air," "The Three Musketeers" and "No, No, Nanette."         Miss Segal made her film debut in 1927 in an early sound short, singing excerpts from "Sweethearts" and "Maytime." She also appeared in "Song of the West," "Golden Dawn," "Bride of the Regiment" and "Viennese Nights," all made in 1930, and in "The Cat and the Fiddle" (1934). She later told an interviewer that she went on strike to protest the saccharine roles she was given. A Change in Style         In 1938, the lyricist Lorenz Hart came to the rescue, offering her the role of a cynical countess in "I Married an Angel" on Broadway. "He was the only one who really got me out of a rut of playing sweet-faced ingenues and taught me how to play comedy," she told an interviewer in the early 1950's.         Two years later came her breakthrough role, as the hard-boiled Vera Simpson in "Pal Joey." Describing her show-stopping number, "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered," Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote, "In a singularly sweet voice she sings some scabrous lyrics by Lorenz Hart to one of Richard Rodgers' most haunting tunes."         After appearing in the Richard Rodgers revival of "A Connecticut Yankee" (1943) and in "Great to Be Alive!" (1950), she did a reprise of her role in "Pal Joey" in 1952, for which she was named best actress in a musical by the New York Drama Critics.         On television she appeared in "Studio One" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents."         Her first marriage, to Robert D. Ames, an actor, ended in divorce. In 1950, she married Hubbell Robinson Jr., a vice president of CBS. He died in 1974.         She is survived by a sister, Louise Paget Kowalski of Los Angeles.       
         Katrina Haslip, a former New York State prison inmate who became an advocate for increased governmental and private support for women with AIDS, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 33 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Haslip died of complications from AIDS, said Theresa McGovern, director of the H.I.V. Law Project of the AIDS Service Center of Lower Manhattan.         Ms. Haslip was a native of Niagara Falls, N.Y. Her H.I.V. was diagnosed while she was in the Bedford Hills Correctional Center in the late 1980's after she was convicted of picking pockets. She founded two organizations, ACE, for AIDS Counseling and Education Program, and, after her release in 1990, its sister program, ACE-OUT, to help women with AIDS in and out of prison do more for themselves.         She also joined with other AIDS organizations, including Life Force, a Brooklyn-based program, the Brooklyn Task Force on AIDS, and the Upper Manhattan Task Force on AIDS, which worked to press the Federal Government to expand its efforts to fight AIDS among women.         Because of her efforts, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month announced plans to expand its definition of the disease to include more illnesses that affect women with AIDS.       
         Marie McCarthy, who for many years designed the Larry Aldrich fashion collection, died on Tuesday at the Windermere Nursing Home in Virginia Beach, Va., at the age of 86.         She entered the home in 1989 because of severe osteoporosis, and her condition had deteriorated, said her daughter, Polly Gillespie.         Miss McCarthy, who was born in Cambridge, Mass., and attended Radcliffe College, started her career as a buyer for Filene's, the Boston department store. In New York in 1939, she became the designer for Larry Aldrich, a Seventh Avenue manufacturer known for simple, tasteful women's clothing.         She became a partner in the early 1970's and continued to design the line until the company closed in 1975.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Agnes Nessen, of Lincoln, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Helen Callaghan Candaele St. Aubin, the speedy outfielder whose swing won one batting title and inspired two movies about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, died Tuesday night at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., at age 69. She died of breast cancer, according to her son Kelly Candaele, whose 1988 documentary about his mother's career, "A League of Their Own," inspired last summer's movie of the same name.         During her four seasons in the women's league that was formed in 1943 as a wartime alternative to the talent-depleted men's league, Mrs. St. Aubin, who played under her original name, Helen Callaghan, batted .257 and stole 354 bases in 388 games.         Mrs. St. Aubin was a native of Vancouver, British Columbia, who had been recruited at a Canadian softball tournament. Accompanied by her sister, Margie, who was sent by their father to keep an eye on her, she broke in with the expansion Minneapolis Millerettes in 1944 and was an immediate star. She stole 112 bases in 111 games, and her .287 batting average was the league's second highest.         In 1945, when the team moved to Indiana and became the Fort Wayne Daisies, Mrs. St. Aubin, a left-handed batter, led the league with a .299 average and in extra-base hits (24), doubles (17) and home runs (3).         She became ill in 1946 and sat out the 1947 season before returning for part of the 1948 season, her last, and she was never again as sharp at the plate. But she stole 114 bases in 111 games in 1946.         Her former teammate Dottie Collins recalled yesterday how deceptive her appearance was on the field.         "When she was playing -- running or throwing -- she looked so dainty, that's the only word for it," said Mrs. Collins, who recalled the 5-foot-1 1/4-inch, 115-pound outfielder as a "tiny" woman who was "strong."         According to Mrs. Collins, the treasurer of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association, Mrs. St. Aubin's stance and swing are almost perfectly preserved in her son Casey Candaele, a switch-hitting infielder for the Houston Astros.         She married Bobby Candaele during her career and gave birth to the first of their five sons before the 1948 season. They settled in Lompoc, Calif., where she became a cleaning staff supervisor at a local hospital. She and Mr. Candaele were eventually divorced, and she later married Ronald J. St. Aubin.         The documentary Kelly Candaele and his friend Kim Wilson made in 1988 led directly to the movie starring Geena Davis and directed by Penny Marshall.         In addition to her husband, her sister, who is now Margaret Maxwell of Vancouver, and her sons Kelly and Casey, Mrs. St. Aubin is survived by a brother, Lou; two other sisters, Pearl McInnis and Kay Morrison; three other sons, Ricky, the former head football coach at the University of California at Santa Barbara; Rocky, a telephone company employee, and Kelly's twin brother, Kerry, a Richard Hofstadter fellow in history at Columbia University, plus three grandchildren.
