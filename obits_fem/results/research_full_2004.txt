         Dr. Harriet B. Braiker, a clinical psychologist and self-help author whose books touched on identity, resolving stress and the grief occasioned by the World Trade Center attacks, died on Jan. 10 at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. She was 55.         The cause was respiratory failure after pneumonia, said her husband, Steven Fink.         One of her books, ''The Type E Woman,'' published in 1986, described the stresses of balancing a career and family. Dr. Braiker's literary agent, Alice Martel, said the ''E'' represented the woman who tried to be ''everything to everybody.'' The book was a response to research into the Type A personality so often associated with hard-driving men. It was Dr. Braiker's favorite through the years, Mr. Fink said.         In another book, ''The Disease to Please,'' she described a destructive propensity that drives people, usually women, to serve others to the detriment of their own well-being.         In the introduction to ''The September 11 Syndrome,'' published four months after the 2001 attacks, she described the premise of the book as helping readers turn ''our collective emotional adversity'' into their own psychological victories. The book prescribed steps to control feelings of helplessness and anxiety awakened by terrorism.         Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who met Dr. Braiker in graduate school, said she ''brought an extremely strong theoretical background to popular writing.''         ''Her books took problems that were common and subliminal and put them out in the open,'' Dr. Jamison said.         Harriet Beryl Braiker was born in Los Angeles. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and won a National Science Foundation research scholarship. In 1975, she received a doctorate in clinical and social psychology from U.C.L.A.         Before establishing a private practice in 1980, Dr. Braiker worked at the RAND Corporation, analyzing health policies for the federal government. She later became a contributing editor for Working Woman and a columnist for Lear's magazine. She also appeared on television and radio talk shows and was an expert witness in legal cases on sexual harassment.         Although her earliest works examined alcoholism, depression and destructive relationships, her most recent book, ''Who's Pulling Your Strings?'' (2003), was a study of manipulation.         In addition to her husband, surviving are their daughter, Amanda Fink, also of Pasadena; a stepson, Stuart, of New York; and a brother, Dr. Barry Braiker of Beverly Hills, Calif.       
         Dr. Gertie F. Marx, a New York anesthesiologist who helped advance the use of modern epidural injections that ease women's pain during childbirth, died on Sunday at the Schervier Nursing Care Center in the Bronx, according to Dr. Jill M. Rabin, a friend and colleague. Dr. Marx was 91.         At a time when anesthesia was reserved for complicated deliveries and Caesarean sections, Dr. Marx became an early and vigorous advocate of what became known as the epidural and helped show that it was safe and effective. The procedure places a catheter next to a patient's spine, allowing a sedative to block the sensation of pain without paralyzing the birth canal.         Dr. Marx worked at Beth Israel Hospital for more than a decade before joining the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in 1955. For the next four decades, she continued her clinical practice and research at Einstein. She developed an epidural needle that bears her name and became the founding editor of Obstetric Anesthesia Digest, the original publication in the field.         Before Dr. Marx, a doctor might or might not have given sedation or pain relief in childbirth, said Dr. Paul L. Goldiner, chairman of the anesthesiology department at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan. ''She single-handedly pushed the development of obstetric anesthesiology as a specialty.''         Gertie Florentine Marx was born in Frankfurt and left Germany in the 1930's, after the Nazi government began to deny Jews entrance to universities. She received her medical degree from the University of Bern, in Switzerland, in 1937, before immigrating to the United States.         Dr. Marx later married Eric Reiss, a radiological technician whom she had met in Germany, said Dr. Goldiner. Mr. Reiss died in the 1960's, and the couple had no children.         In 1993, Dr. Marx was awarded a College Medal from the Royal College of Anaesthetists, in a presentation made by Queen Elizabeth II. She was a fellow of the American College of Anesthesiologists and an associate fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. She received a distinguished service award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists.         Dr. Marx became a professor emerita at Einstein in 1995, and spent most of her time at home in Southbury, Conn., before recently moving to an assisted-living facility there.         She is survived by a cousin, Dr. Ronald Simon of New York, and by her close friend and former student, Dr. Rabin, also of New York.       
         Elizabeth Kenowsky Fisher, who with her husband, Zachary Fisher, helped bring the aircraft carrier Intrepid to its Hudson River berth as a floating museum, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Her death was announced yesterday by the Intrepid Foundation, which was founded by the Fishers and administers the annual Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Award for Patriotism. Mrs. Fisher had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease since 1990, the foundation said. Mr. Fisher died in 1999.         For many years, Mrs. Fisher was deeply involved in charitable work alongside her husband, a leading New York builder, especially to benefit the country's military, its veterans and their families.         Elizabeth Fisher, born in Allegheny County, Pa., was a Ziegfeld girl and served overseas with the United Service Organizations in World War II, helping entertain the troops, visiting the wounded in field hospitals and volunteering for the Veterans Bedside Network.         More recently, the Fishers provided financial support for families of military personnel lost in the line of duty. They started with the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 and kept the effort alive through the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund. They began the Fisher House Foundation in 1990 to build ''homes away from home'' for families of hospitalized members of the military and the Fisher Armed Forces Scholarship Foundation to help active and former military personnel and their families.         The Fishers also gave money to the United States Naval Academy, and in the 1970's they led the campaign to refurbish the Intrepid and turn it into a floating museum, contributing millions of dollars to the effort. The Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum is berthed at Pier 86, at 12th Avenue and 46th Street.         Four years after Mrs. Fisher's Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed, the Fisher Medical Foundation joined David Rockefeller in providing $5 million for the Zachary and Elizabeth M. Fisher Center for Research on Alzheimer's Disease at Rockefeller University.         Mrs. Fisher is survived by a son, William Crovello of Manhattan.       
         M. M. Kaye, the British writer and illustrator, who wrote ''The Far Pavilions,'' a luxuriant evocation of her upbringing in the India of the British Raj, died last Thursday. She was 95 and lived in Suffolk, England.         Her death was announced Tuesday by her New York agents, Harold Ober Associates.         Mary Margaret Kaye -- or Mrs. Hamilton, as she was also known -- started a moderately successful writing career in the late 1930's. She had filled a medium-size bookshelf with children's books, novels and mysteries before she published her blockbuster of a historical romance in 1978.         ''The Far Pavilions,'' published in the United States by St. Martin's Press, was an immediate best seller. Set at the zenith of Britain's Indian Empire and covering a period from roughly 1885 to 1920, it led to a television mini-series in 1984, sold millions of copies around the world and remains in print, as do a dozen of her other books.         Using her nickname Mollie Kaye, she wrote stories for younger readers, like her ''Potter Pinner'' series (1937-41), and ''Black Bramble Wood'' (1938). Some of her other books were ascribed to Mollie Hamilton.         She had written two earlier historical romances of lesser renown, ''Shadow of the Moon'' (1956) and ''Trade Wind'' (1963). The first dramatized events of the Indian Mutiny of 1857 as witnessed by an orphaned Anglo-Spanish heiress sent to India to marry. ''Trade Wind,'' set in Zanzibar, similarly tells a story of conflicting cultures.         ''Far Pavilions,'' nearly 1,000 pages long, was written over about 16 years and relived a world of the viceroys and maharajahs that its author knew well. She was born in Simla, summer residence of the British viceroy. Her father, Sir Cecil Kaye, was titular head of an Indian state, Rajputana. Her husband, Maj. Gen. Goff Hamilton, served with Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides, as had his father.         She started the book in 1964, but it had barely reached three chapters, when a diagnosis of cancer stopped her. She picked it up four years later, upon her husband's retirement, and kept writing and doing the research for it in England while fighting her illness.         The result has been compared by some to the Civil War epic ''Gone With the Wind.'' She said she ''just let the book take over and write itself.'' It surprised her, she said, when Thomas McCormack, president of St. Martin's Press, acquired the manuscript without cuts.         Her other work thrived as well, thanks to the fame of ''The Far Pavilions.'' She had written many detective and mystery novels, beginning with ''Death Walked in Kashmir'' (1953) and continuing into the mid-1990's. The settings of the books shifted with her husband's postings, from Berlin to Cyprus to Kenya. They, too, remain in print.         In ''The Far Pavilions,'' passions, intrigue and narrow escapes involve concubines, dashing heroes and princesses. Its television adaptation, presented in installments, starred Ben Cross and Amy Irving and featured Omar Sharif, Christopher Lee and John Gielgud.         Miss Kaye edited several volumes of poetry by Rudyard Kipling and wrote an autobiographical trilogy, ''The Sun in the Morning: My Early Years in India and England'' (St. Martin's, 1990), ''Golden Afternoon'' (St. Martin's, 1998), and ''Enchanted Evening'' (Viking, 1999). All remain in print.         General Hamilton died in 1985. They had two daughters, Carolyn and Nicky, who survive, according to The Telegraph of London, as does a stepdaughter. Speaking of pseudonyms as a writer's alter egos, Miss Kaye told Herbert Mitgang of The New York Times in 1978, ''If you're writing about rabbits, readers might not take you seriously with a large historical romance under the same name.''       
         Joan Richman, a retired executive at CBS News who oversaw the network's early coverage of the Apollo space program with Walter Cronkite, died on Friday at her home in Lumberville, Pa. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, Kyle Good, a family friend, said.         A native of St. Louis, Ms. Richman graduated from Wellesley College in 1961.         She was hired the same year to clip newspapers in the research library of CBS News. By 1965, she was a researcher in the special events unit, and in 1968, she became a full producer. She went on to win two Emmy awards for producing Mr. Cronkite's space coverage, one in 1971 for the Apollo 13 and 14 missions, and another, in 1972, for the Apollo 15 mission.         In a statement released by Ms. Richman's family, Mr. Cronkite said that she ''was probably more important than any other individual in shaping the presentation of a new science that gripped the world's imagination.''         From 1973 to 1975, Ms. Richman worked as senior producer for ''The Reasoner Report'' for ABC News, before returning to CBS.         Ms. Richman became executive producer of the weekend editions of the CBS Evening News in 1976, while also producing special events coverage, including the election-night specials in 1976, 1978 and 1980.         In 1981, she was promoted to vice president and director for special events at CBS News, overseeing special coverage of breaking news.         She built her career at CBS News during a time when it was rare for a woman to be a senior media executive. ''It's difficult for the many women thriving in broadcast journalism today to imagine the battles Joan Richman fought and won on their behalf,'' said Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, in the statement from the family.         She retired in 1989 to teach at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.         She is survived by her sister, Judith R. Saidel of Albany; two nephews, Andrew, of Gaithersburg, Md., and Jonathan, of Albany; a niece, Lisa Saidel, also of Albany; and three grandnieces.       
         Mildred Jeffrey, who for seven decades was an influential behind-the-scenes combatant in the women's, labor and civil rights movements, died on March 24 in Detroit. She was 93.         Her death was announced by the United Automobile Workers union, where she was the first woman to head a department, becoming director of its Women's Bureau in 1944. She was a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus and was the unofficial head of a group of women who helped persuade Walter F. Mondale to name Geraldine A. Ferraro as his running mate on the 1984 Democratic ticket.         As a student at the University of Minnesota in the early 1930's, she and an African-American classmate helped integrate restaurants in Minneapolis. Decades later, she marched in the South with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.         In 2000, President Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.         Mildred McWilliams, known as Millie, was born on Dec. 29, 1910, in Alton, Iowa, the eldest of seven children. Her grandmother, a widow, ran a farm and raised 16 children by herself. Her mother, who was the first woman to become a registered pharmacist in Iowa, in 1908, raised seven children on her own after her husband left the family.         In 1932, Ms. Jeffrey received a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Minnesota, where she immersed herself in the socialist and progressive movements. In 1934, she received a master's degree in social economy and social research from Bryn Mawr.         With the passage of laws promoting labor unions, she became an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in Philadelphia and later the education director of the Pennsylvania Joint Board of Shirt Workers.         In 1936, she married another Amalgamated organizer, Homer Newman Jeffrey. They organized workers in the South and the East, taking mill jobs and rushing to unionize factories before management fired them for their activism. They divorced in the late 1950's.         During World War II, they moved to Washington and became consultants to the War Labor Board. There, they became close to Walter and Victor Reuther, the U.A.W. leaders.         In 1944, she moved to Detroit when the Reuthers offered her the job as head of the union's new Women's Bureau. She organized the U.A.W.'s first women's conference when a flood of returning veterans resulted in the large-scale postwar layoffs of women from factory jobs.         From 1949 to 1954 she ran the union's radio station. She also became director of its community relations department, aligning the union behind many civil rights efforts, and from 1968 to 1976, the year she retired, she headed the union's consumer affairs department.         Throughout her years at the union, she was active organizing, canvassing and raising money for the Democratic Party and civil rights efforts.         After helping create the National Women's Political Caucus in 1971, she became a leader on the Democratic Party committee that ensured that half the delegates to its 1980 convention were women. She helped propel the careers of many women in politics, including the governor of Michigan, Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat.         Patricia Schroeder, a former United States representative from Colorado, said, ''Millie is the political godmother for many of us.''         Ms. Jeffrey ran for only one office, when she was elected in Michigan to the board of governors of Wayne State University in Detroit. She served on the board for 16 years, including three years as its chairwoman.         She played a major role in many groups, including the Coalition of Labor Union Women, Emily's List, Americans for Democratic Action, the National Abortion Rights League and the American Civil Liberties Union.         She is survived by a daughter, Sharon Lehrer of San Rafael, Calif.; a son, Balfour, of Missoula, Mont.; three sisters, Arlene Swain of St. Paul, Dorothy Shabel of St. Louis and Marjorie Lapic of Seattle; and two grandchildren.         Three years ago, Ms. Jeffrey told a University of Minnesota magazine: ''My underlying goal was always to empower women. Get them to learn their rights, and to exercise them!''       
         Eileen Darby Lester, a photographer who helped immortalize theatrical productions, taking pictures of more than 500 Broadway shows and photographing stars like Olivier, Dietrich and Brando, died on March 30 at a nursing home in Long Beach, N.Y. She was 87.         Her death followed a fall in front of her house in Point Lookout, N.Y., in November from which she never recovered, said Mary Henderson, who is writing a book about her.         Mrs. Lester, whose photographic credits used her maiden name, Darby, recorded images that have helped define the memory of some great productions. These include the picture of a terrified Blanche DuBois, played by Jessica Tandy, at the feet of a menacing Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando) in Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire.''         Her photograph of the original production of Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman,'' showing Jo Mielziner's entire set, was widely published.         Among the stars she photographed were Tallulah Bankhead, the Lunts, Helen Hayes, Gregory Peck, Katharine Hepburn and Paul Robeson. Other assignments included shooting Mayor Fiorello La Guardia at Yankee Stadium, Leonard Bernstein and President John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline.         Eileen Darby was born in Portland, Ore., on May 12, 1916. Her father was an engineer who worked for the federal government and liked to photograph the dams and other large projects on which he worked. He taught his daughter photography and helped her set up her own darkroom, Dr. Henderson said.         Mrs. Lester studied biology at Marylhurst University near Portland, but left college at 20 to pursue photography in Manhattan.         She got a job with Pix, a Manhattan photo agency founded by Alfred Eisenstaedt. There she developed particular expertise at processing photographs and a reputation for going beyond what was necessary to make her subjects feel comfortable, Dr. Henderson said. She once turned down a chance to shoot Ingrid Bergman, whom she greatly admired, for fear of giving her a cold that she had.         In 1941 she left Pix and joined a few friends to form Graphic House, a photo agency. Many professional photographers dropped off their film there for processing, and she got to know them. Through a Life magazine photographer, she met Roy Lester, who eventually took over management of the agency and whom she married in 1944.         It was for Graphic House that many of her most notable pictures were taken. They were sold to many prominent publications.         Mr. Lester died in 1976. Mrs. Lester is survived by a daughter, Virginia Teslik of West Hills, Calif.; her sons Roy Jr., of Long Beach; John, of Mountain Lakes, N.J.; and Patric of St. Louis and San Diego; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Lester stopped taking theatrical pictures after her husband died, Dr. Henderson said, because she felt dispirited about Broadway's new directions after the musical ''Hair'' opened in 1968.         Correction:  May 18, 2004, Tuesday  An obituary on April 13 about Eileen Darby, a photographer of Broadway productions, misstated Alfred Eisenstaedt's role at Pix, a photo agency where she worked. He was an early photographer there, not the founder. The agency was founded by Leon Daniels. A reader pointed out the error by email on the day of publication. This correction was delayed for research into conflicting accounts of the agency's early days; some described Eisenstaedt as a co-founder.       
         Rita R. Fraad, a collector and patron of American art, died on Sunday at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 88.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her daughter Sara F. Henderson.         Starting in the late 1940's, Mrs. Fraad assembled a noted private collection of 19th- and 20th-century American art, from which she lent and donated to museums and galleries. Among her principal beneficiaries was her alma mater, Smith College, with its nationally respected art museum.         Others included the Brooklyn Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she sat on the visiting committee on American art and sculpture.         She was also a trustee of the Archives of American Art, a part of the Smithsonian Institution that promotes research in the visual arts and amasses artists' papers and other memorabilia.         Rita Rich Fraad, a lawyer's daughter, was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from Smith College in 1937, a year before her marriage to Daniel Fraad Jr. Mr. Fraad had just joined the Allied Maintenance Corporation, a modest building service founded by his father in 1888.         While her husband built Allied Maintenance -- later Ogden Allied Maintenance -- into one of the country's leading fuel suppliers to airlines, Mrs. Fraad saw to their private art collection. It brought together works by Homer, Eakins, Sargent, Prendergast, Hassam, Bellows and Hopper, among others.         In her later years she focused on contemporary American works on paper and regularly gave them to the Smith College museum, either drawing works from her collection or buying them for the museum.         Mrs. Fraad was a member of the museum's visiting committee, an advisory panel, until last year. She established an endowment fund for American art at the Smith museum, where a sampling of her collection, called ''Realism Today,'' was exhibited in 1988.         Her husband died in 1987. Mrs. Fraad is survived by Ms. Henderson and another daughter, Dr. Martha F. Haffey, both of Manhattan; a sister, Janet Bradley of Tulsa; six grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Sandra Helen Payson, a socially prominent patron of the arts, died on July 15 in Manhattan, where she was visiting. A former New Yorker, she was 78 and lived in Washington and Delaplane, Va.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Payson was the founder and president of the Beard's Fund, through which she supported groups in the performing arts and individual artists. She also sponsored fellowships for aspiring artists.         The daughter of Charles Shipman Payson, an industrialist, and Joan Whitney Payson, founder of the New York Mets baseball team, she grew up in Manhasset, N.Y., where she founded the Manhasset Stable for thoroughbred racing, which she later moved to Delaplane.         She was a board member of the Lincoln Center Institute for Arts in Education, the Whitney Museum, the Madeira School and the Research Center at the New York Public Library. She also was active in the Women's Leadership Forum of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.         Her two marriages, to William Blair Meyer and George (later Lord) Weidenfeld of London, ended in divorce.         Ms. Payson is survived by a son, William Blair Meyer Jr. of Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla.; two daughters, Joan Curci Meyer of London and Porto Ercole, Italy, and Averil Payson Meyer of New York City and Katonah, N.Y.; two sisters, Payne Whitney Middleton of Manhattan, and Lorinda Payson deRoulet of Manhasset; a brother, John Whitney Payson of Jupiter Island, Fla.; and eight grandchildren.       
         Ellen Auerbach, a photographer best known for innovative portraits and advertising images made during the Weimar Republic in Germany in the early 1930's, died on Friday at New York Weill Cornell Center , according to a friend, the artist Christine Graf. She was 98 and lived in Manhattan.         While in her twenties, together with her colleague and friend Grete Stern, the then Ellen Rosenberg formed a commercial photography studio in Berlin named Ringl & Pit. It was during the days of the liberal Weimar Republic, and they were intent on cracking what had been the male-dominated field of photography.         From 1929 to 1933 the two women collaboratively produced advertising, still lifes and studio portraits that reflected the energetic, experimental style of their mentor, Walter Peterhans, a professional photographer who taught at the legendary Bauhaus design school. Their pictures were part of a wave of innovation in European design and photography that today is referred to as the New Vision, and that temporarily erased distinctions between commercial and artistic motives in photography.         The partnership of Mrs. Auerbach and Ms. Stern produced offbeat, often humorous photographs, frequently of women, which were influenced by both Constructivism and Surrealism. One of their best-known advertising pictures, for a hair product called Pétrole Hahn, shows a lifelike female mannequin holding a bottle of lotion; only on close inspection is it clear that the hand in question belongs to a real woman. In their portraiture, they sometimes depicted their sitters with eyes closed or half shut, as if dreaming. In addition, they experimented with mirrors and with unusual camera angles in an attempt to disrupt familiar perspectives.         Relatively little of Ringl & Pit's work has survived, but it was reproduced and exhibited widely at the time it was made. In 1933, Mrs. Auerbach and Ms. Stern received first prize at an international exhibition in Brussels for ''Komol,'' an advertising still life constructed like a collage out of layers of paper, wire screen and artificial curls of hair.         Despite their success, the photographers closed their studio the same year, shortly after Hitler came to power. Weimar was finished. Ms. Stern and Mrs. Auerbach, who were both Jews, were among the fortunate few who realized what was happening. (''In a country with concentration camps, you cannot live,'' Mrs. Auerbach remembered, and they quickly left Germany.)         Mrs. Auerbach emigrated to Tel Aviv, London and, in 1937, the United States. Ms. Stern left for London and later Argentina.         Mrs. Auerbach continued her career as a photographer through the 1950's, although she gave up the rigors of the studio for more anecdotal and lyrical forms of documentation. She photographed the artists Fairfield Porter and Willem de Kooning with a casual directness in 1944, and in the mid-1950's accompanied Eliot Porter on a trip to photograph Mexican churches. But her interests were increasingly focused on children and the psychology of childhood development. In 1965 she began working as an educational therapist at the Educational Institute for Learning and Research in New York, where for 19 years she taught children with learning disabilities.         Ellen Auerbach was born Ellen Rosenberg in Karlsruhe, Germany, on May 20, 1906. After high school she decided to become an artist and studied sculpture for three years at an art school in Karlsruhe and, in 1928, at the Academy of Art in Stuttgart. While studying there her uncle gave her a camera, and it led her to abandon sculpture for photography, primarily because she thought she might earn a living. She sought out Walter Peterhans in Berlin, where he maintained a successful commercial studio, and asked to be his student. He agreed, and for these lessons Mrs. Auerbach was joined by another private student, Grete Stern.         The two young women quickly became fast friends. When Mr. Peterhans decided to shut down his Berlin studio and move to Dessau, they arranged to take over the premises and to operate as Ringl & Pit. According to the photographers, the studio name was simply a combination of their childhood nicknames: Grete Stern was called Ringl and Ellen Rosenberg was called Pit. But in addition, the name had the advantage of being ambiguous in terms of gender and ethnicity.         When the rise of Hitler forced the women to dissolve their partnership in 1933, Ms. Stern moved to London and opened a studio there. Mrs. Auerbach and her future husband, Walter Auerbach, a stage designer and photographer, moved to Tel Aviv, then part of Palestine, and opened a studio specializing in portraits of children. The Auerbachs were divorced in 1945. Ms. Stern died in 1999, in Buenos Aires, at age 94. Mrs. Auerbach has no immediate survivors.         Interest in her early work from the Ringl & Pit studio was kindled in this country in the 1980's, when museum curators and private collectors began to research European Modernism of the 1920's and 1930's. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art added two Ringl & Pit prints to its collection in 1983 and in 1987 reproduced them in the book, ''Photography: A Facet of Modernism.''       
         Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the psychiatrist whose pioneering work with terminally ill patients helped to revolutionize attitudes toward the care of the dying, died Tuesday at her home in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 78.         She died after losing consciousness last week, according to her son, Kenneth. She had recently suffered a series of infections. As she neared her own death after debilitating strokes in the late 1990's, Dr. Kübler-Ross appeared to accept it, as she had tried to help so many others to do.         ''I always say that death can be one of the greatest experiences ever,'' she wrote in an autobiography in 1997. ''If you live each day of your life right, then you have nothing to fear.''         Dr. Kübler-Ross was credited with helping end centuries-old taboos in Western culture against openly discussing and studying death. She also helped change the care of many terminally ill patients to make death less psychologically painful, not only for the dying, but also for their doctors and nurses -- and not least for the survivors.         Although the care she sought is by no means universal, she profoundly changed the way the medical profession is asked to look at death. Her greatest influence came through her writings, especially her 1969 best-seller, ''On Death and Dying,'' which remains in print around the world.         She also gave many lectures and distributed tape recordings of them, conducted extensive research into what she described as the five stages of death based on thousands of interviews with patients and health care professionals and did groundbreaking work in counseling dying patients.         She was a powerful intellectual force behind creating a hospice system in the United States through which palliative care and psychological support are provided for many terminally ill people. And she helped to turn thanatology, the study of physical, psychological and social problems associated with dying, into an accepted medical discipline.         ''Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was a true pioneer in raising the awareness among the physician community and the general public about the important issues surrounding death, dying and bereavement,'' Dr. Percy Wooten said when he was president of the American Medical Association in 1998.         Dr. Wooten said her work was part of the basis for the A.M.A.'s efforts to encourage the medical profession to improve care at the end of life.         The A.M.A was one of her early supporters, though many of its members at first vigorously opposed her.         In the later part of her career, she embarked on research to verify the existence of life after death, conducting, with others, thousands of interviews with people who recounted near-death experiences, particularly of those declared clinically dead by medical authorities but later revived.         Her prestige generated widespread interest and devoted followers.         The work aroused deep skepticism in medical and scientific circles. Her assertions that she had evidence of an afterlife saddened many colleagues, some of whom said she had abandoned rigorous science and had, perhaps, succumbed to her own fears of death.         ''For years, I have been stalked by a bad reputation,'' she wrote in her 1997 autobiography, ''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying.'' ''Actually, I have been pursued by people who have regarded me as the Death and Dying Lady. They believe that having spent more than three decades in research into death and life after death qualifies me as an expert on the subject. I think they miss the point. The only incontrovertible fact of my work is the importance of life.''         Whatever scientists think about her views of life after death, they continue to be influenced by her methods of caring for the terminally ill. Before ''On Death and Dying,'' terminally ill patients were routinely left to face death in a miasma of loneliness and fear, because doctors, nurses and families were generally ill equipped to deal with death.         Dr. Kübler-Ross changed that for many, though by no means for all, dying people. By the 1980's, the study of dying became part of medical and health-care education in United States. ''Death and Dying'' became an indispensable manual, both for professionals and family members.         Weighing barely two pounds at birth, Elisabeth Kübler was the first of triplets born to Ernst and Emma Villiger Kübler on July 8, 1926, in Zurich.         By the sixth grade, she wanted to be a doctor. But her father angrily opposed the plan, telling her she could resign herself to being his secretary in the office supply business that he managed or spend the rest of her life as a maid.         ''That's all right with me,'' she said she replied.         After her schooling, she volunteered at the largest hospital in Zurich to help refugees from Nazi Germany. When World War II ended, she hitchhiked through nine war-shattered countries, helping open first-aid posts. In Poland, her visit to the Maidanek death camp narrowed her professional goal. She would become a psychiatrist to help people deal with death.         She received her medical degree from the University of Zurich in 1957. Within a year, she moved to the United States; married Dr. Emanuel K. Ross, an American neuropathologist she had met at the university; began her internship at Community Hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y.; and become a research fellow at Manhattan State Hospital.         At the hospital, she was appalled by what she called the routine neglect and abuse of dying patients. After badgering her supervisors, she was allowed to develop programs under which to give the patients individual care and counseling.         In 1962, she became a teaching fellow at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. A small, outwardly shy woman who spoke with a heavy German accent, she was nervous when asked to fill in for a popular professor and master lecturer. At first, she was ignored.         But the hall became noticeably quieter when she brought out a 16-year-old patient who was dying of leukemia and asked the students to interview her. Now it was they who seemed nervous.         When Dr. Kübler-Ross prodded the students, they asked the patient about blood tests, chemotherapy and other clinical questions. Finally, the teenager exploded in anger and began posing her own questions.         What was it like not to be able to dream about the high-school prom? Or going on a date? Or growing up? ''Why won't people tell you the truth?'' she demanded.         When the lecture ended, many students had been moved to tears.         ''Now you're acting like human beings, instead of scientists,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross said.         Her lectures began to draw standing-room-only audiences of medical and theology students, members of the clergy and social workers -- but few doctors.         In 1965, Dr. Kübler-Ross became an assistant professor in psychiatry at the University of Chicago Medical School, where a group of theology students approached her for help in studying death. She suggested a series of conversations with dying patients, who would teach the professionals.         At first, staff doctors objected to the program, arguing that patients should be shielded from thoughts of death. Avoiding the subject entirely, particularly when treating the young, physicians and therapists would meet a dying child's questions with comments like, ''Take your medicine, and you'll get well,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross wrote in ''On Death and Dying,'' which incorporated her account of the Chicago seminars.         She said that children instinctively knew that the answers they received about their prognoses were lies and that the deceit made them feel punished and alone. With an associate, the Rev. Carl Nighswonger, she interviewed dying patients at Billings Memorial, the university's teaching hospital, while the theology students observed from a one-way glass. The terminally ill were eager to talk.         To bring public pressure to change hospital standards, she agreed to a request by Life magazine in 1965 to interview a seminar patient, Eva, who said that her doctors had treated her arrogantly. The Life article angered the hospital administrators, who said the hospital wanted to be famous not for its dying patients, but rather for those it saved. Doctors were ordered not to cooperate further, and the lecture hall for her next seminar was empty.         But the hospital switchboard was overwhelmed with calls in reaction to the article; mail piled up, and Dr. Kübler-Ross was invited to speak at other colleges and universities.         As for Eva, Dr. Kübler-Ross recounted, she ended up dying cold and alone. Gradually, the medical profession moved toward accepting new approaches to treating the terminally ill, although living wills and patient care directives do not always prevent patients from being subjected to neglect or to invasive medical care at the end of life.         From her patient interviews, Dr. Kübler-Ross identified the five now famous stages that many patients go through in confronting their deaths. Often, denial is the first stage. As his condition worsens and denial is impossible, the patient displays anger, the ''Why me?'' stage.         That followed by a bargaining period. ''Yes, I'm going to die, but if I diet and exercise can I do it later?'' When the patient sees that bargaining will not work, depression often sets in.         The final stage is acceptance, a period in which the patient is ready to let go.         Not all dying patients follow the same progression, Dr. Kübler-Ross said, but most experience two or more stages. Moreover, she found, people who are experiencing traumatic life changes like divorces often experience similar stages. Another conclusion she reached was that the acceptance of death came most easily for people who could look back and feel that they had not wasted their lives.         Among the patients whom she interviewed in the late 60's was a woman, Mrs. Schwartz, who had been pronounced dead but hours later was found by a nurse to be alive. Dr. Kübler-Ross said Mrs. Schwartz was able to repeat conversations of others that occurred around her when she was clinically dead, including a joke told by a doctor. Doctors and medical students called the episode a hallucination, but Dr. Kübler-Ross thought it merited further investigation, and she began to an effort to verify existence after death.         At a psychiatric workshop, she was quoted as saying: ''I know for a fact that there is life after death,'' and promptly received a barrage of criticism from scientists. The disapproval, plus what she called institutional politics, caused her to leave hospital work in 1973.         By then, she was receiving requests from around the world to give seminars on death and dying, and she began to speak at workshops for the dying about what she called ''life after life,'' a happy condition in which physical pain and mental anguish are absent.         She and associates talked to thousands of patients like Mrs. Schwartz and said they found common strains in the interviews. Patients reported that their experiences after clinical death were remarkably free of pain; that they were aware of precisely where they were at death and of seeming to float out of their bodies; that they seemed not to be suddenly alone but still with family members or friends; that they felt as if they were guided to a place of psychic energy, light, love and warmth greater than any they knew in life; and that they did not want to return.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross became increasingly interested in spiritual phenomena, she sought her own out-of-body experience. Robert Monroe, an engineer from Virginia who wrote ''Journeys Out of the Body,'' invited her -- at a time when, as it turned out, she was seriously ill with a bowel obstruction -- to participate in experiments with a group of physicians, psychiatrists from the Menninger Foundation and engineers. She lay on a waterbed in a small laboratory, connected with polygraphs and earphones through which she heard tapes of waves, as she was instructed on how to relax.         ''I was on the ceiling,'' she recounted. ''I was so excited that you couldn't believe it. It was really the highlight of my life.''         She repeated the experiment, and she said her illness disappeared.         In her lectures, she began describing more of her out-of-body experiences, some of which she said were at first terrifying but ultimately uplifting. She also talked of encountering spirit guides, including Mrs. Schwartz, who, she said, appeared 10 months after her death and told Dr. Kübler-Ross to continue her work, promising, ''We will help you.''         In the late 70's, Dr. Kübler-Ross built a center on 42 acres in the hills of Escondido, Calif., where she and others could ''expound theories of survival of the spirit after death in the form of a living entity.''         When skeptics challenged her accounts of spirit guides, she said people in the modern age had difficulty accepting them, because they ''are no longer in touch with their own spirituality.''         In 1976, she fell under the sway of Jay Barham, a former Arkansas sharecropper who had founded the Church of the Facet of Divinity and said he was able to channel spirits and communicate with them. Dr. Kübler-Ross talked about setting up a worldwide network of franchised centers with him and his wife to counsel on the problems of dying and living. His program was investigated by the San Diego district attorney's office because of accusations of sexual misbehavior. She severed ties with him, and years later acknowledged that she had been mistaken about him and that he had deceived many people.         Dr. Kübler-Ross's reputation was seriously damaged, and her credibility waned. Moreover, her channeling sessions, combined with a heavy travel schedule, contributed to the breakup of her marriage, and her husband left her in 1979.         Her center in California burned, and the police suspected arson. In 1984, she set up another center, in Virginia, to care for children with AIDS. That center also burned, in 1994, and again arson was suspected. After the second fire, she moved to Scottsdale to be near her son, Kenneth, a freelance photographer.         That year, when Dr. Ross was dying, he moved to a condo in Scottsdale near Dr. Kübler-Ross, and she and Kenneth cared for him. Dr. Kübler-Ross is also survived by a daughter, Barbara Ross Rothweiler, a clinical psychologist, of Wausau, Wis.; and one of her triplet sisters, Eva, of Basel, Switzerland; and two granddaughters.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross's health failed in the late 90's, she acknowledged that she was in pain and ready for her life to end. But she said: ''I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no death the way we understood it. The body dies, but not the soul.''       
         Julia Child, who turned the art of French cooking into prime-time television entertainment and brought cassoulet to a casserole culture in the two volumes of her monumental ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' died yesterday at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif., two days before her 92nd birthday.         The cause was complications of kidney failure, said a niece, Philadelphia Cousins.         Mrs. Child was a towering figure on the culinary front for more than 40 years. Most Americans knew her as the imperturbable host of the long-running PBS television series ''The French Chef.'' She was a tall, exuberant woman who could make lobster bisque look as easy as toast. But she was also respected by food professionals for the clarity and rigor with which she translated French cuisine for an American audience, most impressively in ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' a work that Craig Claiborne, in The New York Times, said ''may be the finest volume on French cooking ever published in English.''         Mrs. Child was not the first dedicated cook to turn cooking into a spectator sport -- James Beard preceded her on television in 1945, Dione Lucas in 1948 -- but she brought a fresh, breezy approach to daunting material, expressed in her up-the-scales signature signoff, ''Bon appétit!''         ''She demystified French cuisine in a way that had not been done before, in an appealing, straightforward way,'' said Jacques Pépin, who teamed up with Mrs. Child in the cooking series ''Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home.''         A self-confessed ham, she became a darling of audiences and comedians almost from the moment she made her debut on WGBH in Boston in 1963 at the age of 50. On ''Saturday Night Live,'' Dan Aykroyd played her boozily bleeding to death while shrieking, ''Save the liver.'' Jean Stapleton even portrayed her in a musical with sung recipes called ''Bon Appétit!'' in 1989.         ''I fell in love with the public, the public fell in love with me, and I tried to keep it that way,'' Mrs. Child said in an interview last year.         What made Mrs. Child such an influential teacher was her good-humored insistence that competent home cooks, if they followed instructions, would find even complicated French dishes within their grasp. Mistakes were not the end of the world, just part of the game.         In fact, minor slips and mishaps were weekly events on ''The French Chef,'' and none of them seemed to faze Mrs. Child. At the same time, she always put the food before showmanship. She had real respect for recipes, and by example she helped elevate the status of cooking in the United States.         Beginnings of an Outsize Life         Julia Carolyn McWilliams was born Aug. 15, 1912, in Pasadena, Calif. Her father was a wealthy farm consultant and investor; her mother was a housewife with a cook and maid who could make not much more than baking powder biscuits, codfish balls and Welsh rarebit. Julia was the oldest of three siblings, each so tall that their mother boasted that she had ''given birth to 18 feet of children.'' Otherwise, she gave no indication that she would lead an outsize life.         She attended Smith College at a time when ''women could be either nurses or teachers,'' she said, and she had some vague idea of being a novelist or a basketball star. After graduation in 1934 and a stint as a copywriter in between cocktail parties in New York, she returned home. According to her biographer, Noel Riley Fitch, in ''Appetite for Life'' (Doubleday, 1997), her one real job in her hometown, in advertising and public relations, ended when she was fired for insubordination, and rightly so, she always said.         After World War II broke out, she signed up for intelligence work with the Office of Strategic Services, hoping to become a spy, but was sent off as a file clerk to Ceylon. There she met Paul Child, the head of a chart-making division who was 10 years older and several inches shorter. He was also an artist, a poet and a serious food lover who opened up her taste horizons on their travels in China.         They married in 1946 and spent a year in Washington before Mr. Child was sent to Paris by the United States Information Agency. It was a fateful move, because Mrs. Child by then was struggling to learn to cook and her husband was suffering the consequences. French food immediately took her attempts to a higher plane. Out of those early experiments came her core belief: that cooking was an art to be studied, not picked up on the fly.         She threw herself into studies at the Cordon Bleu and later joined the Cercle des Gourmettes, a club where she met Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, two cooking enthusiasts who wanted to write a cookbook for the American market but lacked the English to do it. The three became partners in a cooking school they called L'École de Trois Gourmandes in Paris and set to work on their cookbook, even as Mrs. Child followed her husband to postings in Marseille, Bonn and Oslo. In 1956 the couple took up residence in Cambridge, Mass. They continued to visit Europe frequently, maintaining a home near Grasse, in the south of France.         After nearly a decade, Mrs. Child and her partners produced an 800-page manuscript that Houghton Mifflin, the publisher that had originally contracted for it, rejected as too daunting. Judith Jones at Alfred A. Knopf read a later, more comprehensive version and decided it was the detailed, lucid, approachable French cookbook that she, and all of America, had been waiting for.         ''I was jealous,'' said Mr. Pépin, who met Mrs. Child in 1960 and saw the book in manuscript. ''It was just the kind of book I would have liked to do.''         The introduction showed Mrs. Child at her most direct: ''This is a book for the servantless American cook who can be unconcerned on occasion with budgets, waistlines, time schedules, children's meals, the parent-chauffeur-den mother syndrome or anything else which might interfere with the enjoyment of producing something wonderful to eat.'' The book, she wrote, could well be titled ''French Cooking From the American Supermarket.''         As revolutionary as the book was, it might have only gathered cobwebs in bookstores alongside ''Escoffier's Guide Culinaire'' if not for Mrs. Child's way with a whisk on camera. Invited onto a book show on WGBH to talk about ''Mastering,'' she chose to whip up an omelet, beating the eggs in a giant copper bowl. Russell Morash, who became her producer, recalled the sight: ''I thought to myself: Who is this madwoman cooking an omelet on a book-review program?''         Viewers were so taken with the frenzy of cooking and relaxed chatter that Mrs. Child was hired to put together 26 segments, for $50 apiece. Although its host was American and regarded herself as a cook, the program was called ''The French Chef,'' a title that would fit on one line in TV Guide. When stations in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and then New York picked the series up, it was on its way.         ''I think the secret of her appeal was a combination of joy in what she was doing and a deep desire to teach and to teach well,'' said Geof Drummond, who produced Mrs. Child's cooking programs in the 1990's. ''The food was important to her, and it was important to her that you get it.''         With help from her husband she appeared on a set replicating a home kitchen and cooked the dishes of the week, then served them to herself, complete with wine. ''The French Chef'' became the longest-running program in the history of public television; it was followed by ''Julia Child & Company,'' ''Dinner With Julia'' and other series.         The unlikely star whipped through quenelles and coquilles St. Jacques with the greatest of ease, moving on smoothly even after dropping pots or announcing she was about to put a gratin in the refrigerator instead of in the oven where it belonged. Years later, she explained her insouciance by saying that she had demonstrated those same dishes many times at her school in France, whose logo she wore on her signature blue shirt, and that she had the technique down cold.         All her programs were distilled to what she called fundamental lessons. In browning meat, it was as simple as ''hot oil, dry meat and don't crowd the pan.'' She would cook chicken fricassee and coq au vin side by side to show that they were essentially the same dish, one made with white wine, the other with red. She advised viewers to ''plunge right in'' boning a chicken and to ''have the courage of your convictions'' in flipping a potato pancake. Her fearlessness made great television: she roasted ducks, sautéed sweetbreads and stuffed sausages into casings with grunts of effort. She stayed with WGBH even after her series became a national success because it gave her the freedom to cook tripe, kidneys and other offal that she said would not fly on commercial television.         While Mrs. Child has been credited with inspiring a boom in French restaurants, an explosion of fancy food markets and even the arrival of the Food Network, she insisted her original book and program benefited from ''a concatenation of factors'' in the early 1960's. It was an era when Jacqueline Kennedy was raising awareness of all things French, and travel to France, which used to take a week by boat, was shortened to mere hours by plane. Duncan Hines cake mixes and Jell-O salads may have been far more prevalent than chocolate mousse and vinaigrette, but Americans were ready to embrace French food, at least as it was translated by a charismatic compatriot.         Over the years, Mrs. Child devoted herself to her television series while writing companion cookbooks, ending with ''Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home,'' in collaboration with Mr. Pépin, in 1999. For the first books, she would test her recipes upstairs in the open kitchen in Cambridge, Mass., outfitted with a Garland range, while her husband painted in a studio in the basement. When she called, he would come up to photograph her latest creation to give the illustrator something to draw on.         When she wrote recipes, they were long and detailed because, she said, she felt obligated to ensure their success. ''A cookbook is only as good as its worst recipe,'' she said. All 10 of her cookbooks were held up as models of clarity. She was also adamant that cooking was not like free-form jazz: she intended her recipes to be followed to the letter. Her own tastes ran to rather simple food. Overall, she said, she preferred ''la cuisine soignée: long, caring cooking.''         Asked what her favorite meal was, she might mention duck or leg of lamb but would almost always add, ''I love good, fresh food cooked by someone who knows what he's doing.''         She ignored fads and fashions. ''I remember her telling me, 'I hate grilled vegetables,' when those were all the rage,'' Mr. Pépin said. ''She said, 'They're raw and burnt at the same time.'''         As Mrs. Child aged, her role in more and more programs was to sit by as other cooks did the sautéeing. She also appeared regularly on ''Good Morning America'' on ABC in the 1980's.         Mrs. Child was a breast cancer survivor, a cat lover, a fervent advocate of Planned Parenthood and an unabashed sensualist with a sly sense of humor. One year she and her husband sent out Valentine's cards with a photograph of them together in the bathtub in Paris. One of her last projects was to be a memoir of her years in France.         Mrs. Child's obsession with promoting the culinary arts as a profession led to her becoming the first woman inducted into the Culinary Institute of America's hall of fame. She helped establish the American Institute of Wine and Food and, later, Copia: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts. In 1986, after the death of her friend James Beard, she led the effort to buy his town house in Greenwich Village and convert it into a nonprofit foundation.         Kitchen Goes to Smithsonian         Mrs. Child was always a star, never a spokeswoman. She prided herself on not granting endorsements because she was devoted to public television, and she was not afraid to mock corporate contributors to her advertising-free programs. She once demonstrated how to break off a part on a Cuisinart food processor to make it less cumbersome to use even as the manufacturer's representatives sat in the audience. And she was known to sue to prevent a restaurant from advertising that it was one of her favorites.         In 1966 she became the first PBS personality to win an Emmy Award. She was awarded a George Foster Peabody Award in 1965, the National Book Award for ''Julia Child and More Company'' in 1980 and the Légion d'Honneur from the French government in 2000. When she moved from her longtime home in Cambridge to a retirement center in her home state, California, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington took her famous kitchen: whisks, stockpots and 800 knives. She also contributed her huge cookbook collection to the Schlesinger Library at Harvard.         She was also active in the International Association of Culinary Professionals. For her 90th birthday, 20 restaurants across the country staged dinners in her honor to raise money for the group to conduct culinary research in France.         Paul Child died in 1994 after a long hospitalization. Julia Child is survived by a sister, Dorothy Cousins, of Mill Valley, Calif., and several nieces and nephews.         To the end, Mrs. Child maintained her image as the ultimate bonne vivante, a California girl with easy French tastes. Whenever she was asked what her guilty pleasures were, she responded, ''I don't have any guilt.''         Despite decades of rumors about her suspiciously relaxed condition on the set, though, she always denied a one-bottle-for-me, one-for-the-pot pattern of cooking. Her husband, in fact, often said that one of his earliest duties was dyeing water with beef extract so that it could pass for red wine on black and white television -- the producers could afford real Burgundy only for the stew, not for the star's glass.         Mr. Drummond, her producer, also debunks another myth. Mrs. Child never dropped a chicken or a turkey on ''The French Chef.'' It was a potato pancake that flew onto the work table when she tried to flip it. She put it back in the pan, pressed it back into shape and said, ''Remember, you are alone in the kitchen, and no one can see you.''         She always refused to speak evil of fast food but admitted she could live without Mexican cuisine, and she never quite saw the point of Italian food. ''I don't think it's a real cuisine because you don't do much,'' she said in an interview last year.         ''I still feel that French cooking is the most important in the world, one of the few that has rules. If you follow the rules, you can do pretty well.''       
         Hildy Parks Cohen, the producer, writer and actress known as Hildy Parks who wrote the first 20 Tony Awards telecasts as well as 20 other television specials, including the Emmy Awards, died on Thursday at the Actors Fund Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 78.         The cause was complications of a recent stroke, said her son Christopher Cohen.         Ms. Parks was a partner with her husband, Alexander H. Cohen, one of the last old-time independent theatrical producers, with 101 Broadway and West End shows to his name. He died in 2000. Together, from 1967 to 1986, Mr. Cohen usually produced the Tonys, and Ms. Parks wrote them.         As a result of the couple's ministrations, the Tony shows were frequently held up as a model of what other award shows, like the Oscars, ought to be: fast-paced, lively and topical.         Mr. Cohen said his mother ''was the intellect, and Dad was the bravado'' in their Tony work. Political events always made their way into the presentations. Ms. Parks's own views were very much those of a liberal Democrat, and she went so far as to give up limousines for bicycles, cheerfully waving to her husband as he went by in his big black car.         Ms. Parks won two Emmy Awards: one in 1980 for producing the 34th annual Tony Awards and one for producing ''The Night of 100 Stars'' in 1982.         In a 1982 article in The New York Times, Carol Lawson described how Ms. Parks worked hard behind the scenes at the Tony Awards:         ''As the one who warms up the live audience with good-natured barbs at the theater industry before airtime, Mr. Cohen is the more visible member of the team; but it is Miss Parks who puts the whole thing together.'' Ms. Parks was both shrewd and down to earth, focusing on getting the awards show picked up by television by signing on names familiar to television viewers. She did all the research for the show herself at the Lincoln Center library.         She also wrote the 37th and 38th annual Emmy Awards; ''Plácido Domingo: Steppin' Out With the Ladies'' on ABC in 1985; and NBC's 60th anniversary show in 1986.         Besides her contributions to causes like housing for the homeless, Greenpeace, the Actors' Fund and animal rights (she often brought home animals that appeared in shows to become family pets), she was involved with Community Board 5 in Midtown Manhattan and was prominent in continuing efforts to acquire landmark status for all the Broadway theaters.         Hildy Parks was born in Washington on March 12, 1926. She graduated from the University of Virginia and soon after went to New York to make her stage debut as Curley's wife in ''Of Mice and Men'' at the New School. She made her Broadway debut in 1947, when she appeared in ''Bathsheba'' with James Mason. In 1948 she played the Girl in Tennessee Williams's ''Summer and Smoke'' and was the only woman in the London cast of ''Mr. Roberts.''         After a brief marriage to Jackie Cooper, Ms. Parks met Mr. Cohen in 1953 while playing Gwendolyn Holly in the comedy ''Be Your Age'' at the 48th Street Theater. He was one of the play's producers. The play lasted only three days, but the marriage endured for 44 years.         Ms. Parks's involvement with theater also lasted for many years. In the 1983-84 season she worked as a producer or co-producer on the plays ''Edmund Kean,'' ''La Tragédie de Carmen'' and ''Play Memory.'' In 1984 she and her husband co-produced Dario Fo's play ''Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''         Ms. Parks also acted in films, like ''Fail Safe'' in 1964 and ''The Group'' in 1966, and made regular appearances on major television shows for 12 years. They ranged from ''Philco Playhouse'' and ''Studio One'' to ''To Tell the Truth,'' on which she was a frequent panelist. From 1951 to 1955, she played the character Ellie Crown in the daytime series ''Love of Life.''         In addition to Christopher Cohen, Ms. Parks is survived by her son Gerald Cohen and a stepdaughter, Barbara Cohen Hoffman.       
         Iris Chang, a journalist whose best-selling book, ''The Rape of Nanking,'' a chronicle of the atrocities committed in that city by occupying Japanese forces, helped break a six-decade-long international silence on the subject, committed suicide on Tuesday near Los Gatos, Calif. She was 36 and lived in San Jose.         Ms. Chang's literary agent, Susan Rabiner, announced the death.         Ms. Chang was found in her car on a rural road south of Los Gatos, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, the local authorities told The San Francisco Chronicle. She had left a suicide note at home that she had painstakingly written, edited and rewritten, her husband, Brett Douglas said in a telephone interview yesterday.         ''The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II'' was published by Basic Books in 1997, the 60th anniversary of the massacre. The book documented the events in Nanking (now Nanjing) during the second Sino-Japanese War, in the years leading up to World War II.         In December 1937 Japanese troops entered the city, which until shortly before the invasion had been the Chinese capital. In less than two months they murdered more than 300,000 civilians and raped more than 80,000 women. Ms. Chang's book was the first full-length nonfiction account of the event.         Reviewing ''The Rape of Nanking'' in The New York Times Book Review, Orville Schell called it an ''important new book,'' adding that Ms. Chang ''recounts the grisly massacre with understandable outrage.''         She had a keen personal interest in the subject. Ms. Chang's grandparents had fled Nanking just before the occupation, eventually settling in the United States. Growing up in the Midwest, she heard family stories of the massacre, but as an adult she was unable to find much about it in print. In China and Japan, and even in the West, the subject had been almost completely lost to history.         ''The whole issue had scar tissue growing over it, but it had never really healed,'' Mr. Schell, the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime observer of China, said in a telephone interview. ''She sort of threw the curtain back on a period that the Chinese Communist Party and the Japanese hoped was shrouded in official declarations of a new collaboration. But it turned out there was a lot of unfinished business.''         Fluent in Mandarin, Ms. Chang traveled to China, where she scoured archives and interviewed elderly survivors. What she learned would force her to describe the indescribable:         ''Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women, slice off their breasts, nail them alive to walls,'' Ms. Chang wrote. ''Fathers were forced to rape their daughters, and sons their mothers, as other family members watched. Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs and the roasting of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were practiced, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying people to their waists and watching them torn apart by German shepherds. So sickening was the spectacle that even Nazis in the city were horrified.''         ''The Rape of Nanking'' spent 10 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, and close to half a million copies have been sold, Ms. Rabiner said.         The book drew wide international attention. In Japan it prompted outrage among conservatives. (A planned Japanese edition was cancelled in 1999.) Elsewhere it engendered demands for the Japanese government to make reparations or, at least, a formal apology, something Ms. Chang to the end of her life felt had been inadequately done.         ''There have been all sorts of little fragments and shards and bits and pieces,'' Mr. Schell said. ''But no one has done what Willy Brandt did: got down on his knees in the Warsaw ghetto and asked forgiveness.''         Iris Shun-Ru Chang was born on March 28, 1968, in Princeton, N.J. She grew up in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., where her father, a physicist, and her mother, a microbiologist, taught at the University of Illinois. Ms. Chang received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Illinois in 1989. After working briefly as a reporter for The Associated Press and The Chicago Tribune, she earned a master's degree from the writing program of Johns Hopkins University in 1991.         She published her first book, ''Thread of the Silkworm'' (Basic Books, 1995), when she was just 27. It told the story of Tsien Hsue-shen, a Chinese-born scientist deported from the United States during the McCarthy era, who returned to China and founded that country's intercontinental missile program. Ms. Chang also wrote ''The Chinese in America: A Narrative History,'' published last year by Viking.         At the time of her death, she was researching a book on American soldiers who served in tank units on the Bataan peninsula before World War II, many of whom were captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. In the course of her research several months ago, Ms. Chang became severely depressed and had to be hospitalized, Ms. Rabiner said.         Besides her husband, Ms. Chang is survived by her parents, Shau-Jin and Ying-Ying, and a brother, Michael, all of San Jose; and by a son, Christopher.         In a 1998 interview with The Straits Times of Singapore, Ms. Chang described her reasons for writing ''The Rape of Nanking'':         ''I wrote it out of a sense of rage,'' she said. ''I didn't really care if I made a cent from it. It was important to me that the world knew what happened in Nanking back in 1937.''       
         Dr. M. Irené Ferrer, a New York cardiologist and medical educator who helped refine the cardiac catheter and electrocardiogram, which have become diagnostic essentials in heart treatment, died at her apartment in Manhattan last Friday. She was 89.         The cause was pneumonia combined with congestive heart failure, said a close friend, Dr. Marianne J. Legato, a Columbia cardiologist and internist, who was a protégée of Dr. Ferrer as a medical student in the 1950's.         Dr. Ferrer, who spent four decades at Columbia University, grew up as a New York society debutante, blossoming into an internationally recognized researcher and clinician.         Working at Bellevue Hospital in New York in the 1940's, she contributed to laboratory research that led to the cardiac catheter, a flexible tube passed through a patient's veins and directly into the heart or coronary arteries.         The catheter permits precise measurement of blood pressure and flow and has led to angioplasty and other revolutionary heart treatments. In 1956 its development was recognized with the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, shared by a German scientist, Dr. Werner Forssmann and two researchers from Columbia, André F. Cournand and Dr. Dickinson W. Richards. Dr. Richards noted Dr. Ferrer's studies in his Nobel lecture.         In later work Dr. Ferrer turned to the electrocardiogram, commonly known as an EKG, the electrical record of the heart's beating. She helped devise a computer-assisted algorithm that allowed a clearer and more immediate reading of that record. Previously, the test, which is often used to assess damages after a heart attack, could be interpreted only by doctors with specific training.         Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt, chairman of the department of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said that Dr. Ferrer was ''a leader in electrocardiography at a time when it was the only test we had to judge the heart.'' He added, ''She taught today's teachers.''         Marie Irené Ferrer was born in Elberon, N.J. She graduated from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Manhattan and Bryn Mawr College before earning her medical degree at Columbia in 1941.         She practiced briefly at New York University, then returned to Columbia in 1946 and was named an assistant professor there five years later. Dr. Ferrer was appointed professor of clinical medicine in 1972 and became a professor emeritus in 1981. She continued in private practice until nine years ago.         Dr. Ferrer was a former editor in chief of Current Cardiology and The Journal of the American Medical Women's Association. In 1993 she received a gold medal from Columbia Medical School's alumni association.         Dr. Ferrer is survived by a brother, Mel Ferrer, the actor and director, of Santa Barbara, Calif.
