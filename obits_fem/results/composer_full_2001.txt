         Birgit Akesson, a dancer and choreographer whose unconventional approach to movement and music made her a prominent pioneer of Swedish modern dance, died on Saturday in Stockholm, where she lived. She died on her 93rd birthday.         Unlike most modern dancers in the United States and Europe in the 1930's and 40's, Ms. Akesson was less concerned with expressing emotion than with finding the essence of dance through form. She rebelled early against her Expressionist training and became known for pure and rigorous solos, often performed without music.         Although she stopped dancing in 1965, Ms. Akesson's role as a founding mother of Swedish modern dance was increasingly recognized in the last 30 years, and she was awarded the gold medal of the Swedish Academy in 1998. Her works were seen on Swedish television, and her pure-dance aesthetic found favor with a new generation of viewers. A founder of the Choreographic Institute in Stockholm, she was an expert on dance in Asia and also Africa, where she sought the roots of a dance culture absent in the West.         In the 1950's she choreographed several works for the Royal Swedish Ballet as well as a space age opera, ''Aniara,'' that was typical of her collaboration with Sweden's modernist composers and poets. Yet her signature style was not dramatic and narrative. Ahead of her time, she sometimes baffled the international dance world with experiments in stillness, a dissociation between music and movement and her uncanny ability to reshape the body into an assemblage of independent planes.         In Paris, where she had made her debut in 1934, this reconfiguring of the body reminded critics of Cubist forms, and Ms. Akesson was called ''the Picasso of Dance.'' American audiences saw her perform in New York (1949 and 1955), and at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival (1955) and the American Dance Festival (1956). Referring to the slow pace or static quality of some of her solos, the American critic George Beiswanger wrote that she would occasionally ''crawl and writhe like a slug or an upended caterpillar, hardly moving at all.'' But he added, ''If one lets the movement have its way, it generates a compelling, almost hypnotic beauty.''         Ms. Akesson was born in Malmo, Sweden. From 1929 to 1931, she studied in Dresden at the school of Mary Wigman, the German modern dance pioneer. Although she and Birgit Cullberg, who was considered the other founding mother of Swedish modern dance, had their roots in German Expressionist dance, Ms. Akesson did not share Ms. Cullberg's interest in ballet or dance-drama.         In search of her own dance idiom and what she called a first or primary movement that did not depend on music, she moved to Paris, where she presented a solo concert in 1934. Two years later she opened a school in Stockholm, where she concentrated on developing an idiom that would allow each part of the body to move independently.         ''All parts of her dancing body were granted equal importance,'' Horace Engdahl wrote in ''Swedish Ballet and Dance'' (Swedish Institute, 1992). ''This was coupled with a new idea of space as growing out of the movement instead of being a fixed theatrical frame.'' He added that the body ''seemed to be taken apart and reassembled in forever new shapes, dissolving into a continuous flow of images growing one out of the other.''         Molding herself into a sculptural shape with her head or shoulder sometimes resting on the floor, Ms. Akesson often danced with eyes closed. In 1946 she returned to performing with two solos that were considered an artistic breakthrough, ''Blue Evening'' and ''Movement.''         Ms. Akesson began to collaborate with the poet Erik Lindegren and the composer Karl-Birger Blomdahl in works like ''Eye: Sleep in Dream'' (1953). Mr. Lindegren's poem was heard before Ms. Akesson moved in silence, with the music played during blackouts between the danced passages.         Ms. Akesson often turned to the same collaborators for the seven large works, beginning with the 1957 ''Sisyphus,'' that she choreographed for the Royal Swedish Ballet.         In 1983 she published her highly acclaimed book on African culture, ''The Mask of Spring Water,'' and suddenly returned to choreography in 1989 by creating two solos on television. Long interested in Asian dance, she chose the Chinese-born dancer Chiang Ching to perform both dances, ''Autumn Leaves'' and ''Shades.''         Ms. Akesson is survived by a daughter, Mona Moeller-Nilesen, and a grandchild.       
         Ann Sothern, a deft comedian and talented singer who was known as the Queen of the B's at Columbia and RKO, where she made 18 movies between 1934 and 1936, died on Thursday at her home in Ketchum, Idaho. She was 92.         Perhaps never the star she might have been, Ms. Sothern was nevertheless one of the shrewdest actresses around. Her astuteness would eventually lead to her ownership of two early television series, ''Private Secretary'' and ''The Ann Sothern Show.''         In 1938 Ms. Sothern ditched her blond ing√©nue image and stormed Hollywood's greatest studio, MGM, only to be stuck in a wildly successful series of 10 movies about a tough, scatterbrained, down-on-her-luck Brooklyn chorus girl with a heart of gold, Maisie Ravier.         ''Maisie'' (1939), which had been bought for Jean Harlow and then shelved when Harlow died, was an instant phenomenon. Letters addressed to ''Maisie, U.S.A.'' had no trouble being delivered. After ''Congo Maisie'' (1940), ''Gold Rush Maisie'' (1940), ''Ringside Maisie'' (1941) and ''Maisie Was a Lady'' (1941) and between ''Swing Shift Maisie'' (1943) and ''Undercover Maisie'' (1947), Ms. Sothern begged the studio head, Louis B. Mayer, to allow her to quit the series. Mr. Mayer always answered: ''No. Your movies pay for our mistakes.''         Through bad luck or fate, Ms. Sothern was never more than a minor star: ''a Hollywood princess,'' she once said, ''not a Hollywood queen.''         Joseph Mankiewicz, the Academy Award-winning director who cast Ms. Sothern in her best role, as the soap opera-writing wife of Kirk Douglas in ''A Letter to Three Wives'' (1949), said of her: ''Poor Annie. Annie was a damned good Broadway musical comedy actress.  She had the sexiest mouth any woman ever had. But, at Metro, poor Annie got stuck in the Sam Katz unit.  She never got the big break Gene Kelly and others did, of being with the Arthur Freed steamroller of talent.''         Ms. Sothern got a few chances to show off her her talent, her timing and her figure in MGM musicals, most notably ''Lady Be Good'' (1941) and in the Ethel Merman role in the film version of the Cole Porter musical comedy ''Panama Hattie'' (1942). And she got good reviews as a hard-boiled ex-waitress pressed into service as a nurse and doomed when the island of Bataan was conquered by the Japanese in the World War II drama ''Cry Havoc'' (1943). But it would be 35 years after ''Cry Havoc'' before she earned her sole Academy Award nomination.         In 1988, at the age of 79, she was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for her performance as Lillian Gish's optimistic friend and neighbor in the 1987 drama of old age, ''The Whales of August.''         A few months before the nominations were announced, Ms. Sothern told an interviewer that her chances were dismal. ''I think Hollywood has been terrible to me,'' she said. ''Hollywood doesn't respond to a strong woman, not at all. I was too independent. How dare a woman be competitive or produce her own shows?''         Like her friend Lucille Ball, Ms. Sothern turned early to television. In  their B-movie days at RKO, the two actresses had cried on each other's  shoulders, with Ms. Sothern complaining that she got all the roles Katharine Hepburn did not want and Ms. Ball saying that she got all the parts Ms. Sothern did not want.         Ms. Sothern was savvy enough to produce ''Private Secretary,'' and to demand that the situation comedy be shot on film, to preserve it. As Susie McNamera, private secretary to a New York talent agent, Ms. Sothern became a heroine to secretaries all over America. The show alternated Sunday nights on CBS with ''The Jack Benny Show'' from February 1953 to September 1957.         When Ms. Sothern quarreled with the show's other producer over her right to take on movie roles, she left the series and sold her 104 episodes for well over $1 million. She immediately returned to CBS in ''The Ann Sothern Show'' as the assistant manager of a swanky New York hotel.  Lucille Ball, as Lucy Ricardo, was a guest star on the first episode, and Ms. Sothern returned the favor several times as the Countess Framboise on ''I Love Lucy.'' In 1989, 28 years after ''The Ann Sothern Show'' went off the air, the actress sold the rights to the cable channel Nickelodeon, where the show became an unexpected hit.         Ann Sothern was born Harriette Lake on Jan. 22, 1909, in Valley City, N.D., where her mother, a concert singer, was on tour. She was the eldest of the three daughters of Walter and Annette Yde-Lake. Of Danish stock, she was raised in Minnesota by her mother and grandmother after her father, a meat salesman and womanizer, deserted the family when she was 5.         At 16 she was named the outstanding high school composer in Minnesota and sent to Detroit to represent Minnesota in a national contest. She spent a year at the University of Washington before joining her mother, who was a singing teacher in Hollywood. When half a dozen bit parts in movies got her nowhere, she tried Broadway with somewhat more success.         Florenz Ziegfeld offered her a part in ''Smiles'' with Marilyn Miller, but the star considered the 20-year-old Ms. Sothern too much competition and had her fired after the Boston tryout. In 1931 she played the ingenue in ''Everybody's Welcome,'' the play that introduced the song ''As Time Goes By''; she then toured for seven months in the George S. Kaufman-Morrie Ryskind-Ira and George Gershwin musical ''Of Thee I Sing.''  After the tour ended she took over the same role on Broadway, replacing Lois Moran. And Hollywood noticed.         She was signed by Columbia Studios, which changed her name to Ann Sothern and her hair color from red to platinum blond. From ''Let's Fall in Love'' in 1933 through ''The Hell Cat,'' ''Blind Date'' and ''Kid Millions'' with Eddie Cantor in 1934, the Maurice Chevalier musical ''Folies-Berg√®re'' in 1935 and a dozen more lightweight but pleasant musicals and comedies, she bubbled and sang.         Married to the bandleader Rogert Pryor and living in a huge rented house in Beverly Hills, she decided she had had enough of B movies. ''I found a much smaller house in Hollywood,'' she recalled. ''We lived cautiously, not as extravagantly, for a year. I was just so sick of those pictures, I decided I wasn't going to do them anymore.''         After making seven movies in 1937, she was off the screen until 1939, when she returned with fourth billing in an A movie, MGM's ''Trade Winds,'' as Fredric March's manipulative secretary. When he saw ''Trade Winds,'' Walter Ruben, the producer of ''Maisie,'' refused to cast one of MGM's contract actresses as Maisie; he insisted on Ann Sothern for the role that would define her career for the next decade.         In 1950, with her MGM contract coming to an end, she collapsed on the ski slopes at Sun Valley, Idaho, with a near-fatal case of hepatitis and was in and out of hospitals for a year. She had divorced Pryor in 1942. In 1943 she married the actor Robert Sterling and had a daughter. That marriage also ended in divorce.         Her movie career was essentially over, too, although she had solid parts in Gore Vidal's satirical political drama, ''The Best Man,'' and the Olivia de Havilland thriller ''Lady in a Cage,'' both in 1964. In 1965 she played her most bizarre role, as the voice of the mother of Jerry Van Dyke reincarnated as a 1928 Porter automobile in the television series ''My Mother the Car.''         Like many former stars she turned eventually to summer stock and dinner theater, with disastrous results. In 1974 on a stage in Jacksonville, Fla., falling scenery broke her back and smashed the nerves in her legs. She finished the performance, held together with silver gaffer's tape.         Told she would probably never walk again, she refused to accept the diagnosis. Immensely athletic, she was a crack trap shooter and deep sea fisherman, and her MGM contract gave her three months off each winter to ski in Sun Valley. She never came to terms with what the accident had done to her body. But she did walk, with a cane that she used reluctantly and constantly misplaced. And, a decade after the accident, she moved out of Southern California to Ketchum, where she could see Dollar Mountain, which she used to ski, through the window of her house.         A different kind of accident brought her one more chance for glory. The producer of a television remake of ''A Letter to Three Wives'' thought it would be a great marketing ploy to get one of the original stars, Jeanne Crain or Ms. Sothern, to play a cameo role. Ms. Sothern's bit part let Lindsay Anderson, the director who would be making ''The Whales of August,'' know that Ms. Sothern was still alive.         Mr. Anderson had retained ''a memory of her charm'' from Ms. Sothern's early musicals. ''In a sense she was too good an actress to be a star,'' he said. ''Being a star requires elephantiasis of the ego.''         Ms. Sothern is survived by her  daughter, Tisha Sterling, an actress and designer; a sister, Sally Adams of Boise, Idaho; and a granddaughter.         Summing up her career after ''The Whales of August,'' Ms. Sothern shook her graying gold ringlets and said, ''I've done everything but play rodeos.''         Correction:  March 20, 2001, Tuesday  An obituary of the actress Ann Sothern on Saturday misidentified the distributor of ''Trade Winds,'' a 1938 film in which she played a supporting role. It was United Artists, not MGM.         Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the television show on which she appeared as the Countess Framboise. It was ''The Lucy Show,'' not ''I Love Lucy.''       
         Laura Foreman, the director of dance at the New School University and a visual artist, writer and teacher, died on June 15 in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her companion, Richard Keene.         Ms. Foreman came to New York in the mid-1960's after receiving a degree in dance from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. She directed the dance program at the New School, long the center of her dance activities, from the late 1960's until her death.         Her Foreman Dance Theater and Composers' and Choreographers' Theater were in residence at the school. There Ms. Foreman provided much needed exposure for new and avant-garde choreographers and dancers in several dance and music series, among them Choreoconcerts and Critiques. She and her company also performed regularly into the 1970's at the Cubiculo and the American Theater Lab.         One of Ms. Foreman's best-known pieces was her 1981 ''Wallwork,'' created with her husband, the composer John Watts, a frequent collaborator who died in 1982. A conceptual event, it existed only in advertising posters and on a telephone reservations number, which grew very busy when a sold-out sign was slapped on the posters. Ms. Foreman also worked in film and video, winning awards for her ''TimeCoded Woman I, II, III.''         After Mr. Watts's death, she concentrated on art and writing. She began to exhibit sculptures in the early 1980's, becoming most famous for her 1990 ''Birdhouse as Metaphor,'' a show at the Souyun Yi Gallery in SoHo. The New Yorker described the sculptures as ''serious ruminations on the housing crisis, homelessness and personal entrapment.'' Many were eventually installed in neighborhood gardens in Manhattan.         Ms. Foreman's short stories were published in journals, including Confrontation and Lamia. Her stories were collected in a book, ''Close Encounters,'' published in 1997 by Outloud Books. She was also a co-founder and member of Artists and Scientists in Collaboration.         In addition to Mr. Keene, she is survived by her mother, Gladys Foreman of Los Angeles.       
         Jeanne Loriod, whose artistry playing the ondes martenot, a rare electronic instrument known for its haunting wail, made her the instrument's most celebrated performer, died on Aug. 3 at Juan-les-Pins, France. She was 72.         The cause was a stroke, British newspapers reported.         The instrument, also known as ondes musicales, French for musical waves, was first demonstrated in France on April 20, 1928, by its inventor, Maurice Martenot. Miss Loriod was born in Houilles, near Paris, three months later, on July 13.         She followed her sister Yvonne, to the piano class of Lazare Levy at the Paris Conservatory, where she soon became fascinated by the new instrument. She studied it with Martenot, who had just begun teaching it at the conservatory. Her high grades enabled her to join a quartet begun by Martenot's sister, Ginette.         She was in the middle of a futuristic electric music movement that never went remotely as far as its pioneers dreamed. Beginning with the 200-ton telharmonium, and on through at least a dozen instruments with strange-sounding names and even stranger sounds, proponents of the new wired music delighted in making previously unimaginable noises.         For example, the theremin, an electronic instrument conjured up by a Russian scientist, Leon Theremin, as he tinkered with radio parts in 1920, can make a sound that has been likened to a violin being played while submerged in deep water. Other electronic instruments include the trautonium, the sfaerofon, the gnome and the orgatron.         Not surprisingly, the new instruments found their most welcome home in movie soundtracks, including those for ''King Kong,'' ''The Lost Weekend'' and ''Spellbound.'' Rock groups also liked the eerie sounds. The Beach Boys used a theremin in ''Good Vibrations.''         But those who loved the ondes martenot had higher aspirations. It uses oscillating radio tubes to produce electronic pulses at two supersonic sound-wave frequencies. These in turn produce a lower frequency within the audible range that is amplified and converted into sound by a loudspeaker. Many tones can be created by filtering out some of the tones of the audible notes.         The instrument is played with a keyboard and by manipulating a ribbon with a ring for the player's right index finger. Ondes were manufactured individually, to order only.         But like the theremin, the ondes martenot achieved its widest exposure not in avant-garde music, but on the screen. Maurice Jarre, a friend of Ms. Loriod, played the instrument for ''Lawrence of Arabia'' and ''Mad Max.''         One early composer who took an immediate liking to the ondes martenot was Olivier Messiaen, who married Jeanne's sister Yvonne Loriod; she became a renowned pianist. Particularly in his 10-movement symphony, ''Turangalila,'' Messiaen uses the ondes martenot to create shimmering, swooping musical effects. Virtually everywhere ''Turangalila'' was performed, Jeanne Loriod was to be found, her sister often playing the virtuoso piano part. Miss Loriod recorded her part in the symphony at least six times and performed it live on at least four continents with conductors like Pierre Boulez, Seiji Ozawa, Andr√© Previn and Zubin Mehta.         In addition to Yvonne, Miss Loriod is survived by another sister, Jacqueline.         Miss Loriod also took ample advantage of two further masterworks that Messiaen wrote for the instrument. ''Trois Petites Liturgies de la Pr√©sence Divine'' (1943-44) mixes its qualities with women's voices, piano, strings and percussion. ''Saint Fran√ßois d'Assise'' (1975-83) features the ondes in three of the eight tableaus in a work lasting nearly four hours.         Other composers who wrote for the instrument included Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, Edgard Var√®se, Charles Koechlin, Florent Schmitt and Jacques Ibert.         Jeanne Loriod performed in more than 500 works, 14 of them concertos. She added to the repertoire herself, by creating 85 works for a sextet of ondes she formed in 1974, initially to revive Messiaen's first ondes piece, ''La F√™te des Belles Eaux'' of 1937.         She taught at several French conservatories and wrote a three-volume book that became the standard text for the instrument: ''Technique de l'Onde Electronique Type Martenot'' (Leduc, 1987).         Hugh Davies, a performer and musicologist specializing in electronic instruments, estimated that more than 1,000 works had been composed for the ondes.         Thus Miss Loriod bristled when an interviewer suggested to her in 1988 that the instrument's repertory might be less than extensive.         ''Since 1928 we have 15 concertos and over 300 works of chamber music,'' she answered, also citing the 85 she wrote for her sextet.         But the success of the exotic electronic instrument seems to have been diminished by small number of players.         ''The fact is that any instrument with no institutional grounding of second- and third-raters, no spectral army of amateurs, will wither and vanish: how can it not?'' Mark Singer wrote in ''The Wire'' in 1997.         He continued, ''Specialist virtuosos may arrive to tackle the one-off novelty -- the theramin's Clara Rockwell, the ondes martenot's Jeanne Loriod, the trautonium's Oskar Sala -- but there's no meaningful level of entry at the ground floor, and, what's worse, no fallback possibility of rank careerism if things don't turn out.''         Not just anybody, after all, had Ms. Loriod's versatility. Shortly before her death, she had hoped to perform with the British pop group Radiohead. ''Sadly,'' The Times of London said, ''a new era in the history of the 20th century's weirdest classical instrument was not to commence.''         Correction:  August 22, 2001, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Jeanne Loriod, a player of the rare electronic instrument known as the ondes martinot, used an erroneous surname for another such musician, a theremin virtuoso, obtained from a discussion of obstacles to their careers in a British online publication, The Wire. She was Clara Rockmore, not Rockwell.       
         Rosemary Brown, who as a middle-aged widow living in a London suburb in the 1960's said she had been in contact with history's most illustrious composers, offering as evidence hundreds of piano miniatures that she said Beethoven, Bach and others had ''dictated'' to her, died on Nov. 16 in London. She was 85.         The odd experiences she described -- which included shopping with Liszt (he was interested in the price of bananas) and watching television with Chopin (he was appalled) -- found a resonant audience in the era of the Beatles and flower power. More intriguingly, they attracted expert scrutiny and some approbation from such luminaries as Leonard Bernstein, along with tidal waves of more or less good-natured ridicule from most of the music establishment.         Mrs. Brown's credibility as a medium was buttressed by her own musical ignorance. She had just three years of piano instruction and could not play by ear or extemporize. There was no record player or radio in her home and she said she never went to concerts.         ''I seemed to lose control of my hands; it was as though someone were guiding them,'' she said of the first time she received a piece of music from Liszt.         Peter Katin, an outstanding interpreter of Chopin, was pleased to record many of the piano works, while the composer Humphrey Searle published an essay noting the similarity of Mrs. Brown's Liszt pieces with his later official compositions. Mr. Bernstein suggested he could ''buy,'' meaning accept, a piece by Rachmaninoff, but not much else.         Andr√© Previn, then conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, said that if the newfound compositions were genuine, they would best have been left on the shelf.         But the British composer Richard Rodney Bennett seemed entirely convinced, at least at the time. He said that when he was having trouble with a composition of his own, Mrs. Brown passed along Debussy's recommendation. It worked.         ''If she is a fake, she is a brilliant one, and must have had years of training,'' he said in an interview in Time magazine. ''Some of the music is awful, but some is marvelous. I couldn't have faked the Beethoven.''         Regardless of how much Western music may or may not have been enriched by posthumous contributions channeled by Mrs. Brown, there was scant doubt of her entertainment value. She set off waves of interest in several appearances on British Broadcasting Corporation radio shows, the first in 1969. In the United States, she played at Town Hall in New York and appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' with Johnny Carson, telling him that her sources said there was no sex in heaven.         She described the various composers in often humorous detail. Beethoven, she said, was no longer deaf and had lost ''that crabby look.'' Debussy wore ''very bizarre clothes'' and was ''a hippie type.'' Chopin kept screaming something in French; it turned out to be a warning that her bathtub was overflowing.         Later she enjoyed visits from the ghosts of other celebrated people, including Shakespeare, Van Gogh and St. Paul. All the visits, she contended, were intended only to prove the existence of an afterlife.         Rosemary Dickeson was born on July 27, 1916, in southwest London. Her father was an electrician and her mother a catering manager. The family's apartment was above a dance hall, and she won dance contests as a girl. But her father vetoed a dancing career.         The most significant event of her youth occurred when she was 7. She had a vision of an elderly man with long white hair, wearing a black gown. He said he was Liszt. ''He told me that when I grow up, he would give me music,'' she said.         ''I've always had the ability, ever since I can remember, to see and hear people who are thought of as dead,'' she said in an interview with Newsweek.         In 1943, she contracted polio, which left her left side weak. When she was 15, she took a job as a clerk at the post office. When walking home from work one day, she said a voice told her to take a different route. A bombing raid struck her usual route.         In 1948, she got an upright piano and took lessons for the third time; as always, they lasted about a year.         In 1952, she married Charles Brown, a government scientist who had once worked as a gardener for King Farouk of Egypt. In 1961, her husband and her mother died. She began visiting spiritualists active in the emerging New Age thinking.         In 1964, she suffered an accident at the school kitchen where she worked and resumed playing the piano during her long recovery. That was when Liszt returned, as promised. She recognized him immediately, she said, and he arranged for the other composers to come, acting ''like sort of a reception desk.''         They took different approaches. Chopin told her what notes to play and pushed her fingers down on the right keys. Beethoven and Bach liked her to sit at a table and take dictation with a pencil. Schubert tried to sing his compositions, but ''he hasn't a very good voice,'' she said.         She was supported by contributions from people who believed in the occult. She wrote three books on her channeling, and made a number of recordings, some featuring her playing the easier pieces, the last in 1988. In the mid-1980's, the visits ceased as she fell into ill health. She is survived by a son and a daughter.         She always declined to ask her musical visitors the questions that outsiders thought would prove their existence. When Time offered her a list of 20 questions, she replied, ''I cannot push a button and call on the composers just like that.''         But when she needed notes for an album cover in 1970, Sir Donald Tovey, a musicologist, was pleased to provide them. ''It is the implications relevant to this phenomenon that we hope will stimulate sensitive interest,'' he said.         He had died in 1940.       
         Mercedes Matter, a painter, teacher and the chief founder of the New York Studio School in Greenwich Village, died on Tuesday. She was 87  and lived in East Hampton on Long Island.         Mrs. Matter was born Mercedes Carles in New York in 1913. Her father, the American modernist Arthur B. Carles, had studied with Matisse. Her mother, Mercedes de Cordoba, was a model for Edward Steichen. Ms. Matter grew up in Philadelphia, New York and Europe.         She began painting under her father's supervision at age 6, and studied art at Bennett College in Millbrook, N.Y., and then in New York City with Maurice Sterne, Alexander Archipenko and Hans Hofmann.         In the late 1930's, she was an original member of the American Abstract Artists organization and worked for the federal Works Progress Administration, assisting Fernand L√©ger on his mural for the French Line passenger ship company. L√©ger introduced her to Herbert Matter, the Swiss graphic designer and photographer, whom she married in 1939.         The Matters were active in the emerging New York art scene and also traveled frequently to Europe. Their closest friends included Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, Franz Kline, Philip Guston, Alexander Calder and Willem de Kooning. They were also close to Alberto Giacometti, who was an important artistic role model for Mrs. Matter and a frequent photographic subject for her husband.         Beginning in 1953, Mrs. Matter taught at the Philadelphia College of Art (now University of the Arts), Pratt Institute and New York University. Based on her teaching experiences she wrote an article for Art News in 1963 titled ''What's Wrong with U.S. Art Schools?'' In it, she lamented the phasing out of the extended studio classes required to initiate ''that painfully slow education of the senses,'' which she considered an artist's life work.         The article prompted a group of Pratt students to ask her to form a school based on her ideas, which led, in 1964, to the founding of the New York Studio School. Originally in a loft on Broadway, the school gained almost immediate support from the Kaplan Fund, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Ford Foundation. It granted no degrees, had only studio classes and emphasized drawing from life. Its teachers, chosen by the students, included the artists Guston, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Charles Cajori, Louis Finkelstein and Sidney Geist; the art historian Meyer Schapiro; and the composer Morton Feldman.         The Matters lived on Macdougal Alley, where Mr. Matter had a studio in one of the eight small buildings that had housed what is now the Whitney Museum of American Art. It was his idea that the buildings would make a perfect home for the Studio School, which bought them from the Whitney family in 1967.         Mrs. Matter practiced as she preached, spending months, and sometimes years, working on drawings and paintings that usually began as still lifes and evolved into near-abstractions animated by thatched lines that attested to her her devotion to the work of Giacometti and C√©zanne.         In addition to her art and teaching, she wrote articles on artists, including Hofmann, Kline and Giacometti. She wrote the text for a book of her husband's photographs of Giacometti, published in 1987, four years after his death.         Mrs. Matter had her first solo show in New York at the Tanager Gallery in 1956. Her most recent was a double bill of drawings, shown in the Studio School's gallery, and paintings, at Salander O'Reilly Galleries. She taught at the school until last year.         She is survived by her son, Alexander, and a grandson, Jordan Matter, both of New York.
