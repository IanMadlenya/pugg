         Ada Moore, a singer and actress who performed on Broadway and in jazz clubs across the nation, died on Sunday at the Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 64 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of cancer, her husband, Paul J. Ash, said.         Miss Moore, who was born in Chicago, attended the University of California at Los Angeles, and began her singing career in that city. In 1954, she created the role of Gladiola in the Truman Capote and Harold Arlen musical "House of Flowers."         She sang at many jazz and supper clubs, including the Village Vanguard, the Hungry I in San Francisco and Mister Kelly's in Chicago, and at such theaters as the Apollo in New York, the Howard in Washington and the Royal in Baltimore.         In the 1970's, Miss Moore wrote prose and poetry and published a newsletter, The American Negro Woman. In an article about Bessie Smith, Dinah Washington and Billie Holiday, Miss Moore wrote: "They were not just blues singers, they were innovators who took experience directly from the harsh and dynamic areas of life, refined it and gave it the form and beauty that moved us so much."         Her only survivor is her husband, who is executive vice president of the Sam Ash Music Corporation.         Correction:  January 11, 1991, Friday         An obituary in some copies yesterday about Ada Moore, a singer and actress, misstated her relationship to Paul J. Ash. He is her former husband, not her husband. A corrected obituary appears today on page B7.       
         The Rev. Marilyn Adams Moore, an executive with the United Church of Christ, died Jan. 3 at her home in Dayton, N.J. She was 57 years old.

Ms. Moore had served as secretary for racial and social justice with the Board for Homeland Ministries of the United Church of Christ since 1988. She worked on programs to help the clergy and laity respond to social issues and initiated programs to help immigrant women and the homeless.         Before that, she was assistant minister of St. Alban's Congregational Church in Queens.         A graduate of New York Theological Seminary, Ms. Moore was ordained in 1982. She also held positions with the National Council of Churches and the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization. She was a member of the Central Jersey Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

         Bertha A. Normano, a teacher of Russian at Middlebury College before her retirement in 1968, died Sunday at the Porter Medical Center in Middlebury, Vt. She was 104 years old and lived in Middlebury.         Mrs. Normano was born in Ekaterinoslav, now Dnepropetrovsk, in Russia. She left Russia in 1919 and lived in Berlin and Paris before coming to the United States in 1931.         She worked at the Latin American Economic Institute and the Institute of Asian Economics in New York before teaching Russian, first at the Asian Institute and then at City College and at Hunter College. In 1951, she became executive secretary of the Middlebury College Russian School, and from 1956 until her retirement she taught Russian there.         Her husband, John F. Normano, died in 1945. There are no survivors.       
         Dr. Leona Baumgartner Langmuir, a public health official who was New York City's Commissioner of Health from 1954 to 1962 and later was an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, died on Tuesday in Chilmark, Mass. She was 88 years old and lived Chilmark.         She died of polycythemia, a blood ailment, said her husband, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir.         Dr. Baumgartner, as she was known during her career, joined the Department of Health in 1937 and rose to become its first female commissioner. Characteristically, she shrugged off the distinction, as she did again in 1962 when President John F. Kennedy appointed her to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at A.I.D., making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States Government at the time.         In 1966 Dr. Baumgartner was named visiting professor of social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, a post she held until she retired in 1972. Family Planning Advocate         In her career at the Health Department, Dr. Baumgartner was a strong proponent of improving public-health education and of modernizing government programs, particularly in family planning and in maternal and children's health.         In the national and international health arena, while serving with the Agency for International Development, she established a Research Advisory Council to improve standards of professional quality in grants for health and welfare programs around the globe. She was credited with persuading President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse a policy that had prevented the agency from including birth control in its support of health programs in underdeveloped countries.         Dr. Baumgartner was born in Chicago and raised in Lawrence, Kan., where her father taught zoology at the University of Kansas. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the university and was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Munich before winning a Sterling Fellowship to study at Yale, where she took a Ph.D. in immunology and went on to receive an M.D. from the Yale Medical School.         After internship and residency at New York Hospital she spent a year with the United States Public Health Service before joining the New York City Health Department, where she started as an instructor and served as director of the Bureau of Child Hygiene on her way to the department's top position. Safeguarding Public Health         She left for 18 months in the late 1940's to become associate chief of the United States Children's Bureau, returning to the Health Department in 1950 as assistant commissioner. In 1953 she left again to become executive director of the nonprofit New York Foundation but returned a year later when Mayor Robert F. Wagner promised her a free hand as commissioner.         A woman of seemingly boundless energy, Dr. Baumgartner raced about the city on inspection tours and spoke out on sanitary failures of restaurant kitchens, day nurseries and anywhere else she felt the public health could be safeguarded. For several years she gave a health-education message to a nationwide television audience on a morning program hosted by Arlene Francis.         In contrast to most large cities, as many as 35 percent of the babies born in New York were seen in the city's well-baby and immunization clinics under her direction. Her management of emergency maternity and infant-care clinics for dependents of military personnel in World War II was recognized as innovative.         After the war she undertook a thorough revision of the city's sanitary code and expanded a public health laboratory that had already won acclaim in the field. In 1958 she established a Public Health Research Institute in New York with an annual budget of more than $7 million from municipal money to perform basic and applied research on a wide range of health problems.         Dr. Baumgartner was an early advocate of the Salk vaccine to immunize the public against polio, and one of her last achievements as health commissioner was to win a political battle to fluoridate the city's water supply to prevent tooth decay.         Among the honors Dr. Baumgartner received were the Sedgwick Medal and the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association and the Public Welfare Award of the National Academy of Sciences.         Dr. Baumgartner's first husband, Nathaniel M. Elias, a chemical engineeer, died in 1964. In 1970 she married Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, who survives.       
         Selma Tamber Eisenman, a Broadway producer and manager, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack, said a nephew, Martin Poll of Los Angeles.         Ms. Tamber produced several Broadway and Off Broadway shows, including "Boccaccio 70" and "Viva Madison Avenue." She also managed artists like Hanya Holm, the choreographer of "Kiss Me, Kate," "My Fair Lady" and "Camelot," and helped further the careers of the composers and lyricists Richard Adler and Stephen Sondheim.         Ms. Tamber was born in New York City. In the 1930's, she supervised various Broadway musicals as the head of the department of composers and arrangers for the music publisher Chappell-T. B. Harms, where she worked with composers like George Gershwin and Cole Porter. She later became the executive assistant to the producers Herman Levin, Lemuel Ayres and Saint Subber.         Ms. Tamber is survived by another nephew, Alvin Poll, of Cranbury, N.J., and four grandnephews.       
         Charlene Victor, the executive director of BACA, the Brooklyn Arts Council, died on Monday at her home in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. She was 71 years old.         She died of respiratory failure, the council's public relations director, Chuck Reichenthal, said.         In 1966, Ms. Victor founded BACA, a community-based cultural organization, as an outgrowth of her work with the Prospect Park Centennial Committee. BACA has sponsored many arts events in Brooklyn.         Ms. Victor was born in Chicago and moved to New York when she was 16 to pursue a careeer in the theater. Using the stage name Charlene Harris, she appeared in several Broadway shows, and performed on radio and television. She worked with Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater, and with Imogene Coca, Bob Fosse and Mel Brooks. She retired from the theater in the late 1940's and married Eugene Victor, a Brooklyn politician.         She received awards for her work in the arts from several organizations, including the New York Board of Trade and the Arts and Business Council. In 1987, she was awarded the New York State Governor's Art Award.         She is survived by two sons, Adam and Damon, of New York; a brother, Melvyn Harris of Chicago; a sister, Betty Zamore of Ventura, Calif., and three grandchildren.

         Shirley Goodman, a driving force behind the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York for more than four decades, died on Sunday at her Manhattan apartment.         She was 75 years old and had had cancer for many years, a spokeswoman at the institute said.         "If there is a single person whose vision and guidance have been most influential in shaping F.I.T., that person is Shirley Goodman," Marvin Feldman, the president of the institute, said.         Ms. Goodman worked tirelessly for the institute, cajoling designers and editors into lecturing, talking manufacturers into opening their showrooms to students and persuading corporations to donate money.         At her death, she was the institute's executive vice president emeritus and executive director of the Educational Foundation for the Fashion Industries, a fund-raising and advisory group for the college, which has been a part of the State University of New York since 1951.         Since her arrival at the fashion institute in 1949, it has grown from two floors of borrowed space in a nearby high school to an eight-building complex on West 27th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Ms. Goodman is credited with leading the expansion from a small trade school to a specialized college offering 24 majors in fashion design, art, business and technology. The college's graduates include Calvin Klein, Norma Kamali, John Anthony and Stephen Burrows.  Building Named for Her         "I didn't start F.I.T., but I helped build it and broaden it," Ms. Goodman said in an interview in 1978. In recognition of her contributions, the college in 1975 dedicated one of its buildings as the Shirley Goodman Resource Center. It houses a library, galleries, a graduate center and a design laboratory with one of the country's largest collections of fashion costumes and textiles.         Throughout her career, Ms. Goodman worked in community and government organizations promoting the fashion industry. She was an honorary professor of the Bunka College of Fashion in Tokyo. She was also director of liaison for the fashion industries at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959 and 1967, executive director of Fashion Capital of the World Inc. from 1973 to 1974, and a trustee of the Coty Awards. In 1975, the Fifth Avenue Association named her Woman of the Year and in 1976, Business Week magazine listed her as one of the 100 top corporate women in the United States.         She joined the fashion institute in 1949 to help draft the legislation making the five-year-old college part of the State University system. She expected to stay there six months, she later said, but never left.         Born in Virginia and reared in North Carolina, Ms. Goodman always retained a trace of a gentle Southern accent that seemed to temper her toughness as a business woman and a fund-raiser. People in the fashion industry described her as "a dynamo" and "a woman of simple dignity and pride." Despite several bouts with cancer, she refused to retire, saying: "When you retire you get old and tired. You don't stay vital."         She is survived by her husband, Himan Brown, a radio and television producer; two sons from a previous marriage, Alan Fishman of New York and Barry Fishman of San Rafael, Calif., and a grandson. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held at 5 P.M. May 20 at the institute's Haft Auditorium.       
         Harriet Fleischl Pilpel, a lawyer and civil libertarian who was a prominent advocate of women's rights, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Pilpel died of a heart attack, her husband said.         Last Wednesday, she received an award from the New York Civil Liberties Foundation, one of many such awards she had received. At her death she was first vice chairwoman of the National Advisory Council of the American Civil Liberties Union.         Mrs. Pilpel, a frequent guest on the television program "Firing Line" with William F. Buckley Jr., was associated with the Manhattan law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which she joined in 1982. Throughout her career she lectured extensively on freedom of speech and the press, birth control, abortion and related subjects. She also spoke on the status of women and literary and entertainment law.  Served on Rights Panel         In the 1960's, she was a member of the Kennedy and Johnson Commissions on the Status of Women, serving on the committee on political and civil rights. From 1970 to 1978, she was chairwoman of the Law Panel International of Planned Parenthood Federation. She was also a consultant to the Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor from 1965 to 1976 and general counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union from 1979 to 1986.         She was also general counsel for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and special counsel for Planned Parenthood of New York City. In 1974, she was a founding member of the Women's Forum, an organization of women of achievement and influence from diverse fields.         In 1961, she argued successfully for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America against a suit asking the Supreme Court to rule on Connecticut laws that would have made it a crime to use birth-control devices or for doctors to advise their use. The Court declined 5 to 4 to rule on the laws.         In 1965, Mrs. Pilpel represented Dr. Benjamin Spock in a free-speech suit over whether advertising in his best-seller "Baby and Child Care," violated the public interest. The court ruled against Dr. Spock, who sought to block the ads.         She graduated from Vassar College in 1932 and received a master's degree from Columbia University Graduate School in 1933. She received a law degree from Columbia in 1936.         She is survived by her husband, Irvin B.

         Coral Lansbury, an author, Victorian scholar and dean of the Graduate School of English at Rutgers University's Camden campus, died on Tuesday at her home in Philadelphia. She was 61 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Lansbury, who had written a number of scholarly literary works, began writing fiction late in her career when her cousin, the actress Angela Lansbury, said to her seven years ago, "Darling, are you going to go on all your life writing those dreary academic books that nobody reads?"         The result was "Sweet Alice," which E. P. Dutton brought out in 1986 and which Publishers Weekly praised as a "slightly naughty tale of greed, goodness and British breeding." Her second novel, "Ringarra," a Gothic tale, reached readers in 1985, even before "Sweet Alice" appeared. 'Mythic Quality' to Writing         In quick succession there followed "Felicity" (1987) a farce, and "The Grotto" (1989), whose writing was praised by John Mortimer in The New York Times Book Review for its "energy, good humor and mythic quality." Alfred A. Knopf will publish her fifth novel, "Opium!," next year.         Ms. Lansbury was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1929 to British parents who were touring in a production of the musical "Showboat." The family was stranded by the Great Depression and Ms. Lansbury graduated from North Sydney Girls High School, a selective institution, and entered the University of Sydney at age 15.         A year later her father, who had become a sound-effects man in the country's fledgling radio industry, got her a part in a drama on the air. She worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation into the 1960's but as television supplanted radio drama she turned more to academic interests, publishing articles and lecturing widely.         Ms. Lansbury came to the United States and joined the Rutgers faculty at Camden in 1974. She wrote four books on Anthony Trollope and other Victorian literary figures between 1975 and 1984. She served as president of the Victorian Studies Association and of the Victorian executive committee of the Modern Language Association.         She is survived by a son, Malcolm Turnbull of Sydney, and two grandchildren.       
         Barbara A. Bannon, a retired executive editor of Publishers Weekly, died last Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital from injuries in a fall the day before.

Miss Bannon, who was born in Auburn, N.Y., and was a graduate of Manhattanville College, joined Publishers Weekly in 1946 and became chief fiction reviewer for Forecast, the publication's advance review section. She retired in 1983.         In 1978 Miss Bannon received the American Booksellers Association's Irita Van Doren Award for her contributions to promoting books as an instrument of culture. She was a Pulitzer Prize committee chairwoman and a judge of the general nonfiction category on four occasions.         She is survived by a cousin, Margaret Dermady of Syracuse.       
         Freda Resika Caspersen, an executive, philanthropist and former director of the Beneficial Corporation, died on Friday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey.

         Mildred Dunnock, the actress best known for her performances in stage and screen productions of "Death of a Salesman," died Friday evening at Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Oak Bluffs, Mass. She was 90 years old, said her daughter, Linda McGuire.         Her daughter said that Miss Dunnock died of old age. She lived in West Tisbury, Mass.         Miss Dunnock was nominated for Academy Awards for her film performances as Linda Loman, the salesman's wife, in "Death of a Salesman" (1951) and for her performance in Tennessee Williams's "Baby Doll" (1956).         She was small and slight with a thin, mobile mouth, and she excelled at playing the parts of mothers and eccentric ladies of various kinds. Her admirers praised her power to move audiences by making them care for the characters she portrayed.  Broadway's First Linda Loman         Miss Dunnock originated the Linda Loman role on the stage, appearing with Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman in the 1949 Broadway production of "Death of a Salesman," by Arthur Miller. She later played that part in the film, in regional productions and on television.         Appraising the film, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times that "as the long-suffering wife, Mildred Dunnock is simply superb, as she was on the stage" in her "portrayal of a woman who bears the agony of seeing her sons and husband turn out failures."         In an interview late in her career, Miss Dunnock observed: "I like to play parts that are not like myself. I'm not the least bit exciting. I'm an ordinary person in an ordinary life, but in my imagination there's no stopping me."         Among her other major portrayals were Lavinia in Lillian Hellman's "Another Part of the Forest," Big Mama in Tennessee Williams's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," and Miss Ronberry in "The Corn Is Green," a 1940 Emlyn Williams play starring Ethel Barrymore.  Many New Haven Productions         Miss Dunnock performed in numerous stage productions at the Long Wharf theater in New Haven over the decades, including the parts of Mrs. Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and the mother in Mr. Williams's "Glass Menagerie."         She taught in the late 1960's at the Yale Drama School. Over the years she also taught at Barnard College and at the Brearley School in Manhattan.         Mildred Dunnock was born in Baltimore Jan. 25, 1901, her daughter said. She earned an A.B. degree from Goucher College there and an M.A. from Columbia. She first appeared on Broadway in the early 1930's.         She became, as one New York Times writer, Warren Hoge, put it in 1976, "an institution among first-nighters, the creator of several major characters in American dramatic literature, a performer studied and revered by younger actors and actresses."         She is survived by her husband of almost 60 years, Keith Urmy, who is a retired executive of Chemical Bank in Manhattan; their daughter, Linda McGuire, an actress who teaches at the Educational Center for the Arts in New Haven; a granddaughter, Patricia McGuire, an actress who is a member of the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., and two grandsons.

         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died last night at her home in South Salem, N.Y., The Associated Press reported. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Dewhurst was pronounced dead by her personal physician, said Jan Stutts, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County Medical Examiner's Office. The cause of death was not immediately available.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten." She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses.         Her most recent New York appearances were on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in "Ah, Wilderness!," and as O'Neill's wife, Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1987. Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until last May.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant to use her distinctive, big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings." Born in Canada         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee Downer College, a girls' school, and decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side, shortly before he moved to Central Park. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice. Start of a Team         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming young performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two children, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Her first Broadway role with lines came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero. Starring With Jason Robards         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Ms. Dewhurst's other Broadway credits include the 1983 revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's comedy "You Can't Take It With You," in which she co-starred with Mr. Robards; O'Neill's "More Stately Mansions," with Ingrid Bergman in 1967; Edward Albee's adaptation of Carson McCullers's "Ballad of the Sad Cafe," in 1963, and a revival of Mr. Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," with Ben Gazzara and directed by Mr. Albee, for which she was nominated for a Tony in 1977.         She also appeared in many productions for Mr. Papp's Shakespeare Festival, including an "Antony and Cleopatra" in Central Park in 1963 without Mr. Scott (Michael Higgins played Antony) and stagings of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth." Her other Off Broadway plays include Athol Fugard's "Hello and Goodbye," in which she co-starred with Martin Sheen in 1969 and won a Drama Desk Award.         Her many films include Woody Allen's "Annie Hall"; "The Cowboys" and "McQ" with John Wayne; "Tribute" with Jack Lemmon; "The Nun's Story"; "A Fine Madness," and "Ice Castles."         She performed in the recent movie "Dying Young" with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!" Numerous TV Roles         On television she was seen with Candice Bergen on "Murphy Brown" in the last three seasons as Murphy's mother, Avery Brown, winning an Emmy Award in 1989. Her other television credits include productions of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," two Arthur Miller plays, "The Price" and "The Crucible," "No Exit," "The Women's Room," "As Is," "Anne of Green Gables," "Anne of Avonlea" and "Lantern Hill." She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about the most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to Campbell Scott, she is survived by another son, Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer, and two grandchildren.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses, whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died Thursday night at her home in South Salem, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died of cancer, said her son Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill. She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten."

Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings."         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee-Downer Collegewhere she decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice.         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two sons, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Ms. Dewhurst's first major Broadway role came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero.         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Among her many screen credits was the recent movie "Dying Young," with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!"         Her television appearances included three seasons playing Candice Bergen's mother on "Murphy Brown," for which she won an Emmy Award in 1989. She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship, because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to her sons, she is survived by two grandchildren. No public service is planned.

         Ruth G. Schapiro, a nationally known tax lawyer and a partner in the New York firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 64 years old.         Donald Schapiro, her husband of 39 years, said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Schapiro, a native of Manhattan, was a 1947 graduate of Wellesley College and received a law degree from Columbia Law School, where she was notes editor of the Law Review.

         Ann C. Whitman, an influential figure in the White House as the personal secretary to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and later as chief of staff to Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, died Tuesday at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, Fla. She was 83 years old and lived in Clearwater.         Mrs. Whitman died of heart failure, friends said.         "There's no question she played a vital role in the Eisenhower Administration; he really depended on her tremendously," said Robert J. Donovan, author of "Confidential Secretary: Ann Whitman's 20 Years with Eisenhower and Rockefeller" (E. P. Dutton, 1988).         Mrs. Whitman routinely worked 12 hours a day, and often seven days a week. Among her chores was supervising the President's responses to correspondence, which reached hundreds of thousands of letters a year. Recruited in 1952         Mrs. Whitman, whose maiden name was Cook, was born in Perry, Ohio, and attended Antioch College. As part of its work-study program, she went to the Institute for Child Guidance in New York City, became a secretary there and never returned to college. Her next job, which she held for 16 years, was as a personal secretary to Adele Rosenwald Levy, whose father was a founder of Sears, Roebuck & Company.         In the early 1950's Mrs. Whitman worked for the Committee for a Free Europe, which ran Radio Free Europe. She was then recruited for the Eisenhower Presidential campaign in 1952, and worked for Eisenhower through both of his Administrations.         In 1961 she worked for George Hinman, a political adviser to Rockefeller when he was Governor of New York, and became the Governor's executive assistant in 1965. In 1974, when President Gerald R. Ford named Rockefeller as Vice President, she served as his chief of staff. She retired in 1977.         Mrs. Whitman married Clarence Willard Moore in 1933, but the marriage ended in divorce. In 1940 she married Edmund Whitman, her first husband's business colleague at the United Fruit Company. That marriage also ended in divorce, in 1961.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Alice R. Bachrach, a volunteer leader of numerous national social service agencies who was involved in a landmark discrimination suit, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         Mrs. Bachrach died of cancer, her family said.         Among her early activities, she organized and was chairwoman of the Women's Division of the National Jewish Welfare Board and was a vice president of the board for 19 years. She was a board member of the United Service Organizations during World War II and the Korean war.         She also had been an honorary governor of Hebrew Union College, vice president of the New York City Y.W.H.A., vice president of the national Girl Scouts and chairwoman of its American Girl magazine, executive committee member of the New York Blood Center and a trustee of the Parsons School of Design.         Mrs. Bachrach, whose maiden name was Rothschild, was born and grew up in Manhattan and studied at Parsons. She married Alfred R. Bachrach, a prominent accounting executive and president of Temple Emanu-El, the world's largest Reform Jewish congregation. Mr. Bachrach has since died.         In a landmark case 30 years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Bachrach filed a religious-discrimination complaint against a Park Avenue cooperative for rejecting their application to buy an apartment. The city Human Rights Commission upheld their complaint and moved for injunctive relief, the first time the agency exercised that remedy against a cooperative.         Mrs. Bachrach is survived by her twin sons, John, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and Robert, of Manhattan and Southbury, Conn., and a daughter, Ellin Gordon, of Williamsburg, Va.       
         Melissa Gold, who was active in various civic causes, including help for earthquake victims in San Francisco and was a companion of Bill Graham, the rock music impressario, died Friday in the helicopter crash near San Francisco that killed Mr. Graham and his pilot. She was 47 years old and lived in San Francisco.         Mrs. Gold was also a member of a prominent East Coast family. Her father, Joseph Richardson Dilworth, is a former chairman and chief executive officer of the Rockefeller Group in New York City.         Mrs. Gold was born in Washington and grew up in Princeton, N.J. She was a graduate of Radcliffe College and moved to San Francisco, where she married Herbert Gold, a writer. After a divorce, she married Robert L. Anderson, a lawyer, from who she was also divorced.         She and Mr. Graham were first acquainted about 12 years ago, her father said, and their friendship was renewed when they worked on the plans for the public welcoming of Nelson Mandela to San Francisco last year. They had recently been working on a project to provide money to improve public schools.         Besides her father, survivors include her mother, Elizabeth, of Princeton; a daughter, Nina Gold of New York City; twin sons, Ethan Gold, a student at Harvard University, and Ari Gold, a student at Columbia University; a sister, Alexandria (Lucy) Nolan of Silver City, N.M., and two brothers, Charles D. Dilworth of San Francisco and Joseph R. Dilworth Jr. of Bronxville, N.Y.       
         Sylvia Fine Kaye, a producer, lyricist and composer, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old.         She died of emphysema, said her daughter, Dena Kaye of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaye, the widow of the actor Danny Kaye, wrote the music and lyrics for many of her husband's films, including "Up in Arms" (1944), "Wonder Man" (1945), "The Kid from Brooklyn" (1946), "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (1947), "The Inspector General" (1949) and "The Court Jester" (1956).         A native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College, where she studied music. After college, she helped put on skits at a summer camp in Pennsylvania, where her fellow entertainers included Imogene Coca, Max Liebman and Danny Kaye. There she began writing specialty material, including a Yiddish version of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado" for Mr. Kaye. In 1940, the sketches were produced on Broadway under the title "The Straw Hat Revue."         That year, she married Mr. Kaye, and the couple worked as a popular act at La Martinique, a Manhattan nightclub. Mrs. Kaye wrote the music and lyrics for her husband and accompanied him on piano. Wit and Patter         Mrs. Kaye was known for her complex, witty lyrics, and she was often described as a composer of patter songs, which turn on the rapid delivery of tricky lines. Most frequently cited are "Anatole of Paris," "The Lobby Number" and "Soliloquy for Three Heads," the last sung by three mirror images in "The Inspector General." But Mrs. Kaye disagreed with this characterization. "I wrote many songs for Danny that had patter sections in them," she once told an interviewer, "but only two pure patter songs." They were "Melody in 4-F" and a variation of "The Nightmare Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe." For the film "Knock on Wood" (1954), she wrote "All About You," which Cole Porter called "a perfect love song."         For most of her career, Mrs. Kaye wrote songs and music solely for her husband. She once estimated that she wrote more than 100 songs for him during their 40-year collaboration. She was also involved in the production of almost all his films. She was twice nominated fpr Academy Awards for her work on "The Five Pennies" (1959) and "The Moon Is Blue" (1953). Musical Comedy on Television         In the 1970's, she embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971 and at Yale in 1975. In 1979, she produced and narrated the course as a 90-minute PBS program, "Musical Comedy Tonight," which won a Peabody Award. In 1975 she was executive producer for a television special, "Danny Kaye: Look In at the Met." She also produced and edited "Assignment Children," a Unicef film that starred her husband.         In the last three years, Mrs. Kaye devoted most of her time to writing a book about her life with Mr. Kaye, "Fine and Danny," for Alfred A. Knopf. She was also writing a catalogue of show-business material that she and her husband had donated to the Library of Congress.         Brooklyn College awarded her an honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1985. This year she endowed the Sylvia Fine Chair in Musical Theater there. She recently financed the restoration of the 664-seat Playhouse at Hunter College.         Mr. Kaye died in 1987 at age of 74. Mrs. Kaye is survived by her daughter, a magazine and television journalist, and a sister, Rhoda Gamson of New York City.         Correction:  October 30, 1991, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the songwriter Sylvia Fine Kaye omitted a survivor. He is Robert Fine Forrest, of Manhattan, her brother.       
         Leah Silberzan Sayles, a leader in the movement to legalize abortion in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan.         She was 61 years old and died of a brain tumor, her family said.         Ms. Sayles joined the board of directors of the Abortion Justice Association in 1969, was a founding member of the National Abortion Federation and was active in the National Abortion Rights Action League.         Soon after earning a master's degree in social work from the University of Pittsburgh in 1968, she became the counseling director for Planned Parenthood in Western Pennsylvania, based in Pittsburgh. In 1973 she established Women's Health Services in Pittsburgh and served as its executive director for 11 years. The agency at one time described itself as the nation's largest nonprofit abortion clinic.         She is survived by her husband, Donald; two sons, David, of Manhattan and Adam, of Kenova, W. Va., and a sister, Frances Edlitz of Rockville, Md.       
         Mary Vandergrift, a founder and longtime executive of Parke-Bernet Galleries auction house and for many years a major figure in international auctions, died in her sleep on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and also had a home in Bucks County, Pa.         Her daughter, Joan Sweeney of Manhattan, said the cause of death was heart failure.         Ms. Vandergrift was born in Philadelphia on Sept. 4, 1901, and attended college there. Pursuing an interest in art and antiques, she worked for American Art Galleries, later known as American Art Anderson Galleries, a well-known auction house in New York. In 1937, she left American Art with a group of employees that included Hiram H. Parke, Otto Bernet, Leslie A. Hyam and Lewis Marion. Together they formed Parke-Bernet Galleries, which came to dominate New York City's art and antiques auction scene.         Throughout her assocation with the house, Miss Vandergrift oversaw press relations and the design and production of catalogues. When Parke-Bernet was acquired by Sotheby & Company, an English auction house, in 1963, she was named executive vice president of the new firm, Sotheby Parke Bernet. When she retired in 1971, she was succeeded by John Marion, who is now chairman of the firm, which changed its name to Sotheby's Inc. in 1985.         Miss Vandergrift was on the board of the Northside Center for Child Development. Her first husband, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Sr., a career officer in the Army, died in the early 1950's; in 1968 she married E. Swift Newton, an Irish businessman, who died in 1974.         She is survived by her daughter; a sister, Katherine, of Manhattan; her step-son, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Jr., of Orlando, Fla., and three granddaughters.       
         Eleanor Pollock Hughes, former top editor of three national magazines and a public relations executive for several Federal agencies, died Friday at Sibley Hospital in Washington. She was 91 years old and lived in Arlington, Va.         Mrs. Hughes died of heart disease, friends said.         Known professionally as Eleanor Pollock, she was a magazine editor in New York City for nearly three decades, starting in the 1930's. She was the editor in chief of Cue and Family Life, the managing editor of Charm and an assistant to Fleur Cowles in the women's division of Look and Quick magazines at Cowles Publications.         Switching to daily newspapers, she became the editor of the women's section at the Philadelphia Bulletin from the late 1950's to 1965. In that period she was also chairwoman of the Coty American Fashion Critics Award organization. Held Various Federal Posts         Serving in the Government from 1965 to 1973, she variously held the posts of the White House liaison for Project Head Start, public affairs director for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Commission on Product Safety and the National Commission on Materials Policy and press secretary to Betty Furness, when she was President Lyndon B. Johnson's special assistant for consumer affairs.         After leaving government employment, Mrs. Hughes did freelance writing and public relations consulting.         She was born in New York City, the daughter of Alice Leal Pollock, an actress and playwright, and was educated at the Gardner and Finch Schools.         She was married and divorced from Byron Darnton, a reporter for The New York Times who was the first American correspondent killed while covering World War II. Her second husband, Albion Hughes, also a journalist, is deceased.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Allegra Maynard, a retired headmistress of the Madeira School in Greenway, Va., died Wednesday at the North Hill Retirement Center in Needham, Mass., where she resided. She was 94 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, a spokeswoman for the school said.         Miss Maynard joined the staff at Madeira, a college preparatory school for girls, in 1931, the year the school moved from Washington to its present site on the Potomac River. After serving as associate headmistress, Miss Maynard became co-headmistress with Lucy Madeira Wing, who founded the school in 1906, succeeding her as headmistress in 1957.         Retiring at age 65 in 1962, Miss Maynard settled in Dedham, Mass., and went back to school, auditing classes at Wellesley College. She came out of retirement in 1964 to serve another year as headmistress at Madeira.         In June 1985, the school honored Miss Maynard with the dedication of a new faculty housing complex, called the Allegra Maynard Quadrangle.         Born in East Weymouth, Mass., she grew up in California and attended the University of California at Berkeley. She graduated in 1919 from Wheaton College, which awarded her an honorary master's degree in 1953, calling her a "wise counselor and able administrator."         While at Madeira, Miss Maynard served six years on the executive committee of the National Council of Independent Schools and was its chairwoman for three years. She was also a member at large of the College Entrance Examination Board, and held the posts of secretary and president of the Head Mistresses Association of the East.         She served 10 years as treasurer of the Fairfax, Va., chapter of the American Red Cross.         She is survived by a niece, Barbara B. Howe of Marion, Mass.       
         Jean Wade Rindlaub, one of the first American women to become a major advertising executive, died on Thursday at the Courtland Garden Health Center in Stamford, Conn. She was 87 years old and lived in Stamford. She died of complications from a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Rindlaub, in 34 years at the Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn agency in Manhattan, rose to head of a copy group and in 1946 became a vice president, the first woman at that level in the company. In 1954, she became the first woman on the company board. The American Advertising Federation named her woman of the year in 1951 and in 1989 elected her to its hall of fame.         Recognizing the growing importance of homemakers and working women, Mrs. Rindlaub organized nearly 400 women at the agency into sounding boards for products and marketing. As forerunners of marketing-research focus groups, they offered ideas and reactions for products, brand names, packaging and advertising.         Mrs. Rindlaub, born in Lancaster, Pa., was from a Pennsylvania Dutch family. As a teen-ager, she taught typing and shorthand at her father's business school and worked for Armstrong Cork as a secretary to the advertising manager. She became editor of company publications.         She joined B. B. D.&O. in 1930 as a copywriter and supervised campaigns for United Fruit, General Mills and Campbell's Soup. Her slogan for Oneida silverware, "Back home for keeps," resonated as a wartime theme in the 40's. Her work appeared in two compilations, "100 Top Copywriters and Their Favorite Ads" and "100 Greatest Advertisements."         She was a vice chairwoman of the National Safety Council, wrote a newsletter column for the National Council of Women, was a director of the Advertising Women of New York and the Fashion Group and was an adviser to the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.         Appointed under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to the New York State Council of Women, she was the principal author of a report, "New York Women and Their Changing World." She participated in White House Conferences on Nutrition held by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon and was a delegate to a White House Conference on Aging.         For 50 years she lived in Teaneck, N.J., where she was a co-founder of the Senior Services Center and was chairwoman of the Friendship House, the Advisory Board on Senior Citizens and the Advisory Board on Community Relations. She was citizen of the year in 1981. In Stamford she volunteered as a teacher's assistant.         Her husband, Willard, died in 1983. Surviving are a son, John, of Riverside, Conn.; a daughter, Anne Dow of Cambridge, Mass.; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Vredenburgh Bush, the secretary of the Democratic National Committee who called the roll and tallied the votes at 12 national conventions from 1944 to 1988, died on Saturday in a hospital in Naples, Fla. She was 75 years old.         Mrs. Bush died of lung cancer, her stepdaughter, Jan Bush Jennings, told The Associated Press.         At each Democratic national convention, from the one that nominated the Roosevelt-Truman ticket to the one that drafted Michael S. Dukakis and Lloyd Bensten, Mrs. Bush called the role of states in a slight, but crisp, Dixie-accented voice that made her a fixture of the convention floor and a legend in the party. 'Born a Democrat'         "I was born a Democrat," she said before the 1976 convention, "like most people were born into religion."         Dorothy McElroy was born on Dec. 8, 1916, in Baldwyn, Miss., the third daughter of a postmaster. When she was in the eighth grade, her family moved to Columbus, Miss., so that she and her sisters could attend Mississippi State College for Women, from which she graduated in 1938.         In 1940, she married Peter Vredenburgh 3d, a wealthy Alabama lumberman and prominent Democrat, and quickly became enmeshed in politics. She was elected national committee woman of the Alabama Young Democrats in 1941 and a vice-president of the Young Democratic Clubs of America in 1943.         She was just 27 years old when she was named secretary to the Democratic National Committee in 1944. She was the first woman -- and the youngest person -- ever to serve in the position, which is unpaid.         Mr. Vredenburgh died in 1956, and in 1962 she married John W. Bush, then a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission.         In addition to her work at the conventions, she also arranged meetings of the national and executive committees and kept party records.         She retired in September 1989.         In addition to Mr. Bush and Mrs. Jennings, she is survived by another stepdaughter, Emily Bush Zuckett.       
         Mary McDonough Phillips, an editor who helped train a generation of fashion journalists, died last Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center after a long illness. She was 77 years old and lived in New York City and Jupiter, Fla.         She had suffered from a blood disorder for more than 20 years, said her husband, Lynn Phillips.         Soon after graduating from Rosemount College in Rosemount, Pa., in 1935, she joined the Hearst Corporation, starting at Good Housekeeping magazine. She then moved to Harper's Bazaar, becoming executive editor in 1952. Carmel Snow, Nancy White and Dianna Vreeland were among her associates during the 1950's and 1960's.         In 1971 she was named director of marketing of Harper's Bazaar, and in 1980 became retail marketing manager of Town & Country. Though she retired in 1984, she continued as consultant to Town & Country until the end.         Through much of her career, she served as liaison between editorial and advertising deparments and helped shape the direction of the magazines for which she worked. Her friends included major fashion figures such as the designers Ben Zuckerman, Archie Davidow and Norman Norell.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Michael, of St. Louis, four grandchildren and a brother, Edward, of Bridgehampton, N.Y.       
         Jeannette E. Kriendler, a philanthropist and the wife of H. Peter Kreindler, the longtime chairman of "21" Club, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kriendler, who had been suffering from osteoporosis, diabetes and pulmonary disease, collapsed at her Fifth Avenue apartment yesterday morning and died at Mount Sinai a short time later, her husband said.         Mrs. Kriendler was born in New York City and was a graduate of New York University. During World War II she served in a number of executive positions with the Brooklyn chapter of the Motor Transport Service of the American Women's Voluntary Services, the organization that aided the armed forces and local military bases.         She married Mr. Kriendler in 1933, three years after his brother, Jack, founded "21" Club on West 52d Street. Mr. Kriendler was chairman from 1938 to 1989, when he became honorary chairman.         Mrs. Kriendler was a longtime contributor to the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera and helped raise funds for them. She also contributed to Cornell University Veterinary School in Ithaca, N.Y.         Besides her husband, there are no immediate survivors.       
         Greta Kempton, a painter whose portrait of President Harry S. Truman hangs in the White House, died on Monday at her home in New York City. She was 89 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Daisy Dickson of Norfolk, Va.         Miss Kempton, who was born in Vienna, started painting life-size portraits while still a child. She studied art in Vienna and, after her family moved to the United States in the early 1920's, at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League in New York City. By the mid-1930's, she was living in California and was well-established as a painter of commissioned portraits, with Hollywood studio heads like Louis B. Mayer and Adolf Zukor among her clients.         In the 1940's she painted portraits of several members of the Truman Administration and their families, which led to commissions for portraits of the President, his wife and daughter.         Miss Kempton's husband, A. M. McNamara, a lawyer and business executive, died several years ago.
