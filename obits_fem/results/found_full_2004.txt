         Janet Frame, whose vividly romantic explorations of madness and language in novels, poetry and autobiography propelled her to worldwide attention, died yesterday in Dunedin, New Zealand. She was 79.         Dunedin Hospital said the cause was acute leukemia, The Associated Press reported.         In 1973 she legally changed her surname to Clutha, after the river south of Oamaru, her childhood home, but continued to write under the name Janet Frame.         Ms. Frame's work used her own disturbing life to weave fictional nightmares that reflected, in her words, the ''homelessness of self.'' After a suicide attempt she spent eight years in mental hospitals in New Zealand, receiving 200 electroshock treatments. She was about to have a lobotomy when a hospital official read that she had won a literary prize. She was released.         Later, a panel of psychiatrists determined that she had never had schizophrenia. In the sort of bitterly perceptive, highly personalized twist that infuses much of her writing, that news did not please her.         ''Oh why had they robbed me of my schizophrenia, which had been the answer to all my misgivings about myself?'' she wrote in the third volume of her autobiography, which, with the first two, was dramatized in Jane Campion's 1990 film ''An Angel at My Table.''         ''Like King Lear I had gone in search of 'the truth' and now I had nothing,'' she continued.         Ms. Frame's 12 novels, four story collections, one poetry collection and three volumes of autobiography won dozens of awards.         ''As the body of her work has enlarged, one comes to understand it not just as a series of extraordinary insights into suffering and thought, but as a mighty exploration of human consciousness and its context in the natural world,'' the American Academy of Arts and Letters citation read when she was made an honorary foreign member in 1986.         In her novel ''The Edge of the Alphabet'' (Braziller, 1965) words literally crumble into meaninglessness and communication becomes useless. Even spelling becomes sinister. In ''Intensive Care'' (Braziller, 1970) she spells history hiss-tree to make an unsettling connection to Eden's serpent. ''All dreams,'' she wrote, ''lead back to the nightmare garden.''         Ms. Frame created romantic visionaries -- eccentrics, mad people, epileptics -- and pitted them against the repressive forces of a sterile, conformist society. Or maybe she was just reporting on her life. A continuing discussion among critics was whether her autobiographical work was mostly fiction or whether her fiction was mostly autobiographical.         Janet Paterson Frame was born on Aug. 28, 1924, in Dunedin. Her father was a railroad engineer. Her mother, who once worked as a maid in the home of the New Zealand writer Katherine Mansfield, wrote poems that she sold door to door.         Janet's youth was blighted by the drownings of two sisters. She attended the local teachers' training college, where she felt so lonely that she found peace sitting among tombstones in a cemetery. While practice teaching, she panicked when an inspector entered the classroom, and she fled, never to return. She suffered a breakdown that was misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.         After her eight years in two psychiatric hospitals, she was befriended on her release by Frank Sargeson, a writer, who let her stay in an army hut in his backyard in Auckland, New Zealand. She wrote her first novel, ''Owls Do Cry'' (Pegasus, 1957), while staying there. The narrator was Daphne, a patient in a mental hospital.         She next traveled abroad on a grant from the New Zealand government, and in London a panel of psychiatrists determined she was not mentally ill, just different from other people. While living in Europe she published five novels from 1961 to 1963.         Ms. Frame is survived by her sister, June Gordon.         She returned to New Zealand in 1964 and wrote more novels, and three volumes of autobiography (Braziller, 1982, 1984, 1985). Despite the deep introspection of her writing, she developed a reputation as a private person.         In the early 1990's she had two mild strokes, which affected her mental stamina and power of concentration, but she continued to write.         ''Writing is a boon, analgesic, and so on,'' she said. ''I think it's all that matters to me. I dread emerging from it each day.''         Correction:  February 20, 2004, Friday  An obituary of the New Zealand novelist Janet Frame on Jan. 30 omitted attribution for a sentence describing the characters in her work: ''Ms. Frame created romantic visionaries -- eccentrics, mad people, epileptics -- and pitted them against the repressive forces of a sterile, conformist society.'' It was derived from the Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature (Oxford University Press), as reprinted on the New Zealand Book Council's web site, www.bookcouncil.org.nz.       
         Joan Delano Aiken, a prodigious weaver of tales for adults and children, died on Sunday at her home in Petworth, in West Sussex, England. She was 79.         Her death was announced by Brandt & Hochman, her literary agents, in New York.         Ms. Aiken's fiction could have a Dickensian atmosphere, evoke a somewhat skewed history of Olde England or be straightforward.         Much of it was in her chosen genre: nonhistorical adventure, tinged with suspense and horror, often featuring ghosts.         Her most famous book, ''The Wolves of Willoughby Chase,'' illustrated by Pat Marriott, appeared in 1962 and became an evergreen. It tells of two girls in a great English country house, and it leavens suspenseful Victorian melodrama with tongue-in-cheek humor.         Recommended for children in Grades 5 to 9, it was also turned into dramatic versions staged in many schools. Charles Schlesinger, an agent at Brandt & Hochman, said the book sold many thousands of copies every year in English and various translations; it is still in print in the 1987 Delacorte edition.         Mr. Schlesinger said that what is apparently her final book, ''The Witch of Clatteringshaws,'' is scheduled for publication by Delacorte next January. Her first, ''All You've Ever Wanted and Other Stories,'' was published 50 years ago.         In between she wrote more than 100 books, with ''Bone and Dream,'' ''The Scream,'' ''Ghostly Beasts,'' ''In Thunder's Pocket'' and ''Lady Catherine's Necklace,'' all published in Britain since 2000. As of last count, 29 of her books were in print in the United States.         Her ''Arabel's Raven'' series of humorous adventures, most of them also published in the United States, was adapted for television by the BBC. Her adult novels included mysteries and what she called her Jane Austen sequence, which included ''Mansfield Revisited'' (Doubleday, 1985), and ''Jane Fairfax: Jane Austen's Emma Through Another's Eyes'' (St. Martin's, 1991), a sequel to the Austen novel.         Joan Aiken was born in Rye, England, a daughter of the American poet Conrad Aiken and his first wife, Jessie McDonald. Having decided on a literary career early in life, she published some poetry in a prestigious little magazine but found that prose paid better.         She developed her story writing while working for the BBC and the Information Ministry during and just after World War II. She met her first husband, Ronald George Brown, a journalist, during that period.         They married in 1945 and had two children, John S. Brown and Elizabeth D. Charlaff, who survive her, along with Ms. Aiken's sister, Jane A. Hodge, and two grandchildren.         After Ron Brown's death in 1955, Ms. Aiken supported herself working as a features editor for British Argosy magazine and as a copywriter for J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency. After 1961 she devoted herself exclusively to writing fiction.         She also spent some years as a trans-Atlantic commuter after her second marriage, to Julius Goldstein, in 1976. An artist and former member of the Hunter College faculty, he died in 2002.         Her work earned many honors, including an Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America for ''Night Fall'' (Holt, 1970). In 1999 Queen Elizabeth II made her a member of the Order of the British Empire for her contributions to children's literature.       
         Olivia Goldsmith, author of the popular comic novel ''The First Wives Club,'' died late yesterday afternoon at Lenox Hill Hospital from complications related to anesthesia, said her literary agent, Nicholas Ellison. She was 54.         On Wednesday she entered the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospitals for elective surgery to remove loose skin under her chin, Mr. Ellison said. As she went under anesthesia, she had a heart attack and the doctors were unable to get oxygen into her system, he said. She went into a coma, was transferred to Lenox Hill Hospital, and never recovered.         Born Randy Goldfield in New York to Mark and Estelle Goldfield, she grew up in Dumont, N.J., and attended New York University.         Ms. Goldfield became one of the first women in the emerging profession of management consulting and quickly became one of the first to be a partner at the firm Booz Allen Hamilton.         But she had always longed to be a writer, her sister Barbara Turner said.         ''She had read everything and, what is more, could recite by memory from everything she read,'' Ms. Turner said.         After a divorce from her husband, a business executive, she lived in London and changed her legal name to Justine Rendal. She created the pen name Olivia Goldsmith, Mr. Ellison said, when she decided to write.         Her debut novel was ''The First Wives Club''(Arrow, 1992), which playfully imagined the revenge of three women who had been dumped by their husbands for younger second wives. A best seller, that book was also made into a successful movie in 1996, starring Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler. Ms. Hawn played a flashy Hollywood diva who had plastic surgery to retain her youthful looks, but wound up with a decidedly comic outcome.         Ms. Goldsmith wrote more than a half dozen humorous novels, including ''Switcheroo'' (HarperCollins, 1998) and ''Young Wives'' (HarperCollins, 2000).         Although critics frequently dismissed her books as trite, she kept a solid following among readers and Hollywood producers who found her tales highly satisfying social commentary, if not high literary art.         In an interview with The Sunday Express of London, she said she wrote from anger, and she told ABC in 1998: ''Well, I just like things to work out fairly, you know? And that's why I write fiction, because in real life they don't always -- everything isn't fair. And, you know, the cards are stacked against women.''         Said Mr. Ellison, ''She wrote these wonderful, celebratory satires, which seamlessly wove her moral convictions and instruction into these popular entertainments.''         In addition to her mother and sister, Ms. Goldsmith's survivors include another sister, Kate Goldfield.         Correction:  January 20, 2004, Tuesday  An obituary on Friday about the novelist Olivia Goldsmith, who died of complications related to anesthesia for elective surgery, misstated the date she entered the hospital. It was Jan. 7, not Jan. 14. The obituary also misidentified the first publisher of her debut novel, ''The First Wives Club.'' It was Poseidon Press, not Arrow.       
         Irma Fleck, a physician's wife who looked at the vacant lots and abandoned buildings of her South Bronx neighborhood and retaliated by starting organizations to celebrate art and turn rubble piles into emerald oases, died on Feb. 11 in Naples, Fla.         She was 84 and lived in Naples.         The cause was complications after a broken hip, said her daughter, Bonnie Oppenberg.         Among many other initiatives, Mrs. Fleck helped develop the Claremont Neighborhood Center in the South Bronx, the Bronx Council on the Arts and the Bronx Museum. She also hatched a plan to turn compost from the Hunts Point Market into compost for developing lots that had been ravaged by arson.         ''When I work at something, it's like my child,'' she said in an interview with Newsday in 1994. ''I work intensively, and whatever the project, it becomes very important to me.''         Herman Badillo, a former Bronx borough president, said in an interview yesterday that he remembered Mrs. Fleck as being very aggressive in pursuing project after project.         ''She was one of the most active volunteers in the Bronx,'' he said.         Fernando Ferrer, another former Bronx borough president, said in an interview with The Riverdale Press last week that Mrs. Fleck ''put her own stamp on the Bronx in a very important way.''         Irma Lowenthal was born on Oct. 28, 1919, in Poland, the second of three children. Her father, a doctor, ran his practice out of the family's home near Crotona Park, in the heart of the South Bronx. In the three-story house, the family often put up Jewish refugees who like themselves had fled Hitler.         Miss Lowenthal graduated from Walton High School, earned degrees from Queens College and New York University and worked for her father as an X-ray technician. In 1940, she married Henry Fleck, a physician who had fled Europe in 1932. The newlyweds moved in with relatives on Washington Avenue in the Bronx.         The couple continued living in the Washington Avenue house, where Mrs. Fleck had two children, who survive her, Mrs. Oppenberg, of Marco Island, Fla., and Gary Fleck of Safat, Israel. She is also survived by two brothers, both of whom live in New Jersey, and two grandsons. Dr. Fleck died in 1990.         She believed a physician's wife should be active in the community in which he worked and in 1956 was a founder of the Claremont Neighborhood Center on East 169th Street. She was its president for 11 years, successfully pushing initiatives for affordable housing.         The Flecks moved to a penthouse on the Grand Concourse in the 1960's, and in the 1970's Mrs. Fleck held meetings there to try to reverse the decline of the South Bronx. Eventually, these meetings and contacts would lead to the Bronx Museum, which Mrs. Fleck helped found, forming a group in 1986 called the Committee to Make the Concourse Grand Again.         In 1967, Mrs. Fleck formed the Bronx Committee on the Arts. It soon merged with the Bronx Council on the Arts, formed by Gerald Klot in 1961. Mr. Klot's long involvement in the arts in the Bronx included organizing the Bronx Symphony Orchestra in 1945.         The new organization took the name of Mr. Klot's organization and found a home at the Bronx Community College, part of the City University of New York.         At first, ''We had a couple of drawers in a file there,'' Mrs. Fleck said in an interview with The New York Times in 1971.         The council soon found itself coordinating a host of cultural groups, including the Bronx Opera Company, the Bronx Experimental Theater, the Festival of Poetry and the Bronx Showcase of the Visual Arts.         Mrs. Fleck, as executive director of the council, was proudest of her role in creating the museum. It was housed until 1982 in the rotunda of the Bronx County Courthouse, and from the beginning its exhibitions focused on contemporary artists, minority artists and artists from the Bronx.         In 1982, the museum took over the former Young Israel of the Concourse Synagogue, on the corner of 165th Street and the Grand Concourse, which had been sold to the city by its dwindling congregation. Mrs. Fleck raised public and private money to build an exhibition gallery, classrooms and offices, as well as a new glass-walled lobby.         Perhaps her best known accomplishment was collecting spoiling produce from the huge wholesale center at Hunts Point and selling it for compost. With Jack Flanagan, a former police officer, she formed the Bronx Frontier Development Corporation, which collected as much as 40 tons of compost daily.         The compost was used to fertilize new gardens on vacant lots. ''We're in the recycling business,'' Mrs. Fleck said. ''We're recycling land.''         When the vegetable market began to bag its waste in plastic, Mrs. Fleck persuaded the Bronx Zoo to give her the droppings of elephants and other herbivores to use for fertilizer. She called it ZooDoo, and sold some of it in two-pound bags for $2.50 in smart Manhattan stores.       
         Trude Wenzel Lash, inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt to become a children's advocate through the Citizens Commission for Children of New York, died on Wednesday at her home in Greenwich Village, her family said. She was 95.         Mrs. Lash was an early mainstay of the commission, which Mrs. Roosevelt helped found in 1944. Mrs. Lash, a refugee from Germany who befriended Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt, became the commission's program director in 1946 and was its executive director from 1952 to 1972.         After that, Mrs. Lash devoted herself to the Roosevelt legacy through the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in Hyde Park, N.Y. Until 2000, she was the institute's co-chairwoman with Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and at her death both were honorary chairmen of the institute, housed at the Franklin Roosevelt Library.         Trude Lash was born Gertrud Wenzel in June 1908 in Freiburg, Germany. A rebellious girl and brilliant student, she was thrown out of convent school, went on to study journalism in Berlin and, while teaching kindergarten and first grade, attended the University of Heidelberg.         At the University of Freiburg, she received a doctorate in philosophy in 1930. She came to New York for a year as an exchange teacher of philosophy and German literature at Hunter College while doing graduate work in the social sciences at Columbia.         Back in Germany, she wrote for a newspaper opposed to the Nazis. But in 1932 she returned to New York for good as the wife of Eliot D. Pratt, a member of a socially prominent family, and the couple helped other refugees from Europe find their way to the United States. They were divorced in 1943, and he died in 1969.         In 1944, she married Joseph P. Lash, a journalist and confidant of Eleanor Roosevelt, who played matchmaker to the couple. Mr. Lash wrote the two-volume biography ''Eleanor and Franklin,'' published in 1972.         Mrs. Lash, who worked for the Human Rights Commission at the United Nations before joining the staff of the Citizens Commission for Children, collected data on the status of children in New York for major studies in 1976 and 1980. She was principal investigator for the studies' reports, called ''State of the Child: New York City I and II.'' The reports were influential in inspiring similar studies elsewhere.         After retiring, she continued her advocacy through the Foundation for Child Development and became directly involved in the Roosevelt memorials. After Mrs. Roosevelt's death in 1962, Congress had authorized an Eleanor Roosevelt Institute. Mrs. Lash helped establish the combined Franklin and Eleanor Institute in 1984 and until just before her death remained a consultant on Roosevelt memorabilia.         Trude Wenzel Lash is survived by three sons, Dr. Peter W. Pratt of Bridgewater, Conn., Roger S. Pratt of New Milford, Conn., and Jonathan Lash of Washington; a daughter, Vera C. Pratt, also of Washington; a brother, Heinz Wenzel of Germany; 11 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren. Joseph Lash died in 1987.         Her commission work, which ranged from studying day care and foster care to juvenile detention, often involved sending volunteers to institutions to see how children were treated. It sometimes led to confrontations with officialdom.         ''All too often we take our most difficult children and we turn over their care to professionals, and we leave the matter,'' Trude Lash said in an interiew with The New York Times in 1972. ''But professionals, even good ones, are primarily interested in their jobs and their routines. What is needed is someone who is primarily interested in the children.''         Correction:  February 7, 2004, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about Trude Wenzel Lash, an advocate for children in New York City, misstated the name of the organization for which she worked until 1972. It is the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, not Citizens Commission. Because of an editing error, the obituary also misstated the name of the organization for which she later worked on reports called ''State of the Child: New York City I and II.'' It is the Foundation for Child Development, not the committee.       
         Joan McCord, a criminologist who marshaled mountains of evidence to question the effectiveness of social programs championed by both liberals and conservatives, died Tuesday at her home in Narberth, Pa. She was 73.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Robert.         In 12 books and many other writings, Dr. McCord, a professor at Temple University, disputed the effectiveness in fighting crime of boys' clubs, summer camps, programs in which young offenders visit prisons, D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) and other popular programs.         The first woman to be president of the American Society of Criminology, she was known for her use of longitudinal studies, which follow subjects for many years. Her goal was to examine the long-term effects of programs, ranging from individual mentoring programs often favored by conservatives to social work efforts frequently advocated by liberals.         Dr. McCord believed that just as the government monitors the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals, the public should examine data to determine if well-meaning interventions to help people might, in fact, be harmful. Often, she found that programs had no built-in procedure to evaluate their success.         More troubling, she said, was that officials sometimes resisted evaluation of programs, in part because they regarded it as an affront to their good intentions. She also said she sensed a fear that solid criticism of one social program might brand all as ineffective.         ''That fear, perhaps justified in some quarters, would be like blocking publication of damaging effects of Celebrex, thalidomide, or estrogen because the publication could slow work in disease prevention,'' she wrote in the May 2003 issue of The Annals, the publication of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.         Her best-known longitudinal study was her 1978 follow-up on a youth-mentoring program done 30 years earlier in Cambridge and Somerville, Mass. She found that boys at high risk who had been given mentors, health-care services and summer camp fared worse in later life than a similar group of boys who were given nothing special. The 250 boys who got special services were more likely to become criminals, have trouble in their jobs and marriages, and become alcoholics, according to court, hospital and other records noted in her study.         A possible reason, Dr. McCord suggested, was that those boys had felt they were given the attention because something was wrong with them, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. Her theory was that the boys who went to summer camp modeled themselves after camp troublemakers.         The counterintuitive result contradicted the statements of two-thirds of the participants that the program had helped them by giving them better values and keeping them off the streets.         In other studies, she found that some youths counseled by court-appointed volunteers fared worse than those who received no counseling. Her statistical analysis of a program in Australia that provided recreation for troubled adolescents found bad effects. And participants in the Scared Straight program, which takes young offenders from many locales to visit prisons, were arrested more often than a control group, she found.         She said that D.A.R.E., the popular nationwide ''just say no'' drug education program in which law enforcement officers spend time in schools talking about drugs, alcohol and violence, may actually have contributed to drug use, according to her analysis of statistics from the program.         Joan Fish was born in Manhattan on Aug. 4, 1930. After graduating from Stanford in 1952, she did graduate work in philosophy at Harvard and Stanford. She earned her doctorate in sociology from Stanford in 1968.         She wrote some of her early papers with her first husband, William M. McCord. Their marriage ended in divorce. Both he and her second husband, Carl A. Silver, are dead.         Dr. McCord is survived by her sons, Geoffrey Sayre-McCord of Durham, N.C., and Robert McCord of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; her ward, whom she regarded as a family member, Tom Underwood of Boston; her brother, Robert Fish of Santa Cruz, Calif.; her sister, Connie Arnosti of Milwaukee; and four grandsons.         Her often pithy remarks appeared in articles about crime in many newspapers and magazines. The New York Times in 1996 asked her about a 12-year-old arrested on charges of gang rape and murder and who was turned in by his mother.         Of the mother's dilemma, Dr. McCord said, ''It's almost impossible to imagine a good thing to do with a gun-toting 12-year-old.''       
         Princess Juliana, the modest and beloved queen of The Netherlands for 32 years, died early Saturday. She was 94.         The government announced that she had died of pneumonia at the Soestdijk Palace, her longtime home, surrounded by three of her four daughters, including Queen Beatrix. Her fourth daughter, Christina, arrived shortly afterward from New York.         Remembering Juliana, who reigned from 1948 to 1980, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende praised her sense of duty and personal warmth. ''In her own words, she had wanted to be a social worker if she had not been queen,'' he said.         In one way, she was a social worker. Born to privilege and wealth, Juliana made much effort, both as the queen and after she turned over her throne to her daughter, to bring the monarchy closer to the people. She spent much time visiting the sick, the handicapped, the aged and needy children. By many accounts, she helped steer successive governments toward policies promoting social welfare.         Her personal popularity probably helped save the monarchy during several severe crises, when critics agitated for the country to abandon the rituals and symbols of the past and become a modern republic.         Juliana spent her final years in seclusion. For some time she had been unable to recognize her family because of memory loss, said her husband, Prince Bernard, in 2001.         Mr. Balkenende, the prime minister, described her as a mother figure for the nation. ''Many of us feel the death of Princess Juliana as a personal loss,'' he said. ''Today our country in a sense has lost its mother.''         Flags were immediately lowered at Dutch official buildings, and mourners gathered in the rain outside her palace, about 25 miles southeast of Amsterdam. No date for the state burial has been set.         Born April 30, 1909 in The Hague, Juliana was a princess of the House of Orange-Nassau, the only child of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrik. She was 39 when her mother, who had been queen for 50 years, abdicated in her favor and passed the throne to her on Sept. 4, 1948.         Although Juliana was brought up in one of Europe's richest families, many Dutch found her endearing because, shy and soft-spoken, she exuded warmth and plainness. She said she found curtsies embarrassing and enjoyed being filmed while riding her bicycle in a flowery housewife's dress. She sent her children to state schools.         She would sometimes have her limousine pull up unannounced outside the home of one of her subjects, knock on the door and ask if she could come in for tea.         But her life was far from idyllic.         She and her husband, Prince Bernard, a German, and their two oldest daughters, then infants, were forced to flee in a truck, then by ship, to England when the Nazi army invaded The Netherlands in 1940, when her mother was still queen. The family spent much of the war in Canada and returned to a devastated, impoverished country at the end of the war.         Among her first acts as a young queen was not only overseeing reconstruction at home, but also dealing with conflicts in the Dutch colony of Indonesia. She handed back sovereignty to the Indonesians in in 1949.         In 1947, Christina, her youngest daughter, was born almost blind. Juliana blamed herself because she had contracted German measles just before giving birth.         With doctors saying they could do little, she turned to a faith healer. Her close relationship with Greet Hofmans, the healer -- who was a militant pacifist and had a penchant for the occult -- became a scandal and nearly led to the breakup of the royal marriage. The prince contended that the healer had a dangerous influence on his wife and, after a political furor, ensured that all contacts between the two women were broken.         Queen Juliana, in turn, stood by her husband during several scandals in which he was involved. Prince Bernard was often linked to extramarital relationships, which were treated as a public secret within the royal family and in some of the Dutch and European press.         But the greater upset to her reign occurred in 1976, when the government disclosed that Prince Bernard was involved in a bribery scandal and had accepted ''dishonorable offers and favors'' from the Lockheed Corp., which was eager to sell aircraft to the Dutch military.         The prince, by many accounts, was spared criminal prosecution because of public sympathy for Queen Juliana's plight. The distraught queen privately told the government she would abdicate. Fearing a constitutional crisis and a public outcry, the government merely stripped the prince of his military, charitable and diplomatic tasks.         When Juliana did abdicate, in 1980, on her 71st birthday, she took evident pride in handing the throne to her daughter Beatrix. ''Everyone getting older, sooner or later must face the sober fact that one's strength is fading,'' she said in her farewell message, adding that it would not be responsible to carry on.         She declined the title of queen mother and chose to be called princess instead because she wanted to stress that she was taking a step backward.         Princess Juliana is survived by her husband and four daughters and numerous grandchildren.         In a nationwide television address on Saturday, Prime Minister Balkenende recalled Juliana's fight for social causes and her talent for remaining positive.         She put people at ease, he said. He described one of Juliana's Christmas messages, when she said, ''Every person has a light that can shine anywhere and anytime.''       
         Dorothy Denny Scardino, a jazz pianist who rubbed elbows with the form's superstars but found her biggest following through a 25-year gig in a Manhattan bank lobby, died on March 9 at a hospice. She was 82 and had recently been told that she had cancer, her son Donald said.         Drawn to the city from a dairy farm in tiny Jefferson, N.Y., Mrs. Scardino played with the Joe Venuti Band and at the Stork Club during World War II.         ''Her goal was to come to New York and be surrounded by people, and play the piano,'' her son said. She appeared with Lester Lanin's Society Orchestra, and recorded two collections for the A440 label, ''Dottie Denny Digs the Duke'' and ''Dottie Denny Plays Edgar Sampson.''         After marrying Charles Scardino, a bass player, she put aside her career to raise their four children in Queens. With the children grown, she took a job playing classics on a grand piano inside the Manhattan Savings Bank branch at Third Avenue and 86th Street.         She started in 1970, at the invitation of the branch manager, and regaled the customers with her interpretations of hits by Irving Berlin, Duke Ellington, Stephen Sondheim and others. People came in just to listen, tapping their toes in time to her music, and some may have opened accounts because of her. She played there until 1995, when the bank was sold and its new owner decided to do away with the music.         Always elegantly dressed, Mrs. Scardino played what appealed to her, but she also took requests from her audience, which often included people from the neighborhood who did not have accounts at the bank.         When she was cast in an episode of the television series ''The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' the title character, after a loan application was rejected, asked her to play ''Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?''         In addition to her son Donald, of Scarsdale, N.Y., she is survived by her daughter, Nina Coe of Montevallo, Ala.; two other sons, Charles Jr., of Manhattan, and David, of Los Angeles; and eight grandchildren.       
         Emily Morison Beck, the self-described literary archaeologist who edited three editions of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, mining sources from sea chanteys to Shakespeare, died on Sunday at her home in Canton, Mass. She was 88.         The cause was kidney failure, her son Gordon M. Beck said.         Mrs. Beck brought an august intellectual heritage, an elephantine memory and bristling energy to refining, enlarging and, sometimes, subtracting from a reference book that few libraries are without.         In the 13th, 14th and 15th editions, appearing in 1955, 1968 and 1980, Mrs. Beck gradually added feminist voices, the singers James Brown and Bob Dylan and the first words spoken on the moon, while remedying past omissions, like that of Dickens's ''Bah! Humbug!'' Excerpts from what she called ''members of the crappy poetry society,'' particularly those who favored nature poems, bit the dust. Robert Lowell was given a new and quite large voice in her Bartlett's. She expanded the entries from Shakespeare and the Bible, the staples since John Bartlett, a bookstore employee in Cambridge, Mass., decided to publish the quotations that he had been collecting in a notebook. But Mr. Bartlett might have been startled by a phrase from the Watergate scandal that appeared in the 15th edition, published in 1980: ''Expletive deleted,'' not to mention ''E.T., phone home.''         Some critics complained that the whole enterprise had become hopelessly arbitrary. Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1981, James Atlas compared the 15th edition of Bartlett's to the 10th anniversary issue of Rolling Stone.         ''It is strange to find on the stately double-columned pages words to songs I listened to while sitting in the parking lot of an A & W root beer stand on Friday nights in high school,'' Mr. Atlas wrote.         Others praised Mrs. Beck's boldness, even down to including an Emerson quotation criticizing quotations: ''I hate quotations,'' it reads, ''Tell me what you know.''         Mrs. Beck's extensive cross-referencing led to many refinements. For example, she traced Kaufman and Hart's ''You Can't Take It With You'' to the ancient Egyptians, the Bible and Theognis, a Greek poet.         Emily Marshall Morison was born on Oct. 15, 1915, in Boston, one of four children of Samuel Eliot Morison, the historian, and Elizabeth Greene Shaw. Newsweek noted in 1990 that she gave as much space to quotations from her father as to those from Herodotus and Thucydides.         Nicknamed Wendy after the character in Peter Pan, she was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, England, the Concord Academy in Massachusetts and Radcliffe. She worked as an editor for Harper & Brothers and Alfred A. Knopf, and in 1946 married Brooks Beck, one of the first lawyers to represent authors in their negotiations with publishers. When he joined a law firm in Boston, she got a job with Atlantic Monthly Press, editing books.         In 1952 she was given a leave by Atlantic Monthly to help edit the centennial edition of Bartlett's, which was published by Little, Brown in 1955. In the preface she was cited for her ''highly competent and critical service'' but not singled out as the book's editor. During the preparation of that book, she wrote memo after memo, some of which made the case for keeping some of Shakespeare's most famous passages. She thus became the obvious choice to edit the next edition of the book, the 14th, which was published in 1968.         Her pursuit of the origins of quotations was dogged and often ingenious. In stalking a Henry James phrase she wanted to include in the 15th edition, she considered skimming his entire works, but chanced upon a magazine article about Truman Capote that attributed the lines to ''The Middle Years,'' an autobiography of James.         She read the entire book and could not find the lines. Then she noticed a little editor's note at the very end, saying James had taken the title from his short story of the same name. She got a complete collection of James's stories and found the quotation on the next to last page.         ''We work in the dark -- we do what we can -- we give what we have,'' it read. ''Our doubt is our passion, and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art.''         Mr. Beck died in 1969. Mrs. Beck is survived by her sister, Catharine Cooper, of Islington, England; her sons Cameron, of Canton, and Gordon, of Larchmont, N.Y.; her daughter, Emily M. Beck, of Larchmont; and three grandchildren.         Her helpers on Bartlett's ranged far beyond the academic experts hired by Little, Brown. The organist at her church told her that the correct title of Thomas Grey's poem was ''Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,'' not ''Elegy in a Country Churchyard,'' as every edition since John Bartlett had claimed.         Mrs. Beck corrected the error in the 14th.         Correction:  April 1, 2004, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Emily Morison Beck, editor of three editions of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, misspelled the surname of the poet who wrote ''Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.'' (Its title had been misstated in Bartlett's, and Mrs. Beck corrected it on advice from the organist at her church.) The poet was Thomas Gray, not Grey.         The obituary also misstated the timing of the book's inclusion of the quotation ''E.T., phone home.'' It occurred after 1982, when the movie ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' appeared, not in the 1980 edition.       
         Frances B. Schreuder, a Manhattan socialite convicted in 1983 of persuading her teenage son to kill her wealthy father in Utah because of what she considered his stinginess, died on Tuesday at a hospice in San Diego. She was 65.         The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Marilyn Reagan, her sister, said. Ms. Schreuder (pronounced SHROY-der) lived in San Diego.         The murder of Franklin Bradshaw in Salt Lake City on July 23, 1978, provoked intense news coverage and led to two books, two television miniseries and, as recently as this year, a documentary on Court TV.         ''True crime is the hottest game in town,'' J. Anthony Lukas wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the two books, both published in 1985. One was ''My Mother's Request: A True Story of Money, Murder and Betrayal'' (Atheneum) by Jonathan Coleman; the other was ''Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder: A Family Album'' (Doubleday) by Shana Alexander.         ''This is 'Dallas' and 'Dynasty' come to life,'' Bill Wells, the director one of the miniseries, for CBS, said in an interview with The Times in 1986.         The crime indeed involved fascinating characters and plot twists. There was Ms. Schreuder, who bought $40,000 earrings at Tiffany's and sat on the board of the New York City Ballet. Mr. Bradshaw was one of the country's richest men and was known as Utah's Howard Hughes, but he bought his clothes at thrift shops and used a Coors beer carton as a briefcase.         Marc F. Schreuder, the grandson who shot Mr. Bradshaw in the back and head with a .357 Magnum, testified at his mother's trial that she had told him : ''Look, Marc, it is not really killing. It is the right thing to do for us.''         Frances Bernice Bradshaw was born on April 6, 1938, in Salt Lake City. She attended Bryn Mawr but was suspended in 1958 for stealing and forging checks and was told that she could return only if she received psychiatric help.         In the summer of 1958 she lived in Manhattan at the Barbizon Hotel for Women and met Vittorio Gentile, a pearl merchant, at Gino restaurant on Lexington Avenue. They married in 1959 at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and in 1960 had two sons, Lorenzo in February and Marco in December.         After the couple divorced, the sons were called Larry and Marc. Larry, who has changed his last name to Bradshaw, now lives in Los Angeles. Marc Schreuder lives in Provo, Utah. In addition to Ms. Reagan, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Schreuder is survived by a daughter from her second marriage, to Frederik Schreuder. She is Lavinia Schreuder of San Diego.         Mr. Coleman, the author, said in an interview that Frances Schreuder was skilled at manipulating her mother to get money, even as her father tired of supporting her extravagant life in New York. Her $360,000 donation to the New York City Ballet was the largest lump-sum contribution in the company's history up to that time.         At the time, news reports said she made contributions to the ballet and other New York causes, but Ms. Reagan said in an interview yesterday that Mrs. Schreuder's mother, Berenice Bradshaw, actually made most of them.         Mr. Bradshaw made his fortune by starting a chain of auto parts stores and acquiring federal oil and gas leases. Ms. Schreuder came to believe she might be disinherited, and her simmering resentment blossomed into a murder plot that at one point involved hiring what turned out to be a bogus hit man for $5,000.         The summer before the killing, when her sons went to Salt Lake City to work in their grandfather's company, she gave them poison to put in his food, Mr. Coleman said.         After the murder, the police first suspected a transient. But a year later, the murder weapon surfaced in Manhattan, and the police traced Marc Schreuder's journey days before the killing, to Utah by way of Texas, where he bought the murder weapon.         Although Mrs. Bradshaw spent $2 million on the legal defense of Marc Schreuder and his mother, Marc Schreuder was convicted of second-degree murder in 1982 and served 12 years in prison. Ms. Schreuder was convicted of first-degree murder the next year and was imprisoned for 13 years.         Marc Schreuder testified against his mother, saying she must be stopped, according to Mr. Coleman's book. ''I'm doing this for Lavinia,'' he said of his sister. ''Someone should care about Lavinia.''         Ms. Schreuder, who earned two sociology degrees while in prison, worked briefly for the Marriott Corporation in Salt Lake City before moving to San Diego. She inherited a comfortable income from her mother, despite family members' efforts to invoke a statute barring convicted killers from inheriting anything from their victims. A judge ruled that the law did not govern Berenice Bradshaw's choice of heirs.         Correction:  April 10, 2004, Saturday  An obituary on April 1 about Frances B. Schreuder, a Manhattan socialite convicted in 1983 of having arranged the murder of her father in Utah, misstated the time elapsed before the murder weapon was found and referred incorrectly to the college work she completed in prison. The weapon, a handgun, was found two years after the murder, not one. She earned a degree in psychology, not two in sociology. The article also misstated the title of a book about the case by Jonathan Coleman. It is ''At Mother's Request: A True Story of Money, Murder and Betrayal,'' not ''My Mother's Request.''       
         Winson Hudson, a civil rights campaigner in rural Mississippi who flaunted her contempt for Ku Klux Klan intimidation by wearing a bright red dress the many times she marched up to the courthouse to try to register to vote, died on April 24. She was 87.         Her grandson Kempton Horton said she died at a hospital in Jackson, Miss., that she had fought to desegregate.         In 1963, Mrs. Hudson brought the first suit to desegregate schools in a rural Mississippi county and won the case the next year. In 1965, a black child attended a previously all-white school.         She began trying to register to vote at the Leake County courthouse in 1937 and finally succeeded in 1962, but not before repeatedly having to write out and then explain a lengthy passage from the state Constitution. (White registrants merely had to explain this clause: ''All elections shall be by ballot.'')         In Mrs. Hudson's failed attempt to register in 1961, someone slipped a small card to her. It read: ''The Eyes of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Are Upon You.''         The next year, she dispensed with yet another abstruse constitutional passage, this time under the eyes of Robert F. Kennedy's Justice Department.         The Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed literacy tests and poll taxes. Mrs. Hudson soon signed up 500 new voters.         She became chairwoman of the county chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1961 at the urging of her friend Medgar Evers, the N.A.A.C.P. leader who was murdered in 1963. She kept the post for 38 years, fighting and winning battles to stop banks from prejudicial lending practices and bringing phones and paved roads to her poor county.         From inviting civil rights workers to sleep on her floor, to bringing Head Start to the community center she created, Mrs. Hudson achieved much -- but not national fame. Most histories of the civil rights movement do not mention her.         ''Mrs. Hudson was one of the unsung, unheralded heroes of the civil rights movement,'' Vernon E. Jordan Jr., who knew her as director of the Voting Education Project of the Southern Regional Council in the 1960's, said in an interview.         ''Her work represents the essence of what took place,'' he continued. ''There's a lot written about the leaders but not much about the contributions of the Mrs. Hudsons of the world.''         Bob Moses, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Mississippi field secretary in the 1960's, talked in an interview about the reign of terror of white supremacists whom he said wanted to eliminate the leadership of the N.A.C.C.P. He called Mrs. Hudson ''a part of that very small network of people who not only survived but actually found ways to struggle.''         He continued, ''It is inconceivable that the movement could have happened the way it did in Mississippi without these people.''         Last year, Mrs. Hudson said in an interview with The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., that it had been ''a lonely walk.'' But her fierce, righteous attitude was her armor. This was a woman who wrote her own funeral service.         ''The more they did to us, the meaner we got,'' she said in an interview for John Dittmer's 1994 book, ''Local People: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Mississippi.''         Mrs. Hudson looked the part, not least because she was big. Patricia Derian, who fought for integrated schools in Mississippi as a young mother and was an assistant secretary of state in the Carter administration, said in an interview, ''When she walked in a room, it was a little bit like having a battleship arrive.''         Ms. Derian added, ''When you gave her a hug she was soft, and that was all the soft you got out of her.''         Winson Gates was born in Harmony, in central Mississippi, on Nov. 17, 1916, the 10th of 13 children born to John Wesley Gates and Emma Kirkland, neither of whom ever tried to register to vote.         This family history was reported in the book, ''Mississippi Harmony, Memoirs of a Freedom Fighter'' (Macmillan, 2002), written by Mrs. Hudson and Constance Curry.         Mrs. Hudson was 8 when her mother died, and she and her siblings were raised by her father on a 105-acre farm until the land was seized by a white doctor to whom the family owed money.         A more sinister family memory, mentioned in an oral history by the Southern Regional Council, was her father's mentally ill brother being lynched by a white mob.         In 1936, Winson Gates married Cleo Hudson, whose family owned 500 acres in Harmony, a center of black property owners since Reconstruction. She went to work as a teacher at Harmony School and took on the additional chore of managing the lunchroom. The principal reprimanded her for giving free bread to hungry children.         During periods when her activism made it hard to get a job, she did manual labor. She said she could ''saw as much wood as any man.'' In civil rights work, she said she could do more than a man because a man would be in greater physical danger.         In 1937, Mrs. Hudson and her sister Dovie began a habit of going to the courthouse and trying to register ''for the heck of it,'' she wrote in the book. They conscientiously paid the poll tax, later outlawed, despite not being allowed to vote.         When Northern civil rights activists arrived to join local people in the Freedom Summer of 1964, she let the visitors sleep in her house, even after it was bombed. Her husband told James Chaney, a native of the area who would be killed with Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner that summer, not to go to Philadelphia ''because they'd kill you in Neshoba County.''         Mrs. Hudson is survived by her daughter, Annie Maude Horton, of Carthage, Miss.; her brother, Osly Gates of Portland, Ore.; two grandsons and three great-grandchildren.         Her legacy is also marked by Hudson Road, which runs near her house. In 1976, she mobilized the newly powerful black vote to at last pave the streets of Harmony. Before that, paving stopped at the town line.         Correction:  May 12, 2004, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Winson Hudson, a pioneer of the civil rights movement in Mississippi, misstated the year in some copies for the killing of the rights worker James Chaney, who had been warned by her husband against going to Philadelphia, Miss. It was 1964, not 1963.       
         Lygia Pape, an influential Brazilian artist who worked in two important movements, Concretism and the looser Neo-Concretism, and later moved beyond them, died on May 3 in Rio de Janeiro. She was 77.         The cause was complications of myelodysplasia, a blood disease, said her daughter Paula Pape.         A restlessly experimental artist, Ms. Pape (pronounced PAH-pay) worked at challenging formal and conceptual limits in many different media, including painting, printmaking, sculpture, dance, film, performance and installation. In the 1950's she was involved in Concretism, which was based on severe abstract styles of European painters like Piet Mondrian and Kasimir Malevich. In 1954 she helped found an important Concretist group called la Frente (the Front).         At the end of the decade she joined her fellow artists Hélio Oiticica and Lygia Clark in founding Neo-Concretism, which rejected the formal remove of Concretist art but retained its insistence on the concrete reality of the artwork as opposed to more representational imagery.         Favoring more interactive relations between art and viewers, the Neo-Concretists sought to expand the formal, expressive and social dimensions of art. Among Ms. Pape's Neo-Concretist works were books with semiabstract sculptural elements that viewers were encouraged to handle.         In a ballet that Ms. Pape choreographed in 1958, simple geometric shapes with people hidden inside moved about the stage. Ten years later she created one of her best-known pieces, ''Divisor,'' a performance work in which dozens of people poked their heads through holes in a gridded arrangement in a large sheet of white cloth. It has been interpreted as a comment on modern bureaucracy as well as on the split between mind and body.         In the 60's Ms. Pape worked with a filmmaking group called Cinema Novo, for which she designed lettering and posters. She also made short experimental films of her own, some only seconds long. In later decades she created large-scale and often surrealistically dramatic installations using lights, plants, food, flowing liquids, fabric and other materials.         Her work was seen in New York in ''Body and Soul,'' a 400-year survey of Brazilian art at the Guggenheim Museum in 2001. Two works from her Neo-Concretist phase are currently on view at El Museo del Barrio in Manhattan in an exhibition of Latin American works from the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.         Ms. Pape was born on April 7, 1927, in the Novo Friburgo section of Rio. Like many Brazilian artists, she studied studio art informally, but she did receive a master's degree in the philosophy of art from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 1980.         From 1972 to 1985, Ms. Pape taught semiotics at the school of architecture at the Universidade Santa Ursula in Rio. She was appointed professor in the school of fine arts of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 1983.         In addition to her daughter Paula, Ms. Pape is survived by her husband, Gunther Pape; another daughter, Cristina Maria; and two grandsons.       
         Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, a self-trained South African naturalist who in 1938 discovered the coelacanth, a species of bony, four-finned fish often described as a living fossil, died on May 17 in East London, South Africa. She was 97.         A cause of death was not determined, although she had suffered a series of falls, said Susan L. Jewett, a researcher for the Smithsonian Institution who recently visited her.         The story of Ms. Courtenay-Latimer's discovery remains among the most famous in the annals of modern biology. She was a young curator at the East London Museum when, on Dec. 22, 1938, she spotted the coelacanth in a pile of fish on a vessel at the town's dock. After taking steps to preserve the 127-pound fish, she sent a quick sketch to South Africa's leading fish expert, Dr. J.L.B. Smith of Rhodes University.         ''With that action, Courtenay-Latimer became the point person and den mother for all who were to study the fish,'' said Dr. Keith S. Thomson, professor emeritus of natural history at Oxford University and author of the book ''Living Fossil: The Story of the Coelacanth'' (1991).         Dr. Thomson compared the discovery to finding a lost dinosaur on a South American plateau or a pterodactyl in the Everglades. Before Ms. Courtenay-Latimer's discovery, the coelacanth was thought to have been extinct for at least 70 million years.         As a living species, it is believed to hold a unique place in the evolutionary chain from fish to land vertebrates. Early theories that held that the fish might be a direct ancestor of humankind were disproved by studies in the 1980's of the coelacanth's anatomy and DNA.         ''We continually ask, how can this fish have evolved so little?'' Dr. Thomson said.         Recalling her discovery, Ms. Courtenay-Latimer later wrote: ''I saw a blue fin and, pushing off the fish, the most beautiful fish I had ever seen was revealed. It was five feet long and a pale mauve blue with iridescent silver markings.'' She added, ''This I will definitely take to the museum.''         The second coelacanth was caught 14 years later, in 1952, in the Indian Ocean off the Comoro Islands after an international effort by Dr. Smith to find more specimens of the fish. Some 200 coelacanths have been captured since, leading to a call to study the fish in its environment and to preserve the species. Several were found off the South African coast last month.         The significance of the coelacanth continues to unfold.         Dr. William E. Bemis, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said studies of the fish's eye muscles, used to close its jaws, had provided important links to how similar muscles in frogs and vertebrates worked. Other studies have shown that the fish possesses within its snout an electrosensory organ, the rostral organ, which scientists have determined is probably used to find prey.         Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer was born Feb. 24, 1907, the daughter of a railroad accountant who moved the family to stations throughout South Africa. While still a child, she began a collection of bird eggs and insects. She was educated at a convent school and intended to train as a nurse, but became curator at the East London Museum in 1931, a position she held until 1973. She never married.         Although best known for her discovery of the coelacanth, Ms. Courtenay-Latimer had a broader interest in natural history, and also wrote about wildflowers.         In 1971, she received an honorary doctorate from Rhodes University. In 1998, she was a guest of honor when the South African government unveiled a gold coin minted to commemorate the coelacanth's discovery. Ms. Courtenay-Latimer's scientific collaborator, Dr. Smith, named the species after her, Latimeria chalumnae.         Ms. Courtenay-Latimer is survived by two nieces and a nephew.       
         Lillian Seril, who as landlord of a grand Upper West Side apartment building, the Belnord, became the central figure in one of New York City's longest rent strikes, died on Monday at New York Weill Cornell Center in Manhattan. She was 95 and had been living as a tenant at the building she once owned, at 225 West 86th Street.         Her death was announced by her family in a paid notice in The New York Times.         The 16-year battle between Mrs. Seril and her tenants played out on a suitably historic stage. The Belnord, an ornate Italian Renaissance building 12 stories tall, occupies the entire block between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. It was advertised as the largest apartment house in the world when it was completed in 1908 and was designated as a New York City landmark in 1966.         Designed to be one of the city's most luxurious residences, it has huge, high-ceilinged apartments and surrounds a half-acre courtyard. It became a center of the Upper West Side's intellectual life, home over the years to figures like the Nobel Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer, the Actors Studio founder Lee Strasberg and the actor Zero Mostel.         But the Belnord was more than a glamorous address; it also was one of Manhattan's biggest real estate bargains. When Mrs. Seril and her husband, Nathan, became sole owners of the building in 1974, two-thirds of its 225 apartments were covered under the city's rent control law, which originated as a federal plan in World War II to prevent war profiteering. With prices averaging $60 per room, tenants of rent-controlled 10-room apartments could pay less than $500 per month, well below the market rate even then.         Upon taking over the building, the Serils said some tenants owed back rent and accused others of infractions from illegal subletting to ripping out fixtures to installing appliances that put a dangerous strain on the building's wires and pipes.         Tenants had their own complaints: elevators frequently went out of service; pipes burst; the roof leaked; plaster fell from ceilings: the building often had no hot water, or no water at all. The tenants also said the Serils would not allow them to make repairs themselves.         To the Serils, these problems were a simple matter of economics. As their son-in-law, Owen C. Pell, later told said, ''If you keep the rents in the building lower than they are in the South Bronx, how do you stop the property from running down?''         The rent strike began in 1978, joined by nearly half of the Belnord's residents. It was soon followed by litigation that became so bitter that the Manhattan Housing Court judge originally assigned to the case withdrew in 1980 after the collapse of a settlement he had arranged, saying that the two sides ''deserved each other.''         When the city's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development was asked to intervene in the dispute four years later, he said, ''I'm not going to get myself into a West Beirut situation, where one or both parties are shooting at us.''         The battle continued through the 1980's, outliving Mr. Seril, who died in 1981. At one point, a court-appointed administrator was put in charge of the building, a step usually taken against slumlords. Later, a justice of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan found that many strikers were withholding rent to force Mrs. Seril to sell the building or to convert it to condominiums or cooperatives; he also found that some of the strikers were failing to place their withheld rent in escrow, in effect living rent free.         The strike finally came to an end in October 1994, when Mrs. Seril agreed to sell the building to investors for $15 million, or about $66,000 an apartment. Experts estimated that she could have asked two or three times as much if the rents had been at market level and the building had been in better shape.         Her opponents were surprised when she finally sold the Belnord.         ''Mrs. Seril has turned down many offers from buyers,'' a tenant leader said. ''The tenants have even offered to buy the building. This is not about money.''         Born Lillian Trachtenberg, Mrs. Seril is survived by her daughters Barbara and Pearl, her stepdaughter Zena Carp, her sisters Ada Hinden and Gladys Feigenbaum, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Seril remained a part of the Belnord saga even after selling the building. In a long speech before the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1996, she criticized the new owners' renovation plans and their intention of putting a large supermarket in the building's basement. This time Mrs. Seril, who lived in a 3,000-square-foot, $450-a-month, rent-controlled apartment in the Belnord, was speaking as a tenant.       
         Naomi Shemer, an Israeli poet and a prolific composer whose popular songs include ''Jerusalem of Gold,'' which became interwoven with the culture of the Jewish state, died on Saturday at a Tel Aviv hospital after a long illness. She was 74.         Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Moshe Katsav were among the thousands of mourners at her funeral on Sunday at Kibbutz Kinneret, the place of her birth.         Mr. Sharon had begun the weekly cabinet meeting earlier that day by paying tribute to Ms. Shemer, calling her a woman who ''managed, with her beautiful melodies, to connect us to our roots,'' Agence France-Presse reported.         ''Jerusalem of Gold'' was written just before the 1967 Middle East war, in which Israel seized control of the city from Jordan. The ballad made her famous as it gained the status of an informal second national anthem once Israel had ''reunited'' the ancient city.         In the song, Ms. Shemer called on the emotions evoked by thoughts of the Old City and Judaism's holiest sites. Making the city whole realized a dream almost two millennia after the destruction of its last Jewish temple.         Ms. Shemer captured the spirit of that victorious moment when Israel asserted itself by adding another verse after the war to celebrate the event. The song is often heard at public ceremonies and on the radio in Israel.         Another popular Shemer song was based on the Beatles' ''Let It Be.'' Through it she sought to restore hope in Israelis after the costly war with Egypt and Syria in 1973.         She complemented her original work with Hebrew adaptations of foreign poetry. After the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, she rendered Walt Whitman's ''O Captain! My Captain!'' into Hebrew, set it to music and dedicated it to the slain prime minister.         Ms. Shemer, whose parents helped found Kibbutz Kinneret, grew up with singalongs. She studied at the Rubin Academy of Music in Jerusalem, and served with an entertainment unit in the Israeli Army. Returning to the kibbutz, she taught rhythm in school and began to write children's songs. Her career broadened after she moved to Tel Aviv in the mid-1950's. Her songs often recalled the landscapes of her childhood, but she could just as easily relate to contemporary Israeli city scenes.         Teddy Kollek, who was elected mayor of Jerusalem in 1965, commissioned her to write a hymn to the city. It was first heard at the Israel Song Festival in Jerusalem. Then, after the war of 1967, she added a verse that included the lyrics, ''Back to the wells and to the fountains, within the ancient walls.''         In 1983 she was given the Israel Prize for her contributions to Israeli music. She also held several honorary doctorates, served as head of the Israeli entertainers' union, and was a member of the Hebrew Language Academy.         Ms. Shemer's first marriage, to Gideon Shemer, ended in divorce. According to the daily newspaper Haaretz, she is survived by her second husband, Mordechai Horowitz; their son, Daniel; a daughter, Lali, from her first marriage; four grandchildren; a brother; and a sister.       
         Phoebe Brand Carnovsky, an actress and distinguished acting teacher who was a founding member of the influential Group Theater, died on July 3 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, her son, Stephen Carnovsky, said. She was 96.         Phoebe Brand, as she was known professionally, joined Lee Strasberg and others in 1931 to form the Group Theater, a radical company that dealt with social issues confronting the United States during the Depression. It was there that Strasberg advanced the Method approach to acting.         The Group presented the premieres of many plays by Clifford Odets, the troupe's resident playwright, and Ms. Brand played several roles, including that of Hennie Berger in Mr. Odets's masterpiece, ''Awake and Sing!'' She also starred in ''Golden Boy'' as Anna, the thoughtful sister of the hero, a sensitive boxer. The company disbanded in 1941.         Ms. Brand's husband, the Shakespearean actor Morris Carnovsky, died in 1992. In addition to her son, Stephen, of Los Angeles, she is survived by a niece, Katy Brand Dilkes of Cortland, N.Y., whom she raised.         Ms. Brand was born in 1907 in Syracuse and grew up in nearby Ilion, N.Y., where her father was chief mechanical engineer for Remington typewriters.         Petite and pretty, she got her professional start at 18 when the producer Winthrop Ames hired her to perform in a series of Gilbert and Sullivan revivals.         ''I played a lot of princesses,'' she would often say of her early career.         In the 1940's, the Carnovskys moved to Hollywood to work in film. But in 1952, Elia Kazan, a former member of the Group Theater, named them as Communists in the McCarthy hearings, and they were blacklisted. It was at this time that Ms. Brand began to teach acting technique.         In 1956, John Houseman broke the blacklist and asked Mr. Carnovsky to take part in the American Shakespeare Festival. In the early 60's, with her husband's career as an actor re-established, Ms. Brand helped found Theater in the Street, a troupe that toured neglected city neighborhoods and gave free outdoor performances of classic plays.         She made her film debut in 1994, at the age of 86, playing Marina in Louis Malle's ''Vanya on 42nd Street.''         Ms. Brand continued to teach acting technique until the end of her life. She held her last class a week before her death. The subject was her favorite: the plays of William Shakespeare.         Correction:  July 17, 2004, Saturday  An obituary of the actress and acting teacher Phoebe Brand Carnovsky on Monday misstated the forum in which the director Elia Kazan named her and her husband, the actor Morris Carnovsky, as Communists. It was the House Committee on Un-American Activities, not hearings conducted by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.       
         Isabel Sanford, the Emmy Award-winning actress who portrayed Louise Jefferson, the stoically beleaguered better half to Sherman Hemsley's reactionary in ''All in the Family'' and ''The Jeffersons,'' died on Friday at a Los Angeles hospital. She was 86 and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Sanford's health had declined since she had preventive surgery on a carotid artery 10 months ago, said her longtime manager and publicist, Brad Lemack.         At an age when many actresses would have called it quits, Ms. Sanford made her feature film debut in ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?'' in 1967 after having caught the eye of its director, Stanley Kramer, in the 1965 Broadway production of James Baldwin's ''Amen Corner.''         As Tillie, the Drayton family's staunchly loyal housekeeper, Ms. Sanford displayed a defiant acceptance of position and disdain for interracial marriage that stood in stark contrast to the presumed liberalism of the characters portrayed by Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.         The portrayal impressed show-business insiders, including the television producer Norman Lear, who in 1971 hired Ms. Sanford to play a Queens neighbor to the confrontational Archie Bunker, and an eventual friend to his wife, Edith, in ''All in the Family.'' In 1975, Mr. Lear moved the Jeffersons, by now the owners of a successful dry-cleaning franchise, and their son, Lionel, to a ''deluxe apartment in the sky'' on the East Side of Manhattan.         In 1981, Ms. Sanford became the first black woman to win an Emmy for best actress in a comedy series. The show was canceled in 1985.         In an ''Intimate Portrait'' on Lifetime Television last year, Ms. Sanford called herself a survivor: literally, as the youngest of seven children and the only one to survive infancy, and figuratively, as she came to rely on her comedic skills for respite from her poverty-stricken childhood in Harlem. As a teenager, she dreamed of becoming an actress, earning raves at an amateur night at the Apollo Theater before her mother's death quashed her aspirations, leaving Ms. Sanford to take over her job as a cleaning woman.         Still, amid a troubled marriage and the birth of three children, Ms. Sanford joined the Star Players, later the American Negro Theater, in the 1930's and made her stage debut in the company's 1946 production of ''On Strivers Row.''         In 1960, she moved with her children to Los Angeles, where the actress Tallulah Bankhead almost immediately asked her to join the national production of ''Here Today'' -- a job that Ms. Sanford said resulted in her first encounter with discrimination, as she found herself relegated to separate sleeping and dining quarters from her white colleagues.         Ms. Sanford is survived by two sons and a daughter, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Frances Hansen, a self-described housewife who marshaled imagination -- surely not malice -- to make crossword puzzles she constructed more puzzling by using her own poems as clues, died on Friday at a hospital in Perth Amboy, N.J. She was 85.         The cause was complications of a stroke, Betty Lee Solley, her niece, said.         The New York Times published 82 of Mrs. Hansen's puzzles, with the 83rd scheduled for the Christmas issue of the paper's Sunday magazine. She had written every Christmas puzzle since 1995 and had become the second most prolific living writer of Sunday puzzles and the fourth most published of all time.         The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and book publishers like Dell, Random House and Simon & Schuster also printed puzzles she constructed.         Will Shortz, The New York Times crossword puzzle editor, said Mrs. Hansen ''caused a sensation'' with her first puzzle in the paper in December 1964. The puzzle was built around Lewis Carroll's 1872 book, ''Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,'' and required potential solvers to think backward.         The clue was ''a well-known part of ykcowrebbaj, and the answer was ''ebarge out shtar emom eht dna.'' (Lewis's penchant for making up words like Jabberwocky didn't make it any easier.)         Her original limericks became her best-known trademark. Margaret Farrar, a former editor of The New York Times puzzles, at first questioned the originality of the poems because they were so good. Mrs. Hansen assuaged the editor's doubt by sending her clippings of little poems she had had printed in Good Housekeeping and other magazines.         One of Mr. Shortz's favorites goes like this:         Said W. Somerset Maugham         I shall visit the island of Guam.         If I find it is hot,         I shall leave on the spot.         I detest feeling overly waugham.         Frances Mabel Tucker was born on June 21, 1919, in Arlington, N.J., and lived in Metuchen since her childhood. She never attended college nor took any special courses. Her husband, Ernest R. Hansen, a bank president, died in 1983.         She is survived by her sons, Warren, of Forest Hills, Queens, and John, of Germantown, Tenn., and two granddaughters.         Helene Hovanec, the author of a book on crossword puzzle constructors called ''Creative Cruciverbalists'' (Morrow, 1988), said that Mrs. Hansen taught Sunday school for 12 years and noticed, when she quit, that her friends were addicted to the Sunday puzzle.         Mrs. Hansen followed suit and soon hit upon the unlikely idea that constructing puzzles might be easier than doing them because you knew all the answers. She was disabused of this notion when The Times summarily rejected her first puzzle for mistakes common to novice puzzle constructors: using two-letter words and having a very high word count.         Eight months later, her next one was accepted. Mr. Shortz said she went on to perfect her specialty within the rigor of The Times's 21 by 21 squares. Part of the challenge is to keep the black squares symmetrical, a tradition started by Mrs. Farrar because she thought they looked pretty that way.         ''She usually writes an original verse with five lines and each line is exactly 21 letters,'' Mr. Shortz said. ''Perfect rhyme and perfect meter, and it's funny besides.''         Mrs. Hansen was a leader of a group of cruciverbalists who regularly talk shop at a Manhattan restaurant and that has included the last four Times crossword puzzle editors. She organized their last meeting, last month.         In 1987, Mrs. Hansen told The Washington Post that puzzles came to her in her sleep. She said they were left by the ''idea fairy.''         Correction:  July 16, 2004, Friday  An obituary yesterday about Frances Hansen, a constructor of crossword puzzles, misstated part of the solution to a 1964 puzzle she designed around Lewis Carroll's book ''Through the Looking-Glass.'' The clue, rendered in reverse, was ''well-known part of 'Ykcowrebbaj'' (Jabberwocky). The answer, also rendered in reverse, was ''ebargtuo shtar emom eht dna'' (and the mome raths outgrabe), not ''ebarge out shtar emom eht dna.''       
         Bella Lewitzky, a modern-dance pioneer and an outspoken champion of artistic freedom, died on Friday in an assisted-care center in Pasadena, Calif. She was 88.         She had a heart attack after a stroke, said Marjorie Perces, a friend.         A fearless and tireless dancer, choreographer, teacher and cultural crusader, Ms. Lewitzky struggled to make modern dance a major art form in California and to make Los Angeles an important dance center. She campaigned passionately for government support of the arts. Yet she was undaunted by attempts to limit artistic freedom.         Ms. Lewitzky, who was politically active all her life, was called before a hearing of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1951 and asked to identify acquaintances who might have been members of the Communist Party. She declined to supply names, giving the punning reply, ''I am a dancer, not a singer.''         Decades later, when the National Endowment for the Arts started requiring grant recipients to sign an anti-obscenity pledge, Ms. Lewitzky and her company filed a lawsuit, and in January 1991, a federal judge found the pledge unconstitutional.         Ms. Lewitzky was born in Llano del Rio, a utopian socialist community in the Mojave Desert. Her family later settled in San Bernardino, where Ms. Lewitzky received dance and piano lessons. Dance especially fascinated her, and her love of the art grew during the 1930's, when she attended classes taught by Lester Horton, the Los Angeles area's most prominent modern dancer at that time.         She soon established herself as a charismatic performer with the Horton Dance Group, starring in highly dramatic works by Mr. Horton like ''Salome'' (1937) and ''The Beloved'' (1948), in which she portrayed a wife accused of adultery by her puritanical husband.         Other company members included Rudi Gernreich, who became an innovative fashion designer and a stage designer for some of Ms. Lewitzky's later productions, and Newell Reynolds, Ms. Lewitzky's husband, who later became an architect.         Ms. Lewitzky left Horton in 1950 to pursue an independent career. She developed a considerable reputation as a dynamic teacher, holding posts at the University of Southern California, the Idyllwild arts school (accepting an appointment there without signing its loyalty oath) and the California Institute of the Arts. She also served as a guest teacher around the world.         She directed the Los Angeles-based Bella Lewitzky Dance Company from 1966 to 1997. It first traveled to the East Coast in 1971, appearing at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn., and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.         As a performer, Ms. Lewitzky was a fiery stage personality. Anna Kisselgoff described her in The New York Times in 1971 as ''an extraordinary artist with an astounding mastery of technique.''         But as the creator of works like ''On the Brink of Time'' (1969), ''Kinaesonata'' (1970) and ''Greening'' (1976), she favored a cooler choreographic style.         In directing her group, Ms. Lewitzky was deeply concerned about her dancers' welfare. Her company members were always fully insured, and she paid them annual salaries even when they did not perform every month of a year.         Ms. Lewitzky served on the dance panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and on the California Arts Council and was the recipient of the Dance Magazine Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Tiffany Award, the National Medal of Arts, the Capezio Award and, in 1989, the first California Governor's Award for Lifetime Achievement.         Ms. Lewitzky and her husband lived in New Mexico in the 1990's but returned to Southern California in 2001. In addition to her husband, she is survived by her daughter, Nora Reynolds, a dancer, and two grandsons, Keenan and Ross McCune.       
         Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the psychiatrist whose pioneering work with terminally ill patients helped to revolutionize attitudes toward the care of the dying, died Tuesday at her home in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 78.         She died after losing consciousness last week, according to her son, Kenneth. She had recently suffered a series of infections. As she neared her own death after debilitating strokes in the late 1990's, Dr. Kübler-Ross appeared to accept it, as she had tried to help so many others to do.         ''I always say that death can be one of the greatest experiences ever,'' she wrote in an autobiography in 1997. ''If you live each day of your life right, then you have nothing to fear.''         Dr. Kübler-Ross was credited with helping end centuries-old taboos in Western culture against openly discussing and studying death. She also helped change the care of many terminally ill patients to make death less psychologically painful, not only for the dying, but also for their doctors and nurses -- and not least for the survivors.         Although the care she sought is by no means universal, she profoundly changed the way the medical profession is asked to look at death. Her greatest influence came through her writings, especially her 1969 best-seller, ''On Death and Dying,'' which remains in print around the world.         She also gave many lectures and distributed tape recordings of them, conducted extensive research into what she described as the five stages of death based on thousands of interviews with patients and health care professionals and did groundbreaking work in counseling dying patients.         She was a powerful intellectual force behind creating a hospice system in the United States through which palliative care and psychological support are provided for many terminally ill people. And she helped to turn thanatology, the study of physical, psychological and social problems associated with dying, into an accepted medical discipline.         ''Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was a true pioneer in raising the awareness among the physician community and the general public about the important issues surrounding death, dying and bereavement,'' Dr. Percy Wooten said when he was president of the American Medical Association in 1998.         Dr. Wooten said her work was part of the basis for the A.M.A.'s efforts to encourage the medical profession to improve care at the end of life.         The A.M.A was one of her early supporters, though many of its members at first vigorously opposed her.         In the later part of her career, she embarked on research to verify the existence of life after death, conducting, with others, thousands of interviews with people who recounted near-death experiences, particularly of those declared clinically dead by medical authorities but later revived.         Her prestige generated widespread interest and devoted followers.         The work aroused deep skepticism in medical and scientific circles. Her assertions that she had evidence of an afterlife saddened many colleagues, some of whom said she had abandoned rigorous science and had, perhaps, succumbed to her own fears of death.         ''For years, I have been stalked by a bad reputation,'' she wrote in her 1997 autobiography, ''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying.'' ''Actually, I have been pursued by people who have regarded me as the Death and Dying Lady. They believe that having spent more than three decades in research into death and life after death qualifies me as an expert on the subject. I think they miss the point. The only incontrovertible fact of my work is the importance of life.''         Whatever scientists think about her views of life after death, they continue to be influenced by her methods of caring for the terminally ill. Before ''On Death and Dying,'' terminally ill patients were routinely left to face death in a miasma of loneliness and fear, because doctors, nurses and families were generally ill equipped to deal with death.         Dr. Kübler-Ross changed that for many, though by no means for all, dying people. By the 1980's, the study of dying became part of medical and health-care education in United States. ''Death and Dying'' became an indispensable manual, both for professionals and family members.         Weighing barely two pounds at birth, Elisabeth Kübler was the first of triplets born to Ernst and Emma Villiger Kübler on July 8, 1926, in Zurich.         By the sixth grade, she wanted to be a doctor. But her father angrily opposed the plan, telling her she could resign herself to being his secretary in the office supply business that he managed or spend the rest of her life as a maid.         ''That's all right with me,'' she said she replied.         After her schooling, she volunteered at the largest hospital in Zurich to help refugees from Nazi Germany. When World War II ended, she hitchhiked through nine war-shattered countries, helping open first-aid posts. In Poland, her visit to the Maidanek death camp narrowed her professional goal. She would become a psychiatrist to help people deal with death.         She received her medical degree from the University of Zurich in 1957. Within a year, she moved to the United States; married Dr. Emanuel K. Ross, an American neuropathologist she had met at the university; began her internship at Community Hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y.; and become a research fellow at Manhattan State Hospital.         At the hospital, she was appalled by what she called the routine neglect and abuse of dying patients. After badgering her supervisors, she was allowed to develop programs under which to give the patients individual care and counseling.         In 1962, she became a teaching fellow at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. A small, outwardly shy woman who spoke with a heavy German accent, she was nervous when asked to fill in for a popular professor and master lecturer. At first, she was ignored.         But the hall became noticeably quieter when she brought out a 16-year-old patient who was dying of leukemia and asked the students to interview her. Now it was they who seemed nervous.         When Dr. Kübler-Ross prodded the students, they asked the patient about blood tests, chemotherapy and other clinical questions. Finally, the teenager exploded in anger and began posing her own questions.         What was it like not to be able to dream about the high-school prom? Or going on a date? Or growing up? ''Why won't people tell you the truth?'' she demanded.         When the lecture ended, many students had been moved to tears.         ''Now you're acting like human beings, instead of scientists,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross said.         Her lectures began to draw standing-room-only audiences of medical and theology students, members of the clergy and social workers -- but few doctors.         In 1965, Dr. Kübler-Ross became an assistant professor in psychiatry at the University of Chicago Medical School, where a group of theology students approached her for help in studying death. She suggested a series of conversations with dying patients, who would teach the professionals.         At first, staff doctors objected to the program, arguing that patients should be shielded from thoughts of death. Avoiding the subject entirely, particularly when treating the young, physicians and therapists would meet a dying child's questions with comments like, ''Take your medicine, and you'll get well,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross wrote in ''On Death and Dying,'' which incorporated her account of the Chicago seminars.         She said that children instinctively knew that the answers they received about their prognoses were lies and that the deceit made them feel punished and alone. With an associate, the Rev. Carl Nighswonger, she interviewed dying patients at Billings Memorial, the university's teaching hospital, while the theology students observed from a one-way glass. The terminally ill were eager to talk.         To bring public pressure to change hospital standards, she agreed to a request by Life magazine in 1965 to interview a seminar patient, Eva, who said that her doctors had treated her arrogantly. The Life article angered the hospital administrators, who said the hospital wanted to be famous not for its dying patients, but rather for those it saved. Doctors were ordered not to cooperate further, and the lecture hall for her next seminar was empty.         But the hospital switchboard was overwhelmed with calls in reaction to the article; mail piled up, and Dr. Kübler-Ross was invited to speak at other colleges and universities.         As for Eva, Dr. Kübler-Ross recounted, she ended up dying cold and alone. Gradually, the medical profession moved toward accepting new approaches to treating the terminally ill, although living wills and patient care directives do not always prevent patients from being subjected to neglect or to invasive medical care at the end of life.         From her patient interviews, Dr. Kübler-Ross identified the five now famous stages that many patients go through in confronting their deaths. Often, denial is the first stage. As his condition worsens and denial is impossible, the patient displays anger, the ''Why me?'' stage.         That followed by a bargaining period. ''Yes, I'm going to die, but if I diet and exercise can I do it later?'' When the patient sees that bargaining will not work, depression often sets in.         The final stage is acceptance, a period in which the patient is ready to let go.         Not all dying patients follow the same progression, Dr. Kübler-Ross said, but most experience two or more stages. Moreover, she found, people who are experiencing traumatic life changes like divorces often experience similar stages. Another conclusion she reached was that the acceptance of death came most easily for people who could look back and feel that they had not wasted their lives.         Among the patients whom she interviewed in the late 60's was a woman, Mrs. Schwartz, who had been pronounced dead but hours later was found by a nurse to be alive. Dr. Kübler-Ross said Mrs. Schwartz was able to repeat conversations of others that occurred around her when she was clinically dead, including a joke told by a doctor. Doctors and medical students called the episode a hallucination, but Dr. Kübler-Ross thought it merited further investigation, and she began to an effort to verify existence after death.         At a psychiatric workshop, she was quoted as saying: ''I know for a fact that there is life after death,'' and promptly received a barrage of criticism from scientists. The disapproval, plus what she called institutional politics, caused her to leave hospital work in 1973.         By then, she was receiving requests from around the world to give seminars on death and dying, and she began to speak at workshops for the dying about what she called ''life after life,'' a happy condition in which physical pain and mental anguish are absent.         She and associates talked to thousands of patients like Mrs. Schwartz and said they found common strains in the interviews. Patients reported that their experiences after clinical death were remarkably free of pain; that they were aware of precisely where they were at death and of seeming to float out of their bodies; that they seemed not to be suddenly alone but still with family members or friends; that they felt as if they were guided to a place of psychic energy, light, love and warmth greater than any they knew in life; and that they did not want to return.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross became increasingly interested in spiritual phenomena, she sought her own out-of-body experience. Robert Monroe, an engineer from Virginia who wrote ''Journeys Out of the Body,'' invited her -- at a time when, as it turned out, she was seriously ill with a bowel obstruction -- to participate in experiments with a group of physicians, psychiatrists from the Menninger Foundation and engineers. She lay on a waterbed in a small laboratory, connected with polygraphs and earphones through which she heard tapes of waves, as she was instructed on how to relax.         ''I was on the ceiling,'' she recounted. ''I was so excited that you couldn't believe it. It was really the highlight of my life.''         She repeated the experiment, and she said her illness disappeared.         In her lectures, she began describing more of her out-of-body experiences, some of which she said were at first terrifying but ultimately uplifting. She also talked of encountering spirit guides, including Mrs. Schwartz, who, she said, appeared 10 months after her death and told Dr. Kübler-Ross to continue her work, promising, ''We will help you.''         In the late 70's, Dr. Kübler-Ross built a center on 42 acres in the hills of Escondido, Calif., where she and others could ''expound theories of survival of the spirit after death in the form of a living entity.''         When skeptics challenged her accounts of spirit guides, she said people in the modern age had difficulty accepting them, because they ''are no longer in touch with their own spirituality.''         In 1976, she fell under the sway of Jay Barham, a former Arkansas sharecropper who had founded the Church of the Facet of Divinity and said he was able to channel spirits and communicate with them. Dr. Kübler-Ross talked about setting up a worldwide network of franchised centers with him and his wife to counsel on the problems of dying and living. His program was investigated by the San Diego district attorney's office because of accusations of sexual misbehavior. She severed ties with him, and years later acknowledged that she had been mistaken about him and that he had deceived many people.         Dr. Kübler-Ross's reputation was seriously damaged, and her credibility waned. Moreover, her channeling sessions, combined with a heavy travel schedule, contributed to the breakup of her marriage, and her husband left her in 1979.         Her center in California burned, and the police suspected arson. In 1984, she set up another center, in Virginia, to care for children with AIDS. That center also burned, in 1994, and again arson was suspected. After the second fire, she moved to Scottsdale to be near her son, Kenneth, a freelance photographer.         That year, when Dr. Ross was dying, he moved to a condo in Scottsdale near Dr. Kübler-Ross, and she and Kenneth cared for him. Dr. Kübler-Ross is also survived by a daughter, Barbara Ross Rothweiler, a clinical psychologist, of Wausau, Wis.; and one of her triplet sisters, Eva, of Basel, Switzerland; and two granddaughters.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross's health failed in the late 90's, she acknowledged that she was in pain and ready for her life to end. But she said: ''I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no death the way we understood it. The body dies, but not the soul.''       
         Gloria Emerson, a journalist and author who wrote with angry dignity about the effects of war on Americans, Vietnamese and Palestinians, was found dead by friends and the police yesterday morning in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 75 and left no immediate survivors.         The medical examiner's office said that it had not ruled on the cause of death. Her physician, Karen Brudney, said Ms. Emerson had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, which she feared would leave her unable to write, and she left many notes at the apartment indicating that she had taken her own life.         Both as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times in Vietnam in the early 1970's and later as a writer of nonfiction books and a novel, Ms. Emerson wrote passionately about ordinary people and soldiers ground up by the machinery of war in places like Vietnam, Gaza and Algeria.         War as she wrote about it was not ennobling but debasing, a misery that inflicted physical suffering and psychic damage on civilians, children, and soldiers on both sides. Her literary model was Graham Greene, whose dark portrayal of the early days of the American war in Vietnam influenced her articles and her style. ''Loving Graham Greene'' was the title she gave her novel, published by Random House in 2000.         She was working in the London bureau of The Times in 1969 when, as she wrote in an obituary she left with a covering note that was dated Tuesday, ''Ms. Emerson requested that she be sent to Vietnam because she had been in that country in 1956 and wanted to go back to write about the Vietnamese people and the immense unhappy changes in their lives, not a subject widely covered by the huge press corps who were preoccupied with covering the military story.''         Her articles from Vietnam, many reported with the help of Nguyen Ngoc Luong, her interpreter, brought alive for many readers people who had been an abstraction, the Vietnamese whose ''hearts and minds'' the United States went to war to win, but lost to communist adversaries who prevailed despite millions of casualties.         One of her articles after the unsuccessful South Vietnamese attempt to cut off North Vietnamese supply lines in Laos in 1971 reported how Sergeant Co, an infantry platoon leader, clung to the skids of an American helicopter to get out alive. '''Each helicopter could have been the last one, so what choice was there for me?' he asked. 'Only the madmen would stay and politely wait for the next helicopter.'''         Her literary voice was always gravely serious. In person, she was well dressed, precise in speech and eccentrically funny.         She was constantly giving money to veterans, refugees and street beggars. She could be possessive and domineering, especially toward the photographers whose work she thought would outlast her articles published with them; the words she compared to ice cubes that melted in the sun.         As Ms. Emerson put it in her own obituary: ''Her dispatches from Vietnam won a George Polk Award for excellence in foreign reporting, and, later, a Matrix Award from New York Women in Communications. Her nonfiction book on the war, 'Winners & Losers' (Random House, 1977), won a National Book Award in 1978 but she described it as 'too huge and somewhat messy.' Its subject was the effects of the conflict on some Americans, or 'an absence of the effect,' as she once said.''         Typical of ''Winners & Losers'' were lines like these, about Joseph (Teddy) Humber Jr., who lost both his legs in a mine explosion in Vietnam in 1972 and came home to his family in Westboro, Mass. ''Teddy did not seem to always know what the others were saying,'' she wrote. ''He seemed busy with something else; perhaps it was pain. He sat at the table without moving, often without hearing.''         Another book in 1985, ''Some American Men,'' published by Simon & Schuster, ranged further into the souls of her countrymen and their afflictions in sports and love as well as in war. ''Gaza, a Year in the Intifada,'' about a year she spent with Palestinians in what she called ''an occupied land,'' was published by The Atlantic Monthly Press in 1991.         ''Made to feel inferior, treated with contempt and cruelty, the Gazans struggled to transcend their own feelings of helplessness,'' she wrote then.         ''The book provoked hostility among friends, and others felt it was anti-Israel, but Ms. Emerson insisted this was not the reason for writing it,'' she explained later, in the obituary she left behind. ''She hoped to provide a primer for those who felt the situation in the Middle East was too complicated or too controversial to understand.''         Born in New York City to William B. Emerson and Ruth Shaw Emerson in 1929, she began her career in The Times's women's news department in 1957, describing herself on her application as a widow, giving her married name as Znamiecki.         ''I applied for a job at The New York Times many years ago, and felt correctly that my life depended on it,'' she explained in a note written just before her death. ''I didn't go to college, I ran away from an alcoholic wretched home and went to work on a hotel giveaway magazine.'' She continued, ''Getting a job on the women's page was a gift from heaven although I hated writing about shoes and clothes, all under the eye of the advertising department who measured editorial mention of retailers. You cannot imagine what it was like in those days.''         She left the paper in 1960 to live in Brussels with Charles A. Brofferio, whom she described as ''an ill-suited husband'' she divorced a year later.         The Times hired her back as a reporter in Paris in 1964 ''on the understanding that I would cover the haute couture collections twice a year,'' she explained. Moving to the paper's London bureau in late 1968, she made her way to Belfast to write some articles about the conflict in Northern Ireland, and in 1970, as she put it, ''I was allowed to go to Vietnam because the war was supposed to be over so it didn't matter if a female was sent. Et voilà!''       
         Virginia Grey, who made her film debut in 1927 at the age of 10 as Little Eva in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and acted almost continuously in movies and television for the next five decades, died on July 31 in Los Angeles. She was 87.         Her death was announced by Jennifer Fagen of the public affairs department of the Motion Picture and Television Fund; she had lived at its retirement home for the last two years. Although never a box office star, Miss Grey was as indomitable as she was versatile, acting in more than 100 films and 40 television shows -- musicals, comedies, adventure films, westerns and romantic dramas. Pretty and pert, she was often a supporting player, cast as the second lead in movies dominated by Joan Crawford, Betty Grable, Susan Hayward and even the Marx Brothers (''The Big Store'' in 1941). In 1942 she was in ''Tarzan's New York Adventure'' with Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan.         In many ways, her life paralleled the history of Hollywood's film studios, first as a contract player with Metro Goldwyn Mayer, later at 20th Century Fox and at Universal under the guidance of the producer Ross Hunter.         Ann Rutherford, who acted with her in several pictures (including ''Whistling in the Dark'' with Red Skelton and ''The Hardys Ride High'' with Mickey Rooney), remembered her as ''a nifty lady.'' ''She was blond and lovely,'' she recalled. ''The camera adored her. There was not a bad angle to her face.''         The key to her success, Ms. Rutherford said, was that she was so flexible: ''She could play the girl next door or somebody's other woman. And that was what kept her working.''         Ms. Grey was born in Los Angeles and nurtured in the film industry. Her father, Ray Grey, acted in Mack Sennett's Keystone comedies and later worked as an assistant director. The Grey home was frequently visited by Hollywood hopefuls, and Ms. Grey recalled that one of her babysitters was a Sennett actress, Gloria Swanson.         After Mr. Grey died, his wife became a film editor at Universal. When she heard that the studio was casting ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' she encouraged Virginia to audition -- and she won the role.         The next year she had small roles in three more movies, then stopped acting for several years to finish her education. But from 1931 onward, she was busily at work with Mary Pickford, Busby Berkeley (''Dames'' and ''Gold Diggers of 1935'') and Wallace Beery, among others. Occasionally, she played the leading female role in MGM's B-pictures.         In 1939, she appeared in the ''Les Blondes'' chorus in ''Idiot's Delight,'' starring Clark Gable.         Ms. Grey, who was involved romantically with Gable, never married. She is survived by her sister, Lorraine Grey Heindorf, two nieces and two nephews.         After her stint at MGM, she worked in ''Stage Door Canteen,'' ''Sweet Rosie O'Grady'' (with Betty Grable), Stanley Kramer's ''So This Is New York,'' ''The Bullfighter and the Lady'' and many others. In 1955, Ross Hunter cast her in ''All That Heaven Allows'' (with Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson), followed by ''The Restless Years'' and ''Portrait in Black.'' During the 1950's and 1960's she found renewed life on television (''Bonanza,'' ''Burke's Law,'' ''Marcus Welby, M.D.''). Among her later films were ''Love Has Many Faces'' (with Lana Turner), ''Madame X'' and in 1970 ''Airport.''         Ms. Grey allowed herself to mature onscreen, accepting the character roles that prolonged her career.         And about her career, she said, pragmatically, ''I consider myself a professional who acts -- not to express my soul or elevate the cinema, but to entertain and get paid for it.''       
         Izora Rhodes Armstead, one half of the disco-pop duo the Weather Girls, who sang the flamboyant and enduring club hit ''It's Raining Men,'' died on Sept. 16 at a hospital in San Leandro, Calif. Her age was unknown.         The cause was heart failure, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. The church where Ms. Armstead's funeral was held, St. John Missionary Baptist in San Francisco, confirmed her death.         ''It's Raining Men,'' a bombastic vocal romp that winkingly borrowed from gospel music -- ''Hallelujah, it's raining men, amen!'' goes its chorus -- was one of the biggest hits of the genre known as hi-NRG, a souped-up version of disco that ruled dance clubs in the 1980's.         Sung with gusto by Ms. Armstead, then known as Izora Rhodes, and her partner, Martha Wash, the song only reached No. 46 on the pop charts when it was released in 1983, but hit No. 1 on the club charts and later reached No. 2 in England.         Written by Paul Jabara and Paul Shaffer -- now of ''Late Show With David Letterman'' -- the song has since become an anthem of the gay club scene and in 2001 it again reached the top of the British charts with a version by a former Spice Girl, Geri Halliwell.         The song was the centerpiece of the group's first album, ''Success,'' which featured another booming Jabara-Shaffer composition, ''Dear Santa (Bring Me a Man This Christmas)'' and a version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair.''         Ms. Armstead and Ms. Wash met in San Francisco in the mid-70's when they both joined a gospel group called Now (News of the World). They were soon recruited to sing backup for Sylvester, a cross-dressing disco singer with a local following.         The two sang on four Sylvester albums, including the hit songs ''Dance (Disco Heat)'' and ''(You Make Me Feel) Mighty Real.''         The two went solo in 1979 under the name Two Tons o' Fun, a play on their Rubenesque physiques. They issued one album under that name before rechristening themselves the Weather Girls for ''Success.'' They recorded two more albums before disbanding in the late 80's.         After the Weather Girls, Ms. Wash sang, often anonymously, for C and C Music Factory, Black Box and other groups, and Ms. Armstead moved to Germany to found a new Weather Girls group with her daughter Dynell Rhodes, who survives Ms. Armstead, along with six other children and several grandchildren.       
         Dr. Katharina Dalton, a British gynecologist who did early work establishing a link between fluctuations in the menstrual cycle and changes in behavior and who advocated using progesterone to treat premenstrual syndrome, died on Sept. 17 in Britain, The Associated Press reported. She was 87.         Beginning in the early 1950's, Dr. Dalton led pioneering studies of premenstrual syndrome, challenging the widely accepted view that the condition was a figment of the imagination. She led one of the first clinics to specifically treat the symptoms, at University College Hospital in London.         She is largely credited with developing the use of menstrual charts for the diagnosis of the disorder, and argued that the timing of PMS in women was associated with higher rates of suicide attempts, alcohol abuse and violent crimes.         ''Many people did not believe it was a real entity,'' said Dr. Mona Shangold, a former assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ''She really brought it into the public eye, and eventually it became an accepted disorder for which we now have good treatments.''         PMS, Dr. Dalton argued, was brought on primarily by deficiencies of progesterone and could be alleviated with hormone therapy. She also believed that the hormone could be used to ease postnatal depression. But today most experts disagree with those findings and instead rely on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.'s, and other medications for the treatment of PMS.         ''None of the rest of us have found progesterone as helpful as the data Dr. Dalton presented, but she really was quite influential in the modern understanding of what happens to women premenstrually,'' said Dr. Diana Dell, an OB-GYN and psychiatrist at the Duke University Medical Center.         Born in 1916 in London, Katharina Kuipers Dalton began her career as a podiatrist after studying at the London Foot Hospital. After her first husband died during World War II, she decided to switch careers and earned a medical degree at the Royal Free Hospital.         In later work, Dr. Dalton helped demonstrate that depression and other disorders could be aggravated by PMS, particularly around the last few days of the menstrual cycle or the first days of menstruation. While many experts today agree that PMS can exacerbate certain conditions and influence behavior, some of Dr. Dalton's assertions remain controversial. In several court cases in the 1980's, for example, she testified in defense of women who blamed severe PMS for their criminal offenses.         Several of Dr. Dalton's books, including ''Once a Month,'' published in the late 70's, became best sellers.         Dr. Dalton is survived by four children and five grandchildren, according to The Independent, a British daily.       
         Nuha al-Radi, the Iraqi artist and diarist whose work depicted her country's tribulations with a wry, impish wit, has died in Beirut. She was 63.         Ms. Radi died on Aug. 30, of pneumonia, her immune system severely weakened as a result of treatment for leukemia, said her sister, Selma al-Radi, speaking by telephone from the Lebanese capital.         Although both a ceramist and a painter, Ms. Radi was best known for her book ''Baghdad Diaries,'' a vivid account of the texture of daily life during the first gulf war and its aftermath, when she found shelter from the bombing in the family orchard in a well-to-do neighborhood.         ''The birds have taken the worst beating of all,'' she wrote. ''They have sensitive souls, which cannot take all this hideous noise and vibration. All the caged lovebirds have died from the shock of the blasts, while birds in the wild fly upside down and do crazy somersaults. Hundreds, if not thousands, have died in the orchard. Lonely survivors fly about in a distracted fashion.''         After the book was reissued last year in the wake of the second gulf war, Michiko Kakutani wrote in a review in The New York Times that ''the opening sections of these diaries give the reader a tactile and highly personal sense of how the allied bombing of Baghdad in 1991 affected ordinary Iraqi civilians. These descriptions can be read as a harbinger, in some respects, of residents' efforts to cope with the recent war and the continuing postwar upheaval.''         While not overtly political, Ms. Radi had no love for either the government controlling Iraq or for the United States for repeatedly causing destruction in Baghdad, her native city.         The book brims with criticism of the United States for making Iraqi civilians bear the brunt of the violence in their efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein, while depicting the grim resignation and black humor Iraqis used to survive under his violent rule.         She relates in matter-of-fact detail how a friend's nanny working in one of the presidential palaces told about what happens to thieves:         ''She said that when someone was caught stealing, they gathered the staff together, brought in a doctor, who chopped off this guy's hand, and immediately dunked it into boiling oil to cauterize it.''         The work also included jokes like the one about Mr. Hussein asking his cabinet members what time it is, with them responding in unison, ''Whatever time you want, sir.''         After her book's publication Ms. Radi, uncertain of the reaction from the government, chose to live in exile in Beirut, following something of a family tradition. She was born in 1941 in Baghdad. Her father was an Iraqi diplomat who served as the country's ambassador to Iran and India until the monarchy was overthrown in 1958.         The family later moved to Beirut, where her survivors still live periodically. They include her mother, Suad Munir Abbas; a brother, Abbad, of Abu Dhabi and Toronto, and her sister, Selma, a renowned archaeologist who has done extensive work on preserving historic buildings in Yemen.         In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Radi studied pottery at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London before moving to Beirut and teaching for a short period at the American University there. With the outbreak of the civil war in Lebanon, she returned to Baghdad, where her work included several government commissions for large ceramic tableaus.         Ms. Radi used to joke that even the attempt to see her work was a perfect reflection of the turmoil in her country: one massive piece showing a magic carpet flight from ''1,001 Nights'' hung on a government building facing the Iranian Embassy while the other graced a presidential palace and was therefore off limits.         Taking visitors around the Iraqi capital in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war, she would nod toward the work near the embassy and tell them not to point and not to take pictures and that stopping to look was certainly out of the question.         Her work often combined a certain whimsy with the darker aspects of life in the Middle East. One exhibition, titled ''Embargo Art,'' held in Amman during the late 1990's, a period of Western sanctions against Iraq, consisted of ''found objects'' like old mufflers from cars, the kind of things Iraqis had to use to get by, she said.         Ms. Radi was especially trenchant in describing the growing divide between the West and the Arab world, one to which she was particularly attuned, given her ease at working in both cultures.         In her diary, she tells of an encounter in Baghdad during which a woman wishes that some great catastrophe would ''envelop the U.S. and swallow the whole continent.'' When someone else in the conversation protests that his brothers living there would perish, the woman responds, ''They can go down with it.''         Last year, weeks after Mr. Hussein was overthrown, Ms. Radi went back to Baghdad to spend several weeks with her mother, who had refused to leave, comparing herself to Scarlett O'Hara after having survived so many wars in Iraq.         Ms. Radi, who usually managed to find a flower to tuck behind her ear every day no matter what war-ravaged city she was in, scampered through the wreckage of Mr. Hussein's compound and found happily that much of her large ceramic tableau of Iraq had survived the bombing unscathed.         She was somewhat less than enchanted with Iraq's latest overseers for failing to provide basic security and services, however, describing the new tenants of the presidential compound in an interview with The Times last year in her typically caustically droll manner:         ''America is in its ivory tower palace,'' she said, ''We are used to having coups and revolutions. But usually people who stage them take over the country afterward.''       
         Phyllis Williams Lehmann, an archaeologist and art historian known for reuniting the hand of one of the icons of Western art, the Winged Victory of Samothrace, with two of its long-lost fingers, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Haydenville, Mass. She was 91.         The cause was congestive heart failure, according to Smith College, where Dr. Lehmann taught for more than 30 years.         Dr. Lehmann was an authority on the monuments and architecture of Samothrace, a remote, mountainous island in the north Aegean. The island was considered crucial in the development of the art and architecture of the Hellenistic period, which lasted from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C. until the mid-first century B.C.         Samothrace was the center of one of the most famous mystery cults of Greek antiquity; its rituals were carried out in the group of imposing buildings known as the Sanctuary of the Great Gods, erected between the fourth and the second centuries B.C. The first of these structures to be built in marble was dedicated by Alexander's father, Philip II. Alexander's successors also erected monuments in the sanctuary.         As a result, the ruins at Samothrace have been of continuing interest to archaeologists, who have excavated there since the 1860's. Dr. Lehmann, who first visited the island in 1938, did her early work there with her husband, the archaeologist Karl Lehmann. She was assistant field director of the excavation from 1948 to 1960 and acting director from 1960 to 1965, and she remained closely involved with Samothrace for the rest of her career. A member of the Smith faculty from 1946 to 1978, she was dean of the college from 1965 to 1970.         Phyllis Williams was born Nov. 30, 1912, in Brooklyn. She received a bachelor's degree from Wellesley in 1934, and for the next two years worked at the Brooklyn Museum as an assistant in charge of the Classical collection. In 1936, she began her graduate work at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts, which ran the excavation on Samothrace. She received her Ph.D. in 1943, and married Mr. Lehmann, the excavation's director, the next year. He died in 1960. No immediate family members survive.         Working on Samothrace in 1949, Phyllis Lehmann made one of her most important discoveries, a tall marble statue of Nike, the goddess of victory, dating from the second century B.C. Unearthed in three large pieces, Dr. Lehmann's statue was the third Nike to be found on the island. The first, the Winged Victory that today greets visitors to the Louvre from the top of an imposing staircase, was found in 1863 by the French archaeologist Charles Champoiseau. That statue, from around 190 B.C., was unearthed in fragments, probably damaged in an earthquake in the sixth century A.D. Reassembled in Paris, it lacked head, arms and hands.         In the 1870's, Austrian archaeologists uncovered a second Nike on Samothrace, this one a Roman copy. They took it to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, along with an unrelated assortment of marble fragments also found on the island. The fragments remained at the museum, unidentified and forgotten, for three-quarters of a century.         Dr. Lehmann's Nike, which had stood atop a building called the Hieron, is today on display in a museum on Samothrace.         In 1950, a team led by Karl Lehmann unearthed the missing right hand of the Louvre's Winged Victory. The hand, which had lost its fingers, had slid out of sight, under a large rock, near where the statue had originally stood. The team also found the tip of the ring finger nearby.         On their way home from Samothrace, the Lehmanns stopped in Vienna, where Phyllis sifted through the dusty storerooms of the Kunsthistorisches Museum. Examining the fragments left there by the Austrian team more than 70 years before, she found the rest of Winged Victory's ring finger and a thumb. The hand, with thumb and finger reattached, is displayed at the Louvre in a glass case next to the statue.         Dr. Lehmann's many books include ''The Pedimental Sculptures of the Hieron in Samothrace'' (1962) and ''Samothrace III: The Hieron,'' which was awarded the Alice Davis Hitchcock Book Award of the Society of Architectural Historians in 1969.         She was made an honorary citizen of Samothrace in 1968.       
         Betty Hill, whose assertion that she was carried off by otherworldly beings in 1961 inspired a national obsession with alien abduction that remains a staple of American popular culture, died on Sunday at her home in Portsmouth, N.H. She was 85.         The cause was lung cancer, her niece Kathleen Marden said.         Mrs. Hill was not the first person to tell of an alien encounter. But her account was the first to capture the public imagination on a grand scale, defining a narrative subgenre that has flourished in the decades since.         Mrs. Hill's account was the subject of a book by John G. Fuller, ''The Interrupted Journey: Two Lost Hours 'Aboard a Flying Saucer''' (Dial, 1966). In 1975 it became a television movie, ''The UFO Incident.'' The film starred Estelle Parsons as Mrs. Hill and James Earl Jones as her husband, Barney, who also said he was abducted.         The incident, the Hills said, occurred on the night of Sept. 19, 1961. Driving in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, they saw a light that seemed to grow larger and larger. Back home, they found what appeared to be shiny spots on the car's exterior. They could not account for a two-hour segment of their trip.         The Hills later saw a psychiatrist, who put them under hypnosis. Gradually, a narrative of the couple's lost hours emerged. They recounted many times that a group of short gray-skinned beings stopped their car and took them aboard a waiting spaceship. There, the Hills said, they were subjected to rigorous medical examinations that included inserting a long needle into Mrs. Hill's navel.         The account fit squarely in the Western narrative tradition. With a dark night, ghostly apparitions and sexual undercurrent, it had many Victorian gothic hallmarks, and it shared the common Western folklore theme of being spirited off and ravished by an otherworldly creature.         In the Hills' account, these traditional elements were transplanted to a modern but no less anxious time, the height of the cold war, when many people gazed nervously skyward.         ''It's not unlike the Leda and the swan myth,'' said Terry Matheson, a professor of English at the University of Saskatchewan and the author of ''Alien Abductions: Creating a Modern Phenomenon'' (Prometheus, 1998). ''The alien comes in, probes women in a distinctly sexual way for purposes that are equally inscrutable, but which may, we're told, make sense down the road.''         Mrs. Hill was born Eunice Elizabeth Barrett on June 28, 1919, in Newton, N.H. A graduate of the University of New Hampshire, she was a social worker for many years. Besides her niece, survivors include three sisters, two children and three grandchildren. Mr. Hill died in 1969.         The Hills' cultural legacy includes films (''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''), television programs (''Roswell'') and books, like those by Whitley Strieber and John Mack, that treat alien abduction as a plausible phenomenon.       
         JOYCE ACCIAIOLI RUDGE is happy to be off her feet. ''It's so good to sit down; man, it's the best,'' she says, relishing the downtime from a morning that began with 70 e-mail messages from Italy. Her legs are tucked underneath her on a wooden bench in Federal Hall National Memorial, the Greek Revival landmark on Wall Street. The hall is now transformed into the downtown branch of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, with 21 portraits of the powerful Medici family dating to the 16th and 17th centuries.         Ms. Rudge is the organizer behind the Splendor of Florence, a cultural festival that is being staged throughout Lower Manhattan through Sunday, with tastings of Tuscan food, concerts and Florentine artisan craft shops in the glass-domed Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, and the Medici exhibition on Wall Street. She convinced the Uffizi to lend the Medici paintings for display until Nov. 12.         How did she manage to pull this off? ''It's all about networking; that's the key,'' says Ms. Rudge, who is 57 and a former fashion model. ''It's about people trusting that you are going to deliver what you say you're going to deliver.''         In the case of the Medici art, she says, the director of the Uffizi and Italian officials took a fancy to her pitch that the festival would bring together Florence's best artisans, many of them making the same beautiful products, including lace and jewelry, that are prominent in the Uffizi paintings hanging in Federal Hall.         ''They took an interest in the theme,'' Ms. Rudge says. ''They love their city, their artisans, and the idea of being able to help artisans who are under threat of extinction because everything is so manufactured these days.''         So who is Ms. Rudge, this delicate-boned beauty with smoky brown eyes and soaring cheekbones? Here's what we know. She was a hometown girl from Providence, R.I., who made good as a fashion model in Milan and Paris in the 1970's and early 1980's, gracing the covers of European Vogue and Cosmopolitan. She organized the first Splendor of Florence in Providence in 1999 as a tribute to her grandfathers, Italian artisans who came to America in the early 1900's. She repeated the festival in Philadelphia in 2001.         She seems to have a knack for organizing things, even rather splashy projects about which she knows very little. She has sailed only twice in her life, yet she handled the logistics for the Italian entry in the 1983 America's Cup race, getting loads of good press in Italy as the Italian sailors regaled the locals in Newport, R.I., with pasta dinners and danced into the night.         ''It established me as a person who could pull rabbits out of hats for Italian companies,'' says Ms. Rudge, elegantly dressed in a taupe-colored pantsuit, her shoulders covered in a striped Kenzo shawl.         In 1995, Ms. Rudge organized her first event in Lower Manhattan, an exhibition about engines of the Renaissance period called ''Mechanical Marvels: Invention in the Age of Leonardo.'' Sponsored by the Italian aeronautics company Finmeccanica, the event was also held in the Winter Garden. That is where she met the mayor of Florence and told him of her idea to celebrate Florentine artisans. Her grandparents are from Molise, a region southeast of Rome, but she says her ancestors are from Florence.         Ms. Rudge is found at the bottom of the grand marble staircase in the Winter Garden. She leans into her cellphone, chatting incessantly, alternating between Italian and English. She says she gets a kick out of working under pressure. She thrives on stress.         ''I could never do something at the same pace, every day,'' she says in a low, husky voice. ''I need to have these moments of high stress, high anxiety, an impossible schedule, then downtime. It's almost like climbing a mountain. Mind you, this is a very big mountain.''         AND what a climb it is. Ms. Rudge is on her cellphone, trying to find black cabbage for Tuscan chefs who consider it an absolute must for a thick peasant soup to be served in the Grill Room at the World Financial Center. Then she is on to another crisis: a Florentine artisan is toting around two suitcases of antique gold jewelry, too afraid to part with it. Ms. Rudge contemplates getting a Brink's armored truck to stash the gold. In the end, the most expensive gold is returned to Florence.         ''To do this job, you just have to be resourceful,'' she says. ''You don't need a degree.''         Ms. Rudge doesn't have a college degree. So does she have a bit of a complex about that?         ''I think you tend to overcompensate,'' she says. ''I've spent my life researching things.''         She moved to Italy at age 19 to discover her roots. Much to the dismay of her parents -- her father was a furniture maker, while her mother made costume jewelry -- she stayed in Europe to pursue a modeling career. She has been married for 15 years to Peter Rudge, an English-born music entrepreneur who managed the Rolling Stones and the Who, among others, in the 1970's. They have a home in London.         For the last couple of years, Ms. Rudge has been living in a hotel suite in Battery Park City, flitting between New York and Florence. She is now looking for a permanent home here. She wants to see the Splendor of Florence be an event every two years in downtown Manhattan.         ''I like solving problems, so I'm certainly having a field day here,'' she says, laughing.         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Yang Huanyi, the last woman to communicate secretly with others in a rare script used exclusively by women, died Sept. 20 in her home in Hunan Province, China. She was believed to be in her late 90's.         The New China News Agency reported her death, saying estimates of her age ranged from 95 to 98.         The script, Nushu, represents the language spoken in Jiangyong Prefecture in the rolling hills of southern Hunan Province. Women, who were denied education for many centuries in China, used it to share feminine feelings, including fears about arranged marriages, husbands and, of course, mothers-in-law.         ''By writing, so much suffering disappears,'' Ms. Yang said in an interview with Northwest Asian Weekly in 1996.         The news agency called Ms. Yang the ''last practitioner'' of Nushu.         However, Orie Endo, a language professor at Bunkyo University in Tokyo and a leading scholar of the writing system, said in an e-mail message that at least two other women knew and still used some Nushu. She said Ms. Yang was important because she was the last woman to use Nushu to communicate with other women under an oath of secrecy, the ancient way.         One of the women she said was conversant with the script is He Yanxin, who learned it from her grandmother. The other, He Jinhua, who like He Yanxin is in her 60's, began to teach herself to write Nushu in 1997.         Laura Miller, a professor of linguistic anthropology at Loyola University in Chicago, said in an e-mail message that she had heard reports that other anthropologists working in China had found other women who continued to use Nushu.         But its disappearance may be inevitable. In 2002, Time magazine included Nushu in the 50 percent of the world's 6,000 languages that might be extinct by 2050. An academic record is being preserved by scholars, some of them men. Also, the Chinese government supports the collection and study of Nushu script, partly to encourage tourism in the small part of Hunan Province where it was historically used. Nushu, which means ''female writing,'' contains at least 1,800 characters, each representing a spoken syllable, not an idea, as is the case for much of Chinese calligraphy, which has at least 50,000 characters. A script specific to one sex is rare among the world's languages, and popular writers have called Nushu ''the witch's script'' and the ''first language of women's liberation.''         Men once used the script but lost interest, not least because they were educated in Mandarin, Dr. Miller wrote in February on a Web site, keywords.oxus.net.         Women were not educated, and gathered at homes to make shoes or embroider. Though in early Chinese history, the penalty for creating languages was death, women quietly developed a code for their secret sorority.         ''What started as a simple way to express themselves became a chronicle of their private anguish,'' Zhao Liming, a Nushu specialist at Qinghua University in Beijing, said in an interview with The South China Post.         Men, who always understood spoken Nushu, derided the written form as ''ant characters'' or ''mosquito scrawls,'' the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported in June. Professor Zhao said the belief was that ''anything to do with women was inferior, insignificant.''         A principal function of the script was for communication among women who called themselves ''sworn sisters.'' Writing in verse on handkerchiefs, fans and elsewhere, they often used Nushu's vocabulary of more than 20,000 words to communicate about marriage as a tragic event. Hardbound booklets conveying deep anxieties about marriage were common wedding gifts in the region.         Chinese scholars began studying Nushu in the mid-1950's, but the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 prohibited its use as a leftover of feudalism. In the early 1980's, academics rediscovered it and the dozen old women who still used it. Yang Huanyi was born in a village in Hunan in 1909, Dr. Endo and at least one other source said. At 10, she began learning Nushu from a woman whose feet had been bound in the traditional fashion and could not find work. In the lessons, the teacher wrote a strip of characters, as Ms. Yang watched. The woman sang as she wrote, and Ms. Yang sang the same songs when she studied by herself.         Once Ms. Yang mastered Nushu, she, too, wrote for others, but charged only for marriage booklets. She married, but her husband died two years later after he was bitten by a snake. She then married a gambler who ran up big debts. They had eight children before he died.         Her family responsibilities and the deaths of her sworn sisters ended Ms. Yang's writing until 1990, when a scholar urged her to resume.         Ms. Yang is survived by two sons and a daughter, The South China Morning Post reported.       
         Helen Gee, whose Limelight photography gallery in Greenwich Village in the 1950's became a pioneering blueprint for the offering and selling of photography as an art form, died on Sunday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 85. Her death was announced by a friend, John Erdman.         Spacious and well lit, the Limelight was started in May 1954 and supported by the adjoining coffeehouse. Although a market in fine photographs was almost nonexistent, for about seven years Limelight carried on as if there were one, setting the standard for successors that came in a trickle in the early 1970's and grew into a flood by the 1990's. Ms. Gee mounted new shows at roughly five-week intervals and wrote the news releases.         Two earlier galleries -- Alfred Stieglitz's 291 early in the 20th century and Julien Levy's in the 1930's -- had tried to sell photographs but without success. Limelight did somewhat better. An Atget show, with the prints made by Berenice Abbott and priced at $20 each, was almost a sellout. More than half the pictures in an Edward Weston exhibition, at $75 a print, were bought. But rare photographs, photograms and photomontages by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy (priced between $100 and $200) failed to sell. Prints by Robert Frank ($25 each) and Julia Margaret Cameron ($65 each) found only a few buyers. Limelight was the showcase for a wide variety of photographic styles, from classic straight photography (Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham) to social documentary (Brassai, Lisette Model, W. Eugene Smith) and subjective and experimental work (Rudolph Burckhardt, Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind). Such a roster differed sharply from the generally homogeneous fare found in popular picture magazines like Life and Look.         Before opening Limelight, Ms. Gee had been a successful retoucher of color transparencies. She briefly took photography courses with Alexey Brodovitch, Model and Sid Grossman. But what Ms. Gee lacked in coffeehouse experience, she made up for in iron determination, familiarity with the Village art and photography worlds, and personal charm.         In her 1997 memoir, ''Limelight: A Greenwich Village Photography Gallery and Coffeehouse in the 50's'' (University of New Mexico Press), Ms. Gee recalled with wry humor and unsentimental directness her struggles with freeloading drug addicts, the lack of adequate help, the threat of bankruptcy as well as brutish union officials.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Mary Cantwell described how Ms. Gee ''had to survive a crooked contractor, a plague of city inspectors, hours in the Bowery's restaurant supply stores and an inundation of Seven Sisters graduates and dropouts all looking to be doing 'something' that would bring them closer to the arts.''         Helen Charlotte Wimmer was born on April 29, 1919, in Jersey City. Her father, Peter Wimmer, had trained in Europe as a church decorator. Settling in New York, he supported his family by painting apartments.         At 16, Helen left home to live in Greenwich Village with Yun Gee, a Chinese modernist painter she had met through an art teacher. They were married in 1942. When Yun Gee, subsequently found to be schizophrenic, threatened to turn violent, Ms. Gee left with their infant daughter, Li-lan.         With a child to support, she taught herself transparency retouching, which paid well. By the early 1950's, with leading magazines and advertising agencies for clients, she could afford a secretary, private school for Li-lan and designer clothes. It was during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art that Ms. Gee came across a photography show and was instantly hooked.         Financial and labor pressures forced Ms. Gee to close the Limelight's doors on Jan. 31, 1961. She then became an art consultant and also started to revive interest in Yun Gee's work. When the photography market began to heat up in the late 1970's, Ms. Gee returned to photography, this time as a curator, lecturer and writer.         In late 2001 and early 2002, Ms. Gee offered her collection of photographs for exhibition and sale, first at the Stephen Daiter Gallery in Chicago and then at the Sarah Morthland Gallery in New York. Most of the prints had been given to Ms. Gee by photographers whose work had appeared at Limelight.         Ms. Gee's second marriage, to Kevin Sullivan, ended in divorce. Besides her daughter, Li-lan Gee, an artist who lives in Easthampton, L.I., she is survived by a sister, Ellen Berland, of Warren, Conn., and a brother, Henry Wimmer, of Bath, N.Y.

         Iris Chang, a journalist whose best-selling book, ''The Rape of Nanking,'' a chronicle of the atrocities committed in that city by occupying Japanese forces, helped break a six-decade-long international silence on the subject, committed suicide on Tuesday near Los Gatos, Calif. She was 36 and lived in San Jose.         Ms. Chang's literary agent, Susan Rabiner, announced the death.         Ms. Chang was found in her car on a rural road south of Los Gatos, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, the local authorities told The San Francisco Chronicle. She had left a suicide note at home that she had painstakingly written, edited and rewritten, her husband, Brett Douglas said in a telephone interview yesterday.         ''The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II'' was published by Basic Books in 1997, the 60th anniversary of the massacre. The book documented the events in Nanking (now Nanjing) during the second Sino-Japanese War, in the years leading up to World War II.         In December 1937 Japanese troops entered the city, which until shortly before the invasion had been the Chinese capital. In less than two months they murdered more than 300,000 civilians and raped more than 80,000 women. Ms. Chang's book was the first full-length nonfiction account of the event.         Reviewing ''The Rape of Nanking'' in The New York Times Book Review, Orville Schell called it an ''important new book,'' adding that Ms. Chang ''recounts the grisly massacre with understandable outrage.''         She had a keen personal interest in the subject. Ms. Chang's grandparents had fled Nanking just before the occupation, eventually settling in the United States. Growing up in the Midwest, she heard family stories of the massacre, but as an adult she was unable to find much about it in print. In China and Japan, and even in the West, the subject had been almost completely lost to history.         ''The whole issue had scar tissue growing over it, but it had never really healed,'' Mr. Schell, the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime observer of China, said in a telephone interview. ''She sort of threw the curtain back on a period that the Chinese Communist Party and the Japanese hoped was shrouded in official declarations of a new collaboration. But it turned out there was a lot of unfinished business.''         Fluent in Mandarin, Ms. Chang traveled to China, where she scoured archives and interviewed elderly survivors. What she learned would force her to describe the indescribable:         ''Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women, slice off their breasts, nail them alive to walls,'' Ms. Chang wrote. ''Fathers were forced to rape their daughters, and sons their mothers, as other family members watched. Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs and the roasting of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were practiced, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying people to their waists and watching them torn apart by German shepherds. So sickening was the spectacle that even Nazis in the city were horrified.''         ''The Rape of Nanking'' spent 10 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, and close to half a million copies have been sold, Ms. Rabiner said.         The book drew wide international attention. In Japan it prompted outrage among conservatives. (A planned Japanese edition was cancelled in 1999.) Elsewhere it engendered demands for the Japanese government to make reparations or, at least, a formal apology, something Ms. Chang to the end of her life felt had been inadequately done.         ''There have been all sorts of little fragments and shards and bits and pieces,'' Mr. Schell said. ''But no one has done what Willy Brandt did: got down on his knees in the Warsaw ghetto and asked forgiveness.''         Iris Shun-Ru Chang was born on March 28, 1968, in Princeton, N.J. She grew up in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., where her father, a physicist, and her mother, a microbiologist, taught at the University of Illinois. Ms. Chang received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Illinois in 1989. After working briefly as a reporter for The Associated Press and The Chicago Tribune, she earned a master's degree from the writing program of Johns Hopkins University in 1991.         She published her first book, ''Thread of the Silkworm'' (Basic Books, 1995), when she was just 27. It told the story of Tsien Hsue-shen, a Chinese-born scientist deported from the United States during the McCarthy era, who returned to China and founded that country's intercontinental missile program. Ms. Chang also wrote ''The Chinese in America: A Narrative History,'' published last year by Viking.         At the time of her death, she was researching a book on American soldiers who served in tank units on the Bataan peninsula before World War II, many of whom were captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. In the course of her research several months ago, Ms. Chang became severely depressed and had to be hospitalized, Ms. Rabiner said.         Besides her husband, Ms. Chang is survived by her parents, Shau-Jin and Ying-Ying, and a brother, Michael, all of San Jose; and by a son, Christopher.         In a 1998 interview with The Straits Times of Singapore, Ms. Chang described her reasons for writing ''The Rape of Nanking'':         ''I wrote it out of a sense of rage,'' she said. ''I didn't really care if I made a cent from it. It was important to me that the world knew what happened in Nanking back in 1937.''       
         Trina Schart Hyman, who illustrated an entire shelf of children's books and inspired many others who worked in the genre, died on Friday in Lebanon, N.H. She was 65 and lived in Lyme, N.H.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, said Jean Aull, her partner.         She won the Caldecott Medal, the highest award for authors and artists in her field, for Margaret Hodges's ''St. George and the Dragon: A Golden Legend Adapted From Edmund Spenser's 'Faerie Queen''' (Little, Brown: 1984). She won Caldecott honors three times, for ''Little Red Riding Hood''; ''A Child's Calendar,'' with text by John Updike; and ''Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins'' by Eric A. Kimmel (Holiday House, 1989).         She joined the staff of Cricket magazine for children as an artist and illustrator in 1972 and became its art director. By the time she left, in 1979, she had established herself as a model for many others looking for a career in children's book publishing.         In all, Ms. Hyman illustrated more than 150 books. Her watercolors, oils and drawings enlivened everything from collected stories to novels to poetry, as well as oft-retold classics like ''Sleeping Beauty,'' ''Rapunzel'' and the Arthurian legends.         She worked with readers as young as toddlers in mind, and she was widely known for opening their eyes to folklore and fairy tales. Her pictures gave form to the imagery conjured up by master storytellers like the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, Mark Twain, Dickens, Chaucer, Dylan Thomas and, not least, Margot Fonteyn's retelling of ''Swan Lake.''         She also wrote her own books, which she illustrated, including ''How Six Found Christmas'' (Holiday House, 1991); ''A Little Alphabet'' (William Morrow, 1993); her retelling of the Grimms' ''Little Red Riding Hood'' (Holiday House, 1983); and ''Self-Portrait: Trina Schart Hyman'' (Addison-Wesley, 1981). Another more recent favorite was ''A Child's Calendar'' (Holiday House, 1999), in which she illustrated poems by Mr. Updike, one for each month.         John Briggs, publisher of Holiday House, estimated her output at millions of copies, with many of her books translated for publication in other countries.         She was born Trina Schart in Philadelphia and grew up in Doylestown, Pa. She studied at the Philadelphia Museum College of Art and the Boston Museum School of Art in the late 1950's and trained for one more year at the Konstfackskolan, the Swedish State Art School, in Stockholm in 1960 and 1961.         Her first work was published in Sweden in 1961, to accompany stories about ''Toffe and the Little Car.'' By the end of the 1960's, she had done more than two dozen book from American publishers like Houghton, Scholastic, Bobbs-Merrill and LittleBrown.         Her marriage to Harris Hyman, of Portland, Ore., ended in divorce.Besides Ms. Aull, Ms. Hyman is survived by her daughter, Katrin Tchana of Fairlee, Vt., for whom she illustrated a retelling of ''The Serpent Slayer and Other Stories of Strong Women'' (Little, Brown; 1998); and two grandsons.       
         Frederica de Laguna, an anthropologist whose work on the history and culture of little-known Arctic civilizations was groundbreaking in the most literal sense of the word, died on Oct. 6 at her home in Haverford, Pa. She was 98.         Her death was announced by Bryn Mawr College, where Dr. de Laguna was the William R. Kenan Jr. professor emeritus of anthropology. She founded the college's anthropology department and taught there from 1938 until her retirement in 1975.         An authority on Alaskan prehistory, Dr. de Laguna was part of the first generation of women to succeed in the rough-and-ready, ultramasculine world of early 20th century field archaeology. She traveled thousands of miles by steamship and skiff, leading expeditions to villages so remote they appeared on no map. There, she contended with -- and generally got the better of -- bitter cold, frozen ground, ravenous mosquitoes and the rare male colleague foolhardy enough to question her ability.         ''I love the actual digging, the rhythmical swing of the arms and the bending and pushing with the whole body,'' Dr. de Laguna wrote in ''Voyage to Greenland'' (1977), a memoir of her first field trip, made when she was 22. ''The sun shines warmly over my back, the rich, sweet smell of rotted blubber rises from the saturated earth.''         In 1975, Dr. de Laguna and Margaret Mead were the first female anthropologists elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Among her best-known books are ''The Archaeology of Cook Inlet'' (1934), ''The Prehistory of Northern North America as Seen From the Yukon'' (1947), ''Chugach Prehistory: The Archeology of Prince William Sound, Alaska'' (1956) and her three-volume masterwork, ''Under Mount Saint Elias: The History and Culture of the Yakutat Tlingit'' (1972). She was the subject of a 1997 documentary film, ''Reunion Under Mount Saint Elias.''         When Dr. de Laguna made her first trip to Alaska, in 1930, Arctic culture was virtually unknown. Victorian explorers had brought back trunkfuls of artifacts, but no scholar before her had studied an Arctic community in depth.         ''She was really trying to find any possible kind of evidence that could converge to give us the overall history of these peoples,'' said Regna Darnell, an anthropologist at the University of Western Ontario and a former student of Dr. de Laguna's. ''Those early papers are a database that people have worked with ever since.''         Frederica Annis Lopez de Leo de Laguna, almost always called Freddy, was born on Oct. 3, 1906, in Ann Arbor, Mich. She grew up in Bryn Mawr, where her parents taught philosophy. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Bryn Mawr in 1927 and, in 1933, a doctorate in anthropology from Columbia, where she was one of the last students of the anthropologist Franz Boas.         In 1929, while still a graduate student, she joined a Danish expedition to a tiny island on Greenland's west coast. She planned to stay six weeks. She stayed nearly six months.         ''How could I realize the hold which this experience -- the free life, the happy, fascinating natives, the absorbing work and the loyal comradeship -- has obtained over me,'' she wrote in a letter home at the end of the trip. ''I feel as if I could never be content with ordinary living again, unless it were to be broken by a return to the Arctic. It makes me very sad to know that I have found my ideal vocation in such an inaccessible place.''         She was so sure of her vocation, and its incompatibility with married life, that she broke her engagement to a young mining engineer. She never married, and left no immediate survivors.         A Wave in World War II, Dr. de Laguna also studied the Pima Indians of Arizona. She wrote two mystery novels with anthropological settings, ''The Arrow Points to Murder'' (1937) and ''Fog on the Mountain'' (1938).         While Dr. de Laguna's work drew praise from many of the Alaskan Natives whose traditions she explored, she had limited patience with the sensitivities of the multicultural era. In recent years, she was called upon to defend her practice -- routine among anthropologists of her generation -- of opening the graves of indigenous people and removing their contents for study.         With the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in 1990, many of these remains, which had been in museums for decades, were returned for reburial. Dr. de Laguna regretted the loss to scholarship in no uncertain terms.         ''Some of our ancestors went to the stake for the right to do science,'' she told The Baltimore Sun in 1997. ''Now we have to kowtow to the superstition of these Indians.''       
         Miriam Schlein, whose nearly one hundred books, written over half a century, taught very young children about animals and concepts like time and space, died on Nov. 23 in New York. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels, her family said.         Ms. Schlein wrote to educate while also entertaining her readers. She found new ways of telling them about bats and skunks and porcupines and their behavior even as she cleared up myths about them. Some of her recent books were about dinosaurs, and four are currently in print: ''Before the Dinosaurs'' (1996), illustrated by Michael Rothman; ''The Dino Quiz Book'' (1995), illustrated by Nate Evans; ''Let's Go Dinosaur Tracking!'' (1991), illustrated by Kate Duke; and ''Discovering Dinosaur Babies'' (1991), illustrated by Margaret Colbert.         Other works featured elephants, pandas, sea horses. pigeons and squirrels. Two new books, her last, appeared this year: ''The Story About Me,'' and ''Little Raccoon's Big Question.'' She first appeared in print in 1951 with ''A Day at the Playground'' from Golden Books, where she worked as a secretary.         Ms. Schlein was born in Brooklyn. She received a B.A. in English and psychology from Brooklyn College in 1947 and then held a number of jobs in advertising and publishing.         She was in the children's department of Simon & Schuster when she decided that her future lay in writing. She pursued it with a series of books about concepts, illustrated by Leonard Kessler and published by William R. Scott. They included ''Shapes'' (1952) and ''Heavy Is a Hippopotamus.'' In the 1950's she also wrote some stories about children and animals that won her wide recognition and awards, including ''Four Little Foxes,'' ''Elephant Herd,'' and ''When Will the World Be Mine?'' about a baby snowshoe rabbit, which The New Yorker called ''a poetic book.''         Some of her books were Junior Literary Guild Selections and several of her natural-science titles received Outstanding Science Books for Children awards. ''When Will the World Be Mine?'' (1953), republished 20 years later as ''The Rabbit's World,'' was named a Caldecott Honor Book.         Her marriage to Harvey Weiss of Westport, Conn., an artist who illustrated some of her early work, ended in divorce.         Ms. Schlein is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth S. Weiss of Union City, N.J.; a son, John M. Weiss of Brooklyn; a brother, Dr. Paul Schlein of Bethesda, Md.; and four grandchildren.       
         The soprano Renata Tebaldi, one of the most beloved opera singers of all time -- Arturo Toscanini, hard to please, said she had ''the voice of an angel'' -- died yesterday in the Republic of San Marino, where she had a home, her doctor told The Associated Press. Miss Tebaldi, who had been in failing health for several months, was 82.         At her best, in roles like Puccini's Mimi and Tosca and Verdi's Desdemona and Alice Ford, Miss Tebaldi was a singer of overwhelming expressivity and matchless vocal allure; arguably, hers was the most sumptuously beautiful lirico-spinto soprano voice (one combining lighter lyrical and weightier dramatic qualities) to emerge from Italy in the 20th century.         Cooler heads could fault her for what often seemed incomplete technique, some strident full-voiced top notes when the vocal line took her above high B-flat, and occasional lapses in pitch. But most opera buffs and critics found it impossible to have a cool head when listening to Renata Tebaldi. She beguiled listeners with the sheer plummy richness of her voice, the melting legato phrases, the deeply expressive yet never maudlin emotional quality of her singing, the unearthly beauty of her floated pianissimo high notes and the temperament she could summon in moments of dramatic intensity.         Though a dedicated artist, she was reluctant to challenge herself. She avoided singing in any language other than Italian, deeming French too nasal and German too guttural, always afraid to compromise the beauty of her sound in her native tongue. But what she considered cautiousness, some critics thought complacency. A vocal crisis in 1963, compounded by exhaustion, compelled her to take a year off, during which she recuperated and reworked her technique. When she returned to the stage in 1964, even some of her most ardent fans conceded that her voice had lost some of its luster.         Still, during what she called her ''second career,'' Miss Tebaldi did some exquisite singing and continued to win understandable devotion from the public. After a deeply affecting and vocally exquisite performance as Desdemona in Verdi's ''Otello'' one night at the Metropolitan Opera, the audience kept her coming back for so many curtain calls that she finally appeared wearing her coat around her costume, to signal that she needed to go home.         Tall and stately, she was a lovely woman with creamy white skin, big blue eyes, and trademark dimples when she smiled. Rudolf Bing, the crusty general manager of the Met during Miss Tebaldi's prime years, knew her demanding side. ''Miss Renata Tebaldi was always sweet and very firm,'' he once said. ''She had dimples of iron.''         During the 1950's, she endured a public rivalry with the soprano Maria Callas. Biographies of the two divas present contrary accounts of who started it and how. The dispute was fueled by publicists and an eager press. But artistically, the idea that they were opposites -- Callas the galvanizing dramatic artist and Tebaldi the supreme vocalist who valued beauty of sound above all else -- was wrongheaded. In roles like Violetta from the Verdi opera ''La Traviata,'' Callas could sing with vocal elegance and vulnerability; in roles like Verdi's Aida, Miss Tebaldi could be fiery and impetuous.         For all Miss Tebaldi's accomplishments, her career faltered in the late 1960's. When she retired in 1976, she was only 54. Still, she began early and had as active and successful a first 15 years as any singer of the 20th century.         Renata Ersilia Clotilde Tebaldi was born on Feb. 1, 1922, in Pesaro, Italy. Her father, Teobaldo Tebaldi, was a wounded soldier from the First World War when he met and married Giuseppina Barbieri, a gifted singer who had wanted a musical career but became a nurse. Six years younger than his wife, Teobaldo was restless and unfaithful. The marriage fell apart when Renata, their only child, was 3. Giuseppina took the little girl back to her hometown, Langhirano, outside Parma.         Not long afterward the child woke one morning and could hardly stand. The diagnosis was polio. She began treatments -- injections, massages, thermal compresses, physical therapy -- that lasted five years but proved successful. During this time she and her mother bonded tightly. When Miss Tebaldi's career began, her mother traveled with her constantly, essentially continuing until, at 68, she died in New York in 1957, a loss that devastated Miss Tebaldi. (Despite periodic meetings over the years with her father, they never fully reconciled.)         At first as a child, Miss Tebaldi was drawn to the piano, and she enrolled in studies at the conservatory in Parma, which necessitated a difficult commute. When she was 17, her piano teacher persuaded her to study voice at the conservatory with Ettore Campogalliani, who would later recall her as a scrupulous, perceptive student with a passion for music who kept a certain distance between herself and others. Later the renowned vocal pedagogue Carmen Melis became her most important teacher.         Her opera debut was in 1944, in the smaller role of Elena in Boito's ''Mefistofele'' at the regional theater in Rovigo, Italy. Instant success propelled her into appearances in Parma as Puccini's Mimi in ''La Bohème,'' her first Desdemona and other roles. In 1946, she auditioned with Toscanini at La Scala in Milan, and Miss Tebaldi later said that she remembered every detail of it: her queasiness as she waited backstage, the fearsome presence of the gruff maestro, and finally Toscanini's shouts of ''Brava, brava!'' This led to a career-making appearance in a concert to reopen the La Scala opera house, heavily damaged during the Second World War.         By the time of her much-anticipated Met debut in January 1955, as Desdemona, Miss Tebaldi was already a celebrated singer. Today's opera buffs can only swoon looking at the cast list that night, with Mario Del Monaco as Otello, Leonard Warren as Iago and Fritz Stiedry conducting. The critic Olin Downes hedged in his initial assessment for The New York Times. But by the time of her first Met Mimi, in February, Downes was duly impressed. ''It is a voice of range and colors of all sorts, and one that throbs with feeling,'' he wrote.         Singing always came first for Miss Tebaldi. She never married and had no children. Yet for a 1995 biography, she openly discussed several romances: a youthful attachment with a handsome medical student to whom she was briefly engaged; a lighthearted relationship with Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, the renowned bass of Italian and Russian heritage; and, most significantly, an intense romance with the conductor Arturo Basile, a hardy and generous man who was in the last phase of a deteriorating marriage when he and Miss Tebaldi began their four-year relationship in 1958.         In a 1995 interview with The Times, Miss Tebaldi said she had no regrets about her single life. ''I was in love many times,'' she said, flashing her dimpled smile. ''This is very good for a woman.'' But she added, ''How could I have been a wife, a mother and a singer? Who takes care of the piccolini when you go around the world? Your children would not call you Mama, but Renata.''         In 1973, Miss Tebaldi sang her final performance at the Met, again as Desdemona, with James McCracken in the title role, Sherrill Milnes as Iago and a young James Levine conducting. She had sung some 270 performances with the Met, a house where she considered herself ''la regina'' -- the queen.         From then on she sang only in recitals. In January 1976, she made it partway through a recital at Carnegie Hall, which she assumed would be her farewell to New York. She had to stop because she was ''too emotional,'' as Rudolf Bing told the audience on her behalf. A month later she tried again and sang the program, complete with six encores, to tumultuous ovations, though her singing was shaky.         Almost 20 years later, she returned again to New York to sign copies of an authorized biography by Carlamaria Casanova, ''Tebaldi: The Voice of an Angel'' (Baskerville Publishers). A line of autograph-seekers stretched from the Met's gift shop across Lincoln Center Plaza and up Broadway.         Miss Tebaldi had a long and productive relationship with the Decca recording company (also called London Records) and left classic accounts of major roles in complete recordings of ''Otello,'' ''La Forza del Destino,'' ''Andrea Chenier,'' ''La Bohème,'' ''Tosca,'' ''Madama Butterfly'' and ''Il Trovatore,'' among many other works. Asked during that 1995 interview how she felt about her discography, she said, ''I cry when I hear the records.'' She added: ''Now I understand what happened during my performances. I feel the same thing. Not because I know I am Renata Tebaldi, but because I can be objective.''       
         Susan Sontag, the novelist, essayist and critic whose impassioned advocacy of the avant-garde and equally impassioned political pronouncements made her one of the most lionized presences -- and one of the most polarizing -- in 20th-century letters, died yesterday morning in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 71.         The cause was complications of acute myelogenous leukemia, her son, David Rieff, said. Ms. Sontag, who died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, had been ill with cancer intermittently for the last 30 years, a struggle that informed one of her most famous books, the critical study ''Illness as Metaphor'' (1978).         A highly visible public figure since the mid-1960's, Ms. Sontag wrote four novels, dozens of essays and a volume of short stories and was also an occasional filmmaker, playwright and theater director. For four decades her work was part of the contemporary canon, discussed everywhere from graduate seminars to the pages of popular magazines to the Hollywood movie ''Bull Durham.''         Ms. Sontag's work made a radical break with traditional postwar criticism in America, gleefully blurring the boundaries between high and popular culture. She advocated an aesthetic approach to the study of culture, championing style over content. She was concerned, in short, with sensation, in both meanings of the term.         ''The theme that runs through Susan's writing is this lifelong struggle to arrive at the proper balance between the moral and the aesthetic,'' Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic and an old friend of Ms. Sontag's, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''There was something unusually vivid about her writing. That's why even if one disagrees with it -- as I did frequently -- it was unusually stimulating. She showed you things you hadn't seen before; she had a way of reopening questions.''         Through four decades, public response to Ms. Sontag remained irreconcilably divided. She was described, variously, as explosive, anticlimactic, original, derivative, naïve, sophisticated, approachable, aloof, condescending, populist, puritanical, sybaritic, sincere, posturing, ascetic, voluptuary, right-wing, left-wing, profound, superficial, ardent, bloodless, dogmatic, ambivalent, lucid, inscrutable, visceral, reasoned, chilly, effusive, relevant, passé, tenacious, ecstatic, melancholic, humorous, humorless, deadpan, rhapsodic, cantankerous and clever. No one ever called her dull.         Ms. Sontag's best-known books, all published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, include the novels ''Death Kit'' (1967), ''The Volcano Lover'' (1992) and ''In America'' (2000); the essay collections ''Against Interpretation'' (1966), ''Styles of Radical Will'' (1969) and ''Under the Sign of Saturn'' (1980); the critical studies ''On Photography'' (1977) and ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' (1989); and the short-story collection ''I, Etcetera'' (1978). One of her most famous works, however, was not a book, but an essay, ''Notes on Camp,'' published in 1964 and still widely read.         Her most recent book, published last year, was ''Regarding the Pain of Others,'' a long essay on the imagery of war and disaster. One of her last published essays, ''Regarding the Torture of Others,'' written in response to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by Americans at Abu Ghraib, appeared in the May 23, 2004, issue of The New York Times Magazine.         An Intellectual With Glamour         Unlike most serious intellectuals, Ms. Sontag was also a celebrity, partly because of her telegenic appearance, partly because of her outspoken statements. She was undoubtedly the only writer of her generation to win major literary prizes (among them a National Book Critics Circle Award, a National Book Award and a MacArthur Foundation genius grant) and to appear in films by Woody Allen and Andy Warhol; to be the subject of rapturous profiles in Rolling Stone and People magazines; and to be photographed by Annie Leibovitz for an Absolut Vodka ad. Through the decades her image -- strong features, wide mouth, intense gaze and dark mane crowned in her middle years by a sweeping streak of white -- became an instantly recognizable artifact of 20th-century popular culture.         Ms. Sontag was a master synthesist who tackled broad, difficult and elusive subjects: the nature of art, the nature of consciousness and, above all, the nature of the modern condition. Where many American critics before her had mined the past, Ms. Sontag became an evangelist of the new, training her eye on the culture unfolding around her.         For Ms. Sontag, culture encompassed a vast landscape. She wrote serious studies of popular art forms, like cinema and science fiction, that earlier critics disdained. She produced impassioned essays on the European writers and filmmakers she admired, like Jean-Paul Sartre, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin and Jean-Luc Godard. She wrote experimental novels on dreams and the nature of consciousness. She published painstaking critical dissections of photography and dance; illness, politics and pornography; and, most famously, camp. Her work, with its emphasis on the outré, the jagged and the here and now, helped make the study of popular culture a respectable academic pursuit.         What united Ms. Sontag's output was a propulsive desire to define the forces that shape the modernist sensibility. And in so doing, she sought to explain what it meant to be human in the waning years of the 20th century.         To many critics, her work was bold and thrilling. Interviewed in The Times Magazine in 1992, the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes compared Ms. Sontag to the Renaissance humanist Erasmus. ''Erasmus traveled with 32 volumes, which contained all the knowledge worth knowing,'' he said. ''Susan Sontag carries it in her brain! I know of no other intellectual who is so clear-minded, with a capacity to link, to connect, to relate.''         A Bevy of Detractors         Others were less enthralled. Some branded Ms. Sontag an unoriginal thinker, a popularizer with a gift for aphorism who could boil down difficult writers for mass consumption. (Irving Howe called her ''a publicist able to make brilliant quilts from grandmother's patches.'') Some regarded her tendency to revisit her earlier, often controversial positions as ambivalent. Some saw her scholarly approach to popular art forms as pretentious. (Ms. Sontag once remarked that she could appreciate Patti Smith because she had read Nietzsche.)         In person Ms. Sontag could be astringent, particularly if she felt she had been misunderstood. She grew irritated when reporters asked how many books she had in her apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan (15,000; no television set). But she could also be warm and girlish, speaking confidingly in her rich, low voice, her feet propped casually on the nearest coffee table. She laughed readily, and when she discussed something that engaged her passionately (and there were many things), her dark eyes often filled with tears.         Ms. Sontag had a knack -- or perhaps a penchant -- for getting into trouble. She could be provocative to the point of being inflammatory, as when she championed the Nazi-era filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl in a 1965 essay; she would revise her position some years later. She celebrated the communist societies of Cuba and North Vietnam; just as provocatively, she later denounced communism as a form of fascism. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, she wrote in The New Yorker, ''Whatever may be said of the perpetrators of Tuesday's slaughter, they were not cowards.'' And in 2000, the publication of Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' raised accusations of plagiarism, charges she vehemently denied.         Ms. Sontag was born Susan Rosenblatt in Manhattan on Jan. 16, 1933, the daughter of Jack and Mildred Rosenblatt. Her father was a fur trader in China, and her mother joined him there for long periods, leaving Susan and her younger sister in the care of relatives. When Susan was 5, her father died in China of tuberculosis. Seeking relief for Susan's asthma, her mother moved the family to Tucson, spending the next several years there. In Arizona, Susan's mother met Capt. Nathan Sontag, a World War II veteran sent there to recuperate. The couple were married -- Susan took her stepfather's name -- and the family moved to Los Angeles.         For Susan, who graduated from high school before her 16th birthday, the philistinism of American culture was a torment she vowed early to escape. ''My greatest dream,'' she later wrote, ''was to grow up and come to New York and write for Partisan Review and be read by 5,000 people.''         She would get her wish -- Ms. Sontag burst onto the scene with ''Notes on Camp,'' which was published in Partisan Review -- but not before she earned a bachelor's and two master's degrees from prestigious American universities; studied at Oxford on a fellowship; and married, became a mother and divorced eight years later, all by the time she turned 26.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Sontag spent a semester at the University of California, Berkeley, before transferring to the University of Chicago, from which she received a bachelor's degree in 1951. At Chicago she wandered into a class taught by the sociologist Philip Rieff, then a 28-year-old instructor, who would write the celebrated study ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist'' (Viking, 1959). He was, she would say, the first person with whom she could really talk; they were married 10 days later. Ms. Sontag was 17 and looked even younger, clad habitually in blue jeans, her black hair spilling down her back. Word swept around campus that Dr. Rieff had married a 14-year-old American Indian.         An Academic Beginning         Moving with her husband to Boston, Ms. Sontag earned her master's degrees from Harvard, the first in English, in 1954, the second in philosophy the next year. She began work on a Ph.D., but did not complete her dissertation. In 1952 she and Dr. Rieff became the parents of a son, David Rieff, who survives her. Mr. Rieff lives in Manhattan and was for many years his mother's editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux. (A journalist, he wrote ''Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West,'' published by Simon & Schuster in 1995.) Also surviving is her younger sister, Judith Cohen of Maui.         After further study at Oxford and in Paris, Ms. Sontag was divorced from Dr. Rieff in 1958. In early 1959 she arrived in New York with, as she later described it, ''$70, two suitcases and a 7- year- old.'' She worked as an editor at Commentary and juggled teaching jobs at City College, Sarah Lawrence and Columbia. She published her first essays, critical celebrations of modernists she admired, as well as her first novel, ''The Benefactor'' (1963), an exploration of consciousness and dreams.         With ''Notes on Camp'' Ms. Sontag fired a shot across the bow of the New York critical establishment, which included eminences like Lionel and Diana Trilling, Alfred Kazin and Irving Howe. Interlaced with epigrams from Oscar Wilde, that essay illuminated a particular modern sensibility -- one that had been largely the province of gay culture -- which centered deliciously on artifice, exaggeration and the veneration of style.         ''The experiences of Camp are based on the great discovery that the sensibility of high culture has no monopoly on refinement,'' Ms. Sontag wrote. ''The man who insists on high and serious pleasures is depriving himself of pleasure; he continually restricts what he can enjoy; in the constant exercise of his good taste he will eventually price himself out of the market, so to speak. Here Camp taste supervenes upon good taste as a daring and witty hedonism. It makes the man of good taste cheerful, where before he ran the risk of being chronically frustrated. It is good for the digestion.''         If that essay has today lost its capacity to shock, it is a reflection of how thoroughly Ms. Sontag did her job, serving as a guide to an underground aesthetic that was not then widely known.         ''She found in camp an aesthetic that was very different from what the straight world had acknowledged up to that point, and she managed to make camp 'straight' in a way,'' Arthur C. Danto, the Johnsonian professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia and the art critic for The Nation, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''I think she prepared the ground for the pop revolution, which was in many ways essentially a gay revolution, through Warhol and others. She didn't make that art, but she brought it to consciousness. She gave people a vocabulary for talking about it and thinking about it.''         The article made Ms. Sontag an international celebrity, showered with lavish, if unintentionally ridiculous, titles (''a literary pinup,'' ''the dark lady of American letters,'' ''the Natalie Wood of the U.S. avant-garde'').         Championing Style Over Content         In 1966 Ms. Sontag published her first essay collection, ''Against Interpretation.'' That book's title essay, in which she argued that art should be experienced viscerally rather than cerebrally, helped cement her reputation as a champion of style over content.         It was a position she could take to extremes. In the essay ''On Style,'' published in the same volume, Ms. Sontag offended many readers by upholding the films of Leni Riefenstahl as masterworks of aesthetic form, with little regard for their content. Ms. Sontag would eventually reconsider her position in the 1974 essay ''Fascinating Fascism.''         Though she thought of herself as a novelist, it was through her essays that Ms. Sontag became known. As a result she was fated to write little else for the next quarter-century. She found the form an agony: a long essay took from nine months to a year to complete, often requiring 20 or more drafts.         ''I've had thousands of pages for a 30-page essay,'' she said in a 1992 interview. '''On Photography,' which is six essays, took five years. And I mean working every single day.''         That book, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism in 1978, explored the role of the photographic image, and the act of picture-taking in contemporary culture. The crush of photographs, Ms. Sontag argued, has shaped our perceptions of the world, numbing us to depictions of suffering. She would soften that position when she revisited the issue in ''Regarding the Pain of Others.''         The Washington Post Book World called ''On Photography'' ''a brilliant analysis,'' adding that it '' merely describes a phenomenon we take as much for granted as water from the tap, and how that phenomenon has changed us -- a remarkable enough achievement, when you think about it.''         In the mid-1970's Ms. Sontag learned she had breast cancer. Doctors gave her a 10 percent chance of surviving for two years. She scoured the literature for a treatment that might save her, underwent a mastectomy and persuaded her doctors to give her a two-and-a-half-year course of radiation.         Out of her experience came ''Illness as Metaphor,'' which examined the cultural mythologizing of disease (tuberculosis as the illness of 19th-century romantics, cancer a modern-day scourge). Although it did not discuss her illness explicitly, it condemned the often militaristic language around illness (''battling'' disease, the ''war'' on cancer) that Ms. Sontag felt simultaneously marginalized the sick and held them responsible for their condition..         In ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' Ms. Sontag discussed the social implications of the disease, which she viewed as a ''cultural plague'' that had replaced cancer as the modern bearer of stigma. She would return to the subject of AIDS in her acclaimed short story ''The Way We Live Now,'' originally published in The New Yorker and included in ''The Best American Short Stories of the Century'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1999).         Although Ms. Sontag was strongly identified with the American left during the Vietnam era, in later years her politics were harder to classify. In the essay ''Trip to Hanoi,'' which appears in ''Styles of Radical Will,'' she wrote glowingly of a visit to North Vietnam. But in 1982 she delivered a stinging blow to progressives in a speech at Town Hall in Manhattan. There, at a rally in support of the Solidarity movement in Poland, she denounced European communism as ''fascism with a human face.''         In 1992, weary of essays, Ms. Sontag published ''The Volcano Lover,'' her first novel in 25 years. Though very much a novel of ideas -- it explored, among other things, notions of aesthetics and the psychology of obsessive collecting -- the book was also a big, old-fashioned historical romance. It told the story of Sir William Hamilton, the 18th-century British envoy to the court of Naples; his wife, Emma (''that Hamilton woman''); and her lover, Lord Nelson, the naval hero. The book spent two months on The New York Times best-seller list.         Reviewing the novel in The Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote: ''One thing that makes 'The Volcano Lover' such a delight to read is the way it throws off ideas and intellectual sparks, like a Roman candle or Catherine wheel blazing in the night. Miniature versions of 'Don Giovanni' and 'Tosca' lie embedded, like jewels, in the main narrative; and we are given as well some charmingly acute cameos of such historical figures as Goethe and the King and Queen of Naples.''         Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' was loosely based on the life of the 19th-century Polish actress Helena Modjeska, who immigrated to California to start a utopian community. Though ''In America'' received a National Book Award, critical reception was mixed. Then accusations of plagiarism surfaced. As The Times reported in May 2000, a reader identified at least a dozen passages as being similar to those in four other books about the real Modjeska, including Modjeska's memoirs. Except for a brief preface expressing a general debt to ''books and articles by and on Modjeska,'' Ms. Sontag did not specifically acknowledge her sources.         Interviewed for The Times article, Ms. Sontag defended her method. ''All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain,'' she said. ''I've used these sources and I've completely transformed them. I have these books. I've looked at these books. There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.''         Ms. Sontag's other work includes the play ''Alice in Bed'' (1993); ''A Susan Sontag Reader'' (1982), with an introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick; and four films, including ''Duet for Cannibals'' (1969) and ''Brother Carl'' (1971). She also edited works by Barthes, Antonin Artaud, Danilo Kis and other writers.         Ms. Sontag was the subject of an unauthorized biography by Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock, ''Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon'' (Norton, 2000), and of several critical studies, including ''Sontag & Kael: Opposites Attract Me,'' by Craig Seligman (Counterpoint/Perseus, 2004). She was the president of the PEN American Center from 1987 to 1989.         In a 1992 interview with The Times Magazine, Ms. Sontag described the creative force that animated ''The Volcano Lover,'' putting her finger on the sensibility that would inform all her work: ''I don't want to express alienation. It isn't what I feel. I'm interested in various kinds of passionate engagement. All my work says, be serious, be passionate, wake up.''         A Life of the Mind         For four decades, Susan Sontag's books were published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. These are some of the more notable.

         Mona Van Duyn, a poet laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner who spoke with a distinctly female voice from suburbia, died on Thursday at her home in suburban St. Louis. She was 83.         Her death was announced by Alfred A. Knopf, which published her ''Selected Poems'' two years ago. Her first book in nine years, it includes nearly half of the poems published in her previous eight volumes, starting with ''Valentines to the Wide World'' in 1959.         Knopf said Ms. Van Duyn (pronounced dine) had recently been found to have bone cancer.         To readers unfamiliar with her work, ''Selected Poems'' presented a generous and judicious sampling of a long and successful career, Brian Henry wrote in The New York Times Book Review.         ''Characterized by candor and compassion,'' he said, ''Van Duyn's poetry depicts the pleasures and drudgeries of middle-class American life, an approach that at its best becomes an exploration of the spiritual and psychological dimensions of that life.         ''A pioneer of the poetry of the suburbs -- now a common mode in which the ordinary is routinely revealed as extraordinary -- Van Duyn also knows that the ordinary is frequently just that.''         Mr. Henry, editor of the magazine Verse and director of the creative writing program at the University of Georgia, mentioned the rare incendiary moments in her work but added that, ''Her poetry is primarily, and literally, civil, seeking to uphold the accepted foundations of civilization -- marriage and friendship, love and sympathy -- while occasionally plumbing those foundations for cracks.''         Mr. Henry wrote that he considered Ms. Van Duyn's first three books to be her best, especially ''To See, To Take,'' her second, which won the National Book Award for Poetry in 1971. In it she interwove religious and mythological themes, like divine and human love and the violence of love, with less exalted topics.         In one poem, for example, she compared her work to home canning, writing:         Oh, I know, I know that, great or humble, the arts         in their helplessness can save but a few selves         by such disguises from Time's hideous bite,         and yet, a sweating Proust of the pantry shelves,         I cupboard these pickled peaches in Time's despite.         Ms. Van Duyn was selected by the Library of Congress in 1992 to serve a term as the United States poet laureate. She was the sixth laureate and the first woman to be chosen.         When notified by James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress at the time, Ms. Van Duyn said it was clear to her that the selectors who made the choice were ''getting very nervous'' about the absence of a woman as laureate.         Before the position was formally established by Congress in 1985, it had a forerunner in the library's poetry consultant. There were about two dozen of them, but only a handful were women.         A year before becoming poet laureate, Ms. Van Duyn won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. The award cited her for ''Near Changes'' (Knopf, 1990). She also received, among many others, the Bollingen Prize in 1970; the Carl Sandburg Prize of Cornell College in 1982; the Hart Crane Memorial Award in 1968; the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 1989; the Shelley Memorial Prize of the Poetry Society of America in 1987; and a Guggenheim fellowship in 1972. She was also a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and the National Academy of Arts and Sciences.         Mona Jane Van Duyn was born on May 9, 1921, in Waterloo, Iowa, and graduated from the University of Northern Iowa in 1942, when it was the Iowa State Teachers College. She received a master's degree from the University of Iowa the next near and taught English there until 1946. In 1943 she married Jarvis A. Thurston, whom she met in a writing class and who became a professor of English; he survives her.         She also had an academic career, teaching at the University of Louisville, in Kentucky, and at Washington University in St. Louis, as well as at writing seminars and conferences.         Between ''Valentines'' and ''Selected Poems,'' she also published, among others, ''A Time of Bees'' (1964); ''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems'' (1982); ''If It Be Not I: Collected Poems 1959-1982'' (1992), which included much of her earlier work; and ''Firefall'' (1992), which remains in print at Knopf.         ''I don't know why that is,'' she said 14 years ago as the newly chosen laureate, musing about why women were not anthologized or consulted as frequently as men. ''Perhaps it is because younger women are able to teach, or take the time to raise children. Even for older women, one's life is complicated. It is difficult to be called by a reporter or the Library of Congress when one is cooking a complicated recipe.''         Or, as she once put it in another context:         The world is perverse,         but it could be worse.         (''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems.'')         Correction:  December 23, 2004, Thursday  An obituary of the poet Mona Van Duyn on Dec. 4 misstated the first line of a couplet from her poem ''Sonnet for Minimalists'' and misidentified the first book in which it appeared. The couplet reads, ''The world's perverse/but it could be worse' -- not ''The world is perverse.'' The sonnet was first published in book form in ''Near Changes'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1990), not in ''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems'' (Atheneum, 1982).       
         Frances Chaney, a radio star whose budding film career was stifled after she and her husband, Ring Lardner Jr., were placed on a Hollywood blacklist, died on Nov. 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Ms. Chaney, who had Alzheimer's disease, died in her sleep, said her son James.         Mr. Lardner was one of the Hollywood 10, jailed in 1950 for contempt of Congress for refusing to answer whether they were Communists. Ms. Chaney was blacklisted because she was correctly assumed to be, as Mr. Lardner's wife, a Communist.         Ms. Chaney found herself unemployed after years appearing on popular radio series like ''Topper,'' ''Gangbusters'' and ''Mr. District Attorney.'' At one point, she spent her mornings playing an ingénue in ''House in the Country'' and her afternoons playing the worldly Burma in ''Terry and the Pirates.''         She had parlayed her radio work into a few screen parts before the blacklist started costing her jobs, but she was able to win parts in Off Broadway and Broadway plays, including understudying for Maureen Stapleton, Kim Stanley and Claudette Colbert.         By the time the blacklist's power faded, Ms. Chaney was entrenched as a stage actress. She worried that she was being typecast as a Jewish mother, a part she played in ''Golda'' on Broadway with Anne Bancroft, in James Lapine's Off Broadway ''Table Settings,'' and in three separate productions of Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing.''         Born Fanya Lipetz on July 23, 1915, in Odessa, Ukraine, Ms. Chaney immigrated with her parents to the Bronx when she was a child. After briefly attending Hunter College, she studied on a scholarship at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.         In the 1960's, she had a recurring role on the soap opera ''The Edge of Night.''         Ms. Chaney's first husband, David Lardner, was a younger brother of Ring Lardner Jr.'s. David Lardner died in 1944. Ring Lardner Jr. died in 2000.         In addition to her son James, of Manhattan, Ms. Chaney is survived by a daughter, Katharine, of Manhattan; another son, Joseph, of Los Angeles; two stepchildren, Peter, of St. Augustine, Fla., and Ann Waswo, of Oxford, England; seven grandchildren; and eight great-granddaughters.
