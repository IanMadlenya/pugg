        Zinka Milanov, the leading dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly 30 years until her retirement in 1966, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had suffered a stroke on Saturday.         Zinka Milanov, the leading dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly 30 years until her retirement in 1966, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had suffered a stroke on Saturday.         It was generally acknowledged that Miss Milanov was the greatest dramatic soprano after Rosa Ponselle, who retired early in 1937. On Dec. 17, 1937, the young Yugoslav soprano made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Leonora in Verdi's ''Trovatore.'' It was not one of the more fabulous debuts in the Met's history, and critics hedged about the new singer.         But when Miss Milanov settled down after a few performances and demonstrated what she could do, it became clear that the great Ponselle had a worthy successor. In her first season at the Metropolitan Opera, Olin Downes, then the chief music critic of The New York Times, constantly referred to her ''magnificent'' voice and her ''grand manner.'' Virgil Thomson in The New York Herald Tribune wrote that she had a voice ''with a beauty unmatched among the sopranos of this country.''         Everything about Miss Milanov commanded respect, and that included her physical and vocal size.         When Edward Johnson, then general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, heard her in 1937 at the Salzburg Festival, where she was singing under the baton of Arturo Toscanini, he immediately recognized her potential and offered her a contract that had two stipulations: She had to learn her roles in Italian (up to then she had been singing Italian operas in her native Croatian or in German), and she had to take off 25 pounds. English, After a Fashion         She not only learned to sing in impeccable Italian, but she also learned English, after a fashion. For many years she would order a ''martinelli'' instead of a martini, an allusion to the musical associations with the tenor Giovanni Martinelli.         She was always struggling with her weight and often tried to diet. But she liked to eat, and was herself a good cook, specializing in Yugoslav dishes. Once she took off considerable weight and a critic wrote that the dieting had also brought with it ''a disturbing lessening of her powers.''         Miss Milanov shrugged off the comment. ''You try to do your best to please the public, please critics, please everybody,'' she said. ''Then you lose weight and they don't like you. What you do? You get bugs in the head.'' A Formidable Ego         Miss Milanov was a legend around the Metropolitan Opera in more ways than one. Her ego was commensurate with her stature as a vocalist.         ''I love applause,'' she once said to an interviewer. ''Money is not everything. Money is last.'' Rash was the singer who would try to upstage Miss Milanov at curtain calls.         Stories about her circulated in the house almost from the moment she first set foot on stage. Once, during a stage rehearsal, she looked into the auditorium and saw the team of backup singers for ''Il Trovatore.'' She advanced to the footlights. ''Listen, listen, listen - learn, learn, learn,'' she told the young singers. In a Mischievous Mood         It is said that she could drive her colleagues crazy during performances when she was in a mischievous mood. George London, as Amonasro in ''Aida,'' would be preparing for his big baritone solo. Miss Milanov at that moment would whisper in his ear, ''How's the baby, George?'' Or, in the ''Aida'' Nile scene with a tenor she did not particularly like: ''You're not in good voice tonight, are you? Do you think you can make that high B?''         She could be inconsistent in her singing. It was noticed time and again that Miss Milanov could sing like an angel in one act and have pitch troubles in another.         But there was never a time in any opera when she did not thrill her audiences, and she did so entirely through her voice, because she never was much of an actress. Definitely of the old operatic school of acting, she used the exaggerated gestures and facial expressions that went out in the early days of silent films. But she was a fine musician and never used her voice in an exaggerated manner.         Her singing was refined, subtle, powerful, sensitive or dramatic, as the music demanded. She produced a big, warm sound and had an equalized scale up to a secure high C. In the ''Aida'' Nile scene she was able to take a haunting pianissimo on the C that will forever float in memory. She was equally impressive in ''Il Trovatore,'' an opera that she ''owned.'' Fortunately, she recorded that opera with Jussi Bjoerling and Leonard Warren, and connoisseurs believe it is the greatest performance of that work ever put on disks. Born to a Musical Family         She was born in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, on May 17, 1906, the daughter of a bandmaster named Rudolf Kunc. The family was musical, and her brother, Bozidar, became a pianist and composer who often was her accompanist for her recitals. She also had an uncle who composed songs for her early recitals. She started singing as a child and made her recital debut in Zagreb when she was 15 years old.         Milka Ternina, a great Wagnerian soprano at the turn of the century, heard the young soprano and took her as a pupil for three years. After graduating from the Royal Music Academy in Zagreb, where she won first prize in singing, Miss Kunc became a member of the State Opera, making her debut as Leonora in ''Il Trovatore.''         Soon she was singing in opera houses in Germany and Central Europe, and appearing with orchestras under conductors like Bruno Walter. Toscanini invited her to Salzburg in 1937 to sing the soprano solo in the Verdi Requiem. She was to sing it with him many times in the future.         She married a Yugoslav actor and director, Predrag Milanov, in 1937. He served as her dramatic coach for many years. Gave 445 Met Performances         At the Metropolitan Opera she specialized in Verdi roles, above all ''Aida,'' which she sang at the house and on tour with the Met 75 times. She also appeared in ''Il Trovatore'' 49 times, ''La Forza del Destino'' 37 times, ''Un Ballo in Maschera'' 30 times, ''Otello'' 17 times, ''Simon Boccanegra'' 10 times and ''Ernani'' 8 times. Her other roles were Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' which she sang 57 times, Ponchielli's Gioconda, Puccini's Tosca, Bellini's Norma (a role ventured by only three sopranos at the Met in the 60 years before Miss Milanov sang it), Mozart's Donna Anna and Maddalena in Giordano's ''Andrea Chenier,'' the role she sang at her farewell. All told, she gave 445 performances with the company.         Miss Milanov became an American citizen in 1946. ''When you come to America,'' she said, ''you get independent like American women.'' At that time, she was getting a divorce from Mr. Milanov. In 1947, she married Gen. Ljubo Ilic of Yugoslavia. Though trained as an architect, he had served as a general with the Resistance in southern France.         At the time of his marriage, General Ilic, a close friend of Marshal Tito, was a diplomat. Miss Milanov left the Met from 1947 to 1951, returning to Yugoslavia with her husband. Accused of Being a Spy         In 1949 she was accused by the Soviet Union of being a United States spy. She said the charge was ''silly.'' Her manager, Jack Adams, laughed at the allegation. He said that Miss Milanov could never have been a spy because she could never keep a secret, and that she was interested only in music, clothes, good food and wine.         She was honored on her 25th anniversary at the Metropolitan Opera with an on-stage ceremony, with Rudolf Bing, the Met's general manager, as master of ceremonies. She decided to retire at the end of the 1965-66 season, just before the opening of the new opera house in Lincoln Center. ''It is better,'' she said, ''to go away on two legs rather than on one.''         In her last operatic performance, on April 14, 1966, she sang the role of Maddalena in ''Andrea Chenier.'' In a ceremony on stage after the third act, Mr. Bing presented her with a Steuben glass cup and Lowell Wadmond, the chairman of the Met's board, gave her a silver tray. Two days later, Miss Milanov made her final appearance in the house. During the festivities on April 16, the final day at the old Met, she sang a ''Chenier'' duet with Richard Tucker.         In her years of retirement, Miss Milanov kept up a lively interest in the affairs of the Metropolitan and devoted much of her time to coaching younger singers (among them Christa Ludwig, Regine Crespin and Anna Moffo). She divided each year between Manhattan and Yugoslavia. Her recent birthday was celebrated with a party for 20 close friends and relatives in her home, for which the soprano, as was her custom, did all the cooking.         She is survived by her husband.       
        Diana Vreeland, the legendary fashion editor and creator of spectacular fashion exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, died of a heart attack yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was believed to be in her late 80's and had been in failing health for several years.         Diana Vreeland, the legendary fashion editor and creator of spectacular fashion exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, died of a heart attack yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was believed to be in her late 80's and had been in failing health for several years.         In the more than 40 years that she was associated with the fashion world, she was called an oracle, the high priestess of fashion, a myth maker. She was the fashion editor of Harper's Bazaar from 1937 to 1962, when she moved to Vogue. There, she was editor in chief until 1971.         Instead of resting on her laurels, she went on, as consultant to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to a new career of staging annual fashion exhibitions that drew almost one million visitors a year and made the museum a center of fashion excitement for New York City and the world.         ''She was and remains the only genius fashion editor,'' Richard Avedon, the photographer, said yesterday. Their professional relationship at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue was the inspiration for the movie ''Funny Face'' starring Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn.         Despite a predilection for aristocratic luxury that recalled the gracious days before World War I, she had an innate understanding of the extraordinary pace of change in 20th-century life. She had an eye for what was new and imaginative, and many fashion designers say she gave them a crucial boost at an early stage in their career.         Her sense of theater was evidenced in the way she moved - Cecil Beaton described her as ''an elegant crane picking her way out of a swamp'' -and the way she looked. Her cheeks and ear lobes were rouged, her lips and nails colored a clear red and her hair lacquered black until the end of her life.         She was fashionably thin, and her favorite costume when she was working or partygoing was narrow black pants with either a black turtleneck sweater or elaborate tunic, depending on the occasion. For years she wore her hair in a snood - it became a kind of trademark - and wore ankle-strap low-heel sandals.         She was born around the turn of the century in Paris - she was never very specific about her birth date - to the former Emily Key Hoffman, an American, and her husband, Frederick Y. Dalziel, who was Scottish. She had a younger sister, Alexandra.         ''We went to Venice or Deauville in the summer or wherever everybody else went,'' she said of her childhood in Europe. ''Our parents spent their days having a good time. They never contributed a bloody thing and they and all our friends lived the life of Riley.'' Ballet and Riding         In 1914, spurred by the onset of the war, the family moved to New York, where the Dalziel sisters went to ballet classes three times a week, learned to ride from Buffalo Bill Cody and occasionally attended schools such as Brearley for a few months. Diana Dalziel made her debut in 1922, and two years later, while vacationing in Saratoga, met and married T. Reed Vreeland, a banker who graduated from Yale the year she came out.         They lived in Albany for four years and had two sons, Thomas R. Vreeland Jr., who became an architect, and Frederick, who entered the diplomatic service. Then they moved to Europe, where for a brief time Diana Vreeland ran a lingerie shop in London. When they returned to the United States in 1936, she began writing a column for Harper's Bazaar called ''Why Don't You . . . .''         For a country in the midst of a Depression, it offered such heady suggestions as ''Why don't you put all your dogs in bright yellow collars and leads like all the dogs in Paris?'' or ''have a furry elk-hide trunk for the back of your car?'' It was widely satirized and widely read and the next year she was made fashion editor of the magazine. Made a Few Mistakes         During most of the 1960's, when fashion was in turmoil, she presided over Vogue magazine, where the fashion world took everything she said seriously and where she made a few apparent mistakes, such as having experimental photographs taken with a wide-angle lens that distorted the models, giving them big heads and tiny feet. Nevertheless, fashion photographers were widely influenced by those pictures and began trying to see what their lenses could do.         She breakfasted on tea and oatmeal, worked in bed in the mornings and showed up in her office around noon.         Her legend grew as her aphorisms were circulated within the fashion world. ''Pink,'' she said, ''is the navy blue of India.'' ''The bikini is the most important thing since the atom bomb.'' She pronounced Celanese, the American fabric company, as if it were Italian: chelahnayzay, and broke down corduroy to its original components: cord du roi.         She avoided the typewriter. ''Has anyone ever written a great love letter on a typewriter?'' she asked. ''A great suicide note?'' And she made pronouncements. Of Chanel, she said, ''her first customers were princesses and duchesses and she dressed them like secretaries and stenographers.''         During this period, she asked Giorgio di Sant'Angelo, who was working in plastics and sculpture, to make accessories and then clothes.         ''She sent me to Arizona,'' he said, ''with Veruschka, the model, four suitcases full of fabrics, wires and tape and told me to wrap and tie everything as I wanted and then she gave me eight pages in the magazine.'' Two Job Opportunities         When Oscar de la Renta came to New York from Paris with a letter of introduction, she invited him to tea. He had two job opportunities, he told her, one doing custom clothes for Elizabeth Arden, the other designing ready-to-wear for Christian Dior-New York.         ''What do you want to do with yourself?'' she asked.         ''I want to get into ready-to-wear because that's where the money is,'' he told her.         ''Then go to Arden because you will make your reputation faster,'' she advised. ''She is not a designer, so she will promote you. At the other place, you will always be eclipsed by the name of Dior.''         ''That is exactly what happened,'' he said. ''And when I did go into ready-to-wear, she helped me. When I made all those gypsy clothes and the caftans in 1967, 1968, it was all Diana's suggestions.''         She had a sense of fantasy that enveloped both her own image and her friends.         ''Her thought process was very original,'' said Bill Blass, who became a friend of Mrs. Vreeland and her husband, who died in 1966. ''She always insisted I was British, no matter how many times I told her I was a hoosier from Indiana,'' Mr. Blass said. Last Career With Museum         Her last career, with the Metropolitan Museum, began in 1973 with a retrospective showing of Balenciaga's clothes, from his first collection in 1938 to the wedding dress he made in 1972 for the Duchess of Cadiz, General Francisco Franco's granddaughter, a month before he died.         The same year, she pulled together an exhibition called Innovative Designers in Paris, and each year there followed another eye-catcher that drew not only fashion enthusiasts but also people captivated by the color and drama of romantic Hollywood clothes, stylish American women (including Irene Castle, Isadora Duncan, Josephine Baker and Elsie de Wolfe), Russian peasants, the costumes of the Ballets Russes, fashions of the Hapsburg era, Yves Saint Laurent's designs, equestrian costumes, Chinese mandarin robes and dance clothes throughout history.         The parties that heralded the openings each fall became major New York events where figures prominent in art, social and fashion circles mingled for dinner and dancing in the museum; the evening was capped by a stroll through the exotically lighted display halls with appropriate music and the flash of photographers' lights. Mrs. Vreeland was in the center of the action at all the parties except the one for ''Dance'' in 1986, when her health was too fragile. 'Elegance Is Innate'         During the museum period, Mrs. Vreeland became the undisputed voice of the fashion world, and her presence at other parties and fashion openings was eagerly sought. She received awards from such diverse groups as the Italian fashion industry and the Rhode Island School of Design and she became a chevalier of the French National Order of Merit.         In a book of her favorite photographs and sketches edited by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and published by Doubleday in 1980, she continued her penchant for aphorisms. ''Elegance is innate,'' she wrote. ''It has nothing to do with being well dressed.'' She also said, ''I loathe narcissism, but I approve of vanity.''         In her memoirs, ''D. V.,'' published in 1984 by Alfred A. Knopf, she did not restrict her pronouncements to fashion. ''Chutney is marvelous,'' she wrote. ''I'm mad about it. To me, it's very imperial.'' And ''lettuce is divine, although I'm not sure it's really food.'' A Practical Slant         Sometimes her observations had a remarkably practical slant. ''Whatever the fashion,'' she wrote in The New York Times in 1977, ''the important thing is time for upkeep. We take it for granted that a girl gets the best she can for herself. But, if she doesn't keep it up, if it isn't in beautiful condition, if the shoes aren't cleaned before she wears them every day and her bag isn't cleaned and everything in it cleaned, she'll never look like anything.''         She was an early enthusiast on the subject of keeping fit, and the magazines she edited were filled with articles on exercise, skin and hair care and grooming long before these topics became major obsessions.         ''The body must stay fit,'' she once explained. ''Fit people like themselves much better.''         The woman who was sometimes described as having the profile of a cigar-store Indian told an interviewer once that ''you don't have to be born beautiful to be wildly attractive,'' and her friends insist that she carried this maxim out in her own life.         ''Dinner alone with D. V. was one of the best ways I could think of to spend an evening,'' said Bill Blass.         She lived in a basically red apartment on Park Avenue decorated by Billy Baldwin with lots of pictures, patterns, bibelots and calculated clutter. When she was editor in chief at Vogue, she also had her office painted bright red. Link to Aristocratic Years         As fashion became more egalitarian during the later years of the 20th century, Diana Vreeland provided a link to the aristocratic years when it was the province exclusively of the very rich. At a time when most people were concerned with the practical qualities of synthetic fibers, she could speak of ''the feel of a perfect piece of silk'' as the ''greatest projection of pleasure.''         She had the theatrical knack of a Diaghilev, whom she greatly admired and whom she made the subject of one of her Metropolitan Museum exhibits along with the costumes for his Ballets Russes. For the increasingly computerized fashion industry, she was a symbol of the grandeur of the past when drama and imagination were all. She had a glimpse of that past in her early years in Europe. In recreating it in her later life, she smoothed out the bumps and made it seem more exhilarating than perhaps it ever was.         She is survived by her two sons, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         The funeral will be private. A memorial service is planned for the fall, with the date to be announced later.       
        Lydia Winston Malbin, an art collector and patron who assembled a major collection of modern European art, died on Saturday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She was 91 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Lydia Winston Malbin, an art collector and patron who assembled a major collection of modern European art, died on Saturday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She was 91 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Malbin's collection, known for its concentration on the work of the Italian Futurists, has been widely exhibited and much sought after by major museums. Last year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of which she was an honorary trustee, dedicated to her the catalogue of its show of work by the Futurist Umberto Boccioni, in honor of the significant loans she had made to the exhibition.         Her collection, intensively documented through her own research and personal recollections, served as a research tool for graduate students in art history. Seminars organized by various universities were held over the years at her home in Birmingham, Mich., and later in New York. Collecting Since the 1930's         Mrs. Malbin, who was born in Detroit on Nov. 13, 1897, was the daughter of Albert Kahn, an industrial architect who designed the Ford Motor Company's River Rouge plant in Detroit, among other important factory complexes in the United States and abroad. She began her collection in the late 1930's, traveling to New York City to seek the advice of Alfred Stieglitz, the photographer and early dealer in modernist art.         In 1940, with Hilla Rebay, director of the Museum of Nonobjective Art in New York City - later to become the Guggenheim Museum - she organized for the Detroit City Club the first show of abstract art in Detroit.         Later, after earning a master's degree in ceramics and painting from Cranbrook Academy in 1944, Mrs. Malbin began making trips to Europe to acquire art. With the encouragement of Alfred H. Barr Jr., founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, she made the acquaintance of such artists as Constantin Brancusi and Gino Severini, and bought work from them directly.         Interested in American art as well, she purchased the first painting by Jackson Pollock to enter a private collection, in 1946 from Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century gallery. Until she became ill recently, Mrs. Malbin was still collecting contemporary art, and she had developed an interest in acquiring the work of photographers. Involved in Acquisitions         She graduated from Vassar College in 1921. In 1927, she married Harry Lewis Winston, a lawyer in Detroit, who supported her interest in collecting. She was active in the Founders Society of the Detroit Institute of Arts, and served for eight years on the acquisitions committee of the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1961, she received an honorary doctorate in the humanities from Wayne State University in Detroit.         In 1964, she was appointed a member of the Arts Commission for the City of Detroit, a post she held until recently. At the time of her death, she was a member of the drawings acquisitions committee of the Whitney Museum in New York City.         In 1966, after the death of her first husband, she married Dr. Barnett Malbin of Detroit, who died in 1985. She is survived by two daughters, Sally Robinson of Bennington, Vt., and Ernestine Ruben of Princeton, N.J.; a son, Harry Lewis Winston Jr., of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; 10 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
