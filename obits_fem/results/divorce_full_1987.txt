Mrs. Reyher was 89 years old.         Rebecca Hourwich Reyher, a veteran suffragist, author and lecturer, died of pnuemonia last Saturday at the home of her daughter, Faith Jackson, in St. Inigoes, Md. Mrs. Reyher was 89 years old.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Reyher lived in Manhattan on and off for most of her life. As a young suffragist, she held street meetings on women's causes and was head of the Boston and New York offices of the National Woman's Party.         Beginning in 1924, Mrs. Reyher made six trips to Africa, which resulted in numerous articles and two books on life in Africa, ''Zulu Woman'' (1948) and ''The Fon and His Hundred Wives'' (1952). She later lectured on women and Africa at schools and colleges, including New York University and the New School for Social Research. Her collection of African artifacts was presented to Westbrook College in Portland, Me., as the Sinon collection.         Her marriage in 1917 to the late Ferdinand Reyher, a writer, ended in divorce in 1934.         In addition to her daughter, three grandsons and two great-grandchildren survive.       
        Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         She had been on the air with few interruptions from 1931 to 1975, and the programs led to books and records for children. Her 30 awards included a Peabody and an Emmy. On her radio show, heard in the early evening for decades, she told stories in which she acted each part - ranging from princesses and wicked stepmothers to dragons - with a piano accompaniment. For this she was known as the ''Lady With a Thousand Voices.''         In the late 1930's and early 40's, national polls of radio editors consistently placed her programs first in juvenile entertainment. More than 25 million children listened to her regularly.         She was born Irene Seaton in Quincy, Ill., in 1900 and educated at public schools there. She graduated from the University of Illinois, where she studied music and drama. She then studied at the Goodman School of the Theater in Chicago and appeared in professional roles at the Goodman Theater in 1929 and 1930. Letter Added for Luck         Early in her radio career, she changed the spelling of her first name to Ireene with three ''e's'' when she was told by a numerologist that one more letter would bring her great success.         With her first husband, Walter Charles Wicker, a radio writer, producer and actor, she performed in two early soap operas, ''Today's Children'' and ''Harold Teen.''         The Wickers had a son, Walter Charles Jr., who died in action as a fighter pilot in World War II, and a daughter, Nancy.         Her debut as a children's radio entertainer came as a direct result of the way she amused her own offspring, telling tales and singing songs. ''The Singing Lady'' began as a local radio program in Chicago. Her Routine Was Her Own         According to an account by Val Adams in The New York Times, the sponsoring Kellogg's cornflakes company handed her a list of nursery rhymes and told her to do a children's program. ''She developed the routine of dramatizing fairy tales and playing all the parts herself,'' Mr. Adams wrote in 1948.         When television came along, she adapted her ''Singing Lady'' format to the new medium, using marionettes to act out her stories while she supplied the voices.         During the 1950's, Red Channels, a private blacklisting publication, charged that the actress had sponsored a re-election committee for a Communist councilman in New York. She denied she had even heard of the man and the charges were later withdrawn with apologies.         After her program was discontinued on commercial radio, it was later resumed on the Public Broadcasting System, and she was also heard on network radio affiliates.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1938. In 1941 she married Victor J. Hammer, co-owner with his brother Armand of the Hammer Galleries in New York. He died in 1985.         Mrs. Hammer is survived by her daughter, Nancy Eilan of Stamford, Conn.       
        Nora Kaye, a leading American ballerina whose exceptional power as a dramatic dancer made her an international star, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles after a long illness. She was 67.         Nora Kaye, a leading American ballerina whose exceptional power as a dramatic dancer made her an international star, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles after a long illness. She was 67.         Miss Kaye was one of the foremost ballerinas of her time. Although she danced many classical roles, she became known for creating a new contemporary look among dancers, especially in Antony Tudor's dance-dramas in the 1940's and 1950's.         In an era when ballet was considered a Russian art, Miss Kaye remained steadfastly an American dancer. Her last name was originally Koreff, but she changed it to Kaye because ''an American dancer ought to have an American name,'' as she put it.         Called the ''Duse of the dance,'' Miss Kaye excelled in dramatic roles. The world premiere by Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, of Mr. Tudor's psychological ballet ''Pillar of Fire'' catapulted her to stardom in 1942. Symbol of Tenacity and Vigor         Mikhail Baryshnikov, Ballet Theater's current artistic director, said of the ballerina: ''She was undoubtedly a great woman of the theater and a symbol to any dancer of tenacity, vigor and what it means to be a great star. Everyone in the dance world mourns her and is sad today.''         Miss Kaye was a charter member of Ballet Theater from the company's first year, 1939. There she worked with Mr. Tudor, one of the company's choreographers and teachers, who revealed ballet to her as an expressive art.         During Ballet Theater's first New York season early in 1940, she danced in the chorus of several Tudor ballets. The choreographer offered Miss Kaye her first important dramatic or character role, that of the Russian ballerina in his comic ballet ''Gala Performance,'' for its premiere in February 1941.         But it was her portrayal of the sexually repressed Hagar in ''Pillar of Fire,'' that raised Miss Kaye to the status of prima ballerina and helped make her one of the best-known American ballerinas in the world.         Reviewing the ballet at its premiere in April 1942, John Martin, then dance critic of The New York Times, rated Miss Kaye's characterization as among ''the great examples of tragic acting of its generation.'' 'I Wanted to Extend Myself'         By 1943, Miss Kaye was dancing most of the lead female roles in the Ballet Theater repertory. She performed with the company through 1951, when she left to dance with the New York City Ballet.         She was not well suited to the City Ballet style, however. though she had notable triumphs, among them her portrayal of the man-killing Novice in ''The Cage,'' which Jerome Robbins created for her. ''I wanted to extend myself,'' she said in 1977 of her years with City Ballet, ''but I was wrong for it.'' She returned to Ballet Theater in 1954 and danced with the company until 1959. She retired from the stage in 1961.         Miss Kaye was known as a Tudor ballerina, but she danced ballets by many other contemporary choreographers, including Jerome Robbins, George Balanchine, Valerie Bettis, Kenneth MacMillan, John Taras and Herbert Ross, whom she married in 1959.         Born in New York City, and named after the heroine of ''A Doll's House,'' Miss Kaye was exposed at an early age to Stanislavskian acting by her father, Gregory Koreff, a former actor with the Moscow Art Theater. She began studying dance at the age of 5, working with the celebrated choreographer Michel Fokine.         At 8, Miss Kaye entered Margaret Curtis's ballet class at the Metropolitan Opera school. At 15, she graduated into the Metropolitan Opera's corps de ballet and danced with the American Ballet, a company founded by Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, when it became the Metropolitan's resident ballet troupe in 1935. She also studied at the School of American Ballet and with such noted teachers as Anatole Vilzak, Ludmila Shollar and Margaret Craske.         She then abandoned ballet for several years, feeling, as she later said, that it was ''something dragged up from 300 years ago that didn't make any sense and wasn't going anyplace.'' She performed in musical comedies, among them ''Virginia,'' in 1937, ''Great Lady'' (1938), ''Stars in Your Eyes'' (1939) and, in 1952, ''Two's Company.'' She also danced in the Radio City Music Hall corps de ballet for nine months in the late 1930's. Assisted on Film Projects         Miss Kaye was associate artistic director of Ballet Theater from 1977 to 1983. In later years, she also assisted Mr. Ross, by then a well-known film and stage producer and director, in his projects. Miss Kaye served as executive producer of ''The Turning Point,'' a 1977 film whose story was said to have been drawn from her own life, though she denied the rumor. Last summer, she assisted Mr. Ross in his filming of ''Giselle.''         Other credits included work as executive producer or co-producer on the films ''The Last of Sheila,'' ''The Seven Percent Solution,'' ''Nijinsky,'' ''Pennies From Heaven'' and ''The Secret of My Success.''         ''As an American ballerina,'' Miss Kaye wrote in 1950 in Theater Arts magazine, ''I never take anything for granted. I question each tradition, each interpretation, each movement. The answers I have found, sometimes right and sometimes wrong, constitute my contribution to the young American dancer of ballet: not to accept until you understand (at least to your own satisfaction), and not to dance any role, ancient or new, until you do understand. This urge to question and to discover is, I think, the trademark of American ballet.''         Miss Kaye is survived by Mr. Ross. Earlier marriages to Michael Van Buren and Isaac Stern, the violinist, ended in divorce. The funeral is on Monday at 4 P.M. at the Westwood Village Mortuary in Los Angeles.         NORA KAY IS DEAD       
        Maxine Sullivan, whose cool, precise and rhythmic singing of the Scottish folk song ''Loch Lomond'' in the late 1930's gave her an identity that remained with her throughout her career, died of heart failure Tuesday at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 years old and lived in the         Maxine Sullivan, whose cool, precise and rhythmic singing of the Scottish folk song ''Loch Lomond'' in the late 1930's gave her an identity that remained with her throughout her career, died of heart failure Tuesday at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Miss Sullivan, who had a busy career both in this country and abroad, gave her last performance March 22 at the Westport Arts Center in Westport, Conn. She entered the hospital April 1, where she suffered a seizure and went into a coma.         Miss Sullivan was born Marietta Williams in Homestead, Pa., on May 13, 1911. She shot to fame in 1937 when she recorded ''Loch Lomond'' in an arrangement by Claude Thornhill, the pianist, who led a small accompanying group on the recording. It was an immediate hit, and she followed it with a series of recordings of swinging folk songs, including ''Molly Malone,'' ''It Was a Lover and His Lass'' and ''If I Had a Ribbon Bow.''         Although singing folk songs appeared to be a novelty at that time, Miss Sullivan was doing it in the very earliest stages of her career, when she was singing at an after-hours club in Pittsburgh called the Benjamin Harrison Literary Society.         Two of her future husbands, the bassist John Kirby and the pianist Cliff Jackson both first heard her singing there.         One of her songs was a musical setting of Joyce Kilmer's poem ''Trees.''         ''I couldn't sing it straight,'' she explained. ''I had no choice but to swing it.'' Married in 1938         The success of ''Loch Lomond'' led to an engagement for her at the Onyx Club on 52d Street. There she sang with a small band led by Mr. Kirby that played in a light and airy style, once described as ''orchestrated finesse'' that was an ideal complement to Miss Sullivan's singing and to her manner when she sang, standing motionless, her chin tilted confidently upward and a slightly mischievous smile lighting her face.         She married Mr. Kirby in 1938 and later she and his band became the stars of a weekly NBC radio network series, ''Flow Gently Sweet Rhythm,'' a precedent-setting event for black performers.         In 1938 Miss Sullivan went from the Onyx Club to Hollywood to appear in the film ''Going Places,'' in which she and Louis Armstrong introduced ''Jeepers Creepers.'' The following year she appeared in a second film, ''St. Louis Blues,'' and also performed on Broadway with Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman in a jazz version of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' called ''Swingin' the Dream,'' in which she sang ''Darn That Dream.''         During the 1940's she moved away from her early close association with folk songs, although until her death she could always respect - and respond to - requests for ''Loch Lomond.'' She developed a fresh repertory of standard pop songs such as ''I've Got the World on a String,'' ''Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams'' and ''I Got a Right to Sing the Blues.'' Won Tony Award in 1979         In 1950, after her marriage to Mr. Kirby had ended in divorce, she married Mr. Jackson and temporarily retired from singing to raise her daughter, Paula. During these years she developed an interest in physical therapy and nursing and was active in local civic affairs in the Bronx. After Mr. Jackson's death in 1970, she founded the House That Jazz Built, a community center at 1312 Stebbins Avenue in the Bronx. Dedicated to Mr. Jackson, the center continues to serve young people through the efforts of senior citizens.         In 1979 she received a Tony award for her performance in ''My Old Friends,'' a musical on aging that was described by a reviewer for The New York Times as ''jolly yet touching.''         She is survived by her daughter, Paula Morris, and her son, Orville Williams.         A service will be held at 7 P.M. tomorrow at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street.

        Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Since 1981 the actress had been under the care of her second daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, who by publicizing her mother's tragic illness had drawn national and international attention to Alzheimer's disease, about which little was known until recent years.         According to Princess Yasmin, Miss Hayworth's health had steadily deteriorated over the years and she lapsed into a semicoma in February.         The ''courage and candor'' of Miss Hayworth and her family in bringing attention to Alzheimer's disease was praised by President Reagan in a statement yesterday.         ''Rita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars,'' he said. ''Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on the stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl.         ''Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend whom we will miss.'' The Epitome of Glamour         Rita Hayworth was the epitome of Hollywood glamour and allure, a stunningly beautiful actress and dancer.         During World War II, her pinup pictures decorated barracks walls and ships' bulkheads wherever servicemen went, and over two decades her often tempestuous romantic life thrust her into the headlines.         Fred Astaire, who co-starred with her in two movies, said in his autobiography that she was his favorite dancing partner, and dancing was, indeed, one of her genuine talents.         As a singer, however, she was not similarly gifted, even though she was cast in many musicals. Anita Ellis dubbed Miss Hayworth's songs in four movies, including ''Pal Joey'' and ''The Loves of Carmen,'' and other ''ghosts'' did the singing for her in other films.         But that mattered little to Hayworth fans, who admired her chiefly for the sensuality she exuded, playing temptresses in movies such as ''Blood and Sand'' and ''The Lady From Shanghai.'' The Temptress of 'Gilda'         A particularly memorable temptress role was the title one in ''Gilda,'' in 1946, in which she did a striptease, demure by today's standards, inasmuch as it was limited to removing her arm-length gloves. While the controversial strip scene dazzled tens of thousands of young males, it upset more conservative people across the nation.         So did Miss Hayworth's open affair, in the late 1940's, when such behavior was far less commonplace than it is today, with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the spiritual leader of millions of Ismaili Moslems. They were married in 1949, but she divorced him, as she did four other husbands, including Orson Welles.         As Miss Hayworth grew older, she successfully shifted from her glamour image and took on mature roles in movies such as ''Separate Tables'' in 1958 and ''They Came to Cordura'' in 1959. But by the late 1960's she was appearing in minor movies, most of them made in Europe.         And ultimately, the once-idolized star's health was ravaged by Alzheimer's disease - senile dementia, a devastating mental illness that affects the brain, brings on loss of memory, and ravages bodily functions - which left her ''utterly helpless,'' according to Princess Yasmin.         Miss Hayworth was truly born to show business, in New York City, on Oct. 17, 19l8. Her father, Eduardo Cansino, was a Spanish-born dancer and her mother, the former Volga Haworth, had been a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl. They named their daughter Margarita Carmen Cansino, but she shortened the name to Rita Cansino when she began dancing professionally at the age of 12, and kept that name for her first 10 movies. Spotted by a Fox Producer         Mr. Cansino's career took the family to Los Angeles, where his daughter attended school through the ninth grade. Then she joined her father's act and performed in clubs in Tijuana and Agua Caliente, Mexico, where, when she was 16 years old, she was spotted by a Fox Film Company producer, who signed her to a contract.         Making her film debut in 1935 in ''Under the Pampas Moon,'' Rita Cansino appeared in a succession of lesser roles, such as that of a dance hall girl in a Spencer Tracy movie called ''Dante's Inferno.'' Other films in her Cansino period included ''Charlie Chan in Egypt,'' ''Human Cargo'' and ''Meet Nero Wolfe.''         The Fox company's merger with 20th-Century Pictures left the young dancer without a contract, but in 1937 she met and married the man who was to become her Svengali and dramatically change her career fortunes. He was Edward Judson, a shrewd businessman 22 years her senior, under whose guidance she had her eyebrows and hairline altered by electrolysis and transformed herself from a raven-haired Latin to an auburn-haired cosmopolitan.         As her manager, Mr. Judson also changed his wife's professional name, choosing her mother's maiden name of Haworth and adding a ''y'' to clarify the pronunciation. He hired press agents to get the name and picture of Rita Hayworth into newspapers and fan magazines, and ultimately won her a seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures.         But low-budget B movies continued to be Miss Hayworth's lot, except for the 1939 ''Only Angels Have Wings,'' with Cary Grant, in which the director, Howard Hawks, cast her as an unfaithful wife. It was the secondary female role, but one that got the actress her first good critical notices. A 'Love Goddess' Emerges         Beginning in 1941, Miss Hayworth rapidly developed into one of Hollywood's most glamorous stars, inspiring Winthrop Sargent, a Life magazine writer, to dub her ''The Great American Love Goddess,'' a sobriquet that she welcomed and that caught the public's fancy.         On loan to Warner Brothers, Miss Hayworth appeared opposite James Cagney in ''Strawberry Blonde'' in 1941 and, back at Columbia, she achieved full star status when she was cast as Mr. Astaire's dancing partner in ''You'll Never Get Rich,'' a 1941 hit that got her a Time magazine cover article and instant celebrity. In 1942, she appeared in three hit movies, ''My Gal Sal,'' ''Tales of Manhattan'' and ''You Were Never Lovelier,'' the last again as Mr. Astaire's co-star.         Her performance in ''Cover Girl,'' with Gene Kelly in 1944, earned Miss Hayworth the attention of Life magazine, which printed a photograph of her, posed seductively in black lace, that became famous around the world as an American servicemen's pinup. In what was intended, no doubt, as the ultimate compliment, the picture was even pasted to a test atomic bomb that was dropped on Bikini atoll in 1946.         Miss Hayworth, unlike stars who claimed to deplore their own publicity, reveled in hers. ''Why should I mind?'' she said. ''I like having my picture taken and being a glamorous person. Sometimes when I find myself getting impatient, I just remember the times I cried my eyes out because nobody wanted to take my picture at the Trocadero.''         A great boost to Miss Hayworth's career was ''Gilda,'' which ran into censorship trouble in some areas because of the so-called strip scene. In it, she wore a clinging black satin strapless gown and, while coyly peeling off long black gloves, sang a mildly suggestive song called ''Put the Blame on Mame.'' Actually, the voice was that of Anita Ellis. Marriage to Orson Welles         Miss Hayworth, who had divorced her first husband, married Orson Welles in 1943, and they had a daughter, Rebecca. While Mr. Welles was directing her in one of her best films, ''The Lady From Shanghai'' (1949), she filed for divorce from him. Miss Hayworth had met and fallen in love with Prince Aly Khan and, since neither was divorced at the time, their travels together through Europe provoked some public indignation.         When they were married in 1949, the fact that Miss Hayworth was visibly pregnant was widely reported. She divorced Aly Khan two years later and was subsequently married to and divorced from the singer Dick Haymes and then James Hill, a movie producer.         Miss Hayworth's more than 40 films also included ''Affair in Trinidad'' (1952), ''Salome'' and ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953), ''Fire Down Below'' (1957), ''The Story on Page One'' (1960), ''The Poppy Is Also a Flower'' (1967), and ''The Wrath of God'' (1972).         She attempted a stage career in 1971, but it ended abruptly because she was unable to remember her lines. Six years later, a court in Santa Ana, Calif., named an administrator for her affairs on the recommendation of a physician who said she was disabled by chronic alcoholism.         Despite her heavy drinking, however, it later appeared that the diagnosis of alcoholism might have been erroneous and that Miss Hayworth was actually suffering from the first stages of Alzheimer's disease.         In June 1981, a court in Los Angeles declared the actress legally unable to care for herself and she was put in the care of Princess Yasmin, who took her to New York to live. In 1985 the Princess married a Greek shipping executive, Basil Embiricos, but the marriage was short-lived. They had a son, Andrew. Miss Hayworth's other daughter, Rebecca Welles, lives in Tacoma, Wash.         Princess Yasmin, testifying in 1983 before a Congressional committee concerned with appropriating funds for Alzheimer's disease research, said that the disease had reduced her mother to ''a state of utter helplessness.''         The Princess's appearance was among her many efforts in recent years to draw attention to Alzheimer's disease. She has taken a major role in the growth of the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc., which has headquarters in Chicago and more than 130 chapters and affiliates, backing some 500 family-support groups. She is vice president of that organization and president of Alzheimer's Disease International, which she helped organize in 1985.         A funeral service for Miss Hayworth will be held Monday at 10 A.M. in the Church of the Good Shepherd, Beverly Hills, Calif.       
        Dorothy Blanchard Hammerstein, a former New York interior designer and the widow of the lyricist and librettist Oscar Hammerstein 2d, died in her sleep yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         Dorothy Blanchard Hammerstein, a former New York interior designer and the widow of the lyricist and librettist Oscar Hammerstein 2d, died in her sleep yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         A woman of commanding presence, Mrs. Hammerstein was considered a great beauty throughout her life. Of medium height, with bright blue eyes and, in her later years, snowy white hair, she was known for her flawless carriage and ready wit.         In the early 1930's, Mrs. Hammerstein founded an interior design business, Dorothy Hammerstein Inc., and quickly established herself as one of the most sought-after decorators on both coasts. She retired in the mid-1950's.         In 1949, with her husband and the novelist Pearl Buck, she was a founder of Welcome House (now Welcome House Adoption Sevices) in Doylestown, Pa., an organization that arranges for the adoption of children of American and Asian parents.         She was also actively involved with the Dance Theater of Harlem Inc., both as a board member and as a member of its national advisory board, from its inception in 1969 until her death. Born in Australia         Born in Tasmania, Australia, Mrs. Hammerstein was one of five daughters of Henry James Blanchard, a master mariner, and his wife, the former Marion Parmentier. At the age of 23, Dorothy Blanchard left Melbourne for London, seeking a movie career. Meeting with little success, she decided to return to Australia by way of New York.         In Manhattan, she joined the cast of ''Charlot's Revue,'' an English musical starring Beatrice Lillie. When the show closed in New York, she toured the United States and Canada for a year as Miss Lillie's understudy.         In 1925 she married Henry Jacobson, a New York businessman, with whom she had two children. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1929 she married Mr. Hammerstein. The marriage lasted until his death in 1960.         Mrs. Hammerstein is survived by a sister, Eleanor Biow of Santa Barbara, Calif.; two sons, Henry Jacobson of Santa Barbara and James Blanchard Hammerstein of Manhattan and London; a daughter, Susan Blanchard of Manhattan; two stepchildren, William Hammerstein of Kent, Conn., and Alice Mathias of Harrison, N.Y.; 10 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
        Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Astor entered silent films in 1920 as a willowy 14-year-old and portrayed scores of vulnerable ingenues. Two decades later she gave her most indelible performance opposite Humphrey Bogart in ''The Maltese Falcon,'' John Huston's crime classic. Her subtle, mature portrayal of a seemingly sympathetic woman who was, in fact, evilly duplicitous, took audiences by surprise. Such women were rarely the heroines of movies then, nor had they been portrayed as deceptively as Miss Astor portrayed the homicidal Brigid O'Shaughnessy.         In the same year, 1941, she was a ruthless, egocentric concert pianist battling Bette Davis in ''The Great Lie,'' for which Miss Astor won an Oscar as the best actress in a supporting role. ''If I'd had my druthers,'' she later wrote, ''I would have preferred getting my Oscar for 'The Maltese Falcon.' '' Sophisticates and Villains         Other skillful characterizations included a warmly urbane widow in ''Dodsworth'' (1936), a spurned mistress in the 1937 version of the swashbuckling ''Prizoner of Zenda,'' a disillusioned wife in ''The Hurricane'' (1937) and a sympathetic prostitute in ''Act of Violence'' (1949).         But few of her films matched the turmoil of her private life. In 1936, she was the center of one of Hollywood's most spectacular scandals when she sued Dr. Franklyn Thorpe for legal custody of their 4-year-old daughter, Marylyn. Dr. Thorpe had divorced Miss Astor a year earlier.         The suit led to disclosure of her diary, which allegedly contained accounts of liaisons with many celebrities. Dr. Thorpe sought to use the diary to prove she was an unfit mother, and purported excerpts were published in newspapers under suggestive headlines.         Miss Astor repeatedly maintained that the excerpts were lurid forgeries. She later acknowledged that an authentic portion published by one newspaper included ''a rather overemotional account of a romantic interlude with George S. Kaufman,'' the playwright.         The trial judge ordered the diary sealed and impounded. It was inadmissible as evidence, she wrote later, because her former husband had removed pages involving himself. Miss Astor was granted custody of her daughter for nine months a year, with Dr. Thorpe allowed custody the three other months. The diary was never made public, and a judge witnessed its burning in 1952. Won Beauty Contest at 11         During the 30-day trial, Hollywood producers, fearing the scandal would damage the film industry, pressed Miss Astor to drop the suit, but she refused, risking her reputation and career to keep her daughter. Soon after the trial, throngs of people hailed her courage when she toured with screenings of ''Dodsworth.''         Mary Astor was born Lucile Langhanke on May 3, 1906, in Quincy, Ill., the only child of the former Helen Vasconcells, an American, and Otto Ludwig Wilhelm Langhanke, a German immigrant who made an uncertain income from such diverse activities as teaching German and poultry farming until he began to cash in on his daughter's film success.         The girl won her first movie contract with Famous Players-Lasky and, with it, the name Mary Astor. Within two years she was making features and her salary started soaring. In 1923, the family went to Hollywood and she became John Barrymore's leading lady in ''Beau Brummel.''         She was teamed with Barrymore again in ''Don Juan'' (1926), which introduced a Vitaphone background-music soundtrack, the harbinger of talkies. Her early sound films included ''Holiday'' (1930), playing the materialistic sister of Ann Harding, and ''Red Dust'' (1932), in which she portrayed a frustrated wife attracted to Clark Gable. Sued for Nonsupport by Parents         Later movies included ''Midnight'' (1939), ''Brigham Young - Frontiersman'' (1940), ''Across the Pacific'' (1942), ''The Palm Beach Story'' (1942), ''Claudia and David'' (1946) and ''Return to Peyton Place'' (1961).         Miss Astor's professional successes were punctuated by personal tragedies. In 1930, her first husband, Kenneth Hawks, was killed in a plane crash while directing a movie.         Her parents lived lavishly, taking nearly all her salary, but in 1934 she put them on an allowance. Unable to continue embellishing the mansion and estate she had given them, they sued her for nonsupport. She said that ''from 1920 to 1930, I gave my father $461,000'' while she kept only $24,000. She agreed to pay them $100 a month, and the suit was dismissed.         After the diary scandal, Miss Astor was married to Manuel del Campo, a Mexican sportsman, by whom she had a son, Anthony, and later to Thomas G. Wheelock, a businessman. Both marriages ended in divorce. A Drinking Problem         Her tangled personal life and the financial pressures to keep working worsened a longtime drinking problem. She sought help from a priest-psychologist, the Rev. Peter Ciklic, and to further her therapy, he had her write notes about her life. At his urging, she revised the notes into a 1959 autobiography, ''My Story.'' It was praised by reviewers for its style and uncompromising insights.         Personally regenerated, she began writing novels and completed a successful memoir on movie making, ''A Life on Film,'' in 1971. Her first novel, ''The Incredible Charlie Carewe,'' about a charming rotter, was described by a reviewer in The New York Times as ''lively entertainment.''         In ''A Life on Film,'' Miss Astor deplored a ''poverty of spirit'' in many contemporary movies, writing that ''whatever we did - we old moviemakers - we gave people a lot of fun. Through depressions and wars and calamities, we gave them the sense of glory, of a future that would be braver than today.''         Miss Astor retired to the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills in 1974 and contributed to it from her writing income.         Besides her daughter and son, the actress is survived by an undisclosed number of grandchildren. A funeral service will be private.       
        Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         She was widely known as the sharp-tongued wife of one of the nation's most influential publishers, Henry R. Luce, whose magazines included Time, Life and Sports Illustrated.         But she won fame on her own as magazine writer and editor, author of ''The Women'' and other hit plays, controversial Republican member of the House of Representatives from Connecticut, and, finally, in the Eisenhower Administration, a hardworking and often praised Ambassador to Italy.         She had enough careers to satisfy the ambitions of several women, but none tied her down for long. She was often on lists of the world's 10 most admired women, but her glamorous existence and tart tongue drew criticism, sometimes partisan, sometimes envious.         Clare Boothe was born in New York City on April 10, 1903, the daughter of William Franklin Boothe, a pit orchestra violinist and sometime businessman, and the former Anna Clara Snyder, who had been a chorus girl. The child was christened Ann Clare, but she never used the Ann. When Parents Separated         Her parents separated when Clare was 8 years old. She was brought up in genteel poverty by her mother, who still managed to take her to France for a year and send her to the Cathedral School of St. Mary in Garden City, L.I., and the Castle School at Tarrytown-on-Hudson, N.Y. In 1919, her mother married Dr. Albert Elmer Austin, a prominent physician in Greenwich, Conn. On a trip to Europe in 1920, the 18-year-old Clare met Elsa Maxwell among other social figures. ''I'll have her to one of my parties,'' Miss Maxwell said. ''Whatever happens then, she'll get a rich husband.''         That happened, but not because of a Maxwell party. Clare Boothe met her future husband in church: George Tuttle Brokaw, millionaire-playboy son of a clothing manufacturer.         They married in 1923 in a wedding called ''the most important social event of the season.'' It was not to last. Mr. Brokaw, 23 years older than his bride, was a heavy drinker, according to one of his biographers, and was prone to abuse his wife. After six years of marriage she won a divorce on grounds of mental cruelty and was awarded $425,000 plus education expenses for her daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw. The Job at Vanity Fair         Declining to rest on her money, Clare Boothe importuned a society friend, Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue and Vanity Fair, for a job. After proving she was not another idle society matron whiling away her time between husbands, she did a stint writing photo captions for Vogue.         Vanity Fair's editor, Frank Crowninshield, hired her after demanding that she draw up a list of 100 ideas. She rose quickly to assistant editor and wrote satirical pieces about society that were later collected in a book, ''Stuffed Shirts.''         Her penthouse apartment on East 57th Street, Manhattan, drew the social, artistic and political types who peopled Vanity Fair's pages. She became managing editor, injecting more political material in an effort to revive the magazine. She left in 1934.         She had written three plays, none produced. She once said reading the plays of George Bernard Shaw was the impetus for her interest in the theater. Much later she met Shaw and is said to have gushed, ''Except for you, I wouldn't be here.'' Shaw supposedly replied, ''And now, let me see, dear child, what was your mother's name?''         Her first produced play, ''Abide with Me,'' in 1935, was unanimously deemed a disaster. It concerned a drunken, sadistic husband who is shot in the last act. Several critics commented on how quickly she responded to almost indiscernible cries of ''Author.'' She never went to another opening night. Sparks at First Sight of Luce         Two days after the opening, the author became the wife of Henry R. Luce, publisher of Time and Fortune. The two independent personalities had struck sparks on their first meeting, when they were seated together at a dinner party and Mr. Luce ignored her.         The next time they met, at a party at the Waldorf-Astoria, his future wife resolved to pay Mr. Luce back by asking rude questions. This time he was enthralled by her. He ordered her to accompany him to the Waldorf's lobby, where he said, ''You are the great love of my life, and some day I'm going to marry you.''         The marriage lasted, although there were rumored difficulties - perhaps inevitable in a marriage between two such strongminded personalities. She had her separate careers and Mr. Luce had his magazines - Life, the picture magazine, was reportedly her idea. The Successful Plays         Mrs. Luce returned to writing plays and with ''The Women,'' in 1936, recovered admirably from her maiden flop on Broadway. The play was an apotheosis of feminine bitchiness, concerning a devoted wife, the only sympathetic character, trying to win back her husband, who had been poached by a saleswoman. It earned her $2 million.         In 1938, Mrs. Luce was represented by ''Kiss the Boys Goodbye,'' a satire on the hoopla surrounding the search for the feminine lead in the movie of ''Gone With the Wind.'' It was a box-office success, as was her next play, ''Margin for Error,'' which purveyed a modish anti-Nazism.         With World War II, Mrs. Luce sought to involve herself on a larger stage. In February 1940, she sailed for Europe as an accredited correspondent for Life for a firsthand look at the war. One result was a book, ''Europe in the Spring.'' Dorothy Parker called it ''All Clare on the Western Front.''         In 1943 Mrs. Luce decided to run for the House of Representatives from Fairfield County, Conn. Criticism of Roosevelt         Despite her friendships with early New Dealers, she was by now a Republican and made speeches critical of the Roosevelt Administration's handling of the war effort. Riding an off-year tide of anti-Administration sentiment, she defeated a Democratic incumbent by 7,000 votes.         In her first speech in the House, she attacked a proposal by Vice President Henry A. Wallace calling for postwar freedom of the air. Mrs. Luce wrapped up the Wallace proposal in a single word, ''globaloney.'' In Congress she frequently spoke out on foreign policy as well as for racial equality in the armed forces and war production.         Despite her own brief infatuation with Communism in the 1930's, Mrs. Luce emerged as an early hardline anti-Communist (although as early as 1964 she was calling for more normal relations with China).         She won re-election in 1944, campaigning with fire but concealing sorrow. Her 19-year-old daughter was killed in an automobile accident that year. A Jesuit priest put her in touch with the Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, who was becoming known for his broadcasts. Before Sheen had talked three minutes, she demanded, ''Listen, if God is good, why did He take my daughter?''         ''In order that you might be here in the faith,'' Sheen replied. Became a Catholic         Their sessions, with Mrs. Luce arguing and Sheen explaining, resulted in her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1946. After that a friend noticed a gradual change in her: ''Twenty years ago she was like a diamond - beautiful, brilliant and cold. Now she is beautiful, brilliant and compassionate. She has become a kind and remarkably unselfish woman.''         Because of personal problems and long separations from her husband that her duties entailed, Mrs. Luce did not seek re-election in 1946. She remained politically active, in addition to writing a column for McCall's, and in 1952 she campaigned for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.         He offered her the post of Secretary of Labor, but she demurred. He then named her Ambassador to Italy, stirring controversy because of Mrs. Luce's Catholicism, her lack of diplomatic experience and because she was a woman.         But she waded into her job with customary energy and contempt for obstacles. She helped lay the diplomatic groundwork for an international conference that worked out a compromise on the status of Trieste, a dispute that threatened war between Yugoslavia and Italy. Effective Diplomacy         She made strongly anti-Communist speeches and warned of cutoffs of American aid to Italian industry: Communists dominated the labor unions. She drew fire from leftists.  Once her chauffeur misunderstood her directions and took her to the residence of President Giovanni Gronchi. Unable to back out, Mrs. Luce, whose relations with the President had been somewhat strained, took the occasion to persuade him to permit the stationing of American troops on Italian soil.         In Italy she caught a mysterious illness finally diagnosed as arsenic poisoning. The Central Intelligence Agency was called in. The cause was paint dust from her bedroom ceiling. A Controversy Over Brazil         In 1959 she was nominated Ambassador to Brazil. A determined one-man opposition to her appointment was mounted in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. Mrs. Luce was confirmed both by the committee and the Senate, but she could not resist a final jab at Morse.         ''My difficulties, of course, go back some years,'' she said, ''when Senator Morse was kicked in the head by a horse.'' (He was once kicked by a horse, but not in the head.) In the resultant furor, Eisenhower defended her while Mr. Luce publicly urged her to resign, which she did.         In 1964 she announced that she was running for the Senate in New York State as a Conservative Party candidate and supporter of Senator Barry Goldwater, whose nomination for President she had seconded at the Republican convention. Under pressure from the party's liberal wing and finally Senator Goldwater himself, she withdrew from the race on the eve of the Conservative convention. Moved to Honolulu         In later years she devoted herself to social life in Phoenix, where the Luces had a house - skindiving, doing mosaics and needlepoint, painting and writing. After Mr. Luce died in 1967, she moved to Honolulu, where she lived until 1983, when she moved into an apartment at the Watergate complex in Washington.''It's a city of human proportions,'' she said.         In recent years Mrs. Luce served on President Reagan's unpaid Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.         Of her writing she once said, ''I have been too involved with living to write much - or well - about life.'' A biographer, Alden Hatch, summed her up this way:         ''Brilliant, yet often foolish; idealistic, yet realistic to the verge of cynicism; tough as a Marine sergeant, but almost quixotically kind to unfortunates; with the mind and courage of a man and exceedingly feminine instincts; the complexities of her character are as numerous as the facets of her career. Probably the reason no one understands her completely is because she does not even understand herself.''         Mrs. Luce is survived by two stepsons, Henry Luce 3d and Peter Paul Luce. Interment will be private, A High Mass will be offered at noon Tuesday in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a memorial service Wednesday at 11 A. M. at the Church of St. Stephen Martyr in Washington.       
        Edith Luckett Davis, Nancy Reagan's mother, died of a stroke today at her home in Phoenix, Ariz. She was 91 years old.         Edith Luckett Davis, Nancy Reagan's mother, died of a stroke today at her home in Phoenix, Ariz. She was 91 years old.         President and Mrs. Reagan will travel to Phoenix Tuesday morning, and the President will return to Washington Tuesday night, leaving Mrs. Reagan behind. Mr. Reagan will return to Arizona for the funeral, when arrangements are completed, the White House said.         Mrs. Davis, who went by the name ''Lucky,'' had been in poor health for the last several years. The White House said she died at 12:15 P.M., mountain standard time. Mrs. Reagan was at the White House when told of her mother's death. Career as an Actress         Mrs. Davis began work as an actress at the age of 15 and appeared in several films, including ''The Other Girl'' in 1915. She also acted on stage, in New York and with several regional stock companies. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1928 when she played with Walter Huston and Kay Francis in ''Elmer the Great.''         Her first marriage, to Kenneth Robbins of Pittsfield, Mass., ended in divorce. In 1929 she met and married Dr. Loyal Davis, a Chicago neurosurgeon.         Mrs. Davis performed volunteer work in various areas of health care for more than 50 years. She served on several boards and foundations. She also served as honorary chairman of the women's division of United Cerebral Palsy.         After Dr. Davis retired as head of the surgery department at Northwestern University in 1963, she moved with him to Phoenix. Dr. Davis died in 1982.         In 1983 Mrs. Davis was awarded the Arizona Lifetime Achievement Award by the Association for Retarded Citizens.         She is survived by one daugther, Mrs. Reagan; one son, Richard Davis of Philadelphia, and seven grandchildren.       
        Madeleine Carroll, the cosmopolitan actress of the 1930's and 1940's who starred in the Alfred Hitchcock classics ''The 39 Steps'' and ''Secret Agent'' and more than three dozen other movies, died yesterday afternoon at her home outside the resort town of Marbella, Spain, a spokesman for the Marbella Hospital Clinic said.         Madeleine Carroll, the cosmopolitan actress of the 1930's and 1940's who starred in the Alfred Hitchcock classics ''The 39 Steps'' and ''Secret Agent'' and more than three dozen other movies, died yesterday afternoon at her home outside the resort town of Marbella, Spain, a spokesman for the Marbella Hospital Clinic said. She was 81 years old.         The hospital spokesman said she died of natural causes, but did not give a cause of death.         A friend and neighbor of Miss Carroll, Countess Maria Larisch, said that the actress had been released from the Hospital Clinic a few days ago after spending more than two weeks there. Other members of the Marbella foreign community said that Miss Carroll, who became a United States citizen in 1943, had lived in the Mediterranean coast town for more than 15 years.         The actress, whose real name was Marie-Madeleine Bernadette O'Carroll, was born on Feb. 26, 1906, in West Bromwich, an industrial community five miles northwest of Birmingham, England. She was the daughter of John Carroll of Ireland and Helene de Rosiere Tuaillon, a Frenchwoman. Modeled Hats and Taught French         Miss Carroll was graduated from Birmingham University with a B.A. degree with honors in French. Her first jobs were modeling hats and teaching French. She made her acting debut as a French maid with a touring company in England. After a screen test, she got roles in several British movies, beginning with three 1928 films, ''The Guns of Loos,'' ''The First Born'' and ''What Money Can Buy.''         A delicate blonde beauty, Miss Carroll appeared in a score of British movies, with leading roles in ''The 39 Steps'' (1935) and ''Secret Agent'' (1936). In 1936, too, she went to Hollywood, where she was put under contract to Walter Wanger and 20th Century-Fox.         In the United States she appeared in ''The Case Against Mrs. Ames'' (1936), ''The General Died at Dawn'' (1936), ''Lloyd's of London'' (1936), ''On the Avenue'' (1937), ''The Prisoner of Zenda'' (1937), ''It's All Yours'' (1937), ''Blockade'' (1938), Cafe Society'' (1939), ''Honeymoon in Bali'' (1939), ''My Son, My Son,'' (1940), ''North West Mounted Police'' (1940) ''Virginia'' (1941), ''One Night in Lisbon,'' (1941), ''Bahama Passage'' (1942), and ''My Favorite Blonde'' (1942). Relief Work in World War II         During World War II, her sister was killed in a German air raid on London, and Miss Carroll went back to England, where she did war-relief work.         After the war she resumed her film career briefly, appearing in ''White Cradle Inn'' (1946), ''An Innocent Affair'' - also entitled ''Don't Trust Your Husband'' (1948), and ''The Fan'' (1949) before retiring from film work for good. She later appeared on the stage and on television and worked for Unesco.         During her long career she also acted in radio dramas and on the stage in the United States.         Miss Carroll's four marriages, to Capt. Philip Astley, the actor Sterling Hayden, Henri Lavorel and Andrew Heiskell, an executive of Time Inc., ended in divorce.
