         Elizabeth Wood, a public housing pioneer who advocated racial and economic integration and the designing of workable neighborhoods, died yesterday at a nursing home near Atlanta. She was 93.         She suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a broken hip and a stroke, said Gisela Titman, a niece.         Miss Wood was the founding director of the Chicago Housing Authority, an Illinois state housing official and an officer of the National Association of Housing Officials. She was later a housing consultant in New York City and an administrator at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.         Known as "Chicago's largest landlord," she headed the authority from 1937 to 1954, supervising the building and management of homes for thousands of families. Sought Real Neighborhoods         The philosophy she developed over the years was to mix residents by race, economic class and family size. She proposed that social workers help troubled families who might drag down a project.         Miss Wood favored small, dispersed projects rather than high-rise concentrations. A building's height should be limited to the distance that a mother in a window could be heard when calling to a child in a playground below, she said.         She urged planners to include shops, churches, parks and even pubs to turn housing complexes into real neighborhoods instead of human warehouses. Courtyards and indoor gathering places should have an inviting "design for loitering," she said. She sponsored flower-growing contests to brighten the projects.         Political pressure eventually forced Miss Wood out of her Chicago job. She said she fought with officials "and anybody else who stood in the way of getting homes built for the people."         She then went to New York, where she did studies for the City Housing Authority and the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. From 1965 to 1972 she worked at H.U.D. in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations to coordinate housing policy with other social and poverty programs.         She won Guggenheim and Ford Foundation grants to study in Iran and analyze housing in India. She wrote numerous articles and books.         The daughter of a missionary teacher, Miss Wood was born in Nara, Japan, and grew up in Bloomington, Ill. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees in rhetoric at the University of Michigan, she taught English for four years at Vassar College.         After moving to Chicago for doctoral studies, she instead became a social worker for United Charities. She then joined the Home Modernization Bureau, where a major contractor tutored her on the construction industry.         When the New Deal Public Works Administration began building housing, she became a planner. She also served as executive secretary of the Illinois Housing Board when it drafted a law creating housing authorities.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Beth Robertson Cosnow, a longtime community leader on the East Side of Manhattan, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 70.         The cause was lung cancer, said a friend, Lauren Giber.         Mrs. Cosnow, who was born in Dinuba, Calif., graduated from the University of California. She arrived in New York City after World War II and became involved in numerous neighborhood and block associations. As a Democratic district leader, she was a delegate to the 1984 Democratic National Convention and a leader emeritus of the Tilden Midtown Democratic Club.         Mrs. Cosnow, a co-founder of the First Women's Bank in Manhattan, also served in the 1960's as president of Friendly Visitors Inc., a women's volunteer group that provided social and recreational services to inmates of the city's Women's House of Detention in Manhattan. She was appointed an air-and-noise pollution ombudsman in the city's Department of Environmental Protection by Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins.         She was a past member of Manhattan Planning Board 6 and was active in the National Arts Club until the time of her death.         Her husband, Joseph Cosnow, died nine years ago. Survivors include her companion, Cyrus Rudman, and a sister, Laura Mulville, who lives in Florida.       
         Dr. Blanche Bernstein, a prominent welfare expert and former government official whose criticisms of the welfare system provoked stormy policy debates, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said Barbara Rulnick, a niece.         Dr. Bernstein argued that the welfare system's major failing is in fostering continued dependency for people receiving aid, instead of guiding them off the welfare rolls to independence.         "Reduction of dependency is the greatest unmet need in social policy today," she once said. "We have not gotten to the heart of the problem."         Her pronouncements often stirred opposition from other officials, experts and advocates. Some accused her of being unsympathetic to poor people and minorities, which she denied.         Supporters said her aim was to help the truly needy while paring cheaters and ineligible recipients from welfare and reducing erroneous overpayments. High-Ranking Welfare Posts         In 1978-79 she headed the nation's largest local welfare agency when she served as the city's Human Resources Administrator, with more than a million residents receiving aid. Mayor Edward I. Koch appointed and praised her as "terrific."         But during her term more than 100,000 people were pared from the welfare rolls. After she came under fire from a number of black officials, Mr. Koch named a deputy with superseding power over her, and she resigned. The Mayor's action was widely interpreted as a concession to soothe his frayed minority relations.         Dr. Bernstein also served as the State Social Services Department's deputy commissioner for income maintenance from 1975-77, under Gov. Hugh L. Carey. She was in charge of public assistance, food stamps and welfare job programs.         Later she recounted her battles and explained her policies in "The Politics of Welfare: The New York City Experience" (Abt, 1982), which Fortune magazine called "wonderfully instructive."         An economist, Dr. Bernstein earlier held policy posts in the State Department, worked for charities, was an educator and researched a wide array of social problems.         Among the issues she studied were foster care, the effect of welfare on family stability, obstacles to drug treatment for addicts, impoverished Jews, day care, obstacles to employment for welfare recipients, mental health care, welfare spending, family budgets and prenatal care. Director at New School         Dr. Bernstein focused increasingly on the growing and entwined problems of teen-age mothers, single-parent families, poor education, school dropout and unemployment. Unless society "breaks the cycle of dependency and poverty," she said, "we are in danger of creating a permanent underclass."         On leaving government in 1979, she became the director of the Social Policy Research Institute at the New School for Social Research. The institute studied welfare, housing, health care, child neglect and abuse and services for the aged.         After retiring from the New School, she remained in education as a trustee of the City University of New York.         Dr. Bernstein was born in New York City. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree and a doctorate in economics at Columbia.         Her survivors include a brother, Hilliard, of Manhattan.       
         Grace Hayward Mack, a horticulturalist known for her work in hybridizing chrysanthemums, died on Friday at her home in New Canaan, Conn. She was 91 years old.         Her family said the cause of death was heart failure.         Mrs. Mack became interested in hybridizing chrysanthemums as a hobby in the early 1950's. When she retired six years ago, she held patents on more than 35 varieties.         In 1968, Mrs. Mack, together with Rachel Carson, the author of "Silent Spring," received the Garden Club of America Award of Merit in Horticulture, the highest such award given in this country. In 1989, she was awarded the Gold Medal Award by the Society of American Florists for her outstanding contributions to the floral Industry.         She was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Vassar College in 1924. Interested in social work, she first worked with Indian communities in Alaska, then held an executive post at the Y.W.C.A. in Duluth, Minn. Later she joined the Katherine Gibbs School in New York City, becoming director of placement.         She is survived by two sons, Talbot, of The Plains, Va., and John, of Washington; a daughter, Lucy, of Brookline, Mass., and six grandchildren.       
         Barbara Redmond Ryan, a volunteer for social causes, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 59.         Her husband, Allan A. Ryan 3d, said the cause of death was cancer.         Mrs. Ryan was a member of the women's committee of the Boys' Club of New York for 30 years and served on the club's board for 20 years. She was a co-founder of the committee's Homework Help program, which provides after-school counseling for underprivileged youth.         She was an active member of the Zoological Society of New York and of the New York Junior League, and a longtime organizer of Les Boutiques de Noel, which raises funds for Cancer Care, the Children's Aid Society and other organizations.         Mrs. Ryan, a native New Yorker, graduated from Vassar College in 1955.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Melissa and Sally, both of Manhattan; a son, Allan A. 4th, of Palm Beach, Fla.; her mother, Frances Jones Redmond of Essex, Conn.; a sister, Jean Cushing of Riverside, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Andrea Boroff Eagan, a journalist, educator, union founder and advocate for women, died on Tuesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 49 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         The interwoven themes of her career were social change, group action, women's rights, health and writing. Her causes grew from beliefs she formed as a campus activist in the turbulent protests of the 1960's.         In a celebrated moment during the Columbia University protests in 1968, she and Richard Eagan were unofficially married in a seized building. A chaplain pronounced them "children of the New Age." They were later legally married by that same chaplain.  Feminist Advice for Girls         Drawing on her personal experiences, Ms. Eagan wrote the first feminist advice book for teen-age girls, "Why Am I So Miserable, if These Are the Best Years of My Life?" (Lippincott, 1976). Later she wrote "The Newborn Mother: Stages of Her Growth" (Little, Brown, 1985), about the psychological changes in women after childbirth.         She also wrote many newspaper and magazine articles, mostly on health and women. She was the editor of the National Women's Health Network Series for Pantheon Books and president of Healthright, a nonprofit organization.         Ms. Eagan was active in local and national efforts for abortion rights and other health and women's issues. She taught about them at New York University and at La Guardia, Manhattan Community and Hunter Colleges.         From 1983 to 1987 she served as the founding president of the National Writers Union, which won contracts for freelance writers at several national magazines. She was also a founding board member of the Writers Room, Manhattan office space for writers free of distractions.         Ms. Eagan, who graduated from Columbia in 1969, reaffirmed her protest-era beliefs in a 1988 interview in The Washington Post: "The fact is, we were absolutely correct in what we perceived as being wrong. We were in error only in that we weren't successful."         Her survivors include her mother, Dorothy Boroff of Manhattan; her husband, Richard, and two daughters, Molly and Daisy, the Tony-award winning child actress in "The Secret Garden."       
         Martha Dalrymple, a co-author of an exhaustive study of New York City landmarks, died on Monday in Portland, Ore., where she had moved 17 years ago. She was 89.         The cause of death was chronic lung disease and heart failure, said her half-sister, Joanna Stuart of Portland.         With Harmon H. Goldstone, a former chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Miss Dalrymple wrote "History Preserved: A Guide to New York City Landmarks and Historic Districts" (1974). The book included city landmarks dating from 1650 to 1930.         Mr. Goldstone, an architect, was a major force in establishing the Landmarks Commission and served as its chairman from 1968 to 1973. Miss Dalrymple worked for several years as a volunteer for the commission, and their collaboration on the 576-page volume was a result.         She was a 1925 graduate of the University of Wisconsin, and began her career as a journalist. She worked for The Chicago Journal and then for The Associated Press, reporting from New York City, Washington, London, Rome and Moscow. She was hired by Nelson A. Rockefeller for the Office of Inter-American Affairs, for which he was the coordinator. She also wrote a history of the American International Association for Economic and Social Development, entitled "The A.I.A. Story: Two Decades of International Cooperation" (1968).       
         May Friend Goodman, who served for two decades as a representative of a leading international Jewish organization at the United Nations, died on Friday at her home in Cedarhurst, L.I. She was 85.         She died of heart failure, a family member said.         In 1952, Mrs. Goodman began her association as a nongovernmental representative at the United Nations through the World Union of Progressive Judaism. As a representative, she attended meetings of the Economic and Social Council and was an accredited spokeswoman for the World Union of Progressive Judaism. The World Union is the international body of Reform, Progressive, Liberal, and Reconstructionist Jews linking 1.5 million people in more than 20 countries.         Mrs. Goodman, who was born and educated in Chicago, graduated in 1930 from the University of Chicago. She wrote a number of plays for children sponsored by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. She also wrote book reviews for Chicago publications. She was married to Rabbi Abram Vossen Goodman, now rabbi emeritus of Temple Sinai of Long Island.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Gail G. Schulhoff of Baltimore, and Judith G. Richter of Merion, Pa., and four grandsons.       
         Edna Amadon Toney, a writer, an actress and a producer, died on Tuesday at her home in Katonah, N.Y. She was 79.         Her husband, Anthony, said the cause was liver cancer.         Mrs. Toney began her acting career with the WPA Theater Project in New York in the 1930's and was a writer for the "Kraft Music Hall" radio show, also in New York, in the mid-1940's.         From 1972 to 1984 she produced and acted at various community centers, colleges and libraries, including the Mid-Hudson Arts and Science Center in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and the Katonah Community Theater.         She was the author of several books, including "How to Become a Famous Playwright" and "Stuff and Nonsense." Her books were published by her under the name of Hanotak Kroywen (Katonah, New York, spelled backward).         Mrs. Toney was born in Manhattan and studied at the New Theater School, Columbia University and the New School for Social Research.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Anita Karen Toney of Fairfax, Calif., and Adele Susan Toney of Syracuse.       
         Sylvia A. Boone, a scholar of African and women's art and the first black woman to be granted a tenured professorship at Yale University, died on Tuesday at her home on campus. She was 52.         The cause was heart failure, said a friend, Vera Wells.         Dr. Boone, a professor of art history and Afro-American studies, specialized in African art, female imagery, women's arts and masks.         In Yale's early years of coeducation in the 1970's, she taught a course on black women and served on the executive committee for the women's studies program.

She was instrumental in organizing the 150th anniversary commemoration of the 1839 rebellion of 53 kidnapped Africans on the slave ship Amistad who were jailed in New Haven for mutiny but were eventually freed. She called the episode "a tale of triumph."         A native of Mount Vernon, N.Y., Dr. Boone graduated from Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree in social sciences at Columbia.         Next she studied at the University of Ghana, where she became friendly with visiting black Americans, including Malcolm X, Maya Angelou and W.E.B. Du Bois.         She started at Yale as a visiting lecturer in Afro-American studies in 1970. After earning master's and doctoral degrees in art history there, she joined the faculty in 1979 and was promoted to a tenured, full professor in 1988.         Her survivors include three brothers, J. Herbert, of Newport News, Va., Edgar S., of St. Petersburg, Fla., and John D., of Los Angeles.       
         Florence W. Hartstein, a leader in Jewish community organizations in this country and in Israel, died on Friday at the Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.

         May Davies Hopkins Martenet, a novelist and short-story writer, died on Sunday at the Westminster-Canterbury retirement home in Virginia Beach, Va., where she had lived since 1985. She was 85 and had been a longtime resident of Manhattan.         The cause was complications stemming from lung cancer, said her son-in-law, William Van Orden Gnichtel.         While living in New York, Mrs. Martenet wrote short fiction pieces, which were published in a variety of magazines, and a well-received novel, "Taw Jameson" (1953), which told of a ruthless game of social climbing in a Southern industrial town.

         Gloria E. Wise, who led a sit-in at a lunch counter in the South in 1960 and became a New York City social work administrator and head of a popular youth program, died on June 7 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 56 and lived in the Bronx.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         For her life's work in promoting racial and ethnic harmony, Mrs. Wise won the John V. Lindsay prize from the Citizens' Committee for New York City earlier this year. She donated the $5,000 award to her Youth Activities Committee, which sponsors after-school and summer programs.         As the student government president of Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C., Mrs. Wise joined four male students in protesting the whites-only rule at the local Woolworth lunch counter in 1960. She was among the first black women to demonstrate.         "Everybody was afraid, because we didn't know what was going to happen," she recalled. "But we did it because we wanted to be able sit down at a lunch counter."         Mrs. Wise was a city social worker for 31 years and became the director of case management resources at the Spofford Juvenile Center in the Bronx.         She retired there last year to devote full-time to her volunteer job as the executive director of the youth committee, which she helped found 17 years ago. It has served more than 20,000 youngsters from Co-op City and its neighborhood with education, recreation, culture and career programs.         Mrs. Wise was born in Manhattan. After graduating from Bennett she earned a master's degree in social work at Columbia University. She was a trustee of the Bronx Trinity United Methodist Church.

         Rita Ford, a dealer in antique and current music boxes with a wide array of musical sounds that enchanted visitors to her Manhattan shop for more than four decades, died on Thursday at New York Hospital. She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         Her physician, Dr. Thomas Fabry, said the cause was complications of fluid in the lungs.         Under her guidance, Rita Ford Music Boxes at 19 East 65th Street, has become a New York institution and a veritable museum of melodious boxes. Mrs. Ford used to say her shop was one of a kind because it was the only shop that sold old and new music boxes, made music boxes to order and also restored them.         Among her customers were Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller, the late Richard Rodgers, Beverly Sills and many other personalities in the entertainment and music world. A foreign client was the King of Saudi Arabia, who had made 20 matching music boxes playing the Saudi national anthem.         At her shop, Mrs. Ford would give personal tours of her treasure boxes, which ranged from 18th-century French mechanical figures that tinkled and trilled to modern Japanese boxes shaped like grand pianos playing the "Chariots of Fire" theme. The star of her collection was a Swiss-made mahogany box, circa 1887, which once belonged to Alec Templeton, with eight cylinders each playing six melodies including Strauss's "Blue Danube" waltz, "Comin' Thru the Rye" and "La Marseillaise," priced at $75,000. Born in Northeastern Italy         Retiring in 1990, she sold the music box shop to her assistant in restoration, Gerald Wright, who has preserved the name and character of the establishment.         Born in Fano, in northeastern Italy, she immigrated to the United States with her family when she was 6. The family changed its name from Romagna to Romania and settled on Fishers Island, N.Y.         At 19, she became a registered nurse and started out as a social worker in Hartford. During World War II, she married Albert Ford, an entrepreneur in New York City, and learned about antiques by visiting galleries.         Surviving is a niece, Nancy Young of Starr, S.C.       
         Elisabeth Draper, an interior designer in New York for 60 years, died in her sleep at her home in Manhattan on Monday. She was 93.         John R. Taylor Jr., one of Mrs. Draper's grandnephews, said she had been in declining health for the last four years.         Mrs. Draper was one of the grande dames of decorating in an era when a professionally decorated home was a mark of privilege.         She became known for comfortable rooms that mixed antiques with contemporary furnishings.         In 1967, she said: "I came along in that lovely ladies' era of decorating and just before all the talented men began emerging in the field."         Self-taught, Mrs. Draper was responsible for the decor of countless country houses, city apartments and houses as well as executive suites in banks.         She was born Elisabeth Carrington Frank in New York City in 1900, the daughter of Charles and Louise Frank. Mr. Frank was a banker. She attended Miss Spence's School but left before her graduation in 1918 to be trained as a radio operator 1st class, and served in that capacity until the end of World War I. Eisenhowers Were Clients         Soon after the war, she married Seth Low, a banker. When the couple were divorced in 1929, Mrs. Draper began her career in decorating with her sister Tiffany Taylor, establishing a firm called Taylor & Low.         In 1935, she married Dr. George Draper, an internist and specialist in psychosomatic medicine. In 1936, Mrs. Draper established her business under her own name.         Mrs. Draper was prominent in the Long Island social world for decades. President and Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower were among her numerous clients. She decorated their New York home as well as the Eisenhower farmhouse in Gettysburg, Pa.         She decorated the American Embassy in Paris for Ambassador Amory Houghton, worked on a number of rooms at the White House, and did the interiors of Blair House. The Old Merchant's House on East Fourth Street in Manhattan was restored under her direction.         Mrs. Draper is survived by her son, Seth Low Jr., of Syosset, L.I., and her stepdaughter, Penelope Buchanan of Cleveland.         The funeral will be tomorrow at 11 A.M. at St. James's Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         Dr. Wilma Thompson Donahue, an expert in the psychology of aging and director emeritus of the University of Michigan Institute of Gerontology, died on Tuesday at her home in Ann Arbor. She was 92.         She had had a long illness, the university reported.         Dr. Donahue was among the country's first clinical psychologists when she began her career at Ann Arbor in 1935 as a practitioner of the branch of psychology that deals with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of personality and behavior problems. Her reputation widened in the 1950's as her name appeared in journals and books on housing, medical care and other subjects concerning the elderly.         She served on state commissions on aging and was founding president of the Michigan Society of Gerontology. Ten years ago, she was in the first group inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.         Nationally, Dr. Donahue took part in White House Conferences on Aging in 1961, 1971 and 1981 and was a member of related policy boards for Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter. She served for 10 years as director of the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, a post she left 10 years ago.         Born in Mitchellville, Iowa, she earned three degrees in psychology at the University of Michigan, including a doctorate in 1937. She practiced at the mental hygiene clinic of the Student Health Service starting in 1935 and was appointed an instructor in the department of psychology three years later.         In 1951, she became the founding director of the university's division of gerontology and took the same position at the transformed Institute of Gerontology in 1966. She retired in 1970.         At the time, the university's Regents cited her ultimate mission as apolitical and purely educational: "She sought to elicit the truth about old people, especially those distressed in mind, body, or estate."         Dr. Donahue's husband, Lester, died in 1963 after 41 years of marriage.       
         Joan Walden Fleischman, a social worker who specialized in working with families with abused or neglected children, died on Monday at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. She was 61 and lived in Glen Rock, N.J.         The cause was leukemia, her family said.         Mrs. Fleischman was a social worker at the Family Life Center of Hackensack Hospital from 1980 to 1985, working with troubled families. She was later a social worker for the National Institutes of Health.         She served on the oversight board of the Anne Frank House for homeless women in Washington, D.C. She was also active in the National Museum for Women in the Arts and the Glen Rock League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Flesichman was born in Boston and grew up in Jamaica Plain and Brookline, Mass.         She was married for nearly 40 years to Edward H. Fleischman, a lawyer in Manhattan and former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Her other survivors include a son, Charles of Chevy Chase, Md.; a daughter, Janet of Tacoma Park, Md.; a brother, Stephen Walden of Rye, N.Y.; two sisters, Elinor Wharton of New York City and Beth Greenblatt of Teaneck, N.J., and one grandson.

         Dr. Barbara Biber Bodansky, a leading researcher in child psychology and early education for nearly half a century, died on Tuesday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Medical Center. She was 89.         Her family said she had had a long illness.         Dr. Biber -- the name she used professionally -- was chairman of the child development faculty of the Bank Street College of Education from 1931 to 1960. She directed its research division from 1950 to 1963.         In those positions, she played a central role in creating several new graduate and research programs dealing with early education theory, child psychology and social policy.         In 1973 she became a Distinguished Research Scholar Emeritus at the college, which is on 112th Street near Broadway and was founded in 1916 as a center for training and research in early childhood education. Strong Self-Images         As a teacher, Dr. Biber believed that the best early education programs develop the emotional life of children as well as their intellects, foster strong self-images, encourage responsibility to others, and support imagination and curiosity.         Toward that end, Dr. Biber, along with her colleagues at the college, helped to establish teacher workshops in New York City public schools in the 1940's and 50's.         In the 1960's she directed a study of schools and mental health with a $1 million grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health. At the end of that decade, she began devising the basic principles for federally financed day care and Head Start programs.         At the age of 80, she completed "Early Education and Psychological Development" (Yale University Press, 1984). She also was co-author of two books reporting major research studies: "Child Life in School" (1942) and "The Pyschological Impact of School Experience" (1969).         Dr. Biber, who was born in Brooklyn, first attended Barnard College and then graduated from the University of Chicago. She received a Ph.D. in psychology in 1942 from Columbia University.         In 1929, Dr. Biber was married to Dr. Oscar Bodansky, chief of clinical biochemistry at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He died in 1977.         She is survived by a daughter, Margery B. Franklin of Manhattan; two grandsons, Kenneth and David Frankin, and a sister, Lilian Uviller Pilat.       
         Jean Eckart, who designed sets with her husband, William, for many Broadway shows, including "Fiorello!" and "Damn Yankees," died on Monday at her home in Dallas. She was 72.         The cause was lung cancer, her husband said.         Throughout the 50's and 60's, the Eckarts established themselves as among the most versatile and productive theatrical designers in the business, often working on costumes and lighting as well as sets. They were associated especially with musicals, including "The Golden Apple," "Li'l Abner," "She Loves Me" and "Mame," and received a Donaldson Award and two Tony nominations.         They also did design work for television, notably for the 1957 CBS broadcast of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella." In 1959, they were co-producers, as well as the designers, of "Once Upon a Mattress," which starred Carol Burnett. Their film work included "Damn Yankees," "The Pajama Game" and "The Night They Raided Minsky's." The Goal: 'Light and Airy'         "We tried to do things that were light and airy and that suited the character of each show," Mr. Eckart said yesterday. "In some ways, we were more interested in the movement of the scenery, and how that contributed to the show." In a review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson described the Eckarts' work in "Once Upon a Mattress" as "effortless and cheerful -- a shining fairy-story production designed out of affection and good humor."         Mrs. Eckart, whose maiden name was Jean Levy, was born in Chicago on Aug. 18, 1921. She met her future husband, whom she married in 1943, when they were both students in New Orleans, and they attended the Yale School of Drama together. In 1971, the Eckarts moved to Dallas to teach at Southern Methodist University, while continuing to take on occasional free-lance design projects.         Mrs. Eckart received a master's degree in social work from the University of Texas and co-founded the Community Psychotherapy Center, a nonprofit institution in Dallas.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her brother, Edwin Levy of Topeka, Kans.; a half-sister, Linda Levy of Boulder, Colo.; a son, Peter, of San Francisco; a daughter, Julie Johnson of Norwalk, Conn., and a grandson, Travis Johnson, also of Norwalk.       
         Reizl Bozyk, an actress who received top billing in the Yiddish theater for more than 60 years, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital Medical Center. She was 79 and lived on the Lower East Side.         Mrs. Bozyk was an enduring star of the Yiddish stage here and earlier in Poland and Argentina, appearing in hundreds of productions, often as a comedian and later as the familar mother or mother-in-law character who often stole the show.         In 1988 she played her first English-language role, appearing as the grandmother in Joan Micklin Silver's film "Crossing Delancey." It was her biggest success outside the Yiddish theater, and it came when she was 74. For it, she drew from the dozens of similar roles she had played on the Yiddish stage to portray a kindly meddler trying to find a husband for her granddaughter (Amy Irving).         Mrs. Bozyk began acting in the Yiddish theater in Poland at the age of 5 or 6, performing first with her parents and then with Max Bozyk, the Yiddish actor whom she later married. He died in 1970 after a performance at Town Hall. Inseparable for Three Decades         The Bozyks fled from the Nazis in 1939, traveling first to Argentina and in 1941 to New York City. For three decades, they were inseparable on the Yiddish stage here, starring in one play or revue after another.         In an interview when "Crossing Delancey" opened, Mrs. Bozyk said that her 37 years with her husband had been like 74 because they'd spent their entire days and nights together.         "After the concert in Town Hall, right there, he said he didn't feel well," she said. "I took him in my arms and he died. I would like to go the way he did."         In 1989 she played her first stage role in English, appearing in the comedy "Social Security" at the Forum Theater in Metuchen, N.J. A year later she recreated her "Crossing Delancey" role on stage.         Mrs. Bozyk is survived by her daughter, Suzanne Armetta of Parlin, N.J.; four grandsons, and a great-grandson.         A funeral service will be held at noon on Tuesday at the Riverside Chapel on Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street in Manhattan.       
         Tamara Dembo, a psychologist who developed a method to study anger in social situations, died on Sunday at Memorial Hospital in Worcester, Mass. She was 91 and lived in Worcester.         Professor Dembo, who had taught at Clark University in Worcester, did important early work in Gestalt psychology in the United States, particularly in rehabilitation psychology. She developed a method to provoke anger in the subjects of experiments and developed a theory, in keeping with the Gestalt school, that the onset of anger depends more on situations than personality.         She was head of Clark University's Rehabilitation Psychology Training Program from 1962 to 1972 and was one of two recipients of the first research awards from the Division of Rehabilitation Counseling of the American Personnel and Guidance Association. Her research, which focused on problems in returning to a normal life after the loss of limbs or disfigurement, was applied after World War II to help injured veterans. At Clark, she also directed research with children suffering from cerebral palsy. Native of Russia         Professor Dembo was born in Baku, Russia, and grew up in St. Petersburg. She earned her doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1930 and emigrated to the United States before World War II to do research at Smith College, which she continued at Cornell University, the University of Iowa, Mount Holyoke College and Stanford University.         In 1948, she became an associate professor at the New School for Social Research in New York and then a research fellow at Harvard University in 1951. She joined the faculty at Clark University in 1953.         Professor Dembo, who lived on the Clark University campus, retired from active teaching in 1972 and was made a professor emeritus.       
         Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress and philanthropist whose bittersweet life was woven of luxury, disputes and interludes of deep unhappiness, died yesterday at her house in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80 and had her main residence in Somerset County, N.J. She also had homes on Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, in Newport, R.I., and Hawaii.         The cause was progressive pulmonary edema resulting in cardiac arrest, said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Bernard Lafferty, a friend and adviser to Miss Duke who was with her at her death.         Her manifold interests as a philanthropist ranged from animal rights to AIDS, historical preservation to orchids. By some accounts she was an astute manager of her assets, and a person familiar with her affairs said that she had left nearly all her estate of more than $1 billion to charity.         Late one evening in Rome in 1945, Miss Duke, who was then 33 years old, told a friend that her vast fortune was in some ways a barrier to happiness.         "All that money is a problem sometimes," Miss Duke told her companion, a young American journalist, over a glass of wine at the Hassler Hotel. "It happens every time. After I've gone out with a man a few times, he starts to tell me how much he loves me. But how can I know if he really means it? How can I ever be sure?" An Inheritance With a Double Edge         At that stage of her life, Miss Duke, then between marriages and working as a foreign correspondent based in Rome, was known and liked by other American expatriates for her friendly, unassuming ways, her warmth, and her love of jazz and ballroom dancing. But her words that night showed that her life had been profoundly affected, even scarred, by her wealth.         Miss Duke was not only rich; she was also thought for years to be the richest woman in the world. And she had that reputation during the Depression, when her wealth stood out in especially stark contrast to widespread poverty and suffering. As a result, she was always a celebrity, and one who literally stood out, standing six feet one inch tall.         Her millions, and the elegant life they made possible, seemed to be of great importance to her two husbands, James H. R. Cromwell, an American sportsman and advertising man, and Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican playboy and diplomat. She divorced them both.         The Duke millions also attracted cranks and photographers and ordinary curious people, and to avoid them Miss Duke lived a partly secluded life in her later years. In recent years, she traveled extensively and spent much time in Somerville, Newport, Hawaii and Beverly Hills. A Generous Giver With Many Interests         Her many philanthropic activities included paying for the restoration of numerous old buildings in Newport. She also established the Duke Gardens Foundation at Somerville in 1958. The Duke Gardens' trellised greenhouses, open to the public part of each year, contain French, English, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Islamic gardens and a collection of rare orchids.         As a philanthropist, Miss Duke was also active in support of environmental causes and animal rights. This year she contributed $2 million for AIDS research at Duke University in Durham, N.C., which was named for her family, and $1 million to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.         In addition, she was the president of the Doris Duke Foundation, based in Somerville, whose areas of interest have ranged from social and health services to cultural programs. The foundation reported $775,000 in charitable contributions in the 1992 fiscal year.         The president of Duke University, Nannerl O. Keohane, said yesterday, in a statement released by the university, that Miss Duke's "recent gift in support of AIDS research at Duke is but one of many programs here that she supported, from our Primate Center to other programs across the campus." She added: "Many of her gifts were made anonymously."         A spokesman for the university, John F. Burness, declined to say what, if anything, it might receive from Miss Duke's estate.         In an act of personal generosity in 1988 that involved an old friend, Miss Duke posted $5 million bail for Imelda Marcos, the wife of the former Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos, who died in 1989. Mrs. Marcos had been indicted in New York on Federal racketeering charges.         At various times, Miss Duke's millions, and the publicity they generated, also helped to draw her into lawsuits and disputes, including tax litigation in New Jersey, the site of her 2,700-acre estate, Duke Farms. In 1964, she took legal action in Hawaii to obtain a court order forbidding a jazz musician, Joseph Castro, from maintaining, as had been rumored, that he was her husband. A Bomber for Travel And Clean Kitchens         Her fortune also made possible many pleasures, large and small. She once bought a B-25 bomber and had it refurbished for luxury travel. She had her Hawaii house fixed up with ceiling-high goldfish tanks.         She entertained gracefully there and at her various other residences and tried to put shy guests at their ease. As a hostess, she was calm, quiet and a little shy herself, friends said, although she was sometimes angered by sloppiness in the kitchen, as in other realms.         Miss Duke liked fine porcelain and jewels and enjoyed building her jewelry collection, which included notable Indian pieces and heirlooms from her mother. She liked to bake, and friends said her whole-wheat bread was delicious. She enjoyed relaxing, now and then, with a glass of white wine or a spot of Champagne.         Nonetheless, Miss Duke seemed to experience more than her share of unhappiness. Beyond the two divorces, there was the death of her father, the multimillionaire James Buchanan Duke, in 1925, when she was 12 years old. In July 1940, her premature daughter, her only child, died in a Honolulu hospital after only 24 hours of life.         And in 1966 there was the accidental death of Eduardo Tirella, an interior decorator who was a close friend, when the car she was driving slammed him against a gate on Rough Point, the Newport estate. Fenced with barbed wire and guarded, Rough Point was part of her inheritance from her father, known as Buck, who was president of the American Tobacco Company and had other extensive business interests. A Father's Fortune And a Young Heir         What made Miss Duke so enormously rich was the fact that she was his only child. She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 22, 1912, to his second wife, Nanaline Lee Holt Inman Duke.         Miss Duke, a shy, golden-haired child, had private tutors and for a time attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, where her father had built a three-story, 54-room mansion on the northeast corner of 78th Street and Fifth Avenue. The building now houses the Fine Arts Institute of New York University.         When Mr. Duke died, his total estate was valued at more than $100 million. His daughter's share of the estate was appraised in 1927 at more than $50 million, most of it in trust funds.         As a teen-ager and a young woman, Miss Duke spent much of her time at the 78th Street mansion, to which she sometimes referred jauntily in later years as "the rock pile." She took piano lessons, was tutored in French and Italian, went out to dinner at fashionable restaurants, and frequently went to the theater, although to avoid crowds she did not go to opening nights.         She also acquired a love of travel that was to stay with her through her life.         Miss Duke, who was known to some as Dee-Dee, was guarded by private detectives and sometimes traveled under an assumed name. "It saves trouble," she once said, "and keeps people from paying more attention to me than to anyone else."         Nevertheless, she was continually harassed by cranks, and there was some fear that she might be kidnapped.         Her half-brother, Walker Patterson Inman, who often traveled with her, once said: "Everywhere we go, it's the same. She gets to see a few of the sights, goes out to dinner a few times, and then her identity becomes known and we have to rush off somewhere else. We can't take any chances. When word gets out that she's in town, it's like telling gangsters: 'Here's a lot of money. Come and get it.' "         "But that's not the worst of it," he added. "Mail comes in by the bagful, and every crank in town wants to see her. Every imaginable plea for money comes by mail, to say nothing of threats against her because she's supposed to have so much money."         In hopes of seeing her, reporters gathered outside the 78th Street mansion on the evening of Nov. 21, 1933, but she eluded them and slipped out for a quiet dinner with friends. What made that night newsworthy, it was reported at the time, was that at the stroke of midnight, when she turned 21, she acquired control of one-third of the assets that had been held in trust for her.         Although no precise figures were released, it was estimated that the total value of her inheritance had shrunk by then, because of the financial crash and the Depression, to roughly $30 million. As stipulated in her father's will, Miss Duke acquired control over additional large parts of her inheritance on her 25th and 30th birthdays. Tobacco Queen As Married Woman         Soon after turning 21, Miss Duke began being seen in the company of a dashing, strong-jawed older man. It was James Cromwell, the son and grandson of prominent yachtsmen and the stepson of a partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company.         Mr. Cromwell and Miss Duke had first met in 1929 in Bar Harbor, Me., when she was a long-legged teen-ager and he was already 10 years out of the University of Pennsylvania.         Rumors of an engagement blossomed, were denied, blossomed again. And then, with little advance notice, the couple were married in a civil ceremony on Feb. 13, 1935, in the 78th Street house. The bride was 22, the groom 38. They sailed off on a prolonged honeymoon.         Visiting Agra, the Indian city that is the site of the Taj Mahal, the bride told a a questioner happily, "I'm a married woman now," and remarked that she did not like it when people called her "the world's richest girl" and "the tobacco queen."         "Tobacco queen -- what a name!" she said.         Back in the United States, the Cromwells set up housekeeping in ducal style at Duke Farms, with its 30-room stone manor house, its private movie theater (she loved movies) and 42 miles of private roads. For a change of scene, they built an elegant vacation house on the coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.         As time passed, relations between the Cromwells soured, and after protracted legal wranglings Mrs. Cromwell was granted a divorce in Reno in 1943 on grounds of cruelty. She resumed the use of her maiden name. Later, she testified that Mr. Cromwell had demanded an "endowment" of $7 million in return for the divorce. Learning to Work And Enjoying It         In 1944, Miss Duke went to Egypt to help the United States war effort by working, for $1 a year, for the United Seaman's Service, which operated canteens for American merchant seamen.         "I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something real to help in this war," she said at the time. "This may sound funny, but I honestly believe I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life. I feel I'm doing something worthwhile, earning the right to be friends with a lot of swell, interesting people that I've somehow missed before. I've discovered, I guess, that it's fun to work."         Relishing the overseas life, she went on to Europe, where she wrote dispatches in 1945 and 1946 for International News Service, an American news agency that is now defunct, getting around Rome on a bicycle.         Miss Duke was entertaining an American couple in her Rome apartment one day when a suave and handsome Latin American came to call. He was carrying a guitar, which he was to play while she accompanied him on the piano. It was Porfirio Rubirosa, the high-spirited Dominican society figure.         The harmony beween Mr. Rubirosa and Miss Duke proved so compelling that they were married on Sept. 1, 1947, in a civil ceremony at the Dominican Consulate in Paris, where she had gone to work for Harper's Bazaar magazine. He was 39; she was 34. By some accounts the formalities included the bridegroom's signing a legal document that affirmed the bride's control over her fortune.         They spent their honeymoon at Cap d'Antibes, on the French Riviera, where they swam, sunbathed and went motorboating. Not long afterward, he became the Dominican Republic's Ambassador in Buenos Aires.         Despite his charm, the marriage foundered. Miss Duke obtained a Reno divorce from Rubirosa on Oct. 27, 1948, after charging him with extreme mental cruelty.         As time went on it became clear that Miss Duke preferred to remain single. The life she fashioned for herself was largely centered on her estates, and it involved some frivolity and some high seriousness, along with much unobtrusive travel.         It included both new and old interests. She served as a trustee of Duke University, which her family had built up with donations of many millions, and in her later years she became fascinated by the search for alternative sources of energy. Cultivating Gardens And Saving History         At Duke Farms, she laid out a series of interconnected, glassed-in gardens, totaling thousands of square yards, that were opened to the public in 1964 after much labor by her and her workers.         "Sometimes when we're hanging the flowers I spend 16 hours a day," she once told a friend, adding cheerfully, "I work like a stevedore."         She also had a small museum set up on the New Jersey estate to house her collection of Asian art.         Over the years, Miss Duke and the foundation that bore her name made contributions to many other causes, ranging from the advancement of Russian studies at Princeton University to architectural restoration in Newport. She poured millions into the Preservation Society of Newport County, whose mission was to reclaim the city's rundown 18th-century buildings.         The project was welcomed by many Newporters because, among other reasons, it enhanced property values. They were careful to respect Miss Duke's desire for quiet and privacy, and some came to refer to her, almost reverentially, as "the lady."         In 1988, when she was 75, Miss Duke adopted Charlene Gail Heffner, then 35, a former adherent of the Hare Krishna religious group. But by February 1991, Ms. Heffner, known as Chandi, had become persona non grata at Miss Duke's residences, according to an unauthorized biography of Miss Duke, "The Richest Girl in the World" (Putnam, 1992), by Stephanie Mansfield. The author wrote that Miss Duke told a friend later that adopting Ms. Heffner had been "the greatest mistake I ever made."         Later, Ms. Heffner sued Miss Duke for breach of contract. This month, a New Jersey judge ruled against lawyers for Miss Duke, who had sought to have the suit dismissed.         Miss Heffner survives, as does Miss Duke's nephew, Walker Inman Jr. of Georgetown, S.C., and several cousins.       
         Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.         The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.         In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet. From Old West to Fall River         In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.         A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.         She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.         Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.         Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."         But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."         Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.         "The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."         Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.  She Felt Destined To Be an Artist         Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.         Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.         After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.         Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.         Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.  Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's         After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.         She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.         She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.         Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.  Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'         Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.         "Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.         "Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.         Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.  Created 'People And Not Automata'         Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."         Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."         Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.         Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.         Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."  Her Final Work Dealt With Death         In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.         Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.         Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.         Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."         Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.         Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.       
         Jane G. Judge, who spent five decades as a social worker, educator and child advocate, died on Wednesday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 91.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         For many years Mrs. Judge was associated with Sarah Lawrence College, where she was professor emeritus of childhood development, and the Community Service Society of New York. A vivacious woman who cared passionately about her causes, she came to the Community Service Society in 1932 and worked there into the 1950's, finally as a consultant on its child-care program.         From the 1930's until 1947, she ran the society's district office in Harlem. Appalled that the office was staffed entirely by white social workers trying to serve a mostly black community, she convinced the board of the need to bring in trained black workers.         She first came to Sarah Lawrence in 1937, teaching part time at the invitation of Constance Warren, then college president. She retired as a professor in 1971 but remained a consultant and director of its early-childhood center for five more years. Over the years, she also taught at Columbia and New York Universities.         Born Jane Griswold in Madison, Wis., she was a 1924 graduate of Smith College and held a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work, now part of Columbia University.         She collaborated with Dr. Benjamin Spock to develop treatment centers for children in Westchester, which did not exist in the 1940's, and to organize the Mental Health Association of Westchester. When the Federal Government set up the Headstart program for pre-schoolers, she served as a consultant.         Her husband, John S. Judge, died in 1973. Mrs. Judge is survived by a daughter, Jennifer Judge Howes of Great Neck, L.I.; a son, Jeremy of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Joan Weidemann Harris, a retired Brooklyn community worker and former board member and executive director of the Y.W.C.A. of Brooklyn, died on Thursday at her home in Warren, Conn. She was 63 and also lived in Brooklyn Heights.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         Mrs. Harris was a graduate of Mount Holyoke College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work. Over the years, she worked at the Maimonides Community Mental Health Center, the Mayor's Office for the Aging, community groups assisting the elderly and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. In the 1980's she worked at the Private Industry Council.         During her years in Brooklyn she was active on community boards, including those of the Colony South Brooklyn Houses, the Brooklyn Heights Association and the Brooklyn Teen-age Pregnancy Network.         Mrs. Harris is survived by her husand of 40 years, James T.; a daughter, Karen H. Weidemann of Korsor, Denmark; a son, Christopher T. of Medford, Mass., and a grandson.       
         Uki Heineman, a retired importer who was active in liberal causes, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was scleroderma, her family said.         She was a native of Indiana. She and her husband, Frank Heineman, founded the Manhattan importing firm of Menswear International in 1957. It became one of the early American traders doing business with the People's Republic of China. They sold it 20 years ago.         Mrs. Heineman was a board member of the National Coalition Against Censorship and was a member of the President's Council at the New School for Social Research. She also was an active supporter of the Center for Constitutional Rights.         Mr. Heineman died in 1981. Mrs. Heineman is survived by three daughters, Helen Heineman Haje and Laurie Heineman Millican, both of Manhattan, and Carol Heineman Staley of Fort Collins, Colo.; a sister, Della Mickoll Podell of Milwaukee, and four grandchildren.
