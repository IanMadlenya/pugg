         Mae Questel, a rubber-voiced veteran of stage, screen and vaudeville who played Woody Allen's mother in ''New York Stories'' and was the cartoon voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Ms. Questel was 17 and living in the South Bronx when she won a local contest to find the girl who most resembled Helen Kane, a popular singer known as the boop-oop-a-doop queen. Ms. Questel was signed by an agent that night and soon was performing on the vaudeville circuit, including numerous stints at the Palace Theater.         She appeared in acts alongside many other performers and also as a ''single,'' using her flexible vocal cords to sing and do imitations of Maurice Chevalier, Fanny Brice, Rudy Vallee and Marlene Dietrich.         When the animator Max Fleischer heard Ms. Questel doing her boop-oop-a-doop routine in 1931, he signed her to take over the cartoon voice of Betty Boop in more than 150 animated shorts, until Fleischer retired the character in 1939. Her recording of ''On the Good Ship Lollipop,'' in Betty Boop's voice, sold more than two million copies in the 1930's.         In 1933, she created the voices of Olive Oyl and Sweet Pea for the ''Popeye'' cartoons, and played Popeye's scrawny paramour in more than 450 cartoons until they went out of production in 1967. She once told an interviewer that her Olive Oyl voice was an attempt to imitate the actress ZaSu Pitts. At various times, she also provided the voices for Little Audrey, Casper the Friendly Ghost and other cartoon characters.         Among her many Broadway credits were ''Dr. Social'' in 1948, ''A Majority of One'' in 1959 and ''Enter Laughing'' in 1963. She also appeared in the film version of ''A Majority of One'' in 1962, ''Funny Girl'' in 1968 and ''New York Stories'' in 1989. On the soundtrack of Mr. Allen's ''Zelig'' (1983) she sang the Betty Boop theme song, ''Chameleon Days.''         She is survived by a son, Richard Balkin of upstate New York, and three granddaughters.         In 1963 Ms. Questel was asked to give her philosophy for survival. ''Don't make a megillah out of every little thing,'' she said.         Correction:  January 16, 1998, Friday  A picture caption on Jan. 8 with an obituary of the actress who was the cartoon voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl misspelled her surname. She was Mae Questel, as the article  said, not Questal.       
         Leonie Rysanek, the Austrian dramatic soprano whose illustrious international career spanned nearly 40 years, died on Saturday at a hospital in Vienna, the city of her birth, where she lived all her life. She was 71.         She had been battling bone cancer, according to Peter S. Diggins, an artists' representative in New York and a longtime friend.         It was during Ms. Rysanek's final performances at the Metropolitan Opera in late 1995 and early 1996 in a new production of Tchaikovsky's ''Pique Dame'' that she received confirmation of her cancer diagnosis. But she told few people about it.         The scope of Ms. Rysanek's career was remarkable: she sang with the conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler during his final years in the early 1950's, and with the tenor Jussi Bjoerling in his prime. Yet she was still singing ardently in the early 1990's. She possessed a gleaming, refulgent soprano voice with an especially powerful top and a rich middle range, ideal for roles like Wagner's Sieglinde and Senta, Strauss's Chrysothemis, and Beethoven's Leonora.         Her full-voiced high notes could slice through the thickness of any Strauss orchestra. In her early days, her low voice was often criticized as patchy. But as she matured, her sound darkened and deepened, and she successfully took on lower-set roles like Wagner's Kundry in ''Parsifal.''         Ms. Rysanek's work was equally prized for its dramatic and musical intensity. Speaking of Ms. Rysanek at the time of her Met farewell, the conductor James Levine, a frequent colleague, said such longevity was striking for a singer of her fervor.         ''She had a fire burning in her at all times,'' Mr. Levine said. ''It's remarkable for someone to combine such intensity with a voice of such resiliency and range,'' he added. ''Somehow there is a very womanly, soft-textured quality in Leonie's singing, even in its most forceful moments.''         Her approach to singing was not classically beautiful. Reporting on her 25th-anniversary Met gala in 1984, when she sang Kundry in Act II of ''Parsifal'' and Sieglinde in Act I of ''Walkure'' in a concert with Mr. Levine conducting, The New York Times critic John Rockwell wrote that Ms. Rysanek ''has never been a singer who stresses an even vocal line and abstract bel-canto virtues. She is an Expressionistic actress, given to splintering significant words under the stress of emotion and to wrenching her body and chopping her arms in a way that inevitably distorts her singing. But the result, a few mannerisms aside, is not the disruption of the music but the enhancement of the drama.''         Ms. Rysanek credited her longevity to careful pacing; even at the height of her career, she never sang more than 45 or so performances a year. But, in an interview with The Times on the occasion of her Met farewell, she also cited her ability to say no to the most taxing roles. And, in a way, she explained, the presence of her colleague Birgit Nilsson as the reigning dramatic soprano of her day, fortified her own resolve.         ''Yes, I was asked to sing Brunnhilde,'' she said. ''But there was always Birgit, wonderful Birgit, next to me. She was my Brunnhilde, my Elektra. She was so wonderful in these parts. . . . Even Birgit asked, 'Why don't you sing Turandot?' I said, 'Because of you.' Maybe's it's Birgit who saved my voice.''         Ms. Rysanek was born in Vienna on Nov. 14, 1926, one of six children of a Czech father, a stonecutter, later a chauffeur, and an Austrian mother. As a adolescent during the war years, Ms. Rysanek had to work in a munitions factory. She aspired to be an actress. But her oldest brother, who had a pleasant baritone voice, encouraged her to take her singing seriously. She entered the Vienna Academy at 16, where she studied with Alfred Jerger, and later, Rudolf Grossmann, a baritone who became her first husband. They couple later divorced.         Her professional debut was at Innsbruck in 1949 as Agathe in Weber's ''Der Freischutz.'' But international acclaim came in 1951, when she sang Sieglinde in the first postwar production at Bayreuth, Germany, of Wagner's ''Ring.'' Her American debut was in 1956 with the San Francisco Opera as Senta.         A long association with the Met began in 1959, unexpectedly. She was scheduled to make her debut that season in late February as Aida. But when Maria Callas, who had been scheduled to sing Verdi's Lady Macbeth in the Met's first production of the opera, was fired by the general manager Rudolf Bing during a bitter contractual dispute, Bing asked Ms. Rysanek to take over the role. Leonard Warren was Macbeth; Erich Leinsdorf was the conductor; the night was Feb. 5, and the audience had been expecting Callas.         ''I was hesitant to debut in a production made for Callas,'' Ms. Rysanek said during an 1996 interview in The Times. ''I already had a major success in Europe. But in New York, the attitude was: 'Who are you? Who knows you? How dare you?' ''         When she made her first entrance, someone shouted, ''Brava, Callas!'' Ms. Rysanek was not rattled. ''I said to myself, 'If he is against me, I will show him my high C's.' So I sat on that high C, which is incorrect.'' Her performance was a triumph.         The next season, in 1960, singing Senta in Wagner's ''Fliegende Hollander,'' Ms. Rysanek solidified her claim on Met audiences. The Dutchman was George London. At the end of Act II, the reception was rapturous; a large contingent of fans kept applauding through the intermission, until the conductor Thomas Schippers returned to the pit to begin Act III.         By the late 1960's, she was giving most of her services to her two favorite companies: the Vienna State Opera, where she sang a total of 532 performances, and the Met, where during 37 years she sang 299 performances of 24 roles.         At the Vienna State Opera in 1977, and later at the Met, in one of her most renowned portrayals, Ms. Rysanek sang the Empress in Strauss's operatic fable ''Die Frau Ohne Schatten,'' with Ms. Nilsson as a dyer's wife. This work had been considered muddled and musically cumbersome until these powerful soprano champions sang it. A pirated recording of their Vienna performance, conducted by Karl Bohm, circulated among collectors until Deutsche Grammophon released it commercially in 1985. It is one of the most treasured of Ms. Rysanek's many recordings.         After her 25th-anniversary gala at the Met, Ms. Rysanek returned almost every season, singing a particularly memorable Kundry in 1985 to the great Parsifal of the tenor Jon Vickers. In 1992, at 66, she gave a searing performance in Janacek's ''Jenufa'' as Kostelnicka, a Moravian villager so ashamed of her stepdaughter's out-of-wedlock son that she drowns the infant in a stream.         Ms. Rysanek is survived by her husband of nearly 30 years, Ernst-Ludwig Gausmann, a former journalist; a stepson, Marcus Gausmann; a brother, Kurt, and sister, Lotte Rysanek, who was a lyric soprano with the Vienna State Opera.         The role of Ms. Rysanek's Met farewell, when she was 69, was the old countess in ''Pique Dame,'' which is ''vocally almost nothing,'' she conceded at the time. But dramatically, her portrayal dominated Elijah Moshinsky's haunting production. Even after the character's death, Ms. Rysanek's ghostly countess was a riveting presence. Her ovation lasted for 40 minutes.       
         Laurie Beechman, the throbbing-voiced singer and actress who played Grizabella in the Broadway musical ''Cats'' for more than five years, died on Sunday at her home in White Plains, N.Y. She was 44.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, said her agent and friend, Jim Wilhelm.         An emotive belter in the tradition of Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand, both of whom were her girlhood idols, Ms. Beechman brought a waifish pathos and a piercing vocal power to her character's signature song, ''Memory.''         Whether on Broadway, on a concert stage or in a cabaret, Ms. Beechman conveyed a strong involvement with her material, delivering the climaxes of big ballads with a full-throated, sobbing intensity.         Ms. Beechman was born in Philadelphia, attended New York University and made her Broadway debut in 1977 in the ensemble of ''Annie.''         Venturing into the pop arena, she  made an album, ''Laurie and the Sighs'' (Atlantic), that presented her as a rock belter in the mode of Pat Benatar. When the album sold poorly, she decided to stick to the worlds of theater and cabaret and returned to Broadway as the narrator in ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'' Her performance in that show won her Tony and Drama Desk nominations for best featured actress in a musical.         In 1983 she took the role of Grizabella in the national touring company of ''Cats'' with the proviso that she step into the part on Broadway when Betty Buckley departed. The chance came four months later.         In the late 1980's and 90's, Ms. Beechman became a cabaret and concert performer who often blended popular standards and theater songs with light rock-and-roll. She also recorded four more albums.         Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 1989. Despite her illness, she joined the national touring company of ''Les Miserables'' in the role of Fantine, performing in the touring production of ''The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Sunset Edition,'' and singing ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' at President Clinton's 1997 inaugural gala. Last spring she rejoined ''Cats'' in time to be playing Grizabella when the show surpassed ''A Chorus Line'' as Broadway's longest-running hit.         She is survived by her husband, Neil Mazzella; her parents, Dr. Nathan and Dolly Beechman Schnall of Philadelphia, and two sisters, Jane Segal and Claudia Cohen, both of Philadelphia. A funeral will be held tomorrow at 11 A.M. at J.  Levine and Sons Memorial Chapel, 7112 North Broad Street, Philadelphia.         Ms. Beechman became an advocate and role model for people with cancer. ''The perception people have of cancer,'' she told The New York Times, ''is that you're cured or you die, and that's not necessarily how it works. It can be more like diabetes, a part of life.''       
         Kasey Cisyk, an opera-trained singer who never made it to the Met but whose haunting coloratura soprano became one of the world's most listened-to voices, died on March 29 at her home in Manhattan. She was 44 and had been the singing voice of the long-running ''Have You Driven a Ford Lately?'' advertising campaign.         Her family said the cause was breast cancer.         In the capricious world of show business, she never enjoyed splashy success, but in the backwaters of her profession, where most singers, after all, spend their entire careers, Miss Cisyk, a tiny, slender woman with a smile as big as her heart, made her share of waves.         She worked as a backup singer for Carly Simon and Quincy Jones; she dubbed the Oscar-winning title song for the 1977 movie ''You Light Up My Life,'' and in the demanding world of commercial jingles, she was a star, one whose very anonymity was a critical asset.         It allowed her, for example, to amass a list of credits that included such archrivals as ABC, NBC and CBS; McDonald's and Burger King, American and Delta airlines and even Coke and Pepsi.         And for all her long run with Ford, Miss Cisyk also sang in the service of Chevrolet, Cadillac and Toyota.         It was her work for Ford that made her the envy of her colleagues. From the time she became the voice of Ford in 1981 until the campaign was finally retired two months ago, hers was the most ubiquitous voice in the land. In 1989, when the campaign was nearing the midpoint of its 17-year run, an industry record for a corporate soloist, Ford executives estimated that Miss Cisyk had been heard by a cumulative audience of 20 billion.         Maybe not what she had in mind when she was studying opera at the Mannes College of Music in Manhattan, but not at all bad for a Queens-born daughter of a Ukrainian virtuoso who wanted her to play the violin.         Miss Cisyk, whose father maintained a studio on the Lower East Side, learned the instrument when she was 5 (she also studied ballet), and after graduating from the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, she dutifully accepted a violin scholarship to Mannes.         By the time she graduated she had switched to classical voice training, won encouraging praise for roles in student opera productions, and sung  ''Rigoletto'' in Ghent on a New York State scholarship in Belgium.         For all her promise, Miss Cisyk, whose father died when she was 17, was drawn away from opera and into the world of jingles by the pressing need to make a living.         She found work singing in clubs in New York, but for a while in the mid-70's she despaired of breaking into the tight-knit world of commercials. For months after she had circulated tapes to advertising agencies she heard nothing.         Then the executives got around to listening to the tapes, and the calls started coming in, slowly at first, but after six months of sporadic work, an entire industry seemed to make the simultaneous discovery that her voice was money in the bank.         Suddenly she was in such demand that a typical day, she later recalled, would begin with a 9 A.M. session for Trans World Airlines, followed by Coca-Cola at 11, Hartz Mountain at 1 P.M., Eastern Airlines at 2, Datsun at 3, L'Eggs at 5, McDonald's at 6, and, after all that, a recording session from 8:30 P.M. to 3 A.M.         By the time Ford came calling in 1981, she had learned to pace herself.         After an early marriage and divorce, she married Edward J. Rakowicz, a recording engineer, had a son, Edward W., now 7, and became as devoted a mother as she had been a dedicated singer.         But even after her cancer was diagnosed in 1992 and she began the long, painful ordeal of therapy, Miss Cisyk, who is also survived by her older sister, Maria, a concert pianist and teacher who lives in Ridgefield, Conn., continued to work, singing her last professional jingle just a few months ago.         She may never have made it to the Met or even had a popular hit record in the United States, but she was not a complete unknown in the world of music.         Miss Cisyk, whose given name was Kvita (Ukrainian for flower), adopted the professional name Kasey from her initials, intending to reserve Kvita for an opera career that never happened. She eventually found a use for it after all.         A woman who cherished her Ukrainian heritage, Miss Cisyk formed her own production company in 1988 and recorded two C.D.'s, one  (''Kvita'') of Ukrainian folk songs, the other (''Kvita Two Colors'') of Ukrainian love songs.         Both have been wildly popular among the 100 million far-flung Ukrainian expatriates and in Ukraine, where the woman who worked in the backwaters of American show business was regarded as a leading performer and is very much a household name.       
         Rose Maddox, a singer who was a leading figure in the West Coast country music of the 1940's, died on Wednesday at the Linda Vista rest home in Ashland, Ore., said Jonny Whiteside, her biographer. She was 72 and died of kidney failure.         Ms. Maddox, with her five brothers -- Henry, Cliff, Fred, Don and Cal -- were the Maddox Brothers and Rose. With the occasional augmentation of other musicians they became a popular radio and live act up and down the West Coast beginning in the early 1940's; they continued as a band until 1957, after which Ms. Rose recorded as a solo artist for Columbia, Capitol, Starday and Arhoolie records, among others.         The Maddoxes were a typically hard-bitten Depression-era dust bowl family. As Mr. Whiteside tells the story in his book, ''Ramblin' Rose,'' Ms. Maddox, whose original given name was Roselea, and five of her siblings were taken by their parents in 1933 from Big Wills Valley, Ala., where they were sharecroppers, to Glendale, Calif., in a harrowing 2,000-mile trip, hitching rides and jumping boxcars.         She was 12 when the band, managed by their mother, Lula Maddox, began its career, performing over KTRB, in Modesto, Calif., and at local rodeos and fairs. Influenced by singers like Jimmie Rodgers and Emmett Miller, as well as the early music of the Carter Family and the Sons of the Pioneers, they played a raucous, uptempo, eight-to-the-bar music later called ''hillbilly boogie,'' and not too far away in its energy and speed from rockabilly.         Driven by hunger and a hectoring stage mother to entertain at all costs, they whooped, laughed, joked and yelled their way through performances. In Susanville, Calif., they met Woody Guthrie and his cousin Jack, who were also making a living singing in the area; two of the Guthries' songs, ''The Philadelphia Lawyer'' and ''If You Ain't Got the Do-Re-Mi,'' became regular parts of the Maddoxes' repertory. Guthrie returned the favor, calling them ''the best hill country string band in these 48 states of ours'' in a professional endorsement in 1949. ''Even when they perform a downright badly written song,'' he added, ''it soundeth good to the soul.''         World War II broke up the band for some years. During that time Ms. Maddox married and had a son. By  1946 the band was back together, electrifying their instruments as well as their wardrobe, hiring the Hollywood tailor Nathan Turk to dress them in an outrageous version of the singing-cowboy style: spangles, embroidered satin shirts, bell-bottom pants, short Eisenhower jackets and personalized cowboy boots. They were billed as ''The Most Colorful Hillbilly Band in America.'' ''Their costumes,'' said Tennessee Ernie Ford, ''made Liberace look like a plucked chicken.''         By this time their musicianship was much more solid, and they eventually graduated to broadcasting over XERB, a border station from Rosarita Beach, Mexico, whose signal blanketed the entire western half of the United States. They recorded nearly a hundred songs for 4 Star records, most of them frenzied explosions shot through with wild comedy, and the occasional ballad or spiritual.         In 1951 the band moved to Hollywood and signed with Columbia Records. After the group split up in 1956, Ms. Maddox moved to Oregon with two of her brothers and her mother. She found greater success in her solo career; Cashbox magazine named her Top Female Country Vocalist of 1963. And she exerted a great influence on the group of musicians who created the ''Bakersfield sound'' in the late 1950's, including Buck Owens, Tommy Collins and Merle Haggard.         Ms. Maddox, along with Texas Ruby, was one of the first women to sing honky-tonk music in the 1940's, in indelicate, hard-driving songs like ''Hangover Blues'' and ''Move It on Over.'' As a forthright presence with a strong, rough voice, she inspired singers like Jean Shepherd, Dolly Parton and Janis Joplin.         As Arhoolie and Columbia reissued the best material by the Maddoxes in the 1980's, her reputation grew as an important early figure in honky-tonk music; in 1994, her album ''$35 and a Dream'' was nominated for a Grammy. Despite continuing health problems since the 1960's -- stomach ulcers, several heart attacks and kidney trouble -- she performed up until the summer of 1997.         She is survived by her brother, Don, of Ashland, and three grandchildren.       
         Linda Eastman McCartney, the wife of the former Beatle Paul McCartney and a photographer whose portraits of 1960's rock stars have become classics, died on Friday in Santa Barbara, Calif., where the McCartneys were vacationing. She was 56.         The cause was breast cancer that spread to her liver, said Geoff Baker, a family spokesman.         Besides her work as a photographer, Ms. McCartney performed as a keyboardist and backup singer in two of her husband's post-Beatles bands, Wings and the unnamed ensemble that toured in 1989 and 1993. She was a staunch campaigner for animal rights and vegetarianism and, starting in the late 1980's, she turned her passion for vegetarian cooking into an industry. She published two cookbooks, ''Linda McCartney's Home Cooking'' in 1989 and ''Linda's Kitchen'' in 1996, and in 1991 started a line of frozen vegetarian dinners.         As the wife of a musician who had long been a teen-age heartthrob and was the last Beatle to be married,  Ms. McCartney first attracted the ire of her husband's fans, and eventually the respect of many of them. When the McCartneys were married in London on March 12, 1969, hundreds of crying girls packed the sidewalk outside the Marylebone Register Office. Later, when she toured with Mr. McCartney, she took considerable criticism for her modest keyboard and vocal technique.         But the McCartneys' 29-year marriage was uncommonly steady by the standards of the celebrity world of which they were a part but from which they generally remained aloof, spending most of their time on a farm in West Sussex, England. They  never spent a night apart, except for the 10 days Mr. McCartney spent in a Tokyo jail after he was arrested for marijuana possession; indeed, their disinclination to be separated was part of Mr. McCartney's reason for having his wife in his touring band.         And Mr. McCartney, the composer of some of the rock era's most beautiful love songs, has consistently told interviewers that all his romantic  ballads written after 1968 were about Linda. Those songs include everything from ''Maybe I'm Amazed'' and ''The Lovely Linda'' on his first post-Beatles album, ''McCartney'' (1970), ''Long-Haired Lady'' on ''Ram'' (1971) and ''My Love'' on ''Red Rose Speedway'' (1973) to more recent songs like ''We Got Married'' and ''Figure of Eight'' on ''Flowers in the Dirt'' (1989) and ''Somedays'' on ''Flaming Pie'' (1997), his most recent studio album.         Mr. McCartney was not the first to compose a song about Ms. McCartney. Her father, Lee Eastman, was a prominent show business lawyer in New York and one of his clients, Jack Lawrence, wrote ''Linda'' for her in 1947 when she was 6. Buddy Clark had a hit with the song that year, and it was later recorded by Perry Como and Jan and Dean.         Ms. McCartney also wrote a few songs, including the reggae-style ''Seaside Woman,'' which she and Mr. McCartney released as a single in 1977 under the name Suzy and the Red Stripes, and ''The White-Coated Man,'' which she wrote with Carla Lane and released (also as Suzy and the Red Stripes) on an animal-rights charity disk, ''Animal Magnetism,'' in 1994.         She was born Linda Louise Eastman on September 24, 1941, and grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. As she often pointed out, without ever dispelling the assertion entirely, she was not related to the Eastmans of the Eastman-Kodak photography empire. In fact, her father had changed his name from Epstein.         She described growing up in artistic and materialistic surroundings, with a status-conscious mother and a father whose friends and clients included the artist Willem de Kooning and the songwriters Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Arlen.         Ms. McCartney attended Sarah Lawrence College and the University of Arizona. While a student in Arizona, she married and had a daughter, but the marriage ended in 1963.         Soon afterward, she took up photography, and in 1965 she returned to New York, where she began photographing rock groups, starting with the Dave Clark Five and the Rolling Stones. During the next few years she befriended and photographed dozens of rock stars, including Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, the Animals, Janis Joplin, the Mamas and the Papas, Bob Dylan, Frank Zappa, the Beach Boys and the Grateful Dead. A widely reproduced picture of the Beatles that she took at a press party for the release of ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' in 1967 captured the group on the eve of its greatest artistic triumph.         Her photographs appeared in Rolling Stone and other rock magazines, and in 1992 she published several hundred of them as a book, ''Linda McCartney's Sixties: Portrait of an Era.''         Ms. McCartney met her future husband while photographing the Beatles in London in 1967, and the pair carried on an occasional romance for more than a year. In September 1968, Mr. McCartney asked her to move to London, from which point they became inseparable. Although she took some stunning pictures of the Beatles at work, she left most of them unpublished until she assembled her ''Sixties'' book. Her photographs of Mr. McCartney, however, adorned some of his post-Beatles album covers, and in one of his early television specials, ''James Paul McCartney,'' he is shown singing a medley of his songs while his wife did a photo shoot.         In addition to Mr. McCartney and the daughter from her first marriage, Heather, Ms. McCartney is survived by three children from her marriage with Mr. McCartney: Mary, Stella and James; and by her brother John, who is now Mr. McCartney's lawyer and business manager, and two sisters, Laura and Louise.         Besides ''Sixties,'' Ms. McCartney published several other books, including ''Linda's Pictures,'' ''Sun Prints,'' ''Photographs'' and ''Road Works.'' Celebrities were by no means her only photographic subject. Plants, animals, natural patterns on rock faces and people she encountered on her travels engaged her interest and were captured with a touching refinement in many of her pictures. Her work has also been the subject of exhibitions at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Royal Photographic Society in Bath, England, and at more than 50 galleries around the world.         Correction:  April 21, 1998, Tuesday  The obituary of the photographer Linda McCartney yesterday gave an incorrect name in some copies for the most recent studio album by her husband, the former Beatle Paul McCartney. It is ''Flaming Pie''; ''Off the Ground'' was the one before that.         Correction:  June 11, 1998, Thursday  The obituary of Linda McCartney on April 20 misstated her college background. She attended only the University of Arizona, not Sarah Lawrence College as well. The obituary also misstated the given name of her first husband in some copies. He was Melvin See, not Bob. The errors were pointed out in E-mail received from a reader yesterday.       
         Tammy Wynette, whose 1968 hit ''Stand By Your Man'' established her as a queen of country music, died yesterday in her sleep at her home in Nashville. She was 55.         Ms. Wynette had a history of health problems. The cause of death  was believed to be a blood clot, said Evelyn Shriver, a spokeswoman for the singer.         In her 25-year career, Ms. Wynette recorded more than 50 albums and sold more than 30 million recordings. ''Stand By Your Man'' made her  synonymous with the role of a long-suffering but determinedly loyal wife, holding the family together even when her husband strayed.         Her voice had a husky center, with melancholy balanced by determination; she sounded like an Everywoman with unexpected reserves of strength and affection. Working with  Billy Sherrill as producer, she also became the standard-bearer of an elaborately orchestrated Nashville sound, with pedal steel guitars underlined by strings and backup choruses.         Ms. Wynette's own life was more turbulent, and less stable, than the lifelong attachments her songs promised.         She was born Wynette Pugh in 1942 in rural Itawumba County, Miss., and was raised by her grandparents on a farm where she picked cotton. She was drawn to music and learned to play guitar before she became a teen-ager, when she joined her mother in Birmingham, Ala.         A month before her high school graduation in 1959, she was married for the first time, to Euple Byrd. She had three daughters with him: Gwen, Jackie and Tina. The couple was divorced in 1965.         In 1963, she had enrolled in beautician's school in Tupelo, Miss. Working by day as a beautician and at night as a singer in clubs, she began appearing on local television and then on Porter Wagoner's syndicated country television show.         In 1966, she moved to Nashville and auditioned for Mr. Sherrill, who signed her to Epic Records. He renamed her Tammy Wynette and recorded some honky-tonk-flavored songs, including the ballad ''Apartment No. Nine'' and the uptempo ''Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad,'' her first Top 10 hit, in 1967. ''I Don't Wanna Play House'' reached No. 1 on the country charts and brought her a Grammy award. She married a second time, to Don Chapel, a singer, but the marriage lasted only a year.         Her three No. 1 hits in 1968 -- ''Stand By Your Man,'' ''Take Me To Your World'' and ''D-I-V-O-R-C-E'' -- established both her public image and her style, concentrating on weepers about holding a marriage together and unending love. ''Stand By Your Man,'' written by Ms. Wynette and Mr. Sherrill, sold more than two million copies.         As the song moved from country radio stations to the pop Top 20, she married George Jones, the country singer who had been her idol. ''Stand By Your Man'' brought her a second Grammy Award as well as recognition from the Country Music Association as female vocalist of the year in 1969 and 1970. She and Mr. Jones had a daughter, Georgette, in 1970.         Through the 1970's, she recorded duets with Mr. Jones, even continuing after they were divorced in 1975; the duo had No. 1 country hits with ''Golden Ring'' and ''Near You.'' In 1976, she married and divorced Michael Tomlin.         Two years later, she married George Richey, with whom she wrote the song '' 'Til I Can Make It on My Own.'' Her autobiography, ''Stand By Your Man,'' was published in 1979.         Her career fluctuated in the 1980's, with Top 10 hits including ''Another Chance'' in 1982 and ''Sometimes When We Touch,'' a duet with Mark Gray, in 1985. She acted in the soap opera ''Capitol'' in 1986, but also spent part of the year at the Betty Ford clinic fighting an addiction to prescription painkillers. She was recognized as a major figure in country music, with younger performers, including Emmylou Harris and Vince Gill, appearing on her albums. Although her hits reached the Top 20 less often, her voice was immediately recognizable. In 1992, she had an unexpected international hit when she sang ''Justified and Ancient'' with the English electronic dance group, the KLF; the song reached No. 1 in 18 countries.         Ms. Wynette became a part of the 1992 Presidential campaign after Hillary Rodham Clinton, stressing that her support of her husband was more than routine, told an interviewer, ''I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.''         Ms. Wynette demanded, and received, an apology. Ms. Wynette said Mrs. Clinton had ''offended every true country music fan'' and every person who has ''made it on their own with no one to take them to a White House.''         Ms. Wynette later performed at a Clinton fund-raiser.         In 1993, Ms. Wynette teamed with Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn to record the album ''Honky-Tonk Angels.'' She was hospitalized in 1994 for stomach problems but returned to touring soon afterward.         Her last album, ''One,'' released in 1996, was a reunion with Mr. Jones.         Ms. Wynette had performed as recently as two weeks ago, and had been preparing for a live performance on May 8 on TNN with Melissa Etheridge and Trisha Yearwood, said Ms. Shriver, her spokeswoman.         She is survived by her husband, George Richey; five daughters, Jackie Daly, Gwen Ignaczak and Tina Jones, all of Nashville, Georgette Smith of Alabama and Deirdre Richardson of Los Angeles; a son, Kelly Richardson of San Francisco,  and seven grandchildren.

         Tammy Wynette, whose 1968 hit ''Stand By Your Man'' established her as a queen of country music, died on Monday in her sleep at her home in Nashville. She was 55.         She recorded more than 50 albums and sold more than 30 million recordings. Ms. Wynette, who had a history of health problems, is believed to have died of a blood clot, said her publicist, Evelyn Shriver.         ''Stand By Your Man'' established Ms. Wynette in the role of a long-suffering but determinedly loyal wife, holding the family together even when her husband strayed. Her voice had a husky center, with melancholy balanced by determination; she sounded like an Everywoman with unexpected reserves of strength and affection. ''I'm not the best singer in the world, just the loudest,'' she once declared.         Working with the producer Billy Sherrill, with whom she wrote her biggest hit, she also became the standard-bearer of an elaborately orchestrated Nashville sound, with pedal steel guitars underlined by strings and backup choruses.         She became the first female country singer to have a million-selling album, and she had 20 No. 1 country hit singles in her career. But her own life was more turbulent, and less stable, than the lifelong attachments her songs promised.         She was born in 1942 in rural Itawamba County, Miss., named Virginia Wynette Pugh, and raised by her grandparents on a farm where she picked cotton. She was drawn to music, and learned to play guitar before her teen-age years, when she joined her mother in Birmingham, Ala.         A month before her high school graduation in 1959, she was married for the first time, to Euple Byrd. She had three daughters with him: Gwen, Jackie and Tina. In 1963, she enrolled in beautician's school in Tupelo, Miss.; she was divorced in 1965. Working by day as a beautician and at night as a singer in clubs, she began appearing on a local television program, the ''Country Boy Eddie Show,'' then on Porter Wagoner's nationally syndicated country television show.         In 1966, she moved to Nashville and auditioned for Mr. Sherrill, who signed her to Epic Records. He renamed her Tammy Wynette and recorded some honky-tonk-flavored songs: the ballad ''Apartment No. Nine'' and the uptempo ''Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad,'' her first Top 10 hit, in 1967. ''I Don't Wanna Play House'' reached No. 1 on the country charts and brought her a Grammy Award.         The three No. 1 hits she had in 1968 -- ''Stand By Your Man,'' ''Take Me to Your World'' and ''D-I-V-O-R-C-E'' -- established both her public image and her style, concentrating on weepers about holding a marriage together or declaring her unending love. ''Stand By Your Man'' sold more than two million copies. In it, she sang: ''Sometimes it's hard to be a woman, giving all your love to just one man. You'll have bad times and he'll have good times doin' things that you don't understand. But if you love him, you'll forgive him even though he's hard to understand. And if you love him, oh be proud of him 'cause after all he's just a man.''         She had married the songwriter Don Chapel in 1967, but the partnership lasted only a year. It ended when Ms. Wynette walked out on her husband to live with George Jones, the revered and, at the time, hard-drinking country singer. According to Mr. Jones's autobiography, ''I Lived to Tell It All'' (1996), he had fallen in love with Ms. Wynette while they were on tour together.         One night, visiting her at home, he walked in while she and her husband were having an argument. After kicking over a dining room table, Mr. Jones declared his love for her, and Ms. Wynette and her three daughters left Mr. Chapel that night. A day later, Mr. Jones and Ms. Wynette flew to Mexico for a quick divorce, only to find out on their return that Tennessee did not recognize Mexican divorces. Mr. Chapel sued Mr. Jones for alienation of affection and Ms. Wynette for divorce. But Mr. Jones's lawyers discovered that Mr. Chapel and Ms. Wynette had married illegally, because she had married too soon after her previous divorce.         As ''Stand By Your Man'' moved from country radio stations to the pop Top 20, Ms. Wynette married Mr. Jones in 1969, and they began billing themselves as ''Mr. and Mrs. Country Music.'' They moved to Lakeland, Fla.         ''Stand By Your Man'' brought Ms. Wynette a second Grammy Award as well as recognition from the Country Music Association; she was named female vocalist of the year in 1969 and 1970. She and Mr. Jones had a daughter, Georgette, in 1970. But the marriage was a troubled one. In her 1979 autobiography, ''Stand By Your Man,'' Ms. Wynette wrote that one night he menaced her with a rifle while in a drunken rage, firing in her direction as she ran from him and then shooting up their Lakeland mansion; his autobiography denies the account. The next morning, he was straitjacketed and hospitalized for 10 days.         From 1971 to 1980, she recorded duets with Mr. Jones. Among them were songs like ''We're Gonna Hold On,'' which appeared amid reports of their marital troubles and rumors of impending divorce. The duo had No. 1 country hits with ''Golden Ring'' and ''Near You.'' But their marriage could not survive Mr. Jones's drinking and the couple's increasingly bitter quarrels. In 1975 they were divorced, although they continued to record duets. Ms. Wynette married Michael Tomlin in 1976, then divorced him after 44 days. Two years later, she married George Richey, with whom she wrote the song '' 'Til I Can Make It on My Own.''         Ms. Wynette's career fluctuated in the 1980's, with Top 10 hits including ''Another Chance'' in 1982 and ''Sometimes When We Touch,'' a duet with Mark Gray, in 1985. She acted in the soap opera ''Capitol'' in 1986. But she also spent part of the year at the Betty Ford Clinic fighting an addiction to prescription painkillers. She was recognized as a major figure in country music, with younger performers including Emmylou Harris and Vince Gill appearing on her albums, but her songs reached the Top 20 less often.         Yet her voice was immediately recognizable. In 1992, she had an unexpected international hit when she sang ''Justified and Ancient'' with the English electronic dance group, the KLF. The song reached No. 1 in 18 countries.         In 1992, her name and best-known song entered the Presidential campaign when Hillary Rodham Clinton, stressing that her defense of her husband against charges of adultery was more than routine, said in a ''60 Minutes'' interview: ''I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.''         Ms. Wynette demanded, and received, an apology, declaring that Mrs. Clinton had ''offended every true country music fan'' and every person who has ''made it on their own with no one to take them to a White House.'' After the apology, Ms. Wynette performed at a Clinton fund-raiser. ''Her trademark style has filled our hearts and made her a legend,'' President Clinton said yesterday.         In 1993, Ms. Wynette made an album, ''Honky-Tonk Angels,'' with Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn. She was hospitalized in 1994 with an infection that left her in critical condition for a week. But she returned to touring and recording soon afterward, including a guest appearance on Elton John's album ''Duets.'' Her last recordings reunited her with Mr. Jones to sing duets on the 1996 album ''One.''         In addition to her husband, George Richey, she is survived by five daughters, Jackie Daly, Gwen Ignaczak and Tina Jones, all of Nashville, Georgette Smith of Alabama and Deirdre Richardson of Los Angeles; a son, Kelly Richardson of San Francisco and seven grandchildren.

         Alice Faye, one of the few movie stars to walk away from stardom at the peak of her career, died yesterday at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was in her mid-80's.         The cause was cancer, according to her publicity company, Jewel Baxter, which said she had had two stomach tumors removed last month.         Ms. Faye's warm, husky contralto and demure sexuality in ''Tin Pan Alley,'' ''Hello, Frisco, Hello'' and ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' made her one of Hollywood's top 10 moneymaking stars in 1938 and 1939. Under contract to 20th Century Fox for a little over a decade, during which she made 32 movies, Ms. Faye walked out in 1945 after Darryl Zanuck, the studio's leader, chopped up her scenes in ''Fallen Angel'' to highlight the performance of a younger Fox star, Linda Darnell.         Ms. Faye handed the keys to her dressing room to the studio gate guard and drove off the lot.         ''When I stopped making pictures,'' she told an interviewer in 1987, ''it didn't bother me because there were so many things I hadn't done. I had never learned to run a house. I didn't know how to cook. I didn't know how to shop. So all these things filled all those gaps.''         It was that attitude of taking life as it came without shaking her fist at fate that informed many of her screen performances. She was the honest, good-hearted girl who stood by her man. And when that man did her wrong, her response was to sing a torch song and love him harder. Off screen she had an unlikely but happy marriage to the brash band leader Phil Harris, whom she married in 1941. Hollywood gossip columnists gave the marriage six months, but it lasted 54 years, until Mr. Harris's death at the age of 91 in 1995. They had lived for many years in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs.         Ms. Faye, whose original name was Alice Leppert, was the daughter of a New York City policeman and grew up in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. Although some books list her birth date as 1912, she insisted she was born in 1915 but had lied about her age when she joined the Chester Hale vaudeville troupe at 13.         After several years in the chorus,  Alice Faye, still a teen-ager, got a job on Broadway in ''George White's Scandals of 1931,'' which starred Ethel Merman, Ray Bolger and Rudy Vallee. She sang ''Mimi'' at a cast party, and Mr. Vallee hired her as a singer on his radio show. When  ''Scandals'' was made into the Fox film ''George White's Scandals of 1934,'' Ms. Faye replaced Lillian Harvey as Mr. Vallee's love interest.  Mr. Vallee's wife sued for divorce, naming Ms. Faye as his love interest off screen as well.         Fox put Ms. Faye under contract and presented her as a brassy imitation Jean Harlow in movies like ''She Learned About Sailors'' and ''King of Burlesque.'' After Mr. Zanuck's 20th Century Films merged with Fox in 1935, the studio softened her image. Jack Kroll of Newsweek once called her ''a luscious marshmallow sundae of a girl,'' and her ripe figure fit the many period movies like ''Little Old New York'' and ''In Old Chicago'' in which she sang to Don Ameche, Tyrone Power or John Payne from the stage of a saloon.         Mr. Ameche lost her to Mr. Power in ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' and ''In Old Chicago'' but won her affections in ''You Can't Have Everything,'' ''Hollywood Cavalcade,'' ''Lillian Russell'' and ''That Night in Rio.''         It was the one-two punch of ''In Old Chicago'' and ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' in 1938 that made Ms. Faye a top box-office draw. A year later she and Mr. Power were teamed for the last time in ''Rose of Washington Square,'' a fictionalization of the Nicky Arnstein-Fanny Brice story that was later the basis for the Broadway and Hollywood musical ''Funny Girl,'' which starred Barbra Streisand. Ms. Faye had been responsible for Mr. Power's stardom. In 1936, when he was only an extra, she insisted that Fox test him.         Her voice was inviting, and Irving Berlin once said he would choose Ms. Faye over any other singer to introduce his songs. In 1937, George Gershwin and Cole Porter called her the best female singer in Hollywood. In ''Rose of Washington Square,'' with tears in her eyes, Ms. Faye poured her love and faith in her no-good man into ''My Man.'' But the song with which she is most closely associated is the Academy Award-winning ballad ''You'll Never Know'' from ''Tin Pan Alley.''         An early marriage to Tony Martin, a singer, ended in divorce after three years when Ms. Faye had become a star and Mr. Martin had not succeeded in the movies. When she remarried, she said, she was determined not to let that happen again. She and Mr. Harris were the parents of two daughters by the time she walked off the Fox lot after ''Fallen Angel.''         Ms. Faye had tried to change her screen image in that film noir melodrama, as the wife whose husband wants to dump her for the character played by Ms. Darnell. When she saw how Mr. Zanuck had edited the movie, she decided it would be a failure, telling an interviewer decades later, ''I couldn't see anything coming for me but the same old dumb things.''         So she spent the next eight years raising her children and appearing with her husband on a successful Sunday evening radio program, ''The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show.''         Ms. Faye is survived by her daughters, Alice Regan and Phyllis Harris; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         In 1962 Ms. Faye returned to 20th Century Fox as Pat Boone's mother in a poorly received remake of ''State Fair.'' In 1973 she toured in a revival of ''Good News,'' and in 1976 joined other golden-era stars in cameo roles in ''Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood.''         In 1984 Ms. Faye became a spokeswoman for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, encouraging ''young elders'' to live a healthy life. In 1990, she was co-author of a book, ''Growing Older, Staying Young,'' with Dick Kleiner.         Reminiscing about her years at Fox, Ms. Faye described the studio as a kind of penitentiary.         ''So I decided to make a new life for myself,'' she said. ''A home life. I had been chauffeured to work, made up, dressed, given my meals and chauffeured back home. I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to be independent. I equated independence with seeing daylight during the week and learning how to drive a car.''         Correction:  May 11, 1998, Monday  An obituary of the actress and singer Alice Faye in some editions yesterday misidentified the source of the song ''You'll Never Know,'' which won an Academy Award in 1944. It was from the film ''Hello, Frisco, Hello,'' not ''Tin Pan Alley.'' The obituary is reprinted today on page A15 for readers who did not receive it.

         Theresa Merritt, whose half-century career on television, in movies, on Broadway and in concert halls stretched from the original production of ''Carmen Jones'' to a recent episode of ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' died on June 12 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 and lived in the Hollis section of Queens.         A spokesman for her family said Ms. Merritt died after a six-year battle with skin cancer.         Ms. Merritt is probably best known for two roles. Beginning in 1974, she starred in ''That's My Mama,'' an ABC situation comedy set in a Washington barbershop where a widowed mother knows best what her hapless son (played by Clifton Davis) should do. And on Broadway in 1984 she originated the title role of a domineering, manipulative blues singer in August Wilson's ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,'' earning a Tony nomination.         She was ''Ma Rainey incarnate,'' wrote Frank Rich in his review in The New York Times. ''A singing actress of both wit and power, she finds bitter humor in the character's distorted sense of self: when she barks her outrageous demands to her lackeys, we see a show business monster who's come a long way from her roots.''         Ms. Merritt was born in Emporia, Va., but moved to Philadelphia while a toddler to be reared by an aunt and uncle after her mother died. Yearning for a career as an opera singer, she studied at the Settlement School of Music in Philadelphia, and at Temple University and New York University.         As a teen-ager, she sang in church and community choirs and appeared on a radio show aimed at black audiences, ''Parisian Tailor's Colored Kiddie Hour.''         When she was 21, Ms. Merritt was chosen by Billy Rose, the Broadway producer, to join the cast of his 1943 musical, ''Carmen Jones.'' She played Frascetta.         Later, Ms. Merritt toured as a backup singer for Harry Belafonte and Jackie Wilson and sang at Carnegie Hall in 1985 as part of the Kool Jazz Festival and Salute to Cole Porter.         Her other New York stage roles included a gospel singer in ''Trumpets of the Lord'' in 1969; the understanding Southern maid in ''F. Jasmine Addams,'' a 1971 musical based on Carson McCullers's ''Member of the Wedding''; the wicked witch in ''The Wiz,'' and John Lithgow's black Polish landlady in ''Division Street,'' a 1980 farce by Steve Tesich.         Ms. Merritt acted in several films, including ''They Might Be Giants'' (1972), ''The Goodbye Girl'' (1977), ''All That Jazz'' (1979), ''The Great Santini'' (1979), ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' (1982) and ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'' (1988).         She also appeared on numerous television series, including ''Beekman Place,'' ''Another World,'' ''Police Story'' and ''The Love Boat.'' In the last year, she played guest roles on ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' ''Cosby'' and ''Law and Order.''         Ms. Merritt is survived by her husband of 52 years, Benjamin Hines, and by four children, Norman, Benjamin Jr. and Denise, all of Hollis, and Dennis, of St. Louis.         In a 1984 interview, following her acclaimed opening in ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,'' Ms. Merritt said: ''I don't regret never being a big star. That can all go in seconds. I'm 62, and I've had a taste of it all.''       
         Helen Carter, a singer and musician who was part of the Carter family dynasty of country-music entertainers, died on Tuesday at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. She was 70 and lived in Dickson, Tenn.         She had been hospitalized for gastrointestinal problems that began over a year ago, said Kelly Hancock of House of Cash, the business office of Johnny Cash, Mrs. Carter's brother-in-law, and of her sister June Carter Cash.         The original Carter Family band, which helped kick-start the country-music record industry in 1927, was begun by A. P. Carter, a railroad worker and farmer from Maces Springs, Va.; his wife, Sara, and Sara's cousin, Maybelle. The band grew with the occasional addition of Maybelle's children, including Helen.         The family band lasted from 1927 to 1943, and it was of inestimable importance to American music.         It disseminated traditional songs, established a widely imitated small-group sound and built a set of templates that country, bluegrass and folk musicians would draw upon -- the mountain hymn, the love ballad, the cowboy tune and so on.         In 1943 Sara quit singing for good, and Maybelle started a new band, Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, with her daughters as permanent members.         Helen was 12 when she was introduced to the world over the airwaves of XET in Monterrey, Mexico, and in her teen-age years became the most dependable musician of her mother's band, playing accordion, guitar and autoharp.         It was a successful band, featured on ''The Old Dominion Barn Dance,'' a radio show based in Richmond, Va., in 1946; later it moved to the ''Tennessee Barn Dance,'' on Knoxville's WNOX. In 1950 the band joined the Grand Ole Opry on WSM in Nashville, and did some recording as a trio for Columbia records.         Helen Carter was a songwriter as well, writing ''Poor Old Heartsick Me,'' a hit for the singer Margie Bowes in 1959.         In the 1960's and 70's, she often appeared on radio and television not as a member of a working group but simply as a member of the famous clan. For example, she appeared on television with her sister June and  Mr. Cash.         In addition to her sister June, of Hendersonville, Va., she is survived by her husband, Glenn Jones of Dickson, Tenn.; another sister, Anita Carter of Goodlettsville, Tenn.; three sons, Glenn Daniel, David Lawrence, and Kevin Carter Jones, all of Dickson, and six grandchildren.       
         Julia Perles, a longtime Manhattan lawyer who played an important part in bringing about a significant change in New York State's divorce legislation, died early Wednesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla. She was 84 and had lived in Sarasota for about four years.         The cause was not immediately clear, but she had had a fall at her home, said Janet Post, a friend.         Ms. Perles is widely considered to have played the leading role in bringing about the passage of what is popularly known as New York State's equitable distribution law, which went into effect in 1980. The law brought about what its admirers have called a revolutionary change in the practice of matrimonial law and in the rights of marital partners.         At her death, Ms. Perles was still affiliated with the law firm of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon, based in Manhattan, where she became a partner in 1970, having been invited by Louis Nizer to head the firm's matrimonial practice.         She went on to become a senior partner until about eight years ago,  and remained head of her department until she moved to Florida. After that, she continued to be affiliated with the firm and its matrimonial department.         While she was practicing matrimonial law, she became chairwoman of a special committee of the New York County Lawyers Association. The panel's members were respected specialists in marital law who favored getting the equitable-distribution change made in the state law. Committee members communicated with the State Legislature in Albany repeatedly, former colleagues of Ms. Perles recalled, and it took much attention and perseverance to persuade the Legislature to make the change.         Under the law as it was passed in 1980, both spouses, in the event of a divorce, are enabled to share equitably in the assets that either or both of them have accumulated during the marriage, even if title to the property -- a house for instance, or a business -- is in the name of only one spouse. Parties to a marriage did not have that legal right in New York State before the law was passed.         The underlying assumption behind the law is that both parties to a marriage contribute to the acquisition, maintenance and growth of the marital assets.         Ms. Perles's clients over the years included Woody Allen; Nancy Allen, the actress-wife of Brian De Palma, the movie director; the former Eve Ella Sherpick Green, the first wife of Harry B. Helmsley, the New York real estate titan; David Merrick, the producer; and Ethel Scull, who once was called the doyenne of the pop art world.         Ms. Perles was a former president of the New York Women's Bar Association, a fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and a member of the Dirty Thirty, an organization of American lawyers prominent in the field of matrimonial law.         She was born and raised in Brooklyn, and she wanted to be a lawyer from the time she was 12 years old. Rona J. Shays, a close friend, recalled that Ms. Perles used to say that her own mother had not wanted her to go to law school and had said to her, ''No one will want to marry you if they think you're smarter than they are.''         Nevertheless, Ms. Perles went on to attend Brooklyn College, and she received her law degree in 1937 from Brooklyn Law School.         She was an associate in the Manhattan law firm of Schwartz & Frohlich from 1942 to 1952 and then a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Greenbaum Wolff & Ernst before going to Phillips, Nizer.         In 1951 she married Howard Singer. He died in 1989.         Her survivors include a brother, David Perles, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Kay Thompson, an entertainer who became the author of the hugely successful book ''Eloise,'' about a bratty child living at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, died on Thursday. She lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with her goddaughter, Liza Minnelli. She was taken from the apartment to Lenox Hill Hospital, but her longtime lawyer Arthur E. Abelman said it was unclear where she died. She was between 92 and 95,  Mr. Abelman, estimated.         The daughter of a St. Louis jeweler, Ms. Thompson was a pianist with the St. Louis Symphony in 1928.  ''I was a stage-struck kid,'' she recalled later, ''and I got out of St. Louis fast.''         She became a singer with the Mills Brothers on radio, an arranger and singer with Fred Waring's Band and co-producer of ''Kay Thompson and Company,'' a CBS radio show. She also worked as an arranger and songwriter for ''The Ziegfeld Follies'' and other movies, and performed in nightclubs, singing with the Williams Brothers from 1947 to 1953.         As The New York Herald Tribune reported in 1958, ''Eloise's birth was unexpected. At rehearsals of her act with the Williams Brothers, Ms. Thompson prized punctuality. Then one day she was late. In a high, childish voice that she had never used before, she made her apology. One of her co-workers said, 'Who are you, little girl?' Ms. Thompson replied, 'I am Eloise. I am 6.' The others joined in the game, each assuming a juvenile identity, and it became a regular rehearsal pastime.'' The routine became a book after Ms. Thompson began performing in 1954 in a one-woman show at the Plaza.         While she was appearing in the hotel's Persian Room, she was introduced to an artist, Hilary Knight, and he became the illustrator of ''Eloise,'' which was subtitled ''A Book for Precocious Grown Ups.'' Ms. Thompson wrote the book during a three-month break from performing.         Later she wrote three other books about Eloise, which were also illustrated by Mr. Knight.         In the first two years after ''Eloise'' came out, 150,000 copies were sold. Looking back in 1957, Publisher's Weekly said: ''As everyone who can read must know, Eloise is an overprivileged 6-year-old, the terror of the Hotel Plaza in New York. She is also ill-mannered, ill-tempered and ugly. But she has her charm. She often means well, and her mother neglects her. Even though you know that you would do the same thing if she were yours, you can't help finding this appealing.''         Kim Bouchard, a senior publicist at Simon & Schuster, Ms. Thompson's publisher, said that according to records beginning in 1983, 592,000 copies of ''Eloise'' have been sold in the United States since 1983.         The other Eloise books are ''Eloise in Paris'' (1957), ''Eloise at Christmastime'' (1958) and ''Eloise in Moscow'' (1959).         Ms. Thompson also wrote ''Kay Thompson's Miss Pooky Peckinpaugh and Her Secret Private Boyfriends Complete with Telephone Numbers'' (1970).         Ms. Thompson founded Eloise Ltd., which made recordings and other products related to the Eloise character. She also acted in movies, including ''Funny Face,'' and on television.         Friends said her first marriage, in the 1930's, to Jack Jenney, a trombonist, ended in divorce, as did her later marriage to William Spier, a radio producer.       
         Francelia Butler, a late-blooming academic of such passionate, unorthodox ways that she has been credited with almost single-handedly transforming the study of children's literature from a stepchild of library science into a recognized academic discipline, died last Friday at a nursing home in Windham, Conn. A resident of Mansfield Hollow, Conn., she was 85 and had been a professor at the University of Connecticut.         When they hired her in 1965, it's a safe bet that the men who ran the English department at the University of Connecticut knew that Dr. Butler, a native of Cleveland who grew up in Elyria, Ohio, was a 52-year-old widow who had returned to school after her husband's death, received a doctorate in Renaissance literature from the University of Virginia just two years earlier and spent the intervening years teaching at the University of Tennessee.         It's an even safer bet that her Connecticut superiors did not know that in 1934, as a fresh Oberlin College graduate with a degree in the classics, Dr. Butler had gone to Washington to write a pamphlet for  an education association on ''The Brotherhood of Man.'' And that she had been swiftly dismissed from the project after overriding her boss's directive to go easy on Hitler lest she offend association members who agreed with Hitler's policies.         Or that she had been dismissed from her next job, as publicity director of a segregated Washington hotel, after letting black Oberlin alumni attend a banquet there.         Had they been aware of her record of ad hoc social activism, her superiors might have had second thoughts about relegating Dr. Butler, a small woman with a will of steel, to children's literature, a course so scorned by the Connecticut English faculty that it was known derisively as ''kiddie lit.'' Certainly her superiors would not have been as surprised as they were when Dr. Butler, sensing that the academic disdain for children's literature reflected a disdain both for children and for women as children's traditional caretakers and teachers, proceeded to turn the course into a platform for reform.         The faculty's sneers at her course were understandable. Although children's literature had been taught in American universities since the turn of the century, generally as part of the library science or education curriculums, it was a reflection of the subject's lowly standing that it had no academic association and no academic journal.         Dr. Butler swiftly made up for lost time. Among other things, she established the journal Children's Literature, helped to create the children's literature division of the Modern Language Association and served as a founding director of the Children's Literature Association in 1972.         Along the way Dr. Butler's own course became one of the largest and most popular at the University of Connecticut, in part because she turned it into something resembling a three-ring circus with a string of guest lecturers that included falconers, puppeteers, troubadours, Maurice Sendak, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bruno Bettelheim, Dr. Benjamin Spock, Big Bird and the Wicked Witch of the West (the actress Margaret Hamilton).         Some of her colleagues predictably complained that the course's success was based more on showmanship than scholarship, but Dr. Butler, many of whose students went on to to teach children's literature at other colleges, was no slacker as a scholar. She turned out reams of  papers, edited anthologies and in 1989 published ''Skipping Around the World,'' a study of international  jump-rope rhymes.         For all the acclaim she won, Dr. Butler chafed at what she saw as Connecticut's indifference or active opposition to her efforts to wrest children's literature from its vocational moorings and place it within the humanities.         When, by her account, her upstart Journal was actually banned from the University of Connecticut bookstore, Dr. Butler found another academic sponsor: Yale University. (Later, when Connecticut seemed to shun the annual Peace Games Festival she established to teach children conflict resolution through games that rewarded cooperation over competition, she moved it to Harvard.)         Although her male colleagues suggested that the university had been more supportive than she claimed, after her retirement in 1992 at the age of 79, Dr. Butler, who typically had led the campaign that overturned Connecticut's mandatory retirement at 70, transferred her journal and her papers to Hollins College in Virginia.         She is survived by her daughter, Ann Wandell of Windham; a brother, Bruce McWilliams of Little Deer Isle, Me; four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
         Betty Carter, one of jazz's great singers and a composer and arranger whose groups were virtual schools for generations of jazz musicians, died at home in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn on Saturday. She was 69.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her friend Ora Harris.         Ms. Carter sounded like no one in jazz, with her own diction, her own phrasing and her own sense of pitch. Though she was firmly inside the jazz-singing tradition, she was an abstractionist as well, and for her words were pliable. On her early material -- she began a solo recording career in the mid-1950's -- her light, pure voice sounded instrumental, with curved, beautifully shaped notes. It was immediately noticeable that she was after something different, and that her technique, always extraordinary, was there to work for her ideas. It was equally clear that she was a jazz musician first and a singer second.         About a decade after beginning her recording career, Ms. Carter refined her originality into a style that became the template for modern jazz singing. On ''Look No Further,'' recorded in 1964, Ms. Carter uses her voice against the bass, then as the band comes in her note choice mirrors the experimentation of instrumentalists like John Coltrane and Miles Davis; during the same session she recorded ''My Favorite Things,'' a composition associated with Mr. Coltrane. Her improvisations were explosive, tumbling out in great leaps at a velocity that expressed unfettered artistic freedom.         But it was artifice. Ms. Carter was one of jazz's most articulate small-group arrangers, and few musicians have ever controlled tempo the way  she had; woe to the young musicians in the band who could not navigate the shockingly abrupt tempo changes or keep up with Ms. Carter's fastest or slowest tempos. Her snapping fingers, marking off the time, sent generations of musicians back to the practice room, chagrined.         In her hands a standard or her own compositions often contrasted some of jazz's slowest tempos with some of its fastest. She wasn't afraid to pare down the instrumentation of a group for a while, singing against piano or bass, orchestrating the arrival of other instruments. And the constant tempo-changing gave the impression of emotional extremity and careful control of the artistic environment. She sculptured sound, and it made her concerts some of the most moving experiences in jazz, a mixture of the emotional power of the songs' texts and the sheer joy of her imagination.         ''I started to change my material to keep the musicians interested,'' Ms. Carter said in a 1992 interview with The New York Times. ''What do you do with a chorus and a half? You change things, stretch them out, change speed. Most musicians I played with were so good they could do what was necessary.''         Ms. Carter grew up in Detroit, which in the 1940's and 1950's was a good environment for jazz musicians, with the city producing some of the best musicians of the time.         Detroit was a stop on the jazz circuit, and a young Ms. Carter sang with Charlie Parker, who came through town. One of her nicknames was Betty Bebop, a tribute to her interests. In 1948 she began working with Lionel Hampton and his band, staying with the vibraphonist until 1951, when, during a performance in New York, she decided to remain there. During the same time she recorded the female part for King Pleasure's version of ''Red Top,'' singing a vocal rendition of Gail Brockman's original trumpet solo.         In New York in 1955 and '56, Ms. Carter began recording for Epic Records and generally taking in the  city. In 1957, she recorded with Wynton Kelly and other peers; her work was irregular partly because her style was more jazz than cabaret, and partly because she tried to avoid  the abusive working situations that have plagued jazz.         In 1961 Ms. Carter recorded what has become a classic album, ''Ray Charles and Betty Carter,'' with Mr. Charles; it features the pair singing astringent duets including a famous version of ''Baby, It's Cold Outside.'' Ms. Carter worked with Mr. Charles from 1960 to 1963, the year she toured Japan with Sonny Rollins and recorded an orchestral album for Atco Records.         Through the 1960's Ms. Carter struggled with her career, recording with Roulette Records in the late 1960's, during which the avant-garde and pop music rendered some artists identified with an older style commercially irrelevant. But in 1969 she started her own recording company, Bet-Car Productions, and on that label she released her albums.         In 1988 Ms. Carter began a relationship with Verve Records that included the reissue of the Bet-Car label along with the recording of a series of new albums. That same year she released ''Look What I Got!,'' which won a Grammy, and in 1994 she recorded an album, ''Feed the Fire,'' with the pianist Geri Allen, the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette.         Also during the 1980's Ms. Carter, finally recognized for her innovations, became a concert draw internationally. She recorded duets with Carmen McRae, and she kept turning out well-rounded musicians, having trained them in her trio. Included in the alumni from the 1980's and the 1990's were the pianists Cyrus Chestnut, Benny Green, Stephen Scott, Marc Cary, Darrell Grant and Travis Shook. And her choice of drummers was extraordinary, having hired Greg Hutchinson, Clarence Penn, Winard Harper, Troy Davis and Lewis Nash. She began receiving numerous awards, including the National Medal of Arts given last year by President Clinton.         In 1993 she began the Jazz Ahead series at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a program that featured young and promising musicians.  This year the Jazz Ahead series was invited to appear at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.         Ms. Carter is survived by two sons, Myles and Kagle Redding, both of New York City. A marriage to James Redding ended in divorce.         ''The survival of jazz culture takes priority,'' Ms. Carter said in the interview with The Times. ''The survival of this culture depends on people playing it and living the life. The young guys playing it in 20 years will be taking the music somewhere else. There was a period where, in jazz, the music sent people away. But it's now back to making people feel better, putting happy smiles on their faces. When I was coming up, that's what jazz was about. It wasn't about money. It was about how happy you could make people.''       
         Pauline Julien, who sang songs of passion and of tender love, died on Wednesday in Montreal. The chanteuse, who was 70, was most strongly identified with the songs she sang in the cause of a separate and independent Quebec.         Ms. Julien took her own life at her home after leaving a note saying she did not want to be revived, said her sister, Fabienne Julien. She said the singer suffered from aphasia, a condition that severely limits the power to use or understand words, and had grown despondent as the disease progressed.         In a singing career that spanned more than 35 years and two continents, Ms. Julien became a beloved figure to French-speaking audiences who were touched by her stirring performances and forceful style. She recorded 22 albums containing more than 200 songs, including about 30 that she composed.         She popularized homespun Quebecois music in France and helped revive the popularity of sophisticated French music in Quebec. She interpreted the music of Kurt Weill and the Quebec composer Gilles Vigneault. One of her most popular songs was called ''Tonight I Feel Tender,'' a ballad that became a theme that she performed at many performances.         But from the time she first returned to Quebec from Paris in the late 1950's she formed part of the inspirational soul of the separatist movement in Quebec. She fell in love with the Quebecois poet and journalist Gerald Godin, a staunch separatist, and fought with him for Quebec separatism.         During a crisis in Quebec in 1970 when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau sent the Canadian Army into the streets of Montreal in response to separatist violence, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were among a number of Quebecers who were swept off the streets and briefly jailed.         After Mr. Godin was elected to the province's assembly in 1976, the year the separatist party won control of the provincial government, she appeared regularly at major separatist rallies, leading huge crowds in song and fiery speeches.         She played a major role in fighting for women's rights and in obtaining the right to abortion in predominately Catholic Quebec.         ''Madame Julien lived intensely,'' said Lucien Bouchard, premier of Quebec. ''Her voice, the words of her songs -- above all on the question of love, friendship and her country -- her charisma and her passionate character are deeply etched in our collective memory.''         Ms. Julien was born in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, in 1928. She studied drama in Paris in the 1950's and  began singing there in bistros and bohemian clubs.         Jean Paul Goay, Ms. Julien's brother-in-law, said that on the night before she died she insisted on being taken to a show in Montreal where an old friend, the French comedian Raymond Davos, was performing. ''She told him then that they would never see each other again, but he didn't understand exactly what it signified,'' Mr. Goay said.         In the early 1990's, after 30 years of a common-law marriage, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were formally married. He died of a brain tumor in 1994.         In her later years Ms. Julien retired from active performing and traveled to Africa to work with the poor in Burkina Faso and other French-speaking countries.         She is survived by two children, Pascale and Nicolas, both of Montreal, from her first marriage to Jacques Galipeau, which ended in divorce.       
         Sarah Korein, who acquired some of the choicest real estate in Manhattan through bare-knuckle tactics cloaked by grandmotherly charm, died on Thursday at the North Division of Beth Israel Medical Center. She was 93 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Elysabeth Kleinhans, a lawyer who manages the real estate business with other family members.         Even in a city in which real estate is a popular obsession on a par with sports and soap operas, Mrs. Korein (KO-reen) was almost unknown outside professional circles -- exactly as she preferred it. Her name rarely appeared in public.         And the face that she did present was more Dresden doll than Machiavellian negotiator. But buyers or sellers who assumed they were sitting across the table from sweetness and light did so at their peril.         ''She was the toughest deal maker imaginable,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, executive managing director of Insignia/ESG, a real estate brokerage and management concern. ''She squeezed out every last penny.''         Mrs. Korein could even profit from property she never owned.         In the early 1960's, for instance, she put a $250,000 deposit down on the Osborne Apartments, 205 West 57th Street. Advised against consummating the purchase because the building had no long-term investment value, she had to figure a way out of the deal.         So she reached out to a reporter for The New York Times to say that she planned to demolish the Osborne and replace it with a new tower, her son, Dr. Julius Korein, recalled.         When tenants besieged her office the next day, she comforted them. ''I don't want to take anyone's home away,'' she insisted, offering to sell them the contract. They paid her $500,000, not only taking her off the hook but also leaving her $250,000 richer.         ''She certainly was one of the best negotiators I've ever met,'' said the developer William Zeckendorf Jr. ''Perhaps in the beginning, people didn't take her seriously enough. It didn't take them long to find out.''         A common story in the real estate industry was that Mrs. Korein would keep different buyers in separate rooms and shuttle back and forth among the parties until she had extracted the terms she sought.         ''Even into her old age, everyone thought she was a charming, lovely little woman,'' her daughter said. ''Let me tell you, that's not where she was.''         Mrs. Korein's trophies speak for themselves.         At her death, her properties -- either land alone or both land and building -- included Lever House, the modernist landmark at 390 Park Avenue, between 53d and 54th Streets; the old Equitable Building, 120 Broadway, between Cedar and Pine Streets, a tower so gargantuan that it inspired New York's first zoning law in 1916, and One Penn Plaza on Seventh Avenue, between 33d and 34th Streets, the fifth-largest office building in the city.         She also owned the Delmonico Hotel, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street; the Swiss Center, 606 Fifth Avenue, at 49th Street, and two apartment towers on Central Park South, Nos. 220 and 240, overlooking Columbus Circle.         Mrs. Korein bought and sold the Beresford Apartments, 211 Central Park West, between 81st and 82d Streets; the former Croyden Hotel, 12 East 86th Street, at Madison Avenue; the former Fifth Avenue Hotel, 24 Fifth Avenue, at Ninth Street, and the Schwab House apartments, a full-block complex between West End Avenue and Riverside Drive, 73d and 74th Streets.         The family will not estimate the size and value of her portfolio, and not only because owners are customarily loath to disclose such things (tax assessors read the newspapers). Rather, Mrs. Korein held a variety of positions with any number of partners, making it difficult to apportion her share.         Whatever the bottom line, there was no question that she was wealthy and tough -- a ''great realtor,'' in the words of Leona Helmsley, perhaps the only figure to whom she might immediately be likened.         Ms. Tighe said Mrs. Korein was ''always an object of fascination, certainly to women coming up in the business but even to men, because there was no one else of her gender who accomplished what she did when she did.''         But while both Mrs. Korein and Mrs. Helmsley were known for being as aggressive as necessary to survive in the male-dominated industry, there was a significant difference: Mrs. Korein created her portfolio from scratch.         Sarah Rabinowitz was born in Germany and reared in Palestine, where she met Isidor Korein, a Hungarian engineer who arrived there after World War I. They married and immigrated to the United States in 1923.         In 1931, for $6,000, the Koreins bought a six-story apartment house in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn -- not as an investment but so that family members would have a place to live rent free.         Their first substantial investment, in 1941, was a large apartment building at 8701 Shore Road in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. To make the units more attractive, Mrs. Korein bought dozens of refrigerators and stored them in the building's emptied-out swimming pool.         With the advent of World War II, refrigerator production virtually ended as industry retooled for military needs. So Mrs. Korein was able to sell the refrigerators at a high profit. And because of the shortage of apartments, she was able to rent up the Shore Road building even without the new refrigerators.         ''One of her major secrets was somehow being in the right place at the right time with the right goods,'' Ms. Kleinhans said.         After the war and against her husband's wishes, Mrs. Korein pursued investment in Manhattan, beginning with 715 Park Avenue, an apartment building on the southeast corner of 70th Street. In time, she advised Francis Cardinal Spellman, the Archbishop of New York, on real estate, her children said.         Mrs. Korein made use of the nonamortizing mortgage, under which she would pay slightly higher interest rates but nothing toward principal, thus freeing cash for further investments. By the time the loan itself came due, her properties typically had appreciated so much in value that Mrs. Korein could easily pay off the amount.         ''All of her properties, without exception, did nothing but increase in value,'' said Andrew J. Singer, the chairman of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, who arranged financing for Mrs. Korein over many years.         Mr. Korein died in 1976. But even when he was alive, Mrs. Korein was the ''driving force,'' said Lawrence Friedland, the family's lawyer.         In the 1960's, he recalled, Mrs. Korein was about to sign a contract for the Beresford. At the last minute, her partners balked, fearing the risk of buying such a big building in what was then a rough-and-tumble neighborhood. She signed the contract anyway and more than doubled her money when she sold the property a few years later, Mr. Friedland said.         Perhaps Mrs. Korein's biggest false step was a foray into development in 1972, when she built an apartment house, the Elysabeth, 35 East 38th Street, between Park and Madison. It was not a success and she did not build again.         Besides Ms. Kleinhans and Dr. Korein, both of Manhattan, Mrs. Korein is survived by her sister, Esther Kessler of Naples, Fla.; four grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.         ''Into her 90's -- and I'm talking this year -- she would ask about cap rates and internal rates of return,'' Ms. Tighe said. ''She never lost her fascination with the business.''         Correction:  November 12, 1998, Thursday  An obituary on Nov. 4 about Sarah Korein, a New York real estate investor, referred incorrectly to her financing arrangements. Mrs. Korein was represented from 1977 to 1995 by Ackman Brothers & Singer, in which Lawrence D. Ackman and Andrew J. Singer were partners. Mr. Ackman arranged her financing before and after that time.       
         Barbara Thornton, a singer and musicologist who, with Benjamin Bagby, founded and directed Sequentia, the medieval music ensemble, died last Sunday at the Caritas hospice in Cologne, Germany. She was 48 and lived in Cologne.         The cause was complications from a brain tumor, Jon Aaron, her manager, said.         Ms. Thornton, whose soprano voice had a mezzolike hue and a texture that gave it a distinctive character, was a specialist in the music of the 12th-century abbess Hildegard von Bingen, and it was largely because of Ms. Thornton's performances and recordings with Sequentia that Hildegard and her works have lately become the focus of scholarly and popular interest.         In 1982, when Sequentia toured with a production of Hildegard's ''Ordo Virtutum,'' an allegorical work in which the soul is confronted by both the Virtues and the Devil, Hildegard was virtually unknown outside a small circle of musicologists and students of medieval sacred works. Since then, the ensemble has recorded virtually all of Hildegard's extant music for the Deutsche Harmonia Mundi label, including two versions of ''Ordo Virtutum.'' When Sequentia offered its production again last summer, at the Lincoln Center Festival, it was a popular draw, and one of at least three versions of the work presented in New York City this year.         Ms. Thornton was born in Summit, N.J., and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. During a tour with the Sarah Lawrence European Chorus in the early 1970's, she decided to continue her studies in Europe, and coached in the operatic repertory with teachers in Amsterdam, Zurich and Cremona, Italy. Her growing interest in early music led her to Basel, Switzerland, where she enrolled at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, from which she received an advanced diploma in 1977.         She met Mr. Bagby, a singer and medieval harpist, in Basel in 1974, and started Sequentia with him in 1977. Like many early-music ensembles, Sequentia expanded and contracted as the music required, sometimes using solo voices and a single accompanying instrument, sometimes drawing on a men's choir, the Sons of Thunder; a women's choir, Vox Feminae, and medieval harps, strings, flutes and hurdy-gurdy.         Besides its Hildegard series, Sequentia recorded three disks of sacred works from Spanish monasteries -- including the ''Codex las Huelgas'' and works composed for King Alfonso X (''El Sabio'') -- as well as several collections of courtly love songs and a compilation of sacred and secular works by Oswald von Wolkenstein, a knight, poet and composer who straddled the 14th and 15th centuries.         She is survived by Mr. Bagby, her companion; her parents, Fletcher and Margaret Thornton of Exeter, N.H., and two sisters, Susan Frey Starbuck of Seattle and Anne Thornton Bridges of Woodstock, Vt.       
         Celeste Mendoza, a Cuban singer who was known as the Queen of the Guaguanco, or street rumba, died on Sunday in Havana. She was 68.         Cuban newspapers reported Ms. Mendoza's death but did not say what the cause was, according to the Associated Press.         Ms. Mendoza, who was born in Santiago de Cuba, sang ballads with a convincing heft in her voice, a depth of emotion that made them work. But it was her singing of guaguancos, the music of the street rumbas, that made her famous. When she sang them -- a good example is her version of ''La Confianza,'' which she recorded with Bebo Valdes's orchestra -- the sadness in her voice and her smooth virtuosity mixed well. And they earned her a place in the history of the music: previously, guaguancos and rumbas were almost exclusively the territory of male singers.         She started her career in the 1950's, winning a number of radio contests. In the late 1950's she signed with Gema Records, and performed with Mr. Valdez's orchestra on a series of recordings that included some of her earliest hits, among them ''Que Me Castigue Dios'' and ''Soy Tan Feliz.'' She also recorded with the band of Ernest Duarte, a group that featured some of the most important singers of the time, including Rolando La Serie, Rolo Martinez and Tata Ramos.         Ms. Mendoza continued recording in Cuba under the Castro regime, making records with some of the best rumba groups on the island, including Los Papines. She traveled widely across Europe and Latin America, and she was a star of radio and television in Cuba. She recorded with the son group Sierra Maestra and made the original version of ''Bemba Colorao,'' a tune that became a standard for Celia Cruz. Ms. Mendoza also kept making records with Egrem, the state record label of Cuba, singing songs from the Santeria religion of Cuba, mambos, rancheras and guaguancos.       
         Flora Roberts, a dynamic play agent who represented many important theater artists, died on Saturday at New York Hospital. She was 77, and lived in Manhattan and Bridgewater, Conn.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her associate Sarah Douglas.         Stephen Sondheim, Tina Howe, Alfred Uhry, Maury Yeston and others were greatly indebted to Ms. Roberts, who encouraged them to challenge themselves. As she said in an interview earlier this year, ''writers are causes.'' When she believed in someone, she devoted herself wholeheartedly to nurturing the career of that client.         As Mr. Sondheim said, she was ''a protector and an idealist'' who cared more about the work than the contract. She was not known for her power as a negotiator but for her perspicacity in reading scripts and in analyzing a play in production. Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, said Ms. Roberts had ''a real ability to think like a producer, feel like an artist and act like an agent.''         A perfect personification of her first name, Ms. Roberts gave new meaning to the word flamboyant. She was, Ms. Howe said, ''a woman of enormous style, heart, experience, courage, intelligence -- a real original.'' As round as she was short, and fond of wearing large red hats, Ms. Roberts was one of the most colorful people in the American theater, bursting with energy and with a gravelly voice that approached that of a basso profundo. She was outspoken with her ideas and comments and thought nothing of castigating a client if she felt that a play was worthy of improvement.         Her greatest talent was in her instinctive reaction to fine work, no matter where it came from. As she said, ''Fortunately, I have a finger on the pulse.'' Years ago, Frank Loesser sent her a composer who had written a musical that he considered very noncommercial. She listened to the composer play one song on the piano in her apartment, and it gave her goose bumps. The song was ''Sit Down, John''; the musical was ''1776.'' She recommended that the composer, Sherman Edwards, work with Peter Stone (not her client) as a book writer. Then she guided the show to its Broadway success.         When she received a script of ''The Gin Game,'' she wondered who would want to do ''a two-character play about old people,'' then noticed a photograph on her wall of Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in ''The Four-Poster.'' She called Mr. Cronyn, and, buoyed by his enthusiasm, the play quickly rolled into production. The author, D. L. Coburn, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1977, one of many honors awarded to Ms. Roberts's clients, including Pulitzers for ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' Mr. Sondheim's ''Sunday in the Park With George'' and ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' a play that she suggested Mr. Uhry write when he was thinking of doing a television mini-series.         She met Mr. Sondheim in the early 1950's when he was working on his first show, ''Saturday Night,'' and he became her longest-running client. From ''West Side Story'' onward, she made creative contributions to his musicals.         Last season, shows that Ms. Roberts represented filled theatrical marquees: Ms. Howe's ''Pride's Crossing,'' the revivals of ''Anne Frank'' and ''1776,'' and, carried over from the previous season, Mr. Uhry's ''Last Night of Ballyhoo'' and the musical ''Titanic.''         Ms. Roberts was born in the Bronx, and studied at the Manhattan School of Music and Hunter College to become an opera singer. At one point she sang for Arturo Toscanini. She remembered that he said, ''Molta musica, but a small voice.'' Eventually, she became something of a diva in real life, and switched from opera to torch songs, which she often sang for friends.         After graduation, she worked as an all-purpose assistant to Kermit Bloomgarden, the producer. One day in the mid-1940's Mr. Bloomgarden gave her a new play to read, Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest.'' When the playwright asked what she thought of it, she offered  frank criticism. In response, Ms. Hellman told the producer to give his assistant a raise, adding, ''She's right, and I don't think I can fix it.''         ''I got a raise,'' said Ms. Roberts, ''and she tried to fix it.''         That same year, Arthur Miller submitted a play (later titled ''All My Sons'') to Mr. Bloomgarden and she advised him to produce it. Able to present only one play at a time, he chose Ms. Hellman's instead, but with Ms. Roberts's encouragement, subsequently produced ''Death of a Salesman.''         In the 1950's, because of her interest in playwrights, she became an agent. One of her first clients was Ira Levin, then a television writer. She got him an assignment adapting the Mac Hyman novel ''No Time for Sergeants,'' first for television, then for Broadway, and she discovered the play's star, Andy Griffith.         Although most of her clients were writers, Ms. Roberts also represented a few directors (Susan Stroman) and designers (Jennifer Tipton). Frequently she had solicitations to join major talent agencies, but she remained fiercely independent and placed great emphasis on personal loyalty. As she said: ''I really love most of my clients. That's a privilege when you're on your own.''         She is survived by her sister, Janet Sovin of Berkeley, Calif., and her brother, David, of Huntington Station, N.Y.         Ms. Roberts's major passions were theater and horses. She owned a racehorse, Allaway, and often visited Belmont Park. At the track or on Broadway, she relied upon her experience and her assessment of form and potential. Sometimes she just took a flier and followed her intuition, as when she bet on a horse named ''Comedy Tonight'' because Mr. Sondheim had written a song by that name. Naturally, she bet on the horse to show, and it did. About her other preoccupation, she said, ''I gamble on the theater every day.''
