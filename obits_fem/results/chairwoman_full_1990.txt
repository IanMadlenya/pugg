Miss Izard was a consultant for the Westchester Library System, which has more than 40 branches, for nearly 20 years. She led classes, workshops and monthly meetings for librarians in book reviewing, storytelling and book collections.         She headed the children's services division of the American Library Association and was former chairwoman of its Newbery-Caldecott committee.         She began her career at the New York Public Library and also worked in Greenwich, Conn., and Mount Vernon, N.Y., before going to Westchester in 1959. Miss Izard retired in 1976. The Board of Regents gave her the James E. Allen Jr. Memorial Award for distinguished service to education.

        India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         Mrs. Edwards was unanimously elected to the national committee in 1950. She was first associated with the committee as a volunteer in the 1944 Presidential campaign. From 1945 to 1947 she was executive secretary of the women's division, which she served as associate director before becoming the committee's vice chairwoman.         Mrs. Edwards remained active in the Democratic Party for more than 30 years, through several generations of Democratic politicians, including Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.         For 22 years before she became active in politics she was on the staff of The Chicago Tribune, where she was society editor and woman's editor. She left the paper to marry her third husband, Herbert T. Edwards, a State Department official, and moved to Washington in 1942. Mr. Edwards died in the late 1970's.         Campaigning With Truman         Mrs. Edwards accompanied Mr. Truman, her political hero, on his 1948 campaign tour, where she repeatedly expressed her confidence in his victory at the polls.         At one point the President turned to her and sighed. ''India,'' he said, ''sometimes I think there are only two people who believe I will win. You and me.'' ''That's enough,'' she replied. Largely because of Mrs. Edwards's influence, Mr. Truman appointed more women to top jobs than any preceding President. Among them were Eugenia Anderson as Ambassador to Denmark, Perle Mesta as Minister to Luxembourg, Ruth Bryan Rohde as an alternate delegate to the United Nations and Georgia Neese Clark as Treasurer of the United States.         Explaining how she worked to increase the number of women in Federal jobs, Mrs. Edwards recalled: ''Sometimes I felt like a ghoul. I'd read the obits, and as soon as a man had died, I'd rush over to the White House and suggest a woman to replace him.''         Mrs. Edwards, who was named for her mother and her grandmother, was born in Chicago and grew up in Nashville. Her memoirs, ''Pulling No Punches,'' were published by G. P. Putnam's in 1977.         Mrs. Edward's daughter, India Moffett Williams, died in 1979, and her son, John Holbrook Moffett, died in World War II. She is survived by five grandchildren.

Miss Washington, a lifelong member of the Republican Party and of many civic organizations, was due to leave this week to begin her ambassadorship to the West African nation of Gambia, succeeding Herbert E. Horowitz. Friends said she was looking forward to her mission and had already approached American business people and universities about addressing Gambia's poverty and illiteracy.         ''Ruth would have been a great diplomat,'' said Representative Benjamin Gilman of New York, a close friend of Miss Washington. He described her death as ''a tragic loss at the peak of a brilliant career.''         To Friends, 'the Little Giant'         Another friend, Dr. Caroline Westerhoff of Prattville, Ala., said Miss Washington was a role model for young blacks and other minority youth.         Born in Buffalo, Miss Washington graduated from Hunter College and the New York University Law School. A diminutive woman, under 5 feet tall, she was called ''the little giant'' or ''the little general'' by friends and relatives.         Miss Washington held a number of government positions, including associate counsel for the State Division of Human Rights, commissioner of the State Workers' Compensation Board and chairwoman of the Benefits Review Board of the United States Department of Labor in Washington.         Appointed a Federal Magistrate for the Southern District of New York in 1979, she was one of only two minority women in the country to hold such a post. She retired in 1987 and returned to private law practice.         She is survived by two sisters: Leonora Lark of Bayside, Queens, and Bernice Jackson of Richmondville, N.Y.; and two brothers, James and Bernard Washington, both of Buffalo.

Rosen, a research scientist who was a leading investigator of the ways hormones and other factors control the development of cells, died of breast cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 55 years old.         Dr. Rosen held the Abby Rockefeller Mauze Chair of Experimental Therapeutics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and, as an American Cancer Society research professor, headed the center's laboratory of developmental and membrane biology.         In 1985 Dr. Rosen and colleagues at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, in collaboration with scientists at Genentech Inc., achieved a breakthrough in cell biology by cloning the gene for the human insulin receptor, the cell surface molecule to which insulin binds.         By accomplishing the cloning they opened the way for detailed investigation of how the insulin receptor transmits signals from the surface of the cell to the interior. More recently Dr. Rosen and her associates had been applying a wide range of biochemical and genetic techniques to determine how the receptor molecule gets its message to the cell's metabolic machinery.         Broader Look Into Insulin's Role         Their work also led to a broader inquiry into the role of insulin in normal cell function and in diabetes and other disorders.         Dr. Rosen, who was born in Manhattan, received an M.D. degree from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. After studying cell biology and biochemistry at New York University and at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, she joined the faculty at Einstein in 1966 and became chairwoman of the molecular pharmacology department.

She was 93 years old and lived at World's Edge Apple Organic Farm in Hendersonville.         Evangeline Johnson Merrill, a prominent figure in the arts who was the last surviving child of Robert Wood Johnson, co-founder of Johnson & Johnson, died yesterday at Bryan Health Care Center in Hendersonville, N.C. She was 93 years old and lived at World's Edge Apple Organic Farm in Hendersonville.         A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson said Mrs. Merrill's death resulted from injuries suffered in a fall earlier this year.         She was born in 1897 in New Brunswick, N.J., to Robert Wood Johnson and Evangeline Brewster Armstrong. Her brothers were Gen. Robert Wood Johnson, who built the family-owned business into a large, diversified health care company, and J. Seward Johnson, whose will was the subject of prolonged litigation in Manhattan.         After her graduation from Miss Spence's School in Manhattan in 1916, she became an instructor in first aid and then a lieutenant in the city's Red Cross Ambulance Corps. She was decorated by President Woodrow Wilson for her services in the Red Cross in World War I.         A One-Woman War         In the early 1920's she waged a one-woman war against the city government in Palm Beach, Fla., which refused to allow the wearing of new abbreviated women's bathing suits in public. She had a large number of handbills printed in protest and flew over the beach tossing them from the cockpit of a plane she had recently learned to fly.         Her first husband was the conductor Leopold Stokowski, from whom she was divorced in 1938. She later married Prince Zalstem-Zalessky, a nobleman of Russian descent who died in 1965.

Eleanor Clark French, a writer, editor and former vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, died on Monday in Paoli, Pa. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her stepson, John French Jr., said she had suffered a stroke while visiting relatives in the Philadelphia area.         Mrs. French was born into Philadelphia's Main Line society but spent most of her adult life in New York, where she was active in political causes and civic affairs. Although she had not held party office in the last decade, she remained influential in Democratic affairs until her death.         Last year Mrs. French devoted much of her energy to securing revision of the New York City Charter. As chairwoman of the charter committee of the Women's City Club, she lobbied for the changes that were adopted by the voters last November.         Helped Nazi Victims         Earlier this year the Unitarian Universalist Services Committee honored Mrs. French for her work in the aftermath of World War II, when she directed two rest homes in France operated by the church organization for survivors of Nazi concentration camps.         Mrs. French was most prominently in the public eye in 1964 when she tried unsuccessfully to wrest a seat in the House of Representatives from John V. Lindsay. As the Democratic-Liberal candidate in the ''Silk Stocking'' district on Manhattan's East Side, she waged a vigorous campaign but lost, receiving less than 25 percent of the vote.         Two years earlier she had been appointed New York City's first Commissioner to the United Nations, a post she held until her race for Congress.         Mrs. French was a delegate to five Democratic National Conventions, from 1964 through 1980, and was vice chairwoman of the state party from 1957 to 1960.         She attended the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., which she found progressive. But at 14, as the president of her class, she complained to the headmistress that because the school was all white she was not being prepared for the world in which she was going to live. She quoted the reply: ''My dear Ellie, we're not giving you the opportunity to make friends with Democrats either.''         A Stint as a Teacher         Mrs. French, who later became a member of the New York City Commission on Intergroup Relations, now the Commission on Human Rights, studied at the Sorbonne and at Harvard and Columbia.         In 1932, after her father, Herbert Lincoln Clark, a stockbroker, lost a fortune in the Depression, she returned to Shipley as a teacher and later became a supervisor at the Episcopal School in Overbrook, Pa.         In World War II she served in the Office of Inter-American Affairs in Washington. In 1949, after returning from France, she joined the staff of The New York Times and was named women's news editor. She resigned in 1955 to become more active in politics, and the following year she ran for the State Senate but lost. In 1957 she was appointed vice chairwoman of the Democratic State Committee to fill a vacancy, and in 1958 she won election to the post.         But two years later, in a split with the party's top leadership, she was out, charging that she and other women had not been given a real voice in Democratic affairs in the state.         Family members said yesterday that last Thursday Mrs. French had been pleased to stand in line for two hours for the chance to meet Nelson Mandela during his New York visit.         Mrs. French's husband, John, whom she married in 1950, died in 1984. Surviving are two stepsons, John Jr., of Manhattan, and Roberts, of Amherst, Mass., and a stepdaughter, Mary Moore of Cheyenne, Wyo.         A funeral service will be held on Monday at 11 A.M. at All Souls Unitarian Church, Lexington Aveue at 80th Street.

Besides enlivening many popular comedies, she proved her versatility in epics like ''Cimarron,'' her second film, which won her stardom; dramas like ''Back Street''; musicals; romances like ''Love Affair,'' and period films, including ''I Remember Mama.''         A regal beauty with a classic face, a trim figure, well-modulated speech and a pleasing soprano voice, she was a dedicated artist. To millions of moviegoers, she was a genteel charmer.         Oscar Eluded Her         Reviewers agreed that Miss Dunne's artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. She was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and popularity, an Oscar eluded her, as was the case with many stars of her era. But she was among six distinguished Americans awarded the Kennedy Center Honors in the performing arts in 1985.         Colleagues said they regarded Miss Dunne as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a co-star, hailed her as ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         A private person, she separated herself from the movie world when she left the set. She was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter from the New York Foundling Hospital.         Studied Music         Miss Dunne, who was of Irish descent, was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec. 20, 1898. (Some references put the year at 1901.) Her father was a steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, a pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended Loretta Academy, a Louisville convent school, and studied voice and piano with private teachers. She attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and won a contest and scholarship at the Chicago Musical College. After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected, she recalled, for being ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.'' Yet she later sang Gilbert and Sullivan operettas with the company one season, when, she remarked, the Met ''sent their youngest and thinnest singers on tour.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in several minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, she won the lead ingenue role of Magnolia for a 72-week national tour of ''Show Boat,'' the now-classic musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d musical based on Edna Ferber's novel about Mississippi River show folk.         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after six months of acting lessons, she won a leading role as Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Miss Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.'' Her superb portrayal of Sabra Cravat, a sturdy pioneer in the Oklahoma land rush who later becomes a member of Congress - aging half a century - brought her fame.         She was then cast in tragic roles like a handicapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a harried wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she battled a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 1930's         By the mid-1930's, her warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline''; the urbane ''Roberta,'' co-starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; ''Show Boat,'' with Helen Morgan, Allan Jones and Paul Robeson, and ''High, Wide and Handsome,'' an exuberant saga of the Pennsylvania oil rush.         Miss Dunne won her greatest popularity in comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a suggestive book and struggles to live up - or down - to it.         In other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying back talk and what Bosley Crowther, then film critic of The New York Times, termed ''pure poetry of motion.''         A Mother and a Queen         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her favorite of her 41 films, and received accolades for two wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was an indomitable Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's monarch in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian immigrant family in ''I Remember Mama.''         In her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by makeup, she played a frumpy, elderly Queen Victoria. In the 1950's, she made only occasional television appearances.         As she did less acting, she turned to other pursuits. She was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairwoman of many philanthropies, and she received several honorary doctorates and many other honors.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two grandchildren.         MAGNOLIA, MAMA AND MRS. ANNA         These are among the more than 40 films made by Irene Dunne during her 22-year film career:         Cimarron (1931)         Ann Vickers (1933)         Roberta (1935)         Magnificent Obsession (1935)         Show Boat (1936)         Theodora Goes Wild (1936)         The Awful Truth (1937)         Love Affair (1939)         My Favorite Wife (1940)         A Guy Named Joe (1943)         The White Cliffs of Dover (1944)         Anna and the King of Siam (1946)         Life With Father (1947)         I Remember Mama (1948)         The Mudlark (1950)       
        Marion Rosenwald Ascoli, a philanthropist who was a former chairwoman and president of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, died yesterday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 88 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.         Marion Rosenwald Ascoli, a philanthropist who was a former chairwoman and president of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, died yesterday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 88 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.         She died of arteriosclerotic heart disease, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Ascoli, a daughter of Julius Rosenwald, a Chicago clothier who was a chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Company, devoted most of her adult life to charitable causes, many of them involving child welfare. She was the widow of Dr. Max Ascoli, the editor and publisher of The Reporter magazine, who died in 1978.         Mrs. Ascoli's principal interest was promoting health services for children. She was active with the Citizens Committee for almost four decades and served as its president from 1960 to 1962 and chairwoman from 1962 to 1964, when she stepped down and became head of the committee's health section, a post she held until 1981.         Married Housing Specialist         At her death Mrs. Ascoli was an honorary vice president of the committee. She was also a former president of the New York Fund for Children and, from 1948 to 1960, was president of the Northside Center for Child Development in Harlem.         Mrs. Ascoli, a native of Chicago, attended Wellesley College for a year before she married Alfred K. Stern, a housing specialist who later became chairman of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. They were divorced in 1936. She married Dr. Ascoli in 1940.         Mrs. Ascoli, who lived in New York City for more than 50 years, moved to her summer home in Croton-on-Hudson seven years ago. Active in community affairs there, she gave 150 acres of her estate to the Teatown Lake Reservation, a conservation group.         Mrs. Ascoli is survived by two sons, Alfred R. Stern of Manhattan, and Peter M. Ascoli of Chicago; a brother, William Rosenwald of Manhattan; nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
        Ruth Wittenberg, who led fights to preserve historic buildings in Greenwich Village, including the Jefferson Market Courthouse, died in her sleep on Monday at her home on West 10th Street, where she had lived for 65 years. She was 91 years old.         Ruth Wittenberg, who led fights to preserve historic buildings in Greenwich Village, including the Jefferson Market Courthouse, died in her sleep on Monday at her home on West 10th Street, where she had lived for 65 years. She was 91 years old.         Mrs. Wittenberg was a familiar figure at City Hall and in other forums where she pleaded the case for preservation and against what she and her neighbors considered invasive development. She was a major force in gaining designation of the Greenwich Village Historic District two decades ago.         ''I'm kind of a landmark myself,'' Mrs. Wittenberg said in 1977 when, at the age of 79, she was honored for her many civic campaigns. She served on what is now Community Board 2 for almost four decades, having been appointed in 1951 to its predecessor, the Community Council for the Greenwich Village area, by the Manhattan Borough President, Robert F. Wagner. For many years she was chairwoman of the board's landmarks committee.         Board Meetings in Hospital         She was active in board affairs until shortly before her death. A small, energetic woman, she broke a hip in 1975 in a fall while walking on the Avenue of the Americas. Board 2's landmark committee meetings were held in her hospital room until she recovered, and in the years after that, she attended Board of Estimate and Planning Commission sessions in a wheelchair.         Born into a politically active family, she said one of her earliest memories was sitting on the knee of Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist leader.         Mrs. Wittenberg was born in Brooklyn and attended Hunter College and Barnard before quitting to help support her family by working as a demographer for the Bell Telephone Company, predicting population trends for expansion of telephone service.         Jailed as a Suffragist         As a suffragist before women won the right to vote, she was twice jailed. She marched in 1965 in Selma, Ala., in a civil rights demonstration with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..         Not all her battles were victories. She led Village residents in an unsuccessful fight against New York University's plan to construct the 12-story-high Elmer A. Bobst Library on Washington Square South, which residents regarded as too bulky for the site.         Her most conspicuous victory was for demolition of the Women's House of Detention on Greenwich Avenue at Christopher Street and conversion of the site into a community garden, together with preservation of the adjacent Jefferson Market Courthouse, now a branch public library.         Mrs. Wittenberg's husband, Philip, to whom she was married in 1919, died three years ago. She is survived by a daughter, Susanna Berger of New Rochelle, N.Y.; a son, Jonathan, of Tuckahoe, N.Y., five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Amanda Bryan Kane, former chairwoman of the trustees of Smith College, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Charlottesville, Va. She was 86 years old and lived in Charlottesville and Wickford, R.I.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her daughter Hope Childs of Washington.         Mrs. Kane served on the boards of the Foxcroft School, the Brearley School, the Vocational Advisory Service and the national Y.W.C.A.         She was a graduate of Foxcroft and Smith College.         Besides Mrs. Childs, she is survived by a brother, D. Tennant Bryan of Richmond; three other daughters, Anne McGuire and Shelah Scott, both of Charlottesville, and Constance Tucker of Cincinnati; 11 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
