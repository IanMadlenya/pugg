Margaret Campbell, the chairwoman of the Washington Square Music Festival since 1956, died of a heart attack Sunday at University Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and had lived in lower Manhattan since 1922.         ''I was brought up to believe that one should contribute to the community somehow,'' Mrs. Campbell said in an interview last year, ''and the Washington Square Music Festival is my baby.'' The festival, which presents free chamber-orchestra concerts in Washington Square Park every summer, was founded in 1953 by the violinist Alexander Schneider and the Washington Square Association.         ''Alexander Schneider suggested producing concerts in the square,'' Mrs. Campbell recalled last year. ''The idea worked, and then it fell to me to take it over. My husband asked me what I knew about music. Well, I didn't know very much, but I've learned a lot.'' In the festival's early days, Mrs. Campbell used to carry scrapbooks and petitions to local businesses and corporations to keep the festival solvent. In 1953, the entire budget was $1,300; last year's festival, which presented four concerts, had a budget of $30,000. A Grove Street Resident         Mrs. Campbell, known as Peggy, was born in Audubon, Iowa, in 1900. Her father, William Green, served as a United States Representative, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and, later, as a Federal judge.         Mrs. Campbell is survived by a daughter, Peggy Friedman, and two grandchildren, Matthew and Susannah Friedman, all of Manhattan.         There will be a memorial service Friday at 11 A.M. at Grace Episcopal Church, 801 Broadway, at 10th Street.       
        Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Mrs. Green, a Democrat, started out as a schoolteacher and went on to serve 10 years in Congress.         After defeating Tom McCall, who later became Governor of Oregon, Mrs. Green represented the state's Third Congressional District from 1954 to 1974. She rose to the second-highest position on the House Education and Labor Committee and served as chairwoman of its Subcommittee on Higher Education. In that capacity, she pushed for passage of legislation creating the first Federal scholarships for college undergraduates.         Senator Mark O. Hatfield, a Republican who was a friend of Mrs. Green for 40 years, said yesterday: ''She was probably the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress. On any important legislation, such as women's rights or education or dealing with minorities or poor people, she could switch people's votes on the floor through the power of her intellect and her ability to persuade. People listened because when Edith Green spoke, she spoke from the heart as well as the mind.'' Role in Anti-Poverty Legislation         In 1967, for example, Mrs. Green played a key, though behind-the-scenes, role in passage of major anti-poverty legislation proposed by President Johnson. In large part through her efforts, a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats against the bill was splintered when she drafted and lobbied for an amendment that met the demands of some of the Southerners. Despite those efforts, President Johnson and Mrs. Green did not like each other, largely because of her early opposition to the buildup of troops in Vietnam.         Mrs. Green, a native of South Dakota, went to Willamette University in Salem, Ore., in the late 1920's and, after graduating, started teaching elementary school in Salem, according to a son, James S. Green of Gresham, Ore. She became involved in politics after working with the Oregon Education Association.         She was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the platform committee. At the urging of the candidate, she gave a seconding speech for the Presidential nomination of Adlai E. Stevenson. Four years later, she was asked to second the nomination of John F. Kennedy for President. At the time, she was serving as chairman of the Kennedy campaign committee in Oregon. President Kennedy later named her as a member of the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. And he also offered her the ambassadorship to Canada, but she declined. Advocate for Women's Rights         Mr. Green said his mother was a supporter of women's rights, but without stridence. ''She realized that she had to work with the men before she knocked them over,'' Mr. Green said. ''The key is to work with them, she said, and she was very good at it. I think her colleagues would testify to that.''         Mr. Hatfield said Mrs. Green ''probably had more direct personal role in writing education-related legislation than any other person.'' He also described her as ''foremost in the effort to bring about equal pay for equal work.''         And, the Senator continued: ''She also was remarkable in this business that I'm in, in that she could walk away from it, which she did at the height of her career. She did not run again when she could have been re-elected for life.'' Mrs. Green did not seek re-election in 1974.         After retiring, she became a professor of government at Warner Pacific College and in 1976 she served as co-chairwoman of the National Democrats for Gerald Ford. In 1979, she was appointed to serve on the Oregon Board of Higher Education.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Green's survivors include another son, Richard, of Annandale, Va.; two sisters, Ruth Costello of Berkeley Springs, W.Va., and Mildred Cleaveland of San Andreas, Calif.; and four grandchildren. week, but details were not complete yesterday.

        Wynne Gibson, known for her wordless role as a suddenly rich lady of the night in the 1930's movie ''If I Had a Million,'' died on May 14 in a nursing home in Laguna Niguel, Calif. She was 81 years old, and had suffered a stroke.         Wynne Gibson, known for her wordless role as a suddenly rich lady of the night in the 1930's movie ''If I Had a Million,'' died on May 14 in a nursing home in Laguna Niguel, Calif. She was 81 years old, and had suffered a stroke.         Miss Gibson, who served on the board of Actors' Equity and as chairwoman of the Equity Library Theater, had starring or featured parts in more than 30 movies, as well as roles on Broadway, radio and television.         In the 1932 production of ''If I Had a Million,'' she was one of a series of stars - including Charles Laughton, George Raft, Gary Cooper and W. C. Fields - who performed separate sequences.         A native of New York, Miss Gibson ran away from school at age 16 and landed a job in a chorus line on Broadway. That job lasted only two weeks because Ray Raymond, a vaudeville dancer, spotted her on stage and asked her to be his partner. Within a year, she won the role of the flapper in the touring company of ''The Gingham Girl,'' and soon after was signed to the title role of ''Little Jessie James.''         Among her other movie roles were ''I Give My Love,'' ''The Captain Hates the Sea,'' ''Her Bodyguard'' and ''The Crime of the Century.''         Miss Gibson had no survivors.

Schapiro, a lawyer and an early advocate of child care for working parents in New York, died of natural causes Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93 years old.         Mrs. Schapiro was a founder in the late 1930's of the All Day Neighborhood Schools program. The program, with the help of such settlement houses as the Hudson Guild, helped to educate the children of working parents during and after regular school hours.         She was the chairwoman of the Little Red School House and the Elisabeth Irwin High School in Manhattan, and the founder and chairwoman of the associates of the New School for Social Research.

        Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Born in the Clasons Point section of the East Bronx, she held the borough's at-large seat on the Council for more than 17 years. A Democrat, she had been a teacher in the city's school system and had served three and a half terms in the State Legislature before her election to the Council in 1965.         Her political career, which ended in 1983 when the at-large Council seats were abolished, was devoted largely to education and consumer causes. At budget time she often tangled with the Koch administration over what she considered to be meager funds for the public libraries. Author of Food Laws         Her legislative triumphs included the sponsorship of a law to require dairies to place dates on their milk cartons. Another law she sponsored mandated that supermarkets must list unit prices as well as package prices.         As chairwoman of the Council's General Welfare Committee, she was at the center of some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's. She was chairwoman of a series of long public hearings on proposals to require all-male private clubs to admit women.         Her position on measures that sought to guarantee the civil rights of the city's homosexuals was equivocal at times, but her handling of the issue enhanced her reputation as a skilled parliamentarian. In 1978 she scheduled hearings on the rights bill the day after the November election, leading to accusations by proponents of the bill that she had chosen a day when the public and news media would be absorbed in other matters.         On another crucial occasion the bill was stalled in the Welfare Committee when she failed to return from lunch for an important vote, even though supporters of the bill were counting on her vote. Elected to Assembly         Mrs. Ryan went into politics after her husband, E. Gerard Ryan, a lawyer, died. Only a handful of women had served in the New York State Assembly when she was elected to the Legislature in 1958.         She was active in Bronx politics in her 10 years as a teacher, and she was a former vice president of the Siwanoy Democratic Club, now defunct. She was a charter member of the Bronx Historical Society and a member of the League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Ryan was also a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Business and Professional Women's Club of New York and the Order of Our Lady of the Holy Sepulchre.         Born Aileen Barlow, she attended Public School 47 in the Bronx, Cathederal High School, Hunter College and the New York University Law School. Manhattan College awarded an honorary doctorate to her in 1974.         She was a lifelong resident of the Bronx until she moved to Point Lookout, L.I., about two years ago.         She is survived by two sons, Gerald Ryan of Rockville Centre, L.I., and Francis X. Ryan of Muttontown, L.I.; a daughter, Allana Chesney of Point Lookout, and three grandchildren.         A wake will be held today and tomorrow from 2 to 5 P.M. and from 7 to 9 P.M. at O'Shea's Funeral Home in Wantagh, L.I. A funeral mass is scheduled for 10:30 A.M. Wednesday at St. Helena's Roman Catholic Church in the Bronx.
