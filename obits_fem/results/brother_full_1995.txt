         Reva Rubin, who was among the first specialists in maternity nursing, died on Saturday at her home in Harrisville, Pa. She was 76 and also lived in Panama City, Fla.         The cause was a heart attack, said officials at the University of Pittsburgh, where Professor Rubin had taught for 21 years before retiring in 1981.         In scores of case studies she observed and documented as a nurse, midwife and teacher, she examined how mothers use a variety of senses -- sight, smell and touch -- to become familiar with their newborns.  To encourage the bonding that she observed, she was an early proponent of keeping the mother and the newborn together as much as possible during the first days after birth.         By the 1980's, the concept that there is a special time right after birth during which mothers become emotionally attached to their babies began to receive criticism from some researchers, although the changes in hospital practice that the research wrought were never questioned.         She was the author of "The Maternal Identity and the Maternal Experience" (Springer, 1984). In 1972, she was a founder with her companion and longtime professional colleague, Dr. Florence H. Erickson of the Maternal Child Care Nursing Journal, the first research journal in the field. Together, they also established master's and doctoral programs in nursing at the University of Pittsburgh.         A graduate of Hunter College in 1941, she went on to Yale to receive master's degrees in nursing in 1946 and in mental health in 1954. She taught at Yale and the University of Chicago before joining the University of Pittsburgh in 1960.         Besides Dr. Erickson of Harrisville, she is survived by a brother, Harry, of Cape Coral, Fla.       
         Vivian Cadden, a New York writer and magazine editor, died on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cardiovascular disease, her family said.         A former senior editor of Redbook and McCall's magazines, she became the founding editor of Working Mother in 1978. She retired as its editor in 1990 but continued to write for the magazine.         She contributed to publications including Life, The Nation, Mademoiselle and Parents. Her articles often dealt with political matters, and she interviewed national and international figures.         She was born in the Bronx, graduated from Vassar College in 1938 and studied economics at Columbia University.         Her husband, Joseph E. Cadden, died in 1980. She is survived by two daughters, Joan, of Gambier, Ohio, and Wendy, of Falls Creek, N.M.; a son, Frank, of Manhattan; a brother, Bernard Liebman, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and one grandson.       
         Dr. Janine Andre-Schwartz, an immunologist and specialist in electron microscopy, died on April 26 at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 62 and lived in Brookline, Mass.         The cause was cancer, said a spokeswoman at the center, where she was a medical researcher in the division of hematology/oncology.         Dr. Andre-Schwartz was also an associate professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. She had been on the staff of both institutions for 26 years. Working with the electron microscope, she contributed to research on immunological disease.         Dr. Andre-Schwartz did much of her research in collaboration with her husband, Dr. Robert S. Schwartz, now deputy editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Andre-Schwartz is survived by a son, Louis-George Schwartz of New York City; two sisters, Francoise Poutiers of Bordeaux, France, and Claude Andre of Paris, and a brother, Jean-Pierre Andre, also of Paris.       
         Rochelle Pittman, whose legal battle in a tainted blood scandal led to a continuing national inquiry into the state of Canada's blood supplies, died Wednesday at her home in Toronto. She was 57.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said her son Tom Pittman.         Mrs. Pittman is credited with putting a human face on the struggle for redress waged by the more than 1,000 people in Canada who contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through tainted blood and blood products.         "She made a difference in a lot of people's lives," said her lawyer, Ken Arenson. "She got calls from perfect strangers asking her how to deal with this  or that problem."         Her husband, Ken Pittman, a store chain executive, died in 1990 of H.I.V.-related pneumonia without knowing he was infected. He had received a tainted transfusion after cardiac surgery at Toronto General Hospital in 1984.         Dr. Stanley Bain, the family doctor, knew that Mr. Pittman was infected, but  never told the couple because, as the doctor later testified, he feared the information would send Mr. Pittman into a depression. He also said he had mistakenly believed that the couple was no longer having sex.         Five months after her husband died, Mrs. Pittman, who had worked as a jewelry saleswoman in Toronto, was told she also had the virus.         At a news conference in January 1992 at the Ontario legislature, Mrs. Pittman, a tiny, stylish, retiring woman, announced the start of what became a rocky three-year legal battle for redress.         In March last year an Ontario judge awarded her $375,000 in compensation. Dr. Bain, a former President of the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons, was  held 40 percent liable. The Canadian Red Cross and Toronto General Hospital split the remaining amount equally.         In addition, the same institution Dr. Bain had headed found him guilty of misconduct and suspended him from the practice of medicine for two months.         In her decision, an Ontario judge, Susan Lang, wrote that had Mr. Pittman been told, he might have lived two more years and avoided infecting Mrs. Pittman.         For Canada it was a heart-wrenching story, followed in all its intricate twists on newspaper front pages and on national television. At a news conference at the time of the award, Mrs. Pittman observed that while she was happy with the judgment, "No amount of money can compensate me and my family for the loss of a husband and a father. Nor will it change the fact that I will likely experience the same fate."         Her son Tom said that over the last four to six weeks her health went into a  significant decline. "Last Thursday she announced she didn't want to fight any longer. She was determined to have the end come on quickly. But she lingered until Wednesday. The last day she was in a sort of coma."         He said she had been reconciled to the cruelty of her fate. "Anger and bitterness were there, but they didn't consume her in the end. She rose above that."         Mrs. Pittman is survived by her four children: Tom, of Toronto; Mrs. Kelly Blackwood of Kincardine, Ontario; Mark Pittman of Newmarket, Ontario; and Mrs. Kathy Fenton of Toronto; her mother, Mrs. Evelyn Borden, of Toronto; a sister, Mrs. Gail Stanzel of Toronto; and a brother, Dave Winaut, of Liverpool, Nova Scotia, and six grandchildren.       
         Julia Adler Foshko, the last surviving member of a generation of Adlers who began their theatrical careers on stage with their parents in the Yiddish theater, died yesterday at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. She was 97 and  had been a resident of the Actors Fund Home in Englewood for many years.         Although she was eventually eclipsed by her younger siblings, Stella and Luther, Miss Adler, the middle of the five children of Jacob and Sarah Adler, the founding stars of the American Yiddish theater, had her moments in the spotlight.         Among other Broadway roles in the 1920's, she played Shylock's daughter, Jessica, in the David Warfield production of "The Merchant of Venice," and was cast by David Belasco as the star of "Rosa Machree."         Her last Broadway appearance was in the 1939 revival of the Clifford Odets play "Awake and Sing!" in a part originated by her sister Stella in the initial  production four years earlier. "Julia Adler," wrote Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times, "improves a little upon Stella Adler's playing."         She later toured with her brother Luther in "Tovarich," which appeared at the City Center in 1952.         Like her brothers and sisters -- including two older full siblings, Frances and Jay, and three still older half siblings, Abe, Charles and Celia Adler, born from her father's two previous marriages and an intervening liason in Russia --  Miss Adler began her career early.         The Adler children were generally thrust on stage as toddlers, but Julia, who was born on July 4, 1897, almost broke the record. According to family legend, she arrived moments after her mother had completed a matinee performance in Philadelphia.         There were a lot of Adler mouths to feed, but, fortunately, there were a lot  of parts to go around.         In 1930, the family, including Julia and her mother, Sarah, took 9 of the 10  roles of a George Jessel production, "Millions." The Adlers graciously allowed the director, Joseph Schoenhold, to play the 10 part.         Miss Adler's older siblings, Frances and Jay, died many years ago. Luther, died in 1984 at the age of 81, and Stella, who operated a celebrated Method acting school in New York City, died in 1992 at the age of 91.         Miss Adler, whose husband, Joseph Foshko, the artist, died many years ago, is survived by a daughter, Judy Sure, of Nantucket; three grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.       
         Anne Ratner, a music patron who kept alive the idea of the music salon, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Ms. Ratner put on concerts by first-rate artists in the living room of her Riverside Drive apartment. Among those who appeared, often more than once, were the Emerson and Juilliard Quartets, the singers Arleen Auger and Cecilia Bartoli and the pianists Richard Goode, Jeffrey Kahane and Andras Schiff. Appearance at these evenings became somewhat of a status symbol among musicians, and they often served as showcases for emerging talents.         Ms. Ratner, who organized these evenings by herself, asked each person in the small audiences for at least $30, but personal profit was not on her mind. Ms. Ratner was born in Russia and reared in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She studied the piano and in 1929 married Hyman Ratner. After her husband died in 1960, she taught at the League Center for Seriously Disturbed Children in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The salon concerts -- up to 18 per season -- developed through her work at the center and served as benefit events for the center and for Camphill Village, a community in Copake, N.Y., for mentally handicapped adults.         She is survived by two daughters, Molly Finn of Manhattan and Judy Pitt of Leonia, N.J.; two sisters, Rebecca Jarmon of Forest Hills, Queens, and Mina Gudeon of Sunrise, Fla.; a brother, Saul Kamen of North Hills, L.I., eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Edith Ferry Hooper, a philanthropist who supported art and educational institutions in Baltimore, died on May 27 at the Brightwood Retirement Community in Brooklandville, near Baltimore. She was 85 and lived until recently in North Baltimore.         Mrs. Hooper was born and reared in Grosse Pointe, Mich., the daughter of Dexter Mason Ferry, an insurance executive who was the founder of the Ferry Seed Company, and Jeanette Hawkins. She was a graduate of Vassar College.         In the late 1930's and early 40's, she worked at the Detroit Institute of Arts and at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. After her marriage in 1945 to Arthur Upshur Hooper, a Baltimore lawyer who died in 1970, she became involved with the Baltimore Museum of Art. She was board president of the museum from 1973 to 1975, a trustee from 1957 to 1977 and an honorary trustee until her death.         Because of her intense interest in modern art, which she collected, a wing of the Baltimore museum was named after her 1981. For several years it housed her gifts of photographs, drawings, sculptures and paintings by Picasso, Ellsworth Kelly and Jasper Johns.         Mrs. Hooper was the president of the Bryn Mawr School in North Baltimore, a private school for girls, from 1963 to 1970. She also headed the building program of its lower school, which she persuaded Marcel Breuer, the Hungarian-born New York architect, to design. Earlier, Mr. Breuer had built and expanded two of her homes.         She is survived by three daughters, Kate Hooper Gorman of Piermont, N.Y.; Jeanette Williams of Mount Washington, Md., and Queene Hooper Foster of Manhattan; a brother, Dexter Ferry of Detroit, and six grandchildren.       
         Johana Harris, a pianist, composer and teacher and the widow of the composer Roy Harris, died on June 5 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 82.         Mrs. Harris, whose original name was Beula Duffey, was born in Ottawa on Dec. 31, 1912. In the early 1920's she studied with Henry Puddicombe, a student of Liszt, and at his suggestion she moved to New York in 1924 to study with Ernest Hutcheson at the Juilliard School. A year later, at the age of 17, she joined the Juilliard faculty as an assistant.         She married Roy Harris in 1937, and it was his idea to change her first name to Johana, in tribute to Johann Sebastian Bach.         Mrs. Harris began recording for RCA Victor soon after her marriage, and immediately caught the attention of the record world with the first recording of the difficult Busoni arrangement of the Bach Chaconne. She also recorded most of Beethoven's solo and chamber works, works by her husband, by Schoenberg, Debussy and Piston, and the Ginastera Piano Sonata, which was composed for her in 1952. All told, she made more than 100 recordings.         She was a member of the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles until 1993, and continued to perform until April 1994.         Mr. Harris died in 1979. Mrs. Harris is survived by her second husband, Jake Heggie of San Francisco; two sons, Shaun Harris of Livermore, Calif., and Dan Harris of Indio, Calif; three daughters, Patricia Connelly of Santa Monica, Calif., Maureen Forman of Palm Desert, Calif., and Lane Murray of Tahoe City, Calif., and a brother, Norman Duffey of Lakeland, Fla.       
         Nell Michel Sawyer, a volunteer for the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and other New York institutions, died on Monday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. A lifelong resident of Manhattan and Southampton, she was 50.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Sawyer's husband, David H. Sawyer, a media and political consultant, died at 59 on July 2 while under treatment for a brain tumor.         Mrs. Sawyer, a graduate of Briarcliff College, was the daughter of Barbara and Clifford Michel, an investment banker and senior partner in Loeb, Rhoades & Company and Kuhn Loeb & Company.         She was a board member of the American Ballet Theater. She was also a past chairwoman of the special projects committee at Sloan-Kettering and a longtime volunteer at the Buckley, Taft and Episcopal schools.         She is survived by three sons, Andrew McFarland, Gavin McFarland and Luke Sawyer, all of Manhattan; a brother, Clifford Michel of Gladstone, N.J., and a sister, Julienne Michel of Santa Fe, N.M.       
         Dr. Berta Vogel Scharrer, a pioneering biomedical scientist and founding faculty member of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University, died on Sunday at her home in the Bronx. She was 88.         Harvard University, conferring an honorary doctorate on Dr. Scharrer in 1982, said her "research journeys into the world of insects have profoundly affected the study of human physiology." The particular insect she had studied since 1937 was the South American cockroach.         Dr. Scharrer's specialty was neuroendocrinology, the study of the interaction between the nervous and endocrine systems. At her death, she was distinguished professor emeritus of anatomy and structural biology and of neuroscience at Einstein. She had been affiliated with the college since it was founded in 1955. She reached emeritus status in 1978 but continued her research until a few months ago.         In 1928, Dr. Ernst Scharrer, her future husband, working in Germany, discovered what he called gland-nerve cells in the hypothalamus of a fish's brain. From this, the Scharrers developed the concept of neurosecretion -- secretions from nerve cells -- that gave rise in the 1930's and early 1940's to neuroendocrinology as a new discipline.         Berta Vogel was born in Munich, Germany, and received a doctorate in biology from the University of Munich in 1930. She married Dr. Scharrer in 1934, and they remained a team at Einstein until his accidental drowning in 1965. Though not Jewish, the Scharrers left Germany in 1937 because of Hitler's policies.         Early in their collaboration, they decided on a comparative approach, dividing the animal kingdom so that he would study vertebrates and she invertebrates. They determined that certain principles found in an insect could explain certain things about mammalian systems, and vice versa.         Their discovery of neurosecretions took years to find acceptance, as their peers resisted the notion that neurons could dispatch neurohormonal, blood-borne signals, an activity previously associated only with the hormonal endocrine cells.         Once neuroendocrinology became established, Dr. Scharrer received many honorary degrees and other honors in the United States and in Europe. She was given the National Medal of Science at a White House ceremony in 1985.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Karl Vogel of Neustadt, Germany, and a sister, Lotte Vogel of Munich.       
         Erika Lehnsen, one of the first art therapists to work with children, died on Sunday at the Andrus retirement home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. Until recently, Miss Lehnsen, who was 90, was a resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         Miss Lehnsen and her associates, including Elinor Ulman and Bernard Levy, were among the founders of the art therapy field.         Born in a small town near Berlin, she studied at an innovative school where practicing artists taught free and applied art. After Nazi persecution prompted her departure from Germany, she joined her brother in Guatemala, where he had founded a boarding school. There, she taught art and art appreciation and discovered her interest in the artwork of young children.         She moved to the United States in 1954 and received a master's degree in psychology at the New School for Social Research. She worked for 14 years at Montefiore Medical Center before retiring 20 years ago.       
         Susan McAllister Swap, an educator and writer who focused on involving parents in their children's schools, died last Thursday at her home in Winchester, Mass. She was 50.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         Dr. Swap joined the faculty of Wheelock College in Boston in 1977 and taught courses in child development, special education, consultation and parent studies. A past chairwoman of the department of professional studies, she was a professor of education and psychology.         Most recently she directed the Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning, and the Center on College-School-Community Partnerships, two research programs at Wheelock.         She wrote articles about home-school partnerships and promoting the academic success of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Her books in print are "Managing an Effective Interview Program" (Teachers College, 1984), "Parent Involvement and Success for All Children: What We Know Now" (Institute for Responsive Education, 1990), "Schools Reaching Out and Success for All Children: Two Case Studies" (Institute for Responsive Education, 1990), and "Developing Home-School Partnerships: From Concept to Practice" (Teachers College, 1993).         Born in Bridgeport, Conn., she graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe College and earned her Ph.D. in education and psychology at the University of Michigan. She taught at Tufts University before moving to Wheelock.         Dr. Swap is survived by her husband, Walter; a son, Clifford; a daughter, Alison, all of Winchester; her parents, John and Pauline McAllister of Fairfield, Conn.; two sisters, Joan Howard of Winterville, Ga., and June McAllister of Stratford, Conn., and a brother, Jef McAllister of Great Falls, Va.       
         Dr. Ethel Emerson Wortis, a physician long active in civic affairs, died on Sunday at the San Simeon Nursing Home in Greenport, L.I. A former resident of New York City, she was 93 and lived in Southold, L.I.         For nearly three decades, she was associated with the Women's City Club of New York, holding various offices, including that of president in the 1950's. She was a past president of the Women's Medical Association of New York City and was active in the League of Women Voters, the Women's Prison Association and the Society of Friends.         Dr. Wortis was born in New York City, the daughter of Dr. Haven Emerson, a former City Commissioner of Health. She graduated from Radcliffe College and, in 1927, from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.         Early in her career, she worked as a doctor at the Bronxville School in Bronxville, N.Y. She was later visiting physician at Goldwater Memorial Hospital, on Roosevelt Island, and, in the 1970's, a doctor in the Suffolk County Outreach Unit's mobile health clinic. She retired just over 10 years ago.         Dr. Wortis is survived by two sons, Michael, of Burnaby, British Columbia, and Ethan, of Huntington, L.I.; a sister, Ruth Cooke of Kennett Square, Pa.; a brother, John H. Emerson of Arlington, Mass., and four grandchildren. Her husband, Dr. S. Bernard Wortis, died in 1969 after 35 years of marriage.       
         Jolie Hammer Kinsolving, a government affairs adviser and a former deputy borough president of Manhattan, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital. A resident of the Upper East Side, she was 62.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         She went to work for City Council President Sanford Garelik in 1970, often representing him on the Board of Estimate. Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton named her his deputy in 1974.         In 1978, she became an aide to Robert F. Wagner Jr., then chairman of the City Planning Commission and later deputy mayor. Since leaving government in 1985, she worked for the Manhattan law firm of Rosenman & Colin.         She is survived by her husband, Charles M. Kinsolving Jr.; a son, Ronald Hammer of Darien, Conn.; a brother, Dr. Richard Brockman of Manhattan; a sister, Susan Brockman of Manhattan; her stepmother, Elizabeth Brockman of Manhattan, and one grandson. Her marriage to Gordon Hammer ended in divorce.       
         Marcia Cayne, president of the Association of Reform Zionists of America and a member of the Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations, died on Saturday at Tarzana Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 57 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, the association said.         Born Marcia Liebert in Brooklyn, Ms. Cayne moved to Southern California in 1970 and became active in the Zionist association on the local level in 1981, shortly after it was formed. She was elected president of the organization's Pacific-Southwest Region in 1987 and president of the association in 1993.         The association has chapters in more than 600 Reform synagogues and promotes Reform activities in Israel. It seeks equality for all Jewish denominations in Israel, where religious life has traditionally been dominated by strict Orthodox Judaism.         Ms. Cayne was associated with many Jewish causes. She was a trustee and member of the executive committee of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and was active in groups like the World Zionist Organization and the American Zionist Movement.         She was a delegate to the World Zionist Congress in 1987 and 1992 and was chairwoman of several Congress committees. She was also a member of the Zionist General Council.         Not long after her election as president, she became a leading defender of a gay synagogue in New York, Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, which the American Zionist Youth Foundation suddenly shut out of the 1993 Salute to Israel Parade. She called the exclusion "a shameful surrender to the forces of right-wing orthodoxy" that had diminished the cause of Jewish unity.         The congregation and its supporters among Reform organizations celebrated Israel's independence separately in a midtown synagogue that year.         Ms. Cayne is survived by her husband, Maurice Cayne; a daughter, Naomi Finerman of San Rafael, Calif., and a brother, David Liebert of Carlsbad, Calif.       
         Fay Honey Knopp, an advocate of peace and civil rights who founded a Quaker ministry for men and women in prisons around the country, died on Thursday at her home in Shoreham, Vt. A former resident of Westport, Conn., she was 76.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, her family said in reporting her death this week.         A longtime Quaker minister to prisons, Mrs. Knopp retired two years ago as director of the Safer Society Program, which operates under the auspices of the New York State Council of Churches. The program, a national referral service for sex offenders seeking therapy, grew out of her visits to prison and the Prison Research Education Action Program she founded in 1976.         Under her leadership, an affiliated service, the Safer Society Press, produced about 20 books, research studies, manuals and training videos dealing with the treatment and prevention of sex-related crimes and intended for abusers and their victims.         Her affiliation with the Society of Friends dated to a peace demonstration in 1939. She became a Quaker in 1962 and was designated a "minister of record" to serve as a prison visitor throughout the Federal penitentiary system.         Over the years she also served as director of the New York Region of the American Friends Service Committee, projects director for the National Peace Education Division in Philadelphia and counselor to many conscientious objectors.         Prevention of sexual abuse was a major concern in her nearly 40 years of work with prisoners and, she said, she would be "tough with those guys."         "Society has let them off the hook by just locking them up," she told an interviewer in 1988. "I'm very up front with them. Yes, most of them were sexually abused as children, but that can't be an excuse to go out and abuse other people."         A native of Bridgeport, Conn., she studied at the Hartford Art School, the New School for Social Research and the University of California at Los Angeles.         She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Burton; a daughter, Prof. Sari Biklen of Syracuse; a son, State Representative Alex Knopp of Norwalk, Conn.; two sisters, Isabelle Yolen and Sylvia Wittenberg, both of Laguna Beach, Calif.; a brother, Leonard Irving of Fairfield, Conn., and four grandchildren.       
         Oveta Culp Hobby, the creator of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps in World War II, the first Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and a longtime executive at the recently closed Houston Post, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 90.         Mrs. Hobby, whose media holdings made her one of the nation's richest women, suffered a stroke in April, her family said.         She went from being a small-town lawyer's well-read daughter to being a regular on fashion magazines' lists of well-dressed women, with her trendy designer gowns and hats from Bergdorf Goodman. She took lessons that erased the drawl from her conversations about the Picasso paintings she collected or the Bartok concertos she heard at the Houston Symphony. She also reorganized the business department of The Houston Post from top to bottom, and she later developed a reputation as a hard-working administrator who prized efficiency in government.         But she was not one to demand the credit.         "Everything that ever happened to me fell in my lap," she once said. "And nothing in my life would have been possible without Governor."         "Governor" was William P. Hobby, an easy-going newspaperman who was the top elected official in Texas from 1917 to 1921; his most notable action as Governor was to call out the state militia to crush a dock strike.         He was hired as publisher of The Houston Post-Dispatch at about the same time that Miss Culp, a friend of Florence Sterling, whose millionaire brother owned the paper, got a job in the circulation department.         Mr. Hobby's first wife died a year later. A couple of years later, after Miss Culp lost a campaign for a seat in the State Legislature, they were seen socializing around Houston. In 1931, when she was 26 and he 53, they were married.         "Will, she'll embarrass you," one of her husband's friends warned. "She doesn't give a hang about clothes."         But she learned to; in the 1950's her name appeared regularly on the lists of best-dressed women. She also learned about newspapers. The Hobbys eventually acquired ownership of The Post and she worked as a book reviewer, copy editor and editorial writer.         Their first child, William P. Hobby Jr., was born on Mrs. Hobby's 27th birthday, and her daughter, Jessica, on her 32d. As the publisher's wife, she became president of the Texas League of Women Voters, a member of the board of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, a member of the Houston Symphony Orchestra Committee and regional chairman of the Mobilization for Human Needs, all before she was 35.         Mrs. Hobby was born on Jan. 19, 1905, in Killeen, Tex., the daughter of Isaac and Emma Hoover Culp. Her first name was an Indian word that her parents chose because it rhymed with with Juanita, the name of one of her sisters.         Oveta soon demonstrated her independent-mindedness. A temperance campaign swept Killeen when she was 5, and her Sunday school class was asked to sign a pledge. She politely refused. Her grandmother heard about her refusal and had a switch ready. Not until afterward did her grandmother ask why she had refused. "I did not sign because I did not know what that word means -- temperance," she said. Her grandmother apologized.         She was her father's favorite; at 10 she read the Congressional Record in his office, and when he won a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1919 she went with him to Austin.         She briefly attended Mary Hardin Baylor College at Belton, Tex. Miss Culp was soon on the state payroll, in a job codifying statutes for the State Banking Committee. In 1925, when she was 20, a year shy of being old enough to vote, she was appointed parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature. Later she wrote a handbook on parliamentary procedure, "Mr. Chairman," which was used as a textbook throughout the state.         "If I hadn't been parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature, other things would never have been sparked," she said later. "Twenty is a wonderful age for things to be sparked."         One of the things sparked by her duties in Austin was an interest in politics. The 1928 Democratic National Convention was held in Houston, and she worked on senatorial and mayoral campaigns. She later ran for a seat in the State Legislature. Her opponent whispered that she was "a parliamentarian and a Unitarian." She lost. It was the last time she ran for office.         Mrs. Hobby was in Washington in 1941 for a meeting at the Federal Communications Commission -- the family owned radio station KPRC-AM -- when Gen. David Searles asked her to organize a section on women's activities for the Army. The War Department had been receiving 10,000 letters a day from women who wanted to serve their country. But Mrs. Hobby turned him down, saying that she had a husband, two children and a job.         General Searles asked her to draw up an organization chart with recommendations on ways that women could serve, and she did. He repeated his request that she go to work in Washington. She repeated her refusal. Then she told her husband.         "You shouldn't have made him have to ask you a second time," Mr. Hobby reportedly said at the time. "Any thoughtful person knows that we are in this war, and that every one of us is going to have to do whatever we are called upon to do." Mrs. Hobby went to Washington.         Her job was completely new in American military history, and she had to write her own rules. The idea of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps -- the name was changed to Women's Army Corps in 1943 -- was not well received by male commanders. Sergeants had jeeps, but Mrs. Hobby, who held the rank of colonel, had to call for a car from the War Department motor pool.         Members of the WACs enlisted for noncombat duty as medical technicians, cartography clerks, secretaries and similar types of jobs in the United States and in every war theater. By the end of World War II, about 100,000 women had joined the WAC. The organization was dissolved in 1978.         Mrs. Hobby received the Distinguished Service Medal in January 1945 for outstanding service "without guidance or precedents in United States military history.         Back in Houston, she renewed her political contacts and expanded the circulation of The Post, where she was an executive vice president and a director of KPRC, which came to include not only the AM station but also FM and television outlets.         Although she considered herself a conservative Democrat, she backed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, a Republican, when he ran for President in 1948, and Dwight D. Eisenhower in his successful Presidential campaign in 1952.         In return for her support, Mrs. Hobby was appointed to succeed Oscar E. Ewing as head of the Federal Security Agency. Her post did not have full Cabinet status when she was sworn in, but it was soon elevated to that rank and its name was changed to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mrs. Hobby was the nation's second woman to hold a Cabinet post; the first, Frances Perkins, was Secretary of Labor under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945.         In 31 months in charge of the department, which had a $1.7 billion annual budget, she oversaw the development of nurses training programs and a hospital reinsurance plan. She was also involved in the announcement of the Salk polio vaccine, and was praised at the time for having the patience to hold the announcement until the vaccine had been properly tested.         When Mrs. Hobby resigned, Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey was so dismayed that he said, "What? The best man in the Cabinet?"         Mrs. Hobby's reason for leaving Washington was straightforward: "Nothing is as important as Governor."         Her husband had been ill, but he improved once she was back in Houston. For the next nine years, until his death in 1964, they worked out of adjacent offices at The Post or a single large room in their home.         Mrs. Hobby sold The Post to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company in 1983 for about $130 million. The paper changed hands again a few years later, and was finally closed earlier this year.         In 1992, H&C Communications Inc., another family enterprise, sold its five television stations. The sale left H&C with only one broadcast outlet, the Hobby's original station, KPRC-AM in Houston.         Besides her son, who was the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991 and was recently named chancellor of the University of Houston, and her daughter, Jessica Catto, of San Antonio, she is survived by a sister, Mrs. Loy Loving, of Weslaco, Tex., 8 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Helen Singer Kaplan, a pioneer in the field of sex therapy and founder of the country's first clinic for sexual disorders established at a medical school, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Kaplan was considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists. She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods.         She agreed with others in the field that sexual difficulties often had superficial origins. But she held that, in case an unconscious conflict lay at the root of the disorder, it could indicate deep emotional problems and require the therapist to resort to more analytical means.         Consequently, her approach was seen as psychosexual therapy, to distinguish it from sex therapy. And her arrival on the scene manifested the way psychoanalysts gradually adapted to new sex-therapy techniques.         Although not so well known to the public as the sex researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson, Dr. Kaplan was a leader in her field. She also had her differences with the Masters-Johnson team, questioning their advocacy and use of two therapists working together because, she felt, one therapist of either sex would suffice.         Working as a clinical professor of psychiatry, she became the founder, in 1970, of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, one of the country's most prominent psychiatric clinics and part of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center complex. She remained its director until her death.         Born Helen Singer in Vienna on Feb. 6, 1929, she came to the United States in 1940 and became a citizen in 1947. She graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Syracuse University in 1951 and earned a master's degree in psychology at Columbia University in 1952. She got a Ph.D in psychology in 1955 at Columbia.         In 1959, she received her medical degree from New York Medical College, where she completed a comprehensive course in psychoanalysis in 1970.         She trained in clinical psychology at Veterans Administration hospitals and clinics in Montrose, N.Y., and the Bronx, interned at Bronx Hospital and completed her training as a fellow of psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital and New York Medical College-Metropolitan Hospital Center.         There the first phase of her professional teaching career unfolded as she developed and coordinated a basic behavioral science program for psychiatric residents as well as a freshman medical course in psychiatry. She also developed and taught a required course in psychopharmacology.         From 1960 until she established her program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, she was an associate professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College and an associate attending psychiatrist at Metropolitan, Flower and B.S. Coler Hospitals. At Medical College and Metropolitan Hospital Center she also served as chief of psychosomatic and consultation services, co-director of the Behavior Therapy Unit, chairman of the Behavioral Science Teaching Program and director of a program for women residents with children.         She established new programs, including one to train the psychiatric and obstetrics-gynecology staff in human sexuality.         She was appointed a professor of psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in 1970. Aside from directing her program at the Payne Whitney, she was in charge of undergraduate teaching of psychiatry and curriculum development until 1976.         Her human sexuality program included an outpatient clinic for the evaluation and treatment of psychosexual disorders. This generated clinical materials for postgraduate training courses for enrolled physicians and mental-health professionals. Dr. Kaplan was in charge of all education and training programs in human sexuality for Cornell medical students and psychiatric residents at the Payne Whitney.         Dr. Kaplan was credited with 110 publications and 127 lectures and presentations taking in the full range of her specialty.         Several of her books remain in print. These include "New Sex Therapy: Active Treatment of Sexual Dysfunctions" (Random House, 1974), "Disorders of Sexual Desires and Other New Concepts and Techniques in Sex Therapy" (Brunner-Mazel, 1979), "The Evaluation of Sexual Disorders: Psychological and Medical Aspects" (Brunner, 1983), "The Illustrated Manual of Sex Therapy" (Brunner; 2d ed., 1987), "How to Overcome Premature Ejaculation" (Brunner, 1989), and, with Donald F. Klein, "Sexual Aversion, Sexual Phobias and Panic Disorder" (Brunner, 1987).         Dr. Kaplan is survived by her husband of 15 years, Charles P. Lazarus; two sons, Dr. Phillip Kaplan and Dr. Peter Kaplan, a daughter, Jennifer Kaplan-D'Addio, all of the Upper East Side; a brother, Frank Singer of California, and two grandsons.         Correction:  August 23, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary on Saturday of Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan, founder of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, omitted a survivor. She is Sofie Kane of Manhattan, Dr. Kaplan's mother.       
         Gloria Chadwick, an international ski racing administrator who was especially dedicated to furthering women's cross-country competition, died on Sunday at her home in Lake Placid, N.Y. She was 63.         Her brother, Norman Chadwick of Mount Vernon, Wash., said she died of cancer.         In her youth, Miss Chadwick was a downhill ski racer on the United States A team. She had wanted to compete at the Olympic level, but a skiing accident in which she broke her leg sidelined that ambition.         Undaunted, she went on to make her mark in the sport through administrative undertakings, and in 1986, was inducted into the United States National Ski Hall of Fame in Ishpeming, Mich.         She had been director of the United States Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid since 1985, and was executive director of the United States Ski Association from 1961-68. She was also the first national coordinator for Nastar, a racing program for recreational skiers.         For the last decade, she focused her efforts on behalf of women in skiing as chairman of the International Ski Federation Subcommittee on Women's Cross-Country.         Miss Chadwick was born in Philadelphia, but her family moved to Lowell, Mass., when she was a toddler. As a teen-ager from a modest home, Miss Chadwick honed her Alpine skills by skiing regularly at nearby Cannon Mountain, N.H.         She received a bachelor's and master's degree in business from the now-defunct Staley College in Brookline, Mass., and later studied management at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif.         In a breakthrough for women in the ski industry, she was hired in 1971 by the Big Sky Resort near Bozeman, Mont., to be director of marketing, and later, a vice president.         From 1975 to 1983, she was president and general manager of Burke Mountain, Vt. In 1983, she became commissioner of economic development for the state of Vermont.         In 1985, Miss Chadwick opened the United States Olympic Education Center at Northern Michigan University in Marquette, Mich. Later that year, she also began supervising the $12 million modernization of the Lake Placid training center.         During the last two years, she was in charge of developing the ARCO United States Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Calif.         Miss Chadwick is survived by her brother.       
         Honeychile Wilder is dead, and if the "21" Club is not in actual mourning, the venerable former speak-easy on West 52d Street was closed for vacation last week when word got around that one of its most memorable former patrons had died on Aug. 11 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         Her original name was Patricia Wilder, and at her death at the age of 76, she was officially known as Princess Alexander Hohenlohe. But from the moment she hit town in the 1930's and took New York by storm, the woman from Georgia who called everybody Honeychile was never called anything but that herself.         Even after she married the Austrian prince and became a celebrated international hostess, she was known as Princess Honeychile.         By her own account, within a day of her arrival in New York in 1934 she had been hired as a showgirl and was appearing with Bob Hope at the Palace Theater.         The gig led to a lifelong friendship, a number of appearances on the Bob Hope radio show, some forgettable movie roles, a series of unforgettable encounters at New York nightclubs and eventually to a series of celebrated liaisons, including a dalliance with King Farouk.         "She was a character," said her friend, Susie Schneider, who reported that the Princess, a longtime resident of Marbella, Spain, had died of lymphoma.         She may not have been the actual prototype of Truman Capote's "Breakfast at Tiffany's" heroine, Holly Golightly, as some said. If she was not, it was probably because Mr. Capote was only 16 years old in 1941 when Miss Wilder was charging New York night life with her special brand of electricity.         There was hardly a night the slender dark-haired beauty with the affecting Southern drawl couldn't be found at the Colony or the Monte Carlo for dinner, followed by stops at the Stork Club, the Cafe Pierre and El Morocco, and she had lunch at "21" so often that the bartender created a Honeychile drink in her honor (a whiskey sour made with honey rather than sugar).         As she later recalled those halcyon days, Conde Nast would send his limousine to take her to black-tie dinners at his town house; George Gershwin asked her to sit next to him at the piano while he was composing Porgy and Bess, and she used to go bar-hopping with Walter Winchell and his pal J. Edgar Hoover.         She had a well-chronicled affinity for millionaires, one that would probably have raised fewer eyebrows if their wives had been more understanding. One who apparently was not was Beverly Paterno, whose husband was the heir to a real estate fortune, calculated at the time as worth 63 million 1941 dollars.         What was said between the two women at the Cafe Pierre on the night of Feb. 22, 1941, was not recorded, but Honeychile's riposte made headlines the next day: she peppered her rival with a flurry of rights and lefts, then doused her with a pitcher of water.         Although she said she had attended a finishing school in Charlottesville, Va., there was some evidence that it did not ruin her speech patterns. As she once told an interviewer, "Everybody was my friend, but I wasn't in love with nobody."         That apparently changed when she met Prince Alexander. The Prince died 11 years ago.         After her husband's death, the Princess, who lived in a small house in Marbella (where a wealthy Hohenlohe cousin owns the Marbella Club) spent much of her time visiting rich friends around the world.         She is survived by a brother, Henry Wilder, of Macon, Ga.       
         Phyllis Brooks, a popular film and stage actress in the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in Cape Neddick, Me. She was 80.         Miss Brooks, a native of Boise, Idaho, started her career as an artist's model in New York, posing for the magazine illustrator James Montgomery Flagg and others. Hollywood discovered her in 1934 as the "Ipana toothpaste girl," and she appeared in Sidney Toler's Charlie Chan series and the Shirley Temple films "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Little Miss Broadway." Unhappy with her roles, she tried her luck on Broadway, and succeeded with the George S. Kaufman-Edna Ferber play "Stage Door" (1936) and the hit Ethel Merman musical "Panama Hattie" (1940).         Miss Brooks, who was engaged at one time to Cary Grant, married Torbert H. Macdonald, a wealthy former college football star and hero of World War II, in 1945. He and John F. Kennedy had been college roommates at Harvard.         The Macdonalds settled in Malden, Mass., where Mr. Macdonald was elected to Congress in 1954. He served 11 straight terms, until his death in 1976.         Miss Brooks was active in promoting her husband's political career and that of Kennedy, who was their elder son's godfather. While she declined to move to Washington, she was a frequent hostess on the social scene, especially after Kennedy became President.         She is survived by two sons, Torbert Jr., of York, Me., and Brian, of Salem, Mass.; two daughters, Laurie, of Everett, Mass., and Robin, of Kennebunk, Me.; a brother, Norman Brooks of Cushing, Me., and eight grandchildren.       
         Gloria Wills Landes, a former Broadway showgirl who capped a brief, effervescent career by founding and directing an acclaimed school for aspiring teen-age actors and playwrights, died on Friday at her home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 69.         Mrs. Landes was the director of the SUNY Youth Theater in Purchase, N.Y., until she became ill last year. She had breast cancer, her family said.         If Gloria Wills's days on Broadway had been a Busby Berkeley musical, she would have been the star's funny and bubbly best friend, the one who has her moments in the spotlight but gives up a promising career to marry a rich businessman.         Mrs. Landes's career lasted only three years, but by the time she left a Broadway-bound show in Philadelphia in 1948 to marry Jack Landes, a wealthy silver importer, she had something to tell her grandchildren.  Like hundreds of other stage-struck singers, dancers and actors who have passed through Broadway's revolving door over the years, she had a scrapbook proving that she had been a part of a great tradition.         She may have spent more time auditioning than performing, but she was a Brooklyn girl who could belt out a song, and her persistent auditions at least made an impression on Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. Rodgers once said she had auditioned for every part in "Oklahoma!" except the villain, Jud Fry.  If she missed a week trying out for the part of Ado Annie, the "girl who can't say no," Hammerstein would ask if she had been sick.         She may not have been a star, but the critic Walter Kerr once called her "one of the funniest things on Broadway," and she had her share of brushes with destiny and Broadway cliches.         In 1945, for example, she was in the chorus of "Carousel" when she discovered new meaning in the old theater good-luck wish of "break a leg." A featured singer got sick, and her understudy, rushing in to replace her, fell down the dressing room steps and actually broke a leg. Mrs. Landes, then all of 19 years old, spent the next six weeks singing "You'll Never Walk Alone."         Then there was the birthday party for "Oklahoma!" She did a comic version of Agnes de Mille's famous second-act ballet that left Miss de Mille in stitches and persuaded Rodgers and Hammerstein to cast her as Beulah, the campus vamp, in the musical "Allegro" in 1947.         That led to a part in the revue "Make Mine Manhattan," with Sid Caesar, but Mrs. Landes, who had doubts about the part and her future in the theater, left the show in Philadelphia to accept what she decided was a better offer: to marry Mr. Landes and live happily ever after.         That is more or less what she did. Several months after she was married, Cole Porter asked her to be Bianca in "Kiss Me Kate," but she was pregnant by then with the first of her four sons.         Unlike many other short-term performers who end up in the suburbs, Mrs. Landes found a second act. After performing in summer stock, she established a school for teen-age performers that was absorbed by the State University of New York at Purchase, where she taught a generation of young actors and playwrights, including Matt Dillon.         Mrs. Landes's husband died in 1989. She is survived by her sons, Mark of Potomac, Md., Dan of Brooklyn, Robert of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Peter of San Rafael, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and a brother, Herbery Wolfson of Wilmington, Del.       
         Charlotte Appleton Kidder Ramsay, a philanthropist and wildlife conservationist, died on Saturday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. She was 53.         Her death, which her husband, William Ramsay, said was caused by an aneurysm, occurred two days before that of her mother, Dorothy Robinson Kidder, who died of cancer at age 78.         Mrs. Ramsay was a member of the advisory council of the African Wildlife Foundation and founder and chairwoman of the Jordan Conservation and Research Center, an organization dedicated to training African wildlife researchers.         Born in Australia, where her father, Randolph A. Kidder, was on assignment in the Foreign Service, Mrs. Ramsay was the great-great-granddaughter of Eben D. Jordan, founder of the Jordan Marsh department stores and The Boston Globe.         Her first marriage, to E. Joseph Luskey, ended in divorce in 1983.         She is survived by her second husband, Mr. Ramsay, a scientist and writer whom she married in 1988; a daughter, Ann Luskey Weir, and a son, Randolph Kidder Luskey, both of Washington; her father and a brother, Michael Randolph Kidder of Spofford, N.H.       
         Anyone attending the inauguration this weekend of Ruth Simmons as Smith College's ninth president will be likely to note the presence of such luminaries as Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning author; Johnnetta Cole, the president of Spelman College; Cornel West, the scholar, and Henry Louis Gates, the writer and chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard.         But they might miss the people who Ruth Simmons believes are the most important -- those responsible for her becoming the first black president of one of the country's most elite women's colleges. They are her nine brothers and sisters: Elbert, Wilford, Atherine, Albert, Arnold, Nora, Clarence, Ozella and Azella. Her eighth-grade teacher, Modria Caraway. Her high school drama teacher, Vernell Lillie.         Her kindergarten teacher, Ida Mae Henderson, would like to be there, but at age 85, she is not strong enough to make the trip alone from Grapeland, Tex. "Miss Ida Mae," Dr. Simmons said. "I revere her."         Dr. Simmons, who is 50, is the great-great-granddaughter of slaves. She began her journey on a cotton farm in Grapeland, in East Texas. Her parents, the late Isaac and Fannie Stubblefield, were sharecroppers. Dr. Simmons was the youngest of 12 children -- two brothers are dead -- and was 7 when the family moved to a poor section of Houston. Her father went to work in a factory and eventually became pastor of the Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church. Her mother scrubbed floors for white families.         To Henry Louis Gates, the appointment of a black woman to the top job at Smith is "a major event in the history of American letters." Professor Gates, who regards Dr. Simmons as a mentor, said, "She's the Jackie Robinson of college presidents."         Ask Ruth Simmons how she did it, how she made her way from Grapeland to the provost's job at Spelman College to vice provost at Princeton University to the presidency of Smith, and she seems startled by the question. "I didn't make it happen," she said in an interview the other day in her wood-paneled office at Smith. "That's just the point."         It was her teachers at the segregated schools she attended, W. R. Banks Elementary in Grapeland and Phyllis Wheatley High in Houston, who made it happen, she said. "They thought I belonged in college," she said. "And they were convinced they would get me there. They protected me, especially after my mother died."         She was 15 when her mother lost her battle with kidney disease. "I had a remarkable mother," said Dr. Simmons, who is 50. "When she would do day's work, she would sometimes take me with her to white people's houses when I was a little girl. The thing I remember vividly is how good she was at what she did. She was very demanding in terms of her own work -- Do it well, do it thoroughly, whatever you do."         After graduation from high school, she went to Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans, where she majored in Romance languages.         "Vernell Lillie wrote to Dillard, which is where she had gone, and asked them to provide a scholarship for me," Dr. Simmons said.         Ms. Lillie, a professor of African studies at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview: "She was brilliant. I was very fortunate to be a part of her life."         The scholarship did not cover everything. "I didn't have enough money to buy clothes," said Dr. Simmons, who was elegantly dressed the other morning in a long, dark-green pleated skirt and matching jacket, with a double strand of pearls and small gold hoop earrings. "And I'll never forget one of my teachers asked me to come over to her house, and she went to her closet and she took enough clothes out for me to go to college."         Her family pitched in, too. "My brothers and sisters would send me what they could," she said. "They were all starting families. Sometimes it would be $5, or $10."         Her brother Wilford Stubblefield, who is 16 years older, was working at an oil refinery in Houston as a janitor, the only job open to a black man at the refinery in those days.         "We all helped her -- probably not as much as we should have," Wilford said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Houston. "She was the second one that had gone off to college. Naturally, we were proud."         Another brother, Clarence Stubblefield, who is 54 and a high school basketball coach in Houston, had gone to Prairie View College in Texas on a basketball scholarship.         Dr. Simmons said: "I'm not the brightest person in my family. I was very lucky. I came along at the right time."         Growing up in the segregated South, she said, she had no specific ambition, only a hunger to learn. "One really didn't aspire to do professional things," she said. "I think my mother must have thought that eventually perhaps I would get enough education to be self-sustaining and to do something comfortable, perhaps housework."         Instead, she earned an undergraduate degree from Dillard, and master's and doctorate degrees in Romance languages at Harvard. She became an assistant professor of French, and later an assistant dean at the University of New Orleans.         In the meantime, at age 22, she married Norbert Simmons, a lawyer and businessman. They had a son, Khari, now 22 and a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, and a daughter, Maya, 18, who plans to attend Spelman next year.         After the couple separated in the mid-1980's -- they were divorced in 1989 -- Dr. Simmons began her administrative rise at Princeton. She brought Ms. Morrison and Professor West to the Princeton faculty. She tried to persuade Professor Gates to join the faculty, too, he said.         There was one problem with Ms. Morrison's appointment: the faculty search committee wanted a resume. And Ms. Morrison, offended by the request, refused to submit one.         So Ruth Simmons wrote Toni Morrison's resume for her. "Here's my philosophy about life," said Dr. Simmons, who considers Ms. Morrison her best friend. "Don't dwell on insignificant things."         Ms. Morrison said in a telephone interview: "She's still a bit of a miracle as far as I'm concerned. She has an unusual combination of real politics and integrity, and this very keen sense of morals which does not interfere with her generosity and her wide spiritedness. She's extremely creative in terms of solving other people's problems. And she's a lot of fun."         For the 14-member presidential search committee at Smith, Dr. Simmons was the unanimous first choice. "We had a wish list of the qualities we wanted," said one member of the committee, Peter Rose, a sociology professor. "She seemed to fill them all. Race was not an issue."         Of Smith's 2,800 students, 86 are black. There are 15 black faculty members -- out of 300.         One goals, Dr. Simmons said, is to interest more black women in Smith. She hopes her presence will help. "If it's not a good place for African-American students," she said, "it's not a good place for me."         Her friend, Professor Gates, said he was already planning ahead. "I'm hoping Maggie and Liza Gates will go to Smith now," he said, referring to his teen-age daughters. "It never would have occurred to me before Ruth became president."         For now, her presence has electrified the campus. She walks everywhere. She invites students into her office to talk. She listens to them, they say.         Tigress Osborne, a black senior, said she returned to Smith last spring after taking some time off. "One of my friends said, 'You won't believe what's happened: we have a black president!' " Ms. Osborne said. "There's a moment when you think if Smith picked a black woman, how black is she? Is she going to be interested in us?"         She added, "But there's a real sense of her blackness. She also has a good handle on how to be not just the black president, on how not to cater to just black students."         Watching Dr. Simmons mingle at the senior tea last week, one senior, Kathryn Fields, who is white, said: "She's so cool. She's so young. She's new, she's exciting, she's going to make this school amazing."         At her inauguration, the new president will be carrying a Bible her mother gave her father on the day they were married.         "I know the board of trustees thinks I'm trying to live up to the standards they set for me, and that's O.K.," she said. But she is aiming toward the higher standard set for her by Fannie Stubblefield, who never had the chance to go beyond the seventh grade. "Every day that I'm here," Dr. Simmons said, "I try to be worthy of the kind of person my mother wanted me to be."       
         Mira Barer-Hopkins, a former deputy commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, died on Saturday at a Manhattan apartment she had been subletting while undergoing medical treatment. She was 44 and lived in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.         Dr. Barer-Hopkins, known professionally as Dr. Mira Barer, had pancreatic cancer and was in New York City for treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, The Miami Herald reported yesterday.         At her death, she was the director of the Broward County, Fla., Department of Natural Resource Protection, but she had not worked since January. She took the post in 1991.         Dr. Barer-Hopkins was with the New York Department of Environmental Protection from 1981 to 1991. She began as supervisor of the Office of Environmental Impact, which was responsible for assessing the impact of land-use proposals on wetlands, beach erosion, air, noise and water quality.         She went on to head the department's Hazardous Materials Bureau with the title of assistant commissioner. Later, she was deputy commissioner for environmental management.         She was a native New Yorker, born in Brooklyn, and received a Ph.D. in marine biology from City University.         She is survived by her husband, James M. Hopkins; her mother, Helen Barer of Cranbury, N.J., and her brother, Sol, of Westfield, N.J.       
         Lita Annenberg Hazen, a major philanthropist in medical research whose interests encompassed art, music and education, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was caused by complications from lung cancer, a grandson, Nicholas Polsky, said.         Mrs. Hazen had what her daughter, Cynthia Hazen Polsky, called "a great passion for family" and took a personal interest in the activities she supported. She was a friend of most of the scientists whose institutions she helped, and although she was rarely seen at the glittering social events favored by her peers, she had an active social life centered on the arts and science community.         "Medical discoveries were the most exciting and important things that she could imagine, and I don't remember her ever thinking differently or anything that competed with that," Mrs. Polsky said. "She always envisioned that someone would have a better answer."         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust played an important part in numerous medical and scientific programs on both coasts and made significant contributions to cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery and the Metropolitan Opera.         The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island was one of Mrs. Hazen's principal interests. Hazen Tower, a building at the laboratory, commemorates her participation as a founding donor of its Neuroscience Center.         "Lita Hazen was a wonderful patron of pure science, who enjoyed bright and unusual people who would say things that she wouldn't expect," said Dr. James Watson, the Nobel laureate who is director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. .         Dr. Richard A. Lerner, president of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif, said: "She, like Mary Lasker, was one of the great ladies of American science. These kinds of individuals play important roles in science, far beyond the simple ability to donate money. In fact, they become a magnet around which scientists gather."         Dr. Lerner added, "We are losing our 'great ladies of science,' " and he noted that with their death and with no such new individuals on the horizon, "there will not be much to replace them, and a whole culture that fostered science will come to an end."         The Hazen Trust made possible the purchase of land for a science park at the institute and also financed a chair in immunochemistry. A three-building complex at the institute, to be dedicated on Oct. 15, was named in honor of Mrs. Hazen.         Mrs. Hazen was the sixth of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, who founded Triangle Publications and whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, the Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television interests. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom donated considerable portions of their inherited wealth to public institutions. Her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to Great Britain, is a major benefactor of art institutions, and a sister, Enid Haupt of New York, has devoted much of her fortune to public gardens and horticultural institutions, as well as museums and libraries.         In 1963, Mrs. Hazen was a founding sponsor of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, served as a trustee of its medical center from 1976 and contributed, with her siblings, to the construction of the 33-story Annenberg Building at the center, devoted to medical care, education and research. She also provided support for a neuroendocrinology laboratory at the Mount Sinai Medical Center that was named after her and, from 1979 to 1985, a $100,000 annual award for excellence in clinical research. The award, also named for her and administered by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, was divided between the winner and a young medical scientist chosen by the winner.         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Trust, created in 1952, also established significant scholarships and professorships at Mount Sinai, including the Moses L. and Sadie C. Annenberg Professorship in Molecular Biology, the Annenberg Scholarships in Cardiology and the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professorship in Immunochemistry.         Two grants of $1 million each helped establish and finance the Neurosciences Institute and Neurosciences Research Foundation at Rockefeller University in New York. The grants enabled multidisciplinary groups of scientists from around the world to meet and discuss their work. An atrium garden at the university was named in her honor.         In 1980, she initiated a biomedical workshop program at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and a fellowship that paid for the participation of scientists, physicians and administrators. The workshops were also held at other venues, in Stockholm, Venice and at the University of California at Los Angeles and at San Francisco.         Dr. Martin Meyerson, a former president of the University of Pennsylvania who was chairman of the workshops for a decade, noted that she insured that participants ranged from Nobel laureates to junior scientists and that "she relished providing a bit of luxury to them, a good dinner, putting them up in pleasant places."         Dr. Elaine Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton University who was a longtime friend, said: "She had a remarkable mind, and had she been born in another generation, she might well have done something herself. She understood what research was about, even in its beginning and theoretical stage."         Mrs. Hazen was born in Milwaukee on Oct. 30, 1909, and attended the Calhoun School in New York. In 1936, she married Joseph H. Hazen, a lawyer, film producer, art collector and philanthropist at a double ceremony in which Mrs. Hazen's sister, Enid, was married to the investment banker Ira Haupt.         Mr. Hazen, a former vice president and director of Warner Brothers, wrote the contract between the studio and Edison Vitaphone that resulted in "The Jazz Singer," the first movie with sound. Later, he and Hal B. Wallis, the producer, became partners. Their company, Wallis-Hazen Productions, made films like "Come Back, Little Sheba," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" and "True Grit." During that period, the 1940's to 60's, Mrs. Hazen spent several months each year in Beverly Hills.         It was Mr. Hazen's admiration for Edward G. Robinson's collection of paintings that encouraged Mr. Hazen to become a collector and amass a considerable collection of 20th-century art, including work by Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh, Modigliani, Leger, Kandinsky, Braque and Picasso. The Joseph H. Hazen Foundation still contributes to a number of arts institutions.         "My mother's interest in art developed with her marriage to my father," Mrs. Polsky said. "My father was more passionate about art but my mother also loved museums and paintings. She was particularly interested in the Impressionists."         Mrs. Hazen's trust made sizable contributions to arts institutions, particularly the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In most cases, the trust provided the funds for purchases, among them two important South Indian bronzes, a 14th-century "Yashoda and Krishna" and an 11th-century "Shiva, Parvati and their son Skanda," for the museum's Irving Galleries of South and Southeast Asian Art.         Mrs. Hazen and her husband also established the Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratory in Oncology and Hematology, in memory of their other daughter, at the Marion Davies Hospital, a unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center. Mrs. Cherry died of lymphoma in 1965 at the age of 32.         Mr. Hazen died in 1994 at age 94, after 58 years of marriage. Mrs. Hazen is survived by Mrs. Polsky of Manhattan; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; a brother, Walter H. Annenberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif., and three sisters, Mrs. Haupt, Janet Hooker and Evelyn Hall of Manhattan.         Correction:  October 4, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about Lita Annenberg Hazen, a leading philanthropist in medical research, misstated her age in some editions. She was 85, not 86.       
         Edith Pargeter, a British author of mysteries and historical fiction who wrote a series of novels under the pen name Ellis Peters about a sleuthing 12th  century monk named Brother Cadfael, died Saturday. She was 82 and lived in Shropshire, England.         The cause was a stroke, said her biographer, Margaret Lewis.         Ms. Pargeter wrote approximately 90 books, the first in 1936 and the last in 1994. Her novels about Brother Cadfael, an herbalist at the Benedictine abbey in Shrewsbury with a knack for solving murders, received wide acclaim.         The first of 20 Brother Cadfael books appeared in 1977. They included "The Potter's Field" (1990), "The Confession of Brother Haluin" (1989) and "The Hermit of Eyton Forest" (1988), all published by Mysterious Press.         Last January, some of the Brother Cadfael novels were dramatized in four 90-minute segments of the television program "Mystery."         The British Tourist Authority has published a brochure, "Brother Cadfael Car  Trails," offering directions through the hamlets and villages of Shropshire, where most of her stories were set.         Ms. Pargeter was born on September 28, 1913, in Shropshire, just three miles  from the house where she died in the town of Madeley. During World War II, she joined the Women's Royal Naval Service and in 1944 she received the British Empire Medal for distinguished service. She has no immediate survivors.       
         Thelma Griffith Haynes, a former co-owner of the Minnesota Twins, died Sunday in Orlando, Fla. She was 82.         She had been in poor health since suffering a stroke about 18 months ago, her son, Bruce, said.         Mrs. Haynes and her brother, Calvin Griffith, were raised by their uncle, Clark Griffith, because their parents were struggling financially and were later adopted by Griffith, a Hall of Fame pitcher who owned the Washington Senators.         Calvin Griffith became president of the franchise after Clark Griffith died and moved the team to Minnesota in 1961. Mrs. Haynes served as an executive vice president and assistant treasurer and each owned 26 percent of the team before it was sold to Carl Pohlad in 1985.         In addition to Calvin Griffith and her son, Mrs. Haynes is survived by two brothers and one sister.       
         Frances Cole, a dance teacher whose students included Ruby Keeler and Bob Fosse, died on Oct. 10 at the Actors' Fund Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 94.         Miss Cole, who was born in Greenville, Ohio, was sent to Cincinnati by her father, a ballroom-dance teacher, to study dance so she could help him with his  studio. Instead, she joined the ballet company of the Cincinnati Opera. She could not find work in classical ballet when she came to New York in 1924 and performed in vaudeville and nightclubs. She had her own studio in Manhattan from 1938 to 1961 and later taught in Westwood, N.J. She retired from teaching in 1981. She is survived by a brother, Robert Kolp, of Greenville.       
         Margaret Gorman Cahill, who became the first Miss America in 1921 and spent the better part of the next seven decades trying to live down the bathing beauty image, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Bowie, Md. She was 90 and had lived her entire life in Washington.         Unlike latter-day Miss Americas, who can assert that it was really their talent or their poise that made the difference, Mrs. Cahill could make no such claim.         In September 1921, when she beat out seven other contestants, including a New York showgirl, the pageant was an unabashed beauty contest. Lest there be any misunderstanding, the organizers billed it both as the Inter-City Beauty Contest and the Atlantic City Bathing Beauty Contest and conducted it on the beach.         To be sure, the swimsuits of the era were demure by modern standards, none more so than Mrs. Cahill's. While some of her rivals violated a local modesty ordinance by appearing barelegged on the beach, she wore dark, knee-high stockings and a chiffon bathing costume with a tiered skirt that came almost to her knees.         A petite, blue-eyed beauty whose long blond ringlets made her a Mary Pickford look-alike, Mrs. Cahill was not only the first Miss America, but also set two pageant records that still stand.         At 5 feet 1 inch and 108 pounds, she remains the smallest Miss America, and with a 30-25-32 figure that was close to the flapper era ideal, the slimmest.         But Mrs. Cahill had a certain advantage. When she won in 1921, she was only 16 years old, and by some accounts, only 15.         When she defended her title in 1922, a year older and more mature, she lost to Miss Ohio, Mary Campbell, who beat her again the next year to become the only two-time winner.         Whatever her age was at the time -- Mrs. Cahill would never discuss the matter -- when reporters from The Washington Herald came to her Georgetown home in the summer of 1921 to notify Margee Gorman that on the basis of a photograph submitted by her parents she had been selected to represent the newspaper in the Atlantic City contest, they found her in a nearby park shooting marbles in the dirt.         (Mrs. Cahill later took great pains to correct what she saw as the implications of the activity. "I was not a tomboy," she said. "I loved all the boys.")         In later years, as the contest grew into a major annual event, Mrs. Cahill, who in 1925 married Vincent Cahill, a real estate broker, sought to distance herself from her role in the pageant, especially the beauty queen label. "My husband hated it," she said. "I did, too."         Even so, three years after her husband's death, she was persuaded to attend the 1960 contest, but she later called the organizers cheap for not reimbursing her for $1,500 in expenses.         She is survived by a brother, William L. Gorman of Fort Myers, Fla.       
         Viveca Lindfors, the tall, dark and square-shouldered Swedish actress whose towering presence made her a star in dozens of movies and plays, died yesterday  in Uppsala, Sweden. She was 74.         The cause was complications from rheumatoid arthritis, said her daughter, Lena Tabori. The actress, who lived in Manhattan, had returned to her home city  in July to tour in the play "In Search of Strindberg," Ms. Tabori said.         Miss Lindfors, who played a scientist in the 1994 science-fiction film "Stargate," stars in the movie "Last Summer in the Hamptons," which opened last  week at the East Hampton Film Festival and is to open next month in New York City and Los Angeles.         The film is about one of Miss Lindfors' favorite activities: spending time with relatives in the Hamptons when not working on stage or before a camera, Ms. Tabori said.         Ms. Lindfors, whose full name was Elsa Viveca Torstensdotter Lindfors, trained at the Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm for three years before starting to make films in 1940. Her father, Torsten, was a publisher of art books; her mother, Karen, a painter.         Miss Lindfors appeared in many plays in Sweden and was considered that country's leading film attraction before leaving in 1946 for the United States,  where her auburn hair and elegant features led more than one observer to proclaim her an actress of Garboesque beauty.         Her American screen debut was two years later in "Night Unto Night," with Ronald Reagan. The director was Don Siegel, who would become her third husband.         Her early starring roles in American movies included parts in "Adventures of  Don Juan" (1948), with Errol Flynn; "No Sad Songs for Me" (1950), with Margaret  Sullavan, and "Four in a Jeep" (1951), with Ralph Meeker, for which she won the  "Best Actress of the Year" International Film Award.         She won a Best Actress Award at the Berlin Film Festival for her 1962 performance in "No Exit" and the Special Award at the Venice Film Festival for the 1960 movie "Weddings and Babies."         Her 1955 Broadway debut in the title role of "Anastasia," a drama about a woman claiming to be the missing daughter of Czar Nicholas 2d, won her immediate acclaim from critics and an award from the Drama League.         One critic called her acting in that play "electrifying." In an interview, Miss Lindfors said she had brought her performance to a peak by torturing herself with memories of how she felt upon the death of her brother two years earlier, "so that I could find the feelings of Anastasia."         Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times, "As Anastasia, longing desperately for the consolation of reunion with a blood relative, Miss Lindfors  is all grace, softness and humility."         Miss Lindfors appeared in plays by Shakespeare, Brecht, Tennessee Williams and others. In 1966, she was a founder and artistic director of the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Mass.         Her television appearances included parts in the series "The Defenders" and "The Nurses." She also had starring roles in televised productions of the Dostoyevesky novel "The Idiot" and the Thornton Wilder story "The Bridge of San  Luis Rey."         Among her other well-known films are "The Spinning Family" and "In Paradise," both made in Sweden before she came to the United States, and the American movies "To the Victor" (1948), "This Side of the Law" and "Dark City" (1950), "The Story of Ruth" (1960), "An Affair of the Skin" (1963), "Coming Apart" (1969), "The Way We Were" (1973), and two 1978 films, "Girlfriends" and "A Wedding."         In 1990, Miss Lindfors was attacked by a man who slashed her face with a razor as she walked in Greenwich Village. Her wounds required 28 stitches.         Miss Lindfors married and divorced four times. Her husbands were Henry Hasso, a Swedish cinematographer; Folke Rogard, a Swedish attorney; Mr. Siegel, the director, and George Tabori, a Hungarian writer, producer and director.         In addition to her daughter, whose father was Folke Rogard, she is survived by two sons, John Tabori of Washington, whose father was Henry Hasso, and Kristoffer Tabori of Los Angeles, whose father was Don Siegel, and four grandchildren.       
         Lillian Fuchs, a renowned violist, composer, teacher and keeper of musical tradition, died yesterday morning at the Actors Fund Nursing Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 91.         Lillian Fuchs Stein was "one of the best string players in America," Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times in 1962, and she went on to become one of the most respected string teachers in the world. She taught from 1962 to 1991 at the Manhattan School of Music, from 1964 to 1990 at the Aspen Music Festival and School, and from 1971 to 1993 at the Juilliard School, where she was an emeritus member of the faculty until her death.         Ms. Fuchs was born in 1903 in New York. She took up the piano at an early age, and she and her brother Joseph were taught violin by their father.         "I just developed quietly because nobody paid any attention to me even in my family," she told The Strad magazine in 1986. "They were always fussing over Joseph. I didn't mind at all. I was delighted to be left alone."         She studied violin with the noted Franz Kneisel at the New York Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School, and graduated with highest honors in 1924.         Ms. Fuchs made her New York debut on the violin in 1926, but soon shifted her concentration to viola. She collaborated often in performance with her brother Joseph and her other brother, Harry, a cellist. She played in a number of chamber groups, notably the Perole String Quartet and the Musicians Guild, and appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic and the Casals Festival Orchestra.         Ms. Fuchs was the first violist to perform and record the six Bach suites written for solo cello. "The measure of an artist is the silence he or she can inspire," Ross Parmenter wrote in The Times in 1948 of her performance of the Sixth Suite. "The silence for her performance was so intense that someone rattling cellophane in the back of the hall was an irritation to almost the whole audience."         Ms. Fuchs was an important teacher of chamber performance as well as of the viola. Her first pupil, she said in the 1986 Strad article, was "this boy from the West Coast": Isaac Stern. She also taught Pinchas Zukerman, and encouraged him to play viola as well as violin.         As a composer, she won several awards during her student years, and later wrote mainly for the viola.         Ms. Fuchs's husband, Ludwig Stein, died in 1992. She is survived by her brother Joseph; her daughters, Barbara Stein Mallow, a cellist, of Leonia, N.J., and Carol Stein Amado, a violinist, of Merion, Pa., and four grandchildren.         Services are to be held on Sunday afternoon at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street, Manhattan.         Correction:  October 10, 1995, Tuesday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Saturday about the violist and teacher Lillian Fuchs misstated the day of her death. She died on Thursday, not Friday.       
         Susan F. Glass, a highly particular public relations woman who made a career  being paid for advancing causes she believed in, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60, and until she went on medical leave at the end of 1994, she was a senior vice president of the Urban Development Corporation.         The cause was lung cancer, her friend Sandy Silverman said.         Whether she was writing speeches for Dore Schary at the Anti-Defamation League, editing Albert Shanker's newspaper columns for the United Federation of Teachers or, more recently, advancing her friend Mario M. Cuomo's economic development programs at the U.D.C., Ms. Glass pursued her work with a passion that seemed to go far beyond her professional obligations.         That, her friends say, was because Ms. Glass, a fierce supporter of Democratic politicians from Robert F. Kennedy to Mr. Cuomo, was such an intense  idealist that she made a point of working only for those institutions she deemed worthy of her passions.         Ms. Glass was born in Richmond Hill, Queens, graduated from Queens College and received a master's degree in English from New York University. She began her career at the old Long Island Press, working as women's news editor before shifting to public relations.         She is survived by a brother, Michael, of Miami.       
         Kate Witte Ericson, an artist who collaborated with her husband, Mel Ziegler, on indoor and outdoor installation works noted for their beauty, complexity and  social awareness, died on Sunday at her home in Milanville, Pa. She was 39 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was brain cancer, her husband said.         Ms. Ericson was born in Manhattan in 1955. She earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1978 and a master's from the California Institute of the Arts in 1982. She and Mr. Ziegler met as undergraduates and began working together in 1978, developing a style that featured provocative accumulations of materials and ideas, many of them involved with architecture, American history and the economy.         One of their first solo shows, at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art in 1986, consisted of a display of all the wood necessary to raise a house,  with each piece carved with a phrase or adage about house or home. At the end of the exhibition, the wood was sold and used in the construction of a house.         Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler exhibited their work in many shows in the United  States and abroad, including the 1989 Whitney Biennial. Their most recent New York exhibition was in 1993 at the Michael Klein Gallery in SoHo.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Ericson is survived by her parents, H. A. and Alma Ericson, of Norwalk, Conn., and a brother, Scott, of Arlington, Tex.       
         Anne E. Sullivan, a vice president at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, the New York publishing house, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 53 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         She died from internal injuries after being struck by a private bus on Friday afternoon at 23d Street and 10th Avenue, according to the publishing house.         At her death, Ms. Sullivan was the director of contracts and copyrights at the publishing house, overseeing its legal operations. She had spent 14 years with the company.         She was born in Bronxville, N.Y., and graduated from Newton College of the Sacred Heart, which has since merged with Boston College, and Fordham University Law School.         Ms. Sullivan is survived by her husband, Alan H. Bomser; her stepmother, Patricia Sullivan of Bronxville; a brother, Eugene Sullivan of Larchmont, N.Y.,  and two sisters, Jane Burke of Bronxville and Mary Tracy of Boston.       
         Martha Hill, a pioneer in American dance education who founded the American Dance Festival in addition to dance departments at Bennington College and the Juilliard School, died on Sunday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 94.         A tall, big-boned woman with an irreverent sense of humor and a no-nonsense approach to training modern dancers, Ms. Hill was of incalculable importance in  the development of modern dance in America. She came of age in the field when the art was taught, if at all, as an adjunct to college physical education courses. By the 1980's, when she retired from teaching, universities throughout  the nation offered undergraduate and graduate degrees in dance.         In her zeal to encourage and promote modern dance, Ms. Hill combined performances by leading creative figures with the dance divisions she established at college summer schools. She founded the Bennington School of the  Dance and its summer festival at Bennington College in Vermont in 1934and the Connecticut College School of the Dance in New London in 1948. The American Dance Festival (which moved to Duke University in Durham, N.C., in 1978) was founded by her at Connecticut College as an outgrowth of the Bennington program.         The festivals provided exposure and creative opportunities to most of the major modern-dance choreographers at crucial times in their young careers. Festivals at Bennington were a proving ground for Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Hanya Holm. Performances and classes at the festival offered much-needed early support to choreographers including Jose Limon, Alwin Nikolais, Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor and Alvin Ailey.         "A queer lot, these dancers," Ms. Hill, who doubled as a square dance caller  at parties at Bennington, wrote of the hectic summers in a 1950 article in The New York Times. "And yet, not queer. The first attribute of life is action. To dance is to be intensely alive."         At such festivals, she continued, students are exposed to the three fundamentals of dance education: technical training, watching great performers and participating in good talk. Her hope, she wrote, was that the young dancers  could come out of the experience "with an informed attitude toward dance where they no longer secretly use the 19th-century classification of dance that is 'graceful, ungraceful or disgraceful,' nor yet again fall victim to the old fundamentalist quarrel between the traditional ballet and the experimental modern dance, which is now only a tale with which the elders sometimes divert the young."         Ms. Hill, who was born in East Palestine, Ohio, came to dance through studies in music and the Dalcroze technique of rhythmic analysis. She received a bachelor's degree from Teachers College of Columbia University and a master's degree from New York University.         She performed with Graham from 1929 to 1931, but committed herself to dance education early on, joining the fledgling dance faculty at New York University in 1930. She became its director and established a graduate program there, leaving in 1951 to found the dance department at Juilliard, which she directed until 1985. She was associated with the Bennington summer school and festival from 1934 to 1942. In 1948, Ms. Hill re-created the school and festival in New London where they remained until 1978.         Ms. Hill never subscribed to the kind of specialization she helped to foster  in dance. She was determined to train performers at Juilliard, where she drew in leading ballet and modern-dance choreographers as teachers. But many of the students at the avant-garde Bennington sessions were gym teachers rather than professional dancers. "I have always said that dance is an art," Ms. Hill told Anna Kisselgoff, chief dance critic of The New York Times, in a interview in 1982. "Dance in education and dance in the theater are not different things. The degree of proficiency may vary but the aim is to do dance as dancing, and to teach it as dance."         Ms. Hill also taught and choreographed at the University of Chicago and Kansas State Teachers College in the 1920's and 30's, at the University of Oregon and in colleges throughout the nation. In Australia, she was a co-director of the choreographic conferences of the University of New South Wales in Sydney and the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne.         Ms. Hill was a consultant for the United States Office of Education and wrote the dance section in a teachers' manual in 1943. She was also the chairman of the advisory committee for modern-dance series at City Center in 1949. She received honorary degrees from Adelphi University, Bennington College, Mount Holyoke College and Towson State University. Other awards include the City of New York Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture, in 1984.         Ms. Hill was married to Thurston Davies, who died in 1961. She is survived by a brother, Lewis, of Lake Alfred, Fla., and a step-daughter, Judith Dilts, of San Jose, Calif.       
         Primrose Bordier, a French designer known for her colorful and innovative home textiles, died on Tuesday at the Cochin Hospital in Paris. She was 66 and lived in Paris.         The cause was pulmonary disease, said Carole Weisweiller, a friend.         During a trip to New York in the early 1960's for Le Printemps, the department store, for which she was a design director, Ms. Bordier noted the use of color in sheets and towels, at the time unknown in Europe. Upon starting a company in 1962, she persuaded manufacturers to produce colored sheets and towels. Her bed-linen collections had delicate, often humorous designs in subtle color combinations that became classics.         In 1976, Ms. Bordier was the first woman in design to receive the French Legion of Honor.         Ms. Bordier was born in Paris. In 1966, she married Charles Henri Gombault, the editor in chief of the newspaper France-Soir. She is survived by a brother,  Francis Bordier of Mandelieu, France, and by two stepchildren, Nadine Aiello Gombault of Mount Shasta, Calif., and Jean-Claude Gombault of Paris.       
         Erica Morini, an Austrian-born violinist renowned for her exquisite musicianship as well as a brilliant but unobtrusive technique, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Morini was particularly admired for her performances of the concerto repertory, especially the concertos of Ludwig Spohr, which she helped restore to popularity. She also played and recorded the great concertos of Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Tchaikovsky.         Harold C. Schonberg, the former chief music critic of The New York Times, once described Miss Morini as "probably the greatest woman violinist who ever lived," though the notion was not one that pleased her. "A violinist is a violinist," she said, "and I am to be judged as one -- not as a female musician."         It was as a musician pure and simple that she earned consistently glowing reviews. After a 10-year absence from the New York concert stage, she returned in 1976 to give a recital at Hunter College; Donal Henahan wrote in The Times that the concert was "one of the most musically satisfying of this season." She  retired from the stage soon afterward.         A violin owned by Miss Morini, a 1727 Stradivarius that was legendary for its tone, was stolen from her Fifth Avenue apartment as she approached death. A friend discovered the theft last month. The police and the F.B.I. said yesterday that they were still hunting for the culprit and the instrument, which was known as the Davidoff Stradivarius and had been appraised at $3.5 million. [The Metro  Section, page B3.]         She was also a resourceful musician. During a 1953 performance of the Brahms  Violin Concerto with the New York Philharmonic, the A string of her violin snapped. She quickly exchanged instruments with the concertmaster, missing only  a note or two, and played on. The concertmaster, John Corigliano, replaced the string and handed the instrument back to her in time for the cadenza.         Miss Morini was born on Jan. 5, 1904, in Vienna. She took her first lessons from her father, with whom she studied until the age of 7. She then entered the  Vienna Conservatory as one of the first women to study violin there; her teacher was Otakar Sevcik, who also taught the conductor Jan Kubelik.         She made her Viennese debut in 1916, and it resulted in a personal invitation from the conductor Arthur Nikisch to perform with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1920 she toured the United States, where she made her concerto debut under Artur Bodansky and presented four highly praised recitals at Carnegie Hall.         She returned to Europe shortly afterward and remained there until the Nazi takeover of Austria. She moved to New York, where she continued to make regular  appearances and taught privately at the Mannes College of Music. In 1962 she joined Isaac Stern, Zino Francescatti and Nathan Milstein in a memorial concert for Fritz Kreisler at Carnegie Hall.         Miss Morini was married to Felice Siracusano, a jeweler.         She is survived by a brother, Frank, and a sister, Stella, both of Manhattan.       
         Mercedes Rossy, a pianist, composer and bandleader, died on Thursday in Barcelona, Spain. She was 34.         The cause was intestinal cancer, said her brother Jorge.         Ms. Rossy, who studied classical piano from the age of 6, began playing jazz seriously in the early 1980's. In 1985 she moved to Munich, Germany, where she performed regularly. Four years later she won a scholarship to the Berklee School of Music in Boston, where she remained until her graduation in 1992.         It was at Berklee that she met many of the musicians with whom she later performed, some of the better players of her generation. Her band, with which she toured Europe, included the saxophonists Mark Turner and Steve Wilson. She also played with the saxophonists Herb Harris, Seamus Blake and Antonio Hart, the trombonist Hal Crook and the drummer Leon Parker.         Ms. Rossy performed frequently around New York and was to play at Small's in  January. In addition to her brother Jorge, a drummer, of New York, she is survived by her parents, Mario and Josefina, and another brother, Mario, a bassist, all of Barcelona.       
         Hannah Hirschhorn Baumann, a former national vice president of the American Jewish Committee who was active in many charitable, cultural and religious organizations, died on Sunday at her home in Rye, N.Y. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, her son, James, said.         Mrs. Baumann was also a member of the national executive council of the American Jewish Committee and chairwoman of the organization's Westchester chapter. She was a fellow in perpetuity of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an active supporter of the 92d Street Y and Channel 13. She was also a patron of the United Medical Center in Portchester, N.Y., and a member of the board of the Community Synagogue of Rye.         Mrs. Baumann, who was born in Manhattan, was a daughter of Fred Hirschhorn, the founder and chief executive officer of the General Cigar Company, and the former Hannah deRothschild Sharps. Mrs. Baumann graduated in 1937 from Smith College with a bachelor of arts degree. She worked with the American Red Cross during World War II.         Her husband of 50 years, Jay S. Baumann, the president of Terminal Barber Shops and treasurer of Sierra Realty Corporation, died in 1991. In addition to their son, James S. Baumann of Manhattan, Mrs. Baumann is survived by a sister,  Susan Behrend of Philadelphia, and a brother, Fred Hirschhorn Jr. of Old Greenwich, Conn.       
         Dr. Renata A. Calabresi, a clinical psychologist who was active in the anti-Fascist underground in Italy in the 1930's, died last Friday at her home in New Haven, Conn. She was 96.         Dr. Calabresi, who was born in Ferrara, received her Ph.D. from the University of Florence in 1923 and went to teach at the University of Rome. With her brother, Dr. Massimo E. Calabresi, she helped publish and distribute the leading underground newspaper of the Italian Resistance, Non Mollare (Don't Give Up) and was jailed for a time by the Mussolini Government.         She fled Italy and arrived in the United States in 1940, initially teaching  at the New School for Social Research and Hunter College. In 1947 she joined the Veterans Administration in Newark and worked as a clinical psychologist and coordinator for the training of future psychologists until her retirement in 1969.         Dr. Calabresi is survived by two nephews, Dr. Paul Calabresi of Barrington, R.I., and Judge Guido Calabresi of Woodbridge, Conn. Her brother, a former professor of medicine at Yale University, died in 1988.       
         Linda Sutter, a former journalist who developed the story line of the syndicated cartoon strip "Brenda Starr" in the early 1980's, died on Monday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 54.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         She wrote the Brenda Starr story line for Tribune Media Services of Chicago  from 1982 to 1985, taking over from the strip's creator, Dale Messick. During her tenure, she began the character's gradual update from a fantasy figure to a modern career woman, said Ramona Fradan, a collaborator.         Most recently, Ms. Sutter studied divinity at Harvard University, hoping to be ordained in the Episcopal Church. She had been on medical leave since her illness was diagnosed.         A native of Greenwich, Conn., she graduated from Vassar College in 1961 and started a career as a network radio producer at NBC. She also worked for Metromedia Channel 5 in New York and WINS.         Ms. Sutter is survived by her son, Joshua C. Empson of Greenwich; her parents, Clifford S. and Suzanne T. Sutter of Osterville, Mass.; three sisters,  Rebecca Breed of Greenwich, Tenney Auger of Portland, Me., and Michelle Hodgin of Los Angeles, and a brother, Samuel Sutter of Fall River, Mass.       
         Elisabeth Leustig, a casting agent whose credits included "A River Runs Through It," "Dances With Wolves" and "The Bodyguard," was killed on Tuesday in  a Moscow traffic accident. She was 50.         The Moscow police said Ms. Leustig, in town to work on the planned movie "The Saint," was killed in a hit-and-run accident Tuesday night on Tverskaya Street,  a downtown thoroughfare. The driver was not found.         Ms. Leustig was nominated by the Casting Society of America for her work on  "A River Runs Through It" (1992) and this year's "500 Nations." Her film credits also included "Rapa Nui," "The Scarlet Letter" and the forthcoming "Kansas City," directed by Robert Altman.         She was was born in France and began her career at the Los Angeles Actors Theater. She worked at Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios and at the Casting Company, after which she went into business for herself.         "The Saint" is to be directed by Phillip Noyce ("Patriot Games") for Paramount Pictures. The lead role of Simon Templar has not been cast.         Ms. Leustig is survived by her husband, a brother and a sister.       
         Elaine Limpert Horak, the founder and executive director of the Professional  Theater Wing, died on Dec. 20 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 68, and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was leukemia, said her brother John Limpert Jr.         In 1970, Mrs. Horak founded the wing, which brings new plays to the attention of producers in the United States and abroad. In the 1950's, she was associate producer for the Broadway productions of "Red Roses for Me," "The Innkeepers" and "Wake Up, Darling." She also acted Off Broadway and in summer stock.         She was a native of Brooklyn and graduated from Radcliffe College.         In addition to her brother John, of Plainfield, N.J., she is survived by her  son, Philip A. Amara of Weeki Wachee, Fla., her brother Harold J. Limpert 3d of  Vineland, N.J., and a granddaughter.       
         Toni Cade Bambara, a writer and documentary film maker who was celebrated for her intricate use of Black English in fiction, died on Saturday at a hospital in Philadelphia. She was 56 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Karma Bene Bambara of Philadelphia.         In the early 1970's, Ms. Bambara was a major contributor to the emerging genre of contemporary black women's literature, along with the writers Toni Morrison and Alice Walker and others. Many of her stories focused on men and women living in black neighborhoods in big cities or small Southern towns -- as  one reviewer put it, "young women and men who formed their political convictions in the fury of the 60's and find themselves gasping for air in the torpor of the 70's, manicurists, singers and students struggling to trim the rhetoric of their wishes to the smaller, tighter fit of reality."         What critics found most striking about Ms. Bambara's fiction, though, were the structure and language she used. Rather than using traditional linear plots, she would often use flashbacks, stream of consciousness and interweavings of plot and subplot to tell a story. She would frequently weave black dialects into her prose, creating a unique, complex language that was widely admired by critics.         Ms. Bambara published one novel, "The Salt Eaters," in 1980. She also edited  several anthologies and wrote several short-story collections, including "Gorilla, My Love," published in 1972, and "The Sea Birds Are Still Alive," published in 1977. Reviewing "Gorilla, My Love" for The New York Times in 1972,  C.D.B. Bryan wrote that her stories were unusual because they addressed racial issues in a tone more thoughtful than angry.         "Toni Cade Bambara tells me more about being black through her quiet, proud,  silly, tender, hip, acute, loving stories than any amount of literary polemicizing could hope to do," Mr. Bryan wrote in the review. "She writes about love: a love for one's family, one's friends, one's race, one's neighborhood, and it is the sort of love that comes with maturity and inner peace."         Ms. Bambara was born in New York City, and growing up, she spent much of her  time in public libraries. Louis Massiah, a friend and colleague in Philadelphia, said that as a child, Ms. Bambara would often visit a Harlem branch of the New York Public Library, where she was inspired by two black poets: Gwendolyn Brooks, whose photograph hung there, and Langston Hughes, who she said would often come and talk to children there.         Ms. Bambara graduated from Queens College with a bachelor's degree in theater arts in 1959. In 1965, she received a master's degree in American studies from the City College of New York. She was an assistant professor of English at Rutgers University from 1969 to 1974, and she also held various teaching positions at Duke University, Atlanta University and Spelman College, among others.         From 1986 until this year, Ms. Bambara taught script writing at Scribe Video  Center in Philadelphia. Mr. Massiah said that during her tenure at the center, she helped start the careers of several black women film makers. She wrote and lectured frequently about film, stressing the importance of movies that dispel Hollywood stereotypes about blacks.         Over the last decade, Ms. Bambara also collaborated with Mr. Massiah on several television documentaries, including "The Bombing of Osage Avenue," about the police assault on Move headquarters in Philadelphia, and a biography of Cecil B. Moore, a prominent civil rights activist in Philadelphia. Her most recent project was a documentary about the life of W.E.B. Du Bois, which she worked on with Mr. Massiah and several others.         Throughout her life, Mr. Massiah said, Ms. Bambara fought for the rights of minorities, women, children and the homeless.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her mother, Helen Brehon of Queens, and a brother, Walter Cade of Queens.       
         Miriam Camps, who wrote about European unification and other topics and who had been a State Department official, died on Friday in a hospital near her home in Little Abingdon outside Cambridge, England. She was 78.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, Margaret Schwartz.         Mrs. Camps was born Miriam Camp in Lynn, Mass. She was the first woman to be vice chairman of the State Department's Planning Council, from 1968 to 1970.         After earning degrees at Mount Holyoke and Bryn Mawr colleges, she joined the State Department during World War II and went on to work at the United States Embassy in London. She worked for the State Department in Washington from 1947 to 1953, then resigned to marry William Anthony Camps, a classicist at Cambridge University.         Her many subsequent writings included the books "Britain the the European Community" (1964), "What Kind of Europe?" (1965) and "European Unification in the Sixties" (1966). She was active in a variety of organizations concerned with foreign affairs.         In addition to her husband and her sister, Margaret Schwartz of Endicott, N.Y., she is survived by a brother, Paul R. Camp of Orono, Maine.       
         Libby E. Sachar, who in 1946 was the first woman appointed a Superior Court judge in New Jersey, died on Dec. 28 at her home in Plainfield, N.J. She was 90.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her son, Judge Leonard Sachar of Scotch Plains, N.J.         Selected as a juvenile-domestic relations judge by Gov. Walter Edge and reappointed in 1951, she served in Union County for 10 years until she resumed her private law practice in Plainfield.         She was a 1924 graduate of the New York University School of Law and was an advocate of women's rights. In 1947, she was a member of the New Jersey Constitution Committee, which revised the state's Constitution.         In addition to her son, who is on the Superior Court bench in Union County, she is survived by a daughter, Naomi Margolies of Plainfield; a brother, Dr. Morton Bertin of Orlando, Fla., six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Elaine Greene, a leading literary agent in Britain, died on Jan. 10 at a hospice in London. She was 74 and lived in London.         The cause was lung and brain cancer, said Jed Mattes, her affiliate in New York.         Ms. Greene was born in New York City to Louis and Fanny Gilbert and was educated at Mount Holyoke College and the Sorbonne. She worked in the editorial departments of Random House and Alfred A. Knopf, then moved to London, where she became director of the literary department of MCA London. When MCA dissolved that department in 1961, she formed her own literary agency and soon numbered Arthur Miller, Theodor S. Geisel (Dr. Seuss) and P. D. James among her clients.         Ms. Greene's two marriages, to the American journalist Robert Shaplen and to Sir Hugh Greene, a former director of the BBC, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two sons from her second marriage, Christopher and Timothy, both of London, and a brother, Ted Gilbert of Stamford, Conn.       
         Cleo Rickman Fitch, an archeological researcher who specialized in Roman lamps, died on Sunday in her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         In 1962, she joined an excavation of the ancient town of Cosa, north of Rome, and continued her work into the 1980's.         The book "Cosa: The Lamps," which she wrote with Dr. Norma Goldman of Wayne State University, was issued last fall as part of the American Academy series through the University of Michigan Press.         She was born in Carlsbad, Tex., and received a bachelor's degree from Peabody College in Nashville.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. James Marston Fitch, the architectural historian and critic, and a brother, John Rickman of Chapel Hill, Tenn.       
         Margaret Kahn Ryan, an heir to a New York financial fortune who carried on her father's interests in opera and art, died yesterday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 93.         She died of natural causes, her son, John Barry Ryan 3d, said.         Mrs. Ryan, known as Nin, was a daughter of the financier Otto Kahn, a turn-of-the-century multimillionaire who became a benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera even though the Met at first would not assign him a box in its "diamond horseshoe," where rich New Yorkers hobnobbed at intermission.         She joined the Met's board in 1956, and after the company moved to Lincoln Center in the 1960's and announced that it was facing a financial crisis, she worked on an emergency fund drive to raise $3 million. She became an honorary director in 1981.         Mrs. Ryan was also an art collector whose French Impressionist paintings hung on the walls of her triplex apartment on the East Side of Manhattan and, in summers when she went to London, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Mrs. Ryan was born on July 4, 1901, at Cedar Court, Kahn's mansion in Morristown, N.J. Kahn's biographer John Kobler wrote that he was closer to her than to his other children. Father and daughter, Mr. Kobler wrote in "Otto the Magnificent" (Scribners, 1989) "golfed together, rode together, swam together, chaffed each other, went to the opera together, and when apart, corresponded frequently." Sometimes their correspondence included long poems. He signed his "Fathie."         When she was in her 20's, she met and married John Barry Ryan, who was working as a reporter for The Newark Ledger. It was a union of financial dynasties: Mr. Ryan was a grandson of Thomas Fortune Ryan, a Virginian who migrated to Wall Street in the 1870's and made millions in railways, tobacco and insurance. He was said to have been the largest single owner of diamond fields in the Belgian Congo.         The wedding took place at Kahn's Fifth Avenue mansion on Feb. 9, 1928. Mrs. Ryan called her husband "Johnny" and her father declared, "It is my deliberate conviction that you are the nicest girl in this here republic."         Kahn added, in a letter mailed after she had been married for a year, at a time when she and Ryan were vacationing in Palm Beach, "I should love to be with you in the pink palazzo by the southern sea, but there is really no sense your being in this relentless city, because during the day the evil spell of the office claims me."         Kahn was a power at the Met until a few years before his death in 1934. Mr. Kober wrote that when Kahn first became involved with the company, the Met had an unwritten rule that no Jew could own a box. He was finally permitted to buy one, in the "diamond horseshoe," 17 years after he had joined the board. The Kahns had Margaret baptized at an Episcopal church in Morristown in 1911, along with her older sister, Maud, and her younger brother, Gilbert.         In 1951, two years after Mrs. Ryan's mother, Addie, died, Mrs. Ryan and the other Kahn heirs sold Rembrandt's "Portrait of a Young Student" for $90,000. They gave the money to the Metropolitan Opera. The Met put up a plaque, first at the old house on Broadway and later at Lincoln Center, that said the money had made possible new productions of Verdi's "Don Carlo" and Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte." The "Don Carlo" was Rudolf Bing's first production at the Met.         Among the other productions to which Mrs. Ryan contributed was the 1960 revival of "L'Elisir d'Amore," by Donizetti.         Five years ago, one of her paintings, "The Bench" by Manet, was sold at auction for $16.5 million. Manet's account book showed that the 1881 view of a garden was first sold for 2,000 francs to the Paris dealer Durand-Ruel, who sold it a year later to a Paris stockbroker for 2,500 francs and bought it back 10 years later for 6,000 francs. The painting remained in the dealer's hands until the Ryans bought it in 1945 for an undisclosed sum.         Besides her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Virginia, the Countess of Airlie, who lives in London; eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Blanche G. Etra, a lawyer and philanthropist who played an important role in the development of Yeshiva University, died on Wednesday in her home in Manhattan. She was 79.         The cause was leukemia, said a son, Donald, of Los Angeles.         The Etra family had long supported Yeshiva. Mrs. Etra expanded that role by helping to found, in 1953, the National Women's Division of Yeshiva's newly chartered Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She was its first president and became honorary president in 1962.         When the university founded the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in the mid-1970's, she was named to its Board of Directors and served as secretary from 1986 until her death. She also was the first woman to serve on the medical college's Board of Overseers.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. Etra graduated from Barnard College in 1935. In 1938, she received a law degree from Columbia University and began a private practice. After the death of her husband of 38 years, Harry, in 1977, she joined the law firm of Etra & Etra, where her partner was her brother-in-law, Max Etra, chairman of Yeshiva's board from 1953 to 1977.         Mrs. Etra was on the national Board of Directors for the United Jewish Appeal and served as a director of Seton Hill College in Greensburg, Pa., and the Brookdale Center of Hunter College.         Besides Donald, she is survived by two other sons, Aaron and Marshall, both of Manhattan; a sister, Helen Rachmil of Los Angeles; a brother, Morton Goldman of Manhattan, and six grandchildren. A fourth son, Jonathan, died in 1991.       
         Kathleen Tynan, a writer best known for her biography of her husband, the critic Kenneth Tynan, died yesterday at King Edward VII Hospital in London. She was 57 and lived in London.         The cause was cancer, said Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, a friend and the executor of Mrs. Tynan's estate.         Mrs. Tynan was a journalist, essayist and fiction writer whose works include the novel "The Summer Aeroplane" (1975) and the screenplay and novel titled "Agatha" (1979), a fictional speculation on the midlife disappearance of Agatha Christie.         But it was "The Life of Kenneth Tynan" (1987), an unflinching portrait of the influential English drama critic to whom she was married for 13 years, that was the high point of Mrs. Tynan's literary career. "It was such a weird thing, to write about your husband," she said at the time. "I was a passionate sleuth, torn between being the outsider and insider."         The book, however, was widely praised for its objectivity. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Benedict Nightingale described it as "almost frighteningly judicious," adding that Mrs. Tynan "somehow manages to fulfill, perhaps even surpass, the obligations of a good biographer."         The daughter of Matthew Halton, a Canadian journalist, Mrs. Tynan was reared in Canada and England and attended Oxford University. She worked as a researcher for Newsweek and as a reporter for The Observer and The Sunday Times in London. Her marriage to Mr. Tynan, her second, began in 1967 and lasted until his death, in 1980.         Mrs. Tynan was also the co-editor of "Profiles" (1990), selected essays by her husband, and the editor of "Kenneth Tynan: Letters," which came out in England last fall (Weidenfeld & Nicolson) and will be published in the United States by Random House in the spring.         She is survived by a daughter, Roxana, of Los Angeles, and a son, Matthew, of London, from her marriage to Mr. Tynan; her mother, Jean Halton of Ottawa, and a brother, David, of Washington.       
         Laura Scott Taylor, the co-founder and retired principal of the Concord Baptist Elementary School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, died on Sunday at Kings County Hospital Center. Mrs. Taylor, who lived in Crown Heights, was 79.         Mrs. Taylor was fatally injured when she was hit by a truck last Friday while crossing a street in Crown Heights.         For 32 years, Mrs. Taylor served as the unsalaried principal of the Concord Baptist Elementary School, which she established in 1960 with her husband, the Rev. Gardner Taylor, now pastor emeritus of the Concord Baptist Church of Christ.         Dr. Taylor, who had been a member of the New York City Board of Education, said the school was founded because many parents felt their children were being "intellectually butchered" by the public school system. "The kids were finished before their lives had started," he said.         The school emphasizes reading and extensive instruction in black history and culture. "It means a great deal to know Negroes are making a success in every phase of life," Mrs. Taylor said in 1967. "For these children to get a good opinion of themselves is very important. They should know that those who want to make it can."         Begun with 25 pupils in grades one through six, the school reached an enrollment of 130 pupils in seven years.         "We have proved that Negroes can learn to do what anybody else can do," Mrs. Taylor said then. "There is something radically wrong with the public school system if our kids can't read."         Today, the school has an enrollment of 150 in its six grades.         Mrs. Taylor, who was born in Cleveland, grew up in Oberlin, Ohio, and graduated in 1937 from Oberlin College. In 1940, after teaching in South Carolina, she married Dr. Taylor, whom she had met at the Mount Zion Baptist Church in Oberlin while he was a student at the Oberlin Graduate School of Theology.         The Taylors moved to New Orleans and Baton Rouge, La., and came to Brooklyn in 1948, when Dr. Taylor was named pastor of the Concord Baptist Church. He retired in 1990 as the dean of black pastors in the United States. In 1952, when the church was destroyed by fire, Mrs. Taylor led its women in raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the construction of a replacement.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Taylor is survived by her daughter, Martha LaCroix; a brother, Eugene Scott; a sister, Elizabeth Taylor; a sister by adoption, Ruby Harris, and a grandson.       
         Eleanor Goff-Doerfler, a modern dancer in the 1940's and 50's and a physical therapist, died last Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.         The cause was AIDS, said her daughter, Trina Doerfler.         Ms. Goff-Doefler performed with the Martha Graham Dance Company. She left dance to develop a therapeutic technique to be used by performers. She later adapted it for people with AIDS in workshops at the Judson Memorial Church.         In addition to her daughter, of Seattle, she is survived by her twin brother, Lee, of Greenville, Tex., and a son, David, also of Seattle       
         Margaret Wade, who coached Delta State to three national championships in six seasons in the 1970's and in 1986 became the first woman named to the Basketball Hall of Fame, died yesterday at the Bolivar County Hospital in Cleveland, Miss. She was 82.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         A native of Cleveland, Miss Wade was a star on the Delta State team there in the late 1920's before barnstorming with a semipro team known as the Tupelo Red Wings.         Long before her college triumphs, Miss Wade had earned a reputation as a formidable coach on the high school level. In 21 years at Cleveland High School, she led the team to a 453-89-6 record. It was achieved, one of her former players said yesterday, by a combination of inspiring her players' devotion and working them to distraction.         "She all but killed us doing calisthenics," said Sue King.         After her high school career, Miss Wade joined Delta State, initially as a physical education instructor. The school had dropped women's basketball in 1932 as unsuitably rough for proper young ladies, but when college officials decided to revive it in 1973, Miss Wade was the obvious choice to coach.         Over the next six seasons her teams compiled a 157-23 record, won three national championships and set a record of 51 consecutive victories, from 1974 to 1976.         During her final season, 1978-79, the annual Wade Trophy was established to honor the outstanding college player.         She is survived by a brother, Broughton Wade.       
         Catherine H. Sweeney, a patron of the sciences and arts for whom the Sweeney Mountains of Antarctica were named, died on Jan. 25 at the Miami Heart Institute. She was 80 and lived in Coconut Grove, Fla.         The cause was heart failure, said her son-in-law, Eric Fraunfelter.         Mrs. Sweeney called herself "just a lady gardener," but her efforts on behalf of botany, exploration, education and the arts earned her such honors as a silver medal from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and an honorary doctorate from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., where she sent eight women from Sri Lanka to be educated at her expense.         She was also a trustee of the Congressionally chartered National Tropical Botanical Garden, the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Miami, the American Horticultural Society, the World Wildlife Fund and the Conservation Foundation. She was a member-at-large of the Garden Club of America and a founder of the Florida chapter of the Society of Women Geographers.         Among other enterprises, Mrs. Sweeney rescued and restored the eight-acre estate called The Kampong in Coconut Grove in 1963. She donated the property, the former residence of the plant explorer David Fairchild, to the National Tropical Botanical Garden as a refuge and retreat for horticulturalists.         After she helped finance the Norwegian explorers Finn and Jackie Ronne in an expedition to Antarctica in the late 1940's, the Ronnes named the Sweeney Mountains in her honor.         She was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in Rye, N.Y., and a life trustee and national board member of the Aspen Music Festival and School in Aspen, Colo.         Born Catherine Denkmann Hauberg, she was a granddaughter and grandniece of the two brothers who established the company that became the Weyerhauser lumber empire.         She was a graduate of Dana Hall in Wellesley, Mass., and of the University of Illinois. Her husband, Edward C. Sweeney, a former president of the Explorers Club, died in 1967.         Mrs. Sweeney is survived by her children, Edward Jr., of Black Forest, Colo.; Philip, of Amherst, Mass.; John, of Aspen, Colo.; Susie Kayyali of Coral Gables, Fla., and Harriet Fraunfelter of Washington; her brother, John Hauberg Jr. of Seattle; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Evelyn Tripp, a leading fashion model of the 1950's and 1960's, died on Monday in her home at Remsenburg, L.I. She was 67.         The cause was colon cancer, said her husband, Stan Young.         Ms. Tripp was widely considered to be among the most versatile of a small group of models that exemplified the postwar American fashion industry's emphasis on glamour. Her dramatic features -- a high round forehead, prominent chin and broad cheekbones -- were recorded by dozens of noted photographers, among them, Horst P. Horst, Richard Avedon, Irwin Blumenfeld, Karen Radkai and Lillian Bassman.         Ms. Tripp was a favorite subject of William Klein. His 1958 photograph of her, blowing cigarette smoke from beneath the veil of a beaded cocktail hat, appears on the cover of "William Klein: In and Out of Fashion" (Random House, 1994). It also serves as the signature image of an exhibition of the photographer's work that is currently at the International Center of Photography.         The daughter of a lead miner, Evelyn Tripp was born in 1927 on a small farm in Flat River, Mo. After being discovered at age 20 -- a clerical worker, she was shopping at a Fifth Avenue department store when spotted by an assistant to Louise Dahl-Wolfe, the celebrated Harper's Bazaar photographer -- Ms. Tripp soon began to appear frequently on magazine covers.         She appeared on more than 40 covers, beginning with the Jan. 1, 1949, issue of Vogue. She retired in 1968.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her mother, Sadie Tripp; a brother, David Tripp, both of Farmington, Mo., and two sisters, Kay Taylor of Dahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Karen Eaton of Topeka, Kan.       
         Alison Frantz, one of the foremost archeological photographers of Greek sites and antiquities, died on Feb. 1 at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. She was 91.         Ms. Frantz died of injuries received on Jan. 27 when she was hit by a truck near her home in Princeton.         Ms. Frantz's interest in Greece began in her youth in Princeton and her interest in photography with the gift of a camera from her brother.         When she took over as the official photographer for the excavations in the Athenian agora, the civic center of the ancient city, she carried with her a Ph.D. in classics from Columbia University and an undergraduate degree in the same area from Smith College.         She first visited Greece as a fellow at the American Academy in Rome, after graduation from Smith in 1924.         After study at Princeton on the classical world of early Christendom and Byzantium, she returned to Greece with an appointment as a fellow of the American School. Five years later, she joined the archeological staff at the agora, and in 1939 was made its official photographer, a position she kept until 1964.         The assignment was interrupted by the war, during which she worked for the Office of Strategic Services as an adviser on Greece. After the war, she worked for three years for the State Department as a cultural attache in the American Embassy in Athens.         Ms. Frantz's photographs were used to illustrate a number of publications, including Gisela Richter's "Archaic Gravestones of Attica" (Phaidon, 1961); Bernard Ashmole's "Olympia: The Sculptures of the Temple of Zeus" (Phaidon, 1971), and Martin Robertson's "Parthenon Frieze" (Phaidon, 1975).         She also supplied photographs for Joseph Alsop's "From the Silent Earth: A Report on the Greek Bronze Age" (Harper & Row, 1964).         She was the author of "Church of the Holy Apostles" (American School of Classical Studies Press, 1971) and "The Athenian Agora, vol. XXIV, Late Antiquity, A.D. 267-700" (American School of Classical Studies Press, 1988).       
         Myra Pollack Sadker, a Washington educator and writer who charted sexual bias in the nation's classrooms, died on Saturday at Georgetown Medical Center. She was 52 and lived in Bethesda, Md.         The cause was complications from a bone marrow transplant for breast cancer, said a spokesman for American University, where she was a professor and former dean of the school of education.         Dr. Sadker's most recent work was "Failing at Fairness: How America's Schools Cheat Girls" (Scribners, 1994). It was written in collaboration with her husband, David M. Sadker, a fellow professor at American's school of education. The couple had first studied the subject of sexual bias when they were graduate students together.         With a decade's worth of research, "Failing at Fairness" sought to document that girls' educations were inferior to those of boys. The reason, the authors concluded, was the conscious or subconscious sexism of teachers who spend more time interacting with boys.         Teachers, according to the book, call on boys more, make more substantive comments on their work, and praise and goad them more. The result is that over time girls tend to lose self-esteem and do more poorly in standardized tests.         Dr. Sadker's research was widely reported in newspapers and magazines around the country. It also led to many invitations for her to appear on national television and radio programs.         Myra Pollack Sadker was born in Portland, Me., and graduated from Boston University. She received a master's degree at Harvard University and a doctorate in education at the University of Massachusetts. She taught at junior and senior high schools in Massachusetts and Thailand before joining the faculty of American University in 1973.         In graduate school, the Sadkers noticed that there seemed to be subtle differences in the education they received in the same classrooms and studying the same books. The experience started them in their career as a husband-and-wife team examining sexual bias in schools through research based on transcripts of classroom interactions, textbooks, surveys and polls.         Dr. Sadker was the author or co-author of six books and scores of articles on sexism, teacher education and children's books. Her work was recognized this year with the Eleanor Roosevelt Award of the American Association of University Women.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Sadker is survived by two daughters, Robin and Jacqueline; a brother, Dr. Murray Pollack of Potomac, Md., and her father, Louis Pollack of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Vivian Verdell Gordon, who wrote about feminism, black families and affirmative action and who was a professor of black studies at the State University at Albany, died on Wednesday at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. She was 60 and lived in Albany.         The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, said a friend, Lois Smith Owens.         She was the author of 10 books and several articles, a former chairwoman of the department of Africana studies at the university and a poet. Her collection "Dark Women and Others" (Lotus Press, 1983) was published under the name Satiafa.         Born in Washington, she received an undergraduate degree from Virginia State University in 1955, a master's degree in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1957 and a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Virginia in 1974.         In the 1960's, she worked in Washington for the Library of Congress and the House Committee on Education and Labor. She also worked with the Women's Christian Alliance Child Welfare Agency and the Upward Bound Project in California before she began teaching at the University of Virginia in 1971. She was head of the university's black studies program from 1974 to 1979.         Her book "Black Women, Feminism and Black Liberation" (Third World Press, 1985) described the conflict that black women face over the issues of feminism and racism.         Her marriage to Ronald Gordon ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Ronald Jr., of Atlanta; a brother, Thomas, and a daughter, Susan Akkad, both of New York City.       
         Isabel Wilder, a novelist and a sister of the author and playwright Thornton Wilder, died last Monday at her home in Hamden, Conn. She was 95.         Miss Wilder published three novels in the 1930's: "Mother and Four" (1933), "Heart Be Still" (1934) and "Let Winter Go" (1937). In later years, she contributed introductions to several of her brother's posthumously published works, including "The Alcestiad" (1977), "American Characteristics and Other Essays" (1979) and "The Journals of Thornton Wilder 1939-1961" (1985), selected and edited by Donald Gallup of Yale University.         In 1978, Miss Wilder provided funds to establish an annual prize through the Columbia University Translation Center for distinguished foreign translations of American literature. In 1993, the university renamed the center the Wilder Translation Center for Arts and Education.         She also established the Thornton Wilder endowed writing prize in 1987 for talented high school students around New Haven.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Blanche Rangel, a retired garment worker and mother of United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. A Harlem resident, she was 90.         She had a long illness, according to Mr. Rangel's office in Washington.         Mrs. Rangel worked in the garment industry from 1943 until her retirement in 1965.         Besides Mr. Rangel, she is survived by a daughter, Frances McDermott of the Bronx; a brother, Percy Wharton of Camden, N.J.; a sister, Sylvia Curtis of Manhattan, seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Selena, the 23-year-old reigning queen of the Tejano music world, was shot and killed today at a Corpus Christi motel.         Shortly after 9:30 P.M. a 32-year-old woman identified by the young singer's father as the former president of her fan club abruptly surrendered after keeping the police at bay for nearly 10 hours as she sat in a red pickup truck in the motel parking lot with a gun pointed at her temple.         Hundreds of people who had congregated in the cold drizzle watched as she was rushed off in a police car, surrounded by officers.         The killing of the star, who had won a Grammy music award last year and whose recording "Amor Prohibido" ("Forbidden Love") sold 400,000 copies in the United States and many more than that in Mexico, stunned her fans and prompted almost non-stop coverage on Spanish-language radio and television stations here, in Texas's major cities and all along the Mexican border. Many of the stations took calls from distraught listeners and played Selena's songs throughout the day.         The surrender came in a surreal scene with a crowd of reporters, television camera operators and onlookers gathered at an Exxon gas station across the street from the Days Inn motel just off a stretch of Interstate 37 near the Corpus Christi airport. Hundreds of fans, including many weeping teen-agers, converged on the scene throughout the day, a few with tape machines that played recordings of Selena's songs as reporters' beepers and cellular phones rang almost constantly.         Police identified the suspect as Yolanda Saldivar and said they would charge her on Saturday. The singer's father, Abraham Quintanilla, said Ms. Saldivar was a former head of the Selena fan club who three weeks ago was fired from her job at the family's clothing boutique here, Selena, Etc. The stores are due to expand to San Antonio and Mexico in coming months.         "There have been discrepancies," Mr. Quintanilla told reporters at the hospital where his daughter died this afternoon, two hours after she was shot. "And they resulted in her shooting Selena."         Mr. Quintanilla described Ms. Saldivar as a "disgruntled employee" who was fired after money was discovered to be missing from the store. He said that Selena had demanded that the woman return financial documents about the company and that the two women had agreed to meet at the motel.         With her pouting smile, suggestive clothing and theatrical command of a microphone, Selena was often described as the Madonna of the Mexican-American world and was an idol and heartthrob on both sides of the border. Unlike Madonna, though, she also cultivated an image as a cheerful promoter of family values. She was married to Chris Perez, the lead guitarist in her band, Selena y los Dinos.         Tejano music, which has roots both in the oompah music of European settlers in Texas and in Mexican ballads, is a fast-paced mix of accordion, guitars and lyrics in both English and Spanish.         It is hugely popular in South Texas and elsewhere along the border. The recent Tejano Music Awards in San Antonio, which has become a sort of Nashville of the Tejano world, was attended by 45,000 fans. At the ceremonies, Selena walked away with awards for female entertainer of the year, female vocalist of the year, best record of the year and best album. Her "Selena Live" also won the Grammy last year for best Mexican-American album.         "It's got polka in it, a little bit of country, a little bit of jazz," she said in an interview last year with the San Jose Mercury News. "Fuse all those types of music together. I think that's where you get Tejano."         Selena's hit "Fotos y Recuerdos" ("Photographs and Memories") is No. 4 on Billboard Magazine's Latin chart this week.         An assistant police chief in Corpus Christi, Ken Bung, said that Selena, whose full name was Selena Quintanilla Perez, was shot in a room at the motel just before noon and stumbled to the lobby. She was rushed to the Memorial Medical Center and pronounced dead about an hour later.         Born in Lake Jackson, near Houston, on April 16, 1971, Selena began singing with her father's band at age 3. The family later moved to Corpus Christi where she became well-known in local music circles by her teen-age years and eventually became a widely known star.         At the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, a traditional celebration that turns America's fourth-largest city into a cowtown once a year, Selena was the largest-selling draw this year.         "We had 20 performances this year," said Leroy Shafer, assistant general manager of the show. "We had Reba McEntire, George Strait, Clint Black and Vince Gill. She had the highest-selling show concert at our show this year, at 61,041 in the Astrodome."         A concert video made of her performance is to air shortly in Mexico and on some Spanish-language stations in Texas.         Maria Aguirre, a receptionist at KQQK, a popular Tejano music station in Houston, said the switchboard had been flooded with calls since the death was first announced.         "Basically they are just in awe," Ms. Aguirre said. "They cannot believe that it happened. They're calling to reconfirm."         For Tejano fans, she added, "It's almost like the feeling when John Lennon died. She was the queen of Tejano."         Mr. Shafer said: "This lady was destined to be an international superstar. In many aspects she already was. She could sell out any pavilion in South Texas. She was on her way to standing beside Madonna."         In Mexico, her popularity was limited more to the northern border region, within what Mexicans call the onda grupera, or "group wave," a movement of norteno or "ranchera" pop groups that travel the northern and central states of the country, playing dances in the towns and concerts in the cities.         Selena's father had toured nightclubs across Texas in the 1960's with the original version of Los Dinos but did not achieve wide success until he made young Selena, with her belting vocal power, the lead singer. "I think he saw dollar signs," Selena said laughingly in an interview last year, describing the evolution of a family band that included her sister Suzette on drums and her brother Abraham III on guitar.         Industry experts estimated that the shooting would only ripen Selena's celebrity as the Tejano queen who was about to break through to a larger public with her first English language album as well as her first movie role in the forthcoming "Don Juan DeMarco."         "That album was going to open a lot of doors," said John Ortiz, promotion representative for EMI Latin Records. "It will be a great loss. Shewas involved in many things."       
         Madeleine Herling, a businesswoman and philanthropist, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 75. Besides her home in Manhattan, she had residences in Miami Beach, Zurich and Sao Paolo, Brazil.         The cause was complications from leukemia, a spokesman for the family said.         Mrs. Herling was owner and president of the Jolie Gabor Jewelry Store in Manhattan. Along with her husband, Erwin, she established the Countess Madeleine Galleries Ltd. in Manhattan. The galleries featured the works of Eastern European artists.         Active in many charitable causes, she aided the Magdalena Home for the Elderly in her native Budapest, the Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem and the Emanuel Foundation in Manhattan. She was a major contributor to the building of Holocaust museums in Washington and Budapest.         Besides her husband of 48 years, she is survived by her son, Thomas, of Huntington, L.I.; a brother, Laszlo Steingisser of Chile, and four grandchildren.       
         Diane Cleaver, a literary agent and author, died on Monday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 53.         A spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner's office said the cause of death had not yet been established. But Heide Lange, vice president of the Sanford J. Greenburger agency, with which Ms. Cleaver was affiliated, said the doctor who had examined Ms. Cleaver said that the cause of death appeared to have been either a heart attack or stroke.         Born in Birmingham, England, Ms. Cleaver became a United States citizen in 1976. She began her career in publishing at Doubleday, working her way up from editorial assistant to editor, and later became an editor at Straight Arrow Books, Charles Scribner's Sons and Simon & Schuster. In 1978, she formed her own literary agency, affiliated with the Greenburger agency.         Her clients, a mixture of British and American authors, included John Fowles, Fay Weldon, Jamaica Kincaid, Peter Ackroyd, Beryl Bainbridge, Brigid Brophy, James Lardner and the estate of Laura Riding Jackson.         Ms. Cleaver also wrote two novels under pseudonyms. The mystery novel "Sherbourne's Folly" (Doubleday, 1978) carried the name of Nora Barry. The novel "Morning Glory" (Pocket Books, 1973), about three generations of women in a Texas family, appeared under the name Julia Cleaver Smith. That novel, co-written with a fellow literary agent, Nikki Smith, became a best seller in 1984.         That year, Ms. Cleaver wrote "The Literary Agent and the Writer: A Professional Guide," published by The Writer Inc.         She is survived by her brother, Barry Cleaver of Birmingham, England.       
         Yvette Hawkins, a stage, film and television actress, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 54.         The cause was lung cancer, the hospital said.         Ms. Hawkins appeared on Broadway in "The Amen Corner," "Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death" and "Checkmates." Her Off Broadway credits included "The Strong Breed," "The Trials of Brother Jero," "The Resurrection of Lady Lester," "The Last Street Play" and "Before It Hits Home."         She also acted in regional theater, appearing in productions by the Philadelphia Drama Guild, the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven and the Intiman Theater in Seattle.         Her films include "Nighthawks," "Lean on Me," "Mississippi Masala" and "Zebrahead." Television viewers saw her in "As the World Turns," "Cagney and Lacey," "Guiding Light" and "Law and Order.         Ms. Hawkins also was a co-writer of "A Guide to the Black Apple" and a writer for the Children's Television Workshop.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Pauline Ames Plimpton, who had a late-blooming career as a writer that startled but not did not surprise her famous literary offspring, George Plimpton, died yesterday at her home in New York City. She was 93.         Her family said the cause was circulatory illness.         As the daughter, wife and mother of famous men, Mrs. Plimpton spent most of her life in the shadow of her father, Oakes Ames, the Harvard botanist; her husband, Francis T. P. Plimpton, the lawyer and diplomat, who died in 1983, and her son, George, the multifaceted editor of The Paris Review.         But at the age of 79, as her son put it yesterday, "she suddenly came out from underneath," and started writing books, concentrating, appropriately enough for a novice writer, on what she knew best: her family.         Among the eight books she turned out over the next dozen years was one about her father: "Oakes Ames, Jottings of a Harvard Botanist," (Botanical Museum of Harvard, 1979); one about her husband: "The Plimpton Papers, Law and Diplomacy" (University Press of America, 1985) and even one about her father-in-law, a wide-ranging literary collector: "A Collector's Recollections, George Arthur Plimpton" (Columbia University Library, 1992).         Mr. Plimpton said he had not been surprised at his mother's literary emergence.         "As a young girl," he said, "she kept wonderful diaries."         Mrs. Plimpton, a graduate of Smith College, also served on the boards of Planned Parenthood, the Institute for World Affairs and the Public Education Association.         In addition to George, she is survived by two other sons, Francis T. P. Plimpton Jr. of Ormond Beach, Fla. and Oakes A. Plimpton of Boston; a daughter, Sarah Plimpton of New York; a brother, Amyas Ames of Syosset, L.I., seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren.

         Holly Harp, the California designer who went from a Sunset Boulevard sensation to a darling of Fifth Avenue salons, died on Monday at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 55.         The cause of death was cancer, said her fiance, Mark Buchman.         Mrs. Harp, who captivated Hollywood with a rich hippie look in the 1960's and enthralled New York with soft clinging designs, was nominated for Coty awards two times.         But Mr. Buchman said on Friday in reporting her death that Mrs. Harp once described herself as a "counterculturalist," an apt description for a woman who began her career translating the clothes of the flower children into fashion for counterculture heroines.         When rock stars like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick began exchanging jeans for Mrs. Harp's fringed vests and tie-dyed velvet dresses, the Holly's Harp shop that she opened on Sunset Boulevard in 1968 became the center of a new style.         Her husband at the time, Jim, described the fashions, which included painted jersey, silk and chiffon dresses, and hip-hugger bell bottoms made from old draperies, as "somewhere between here and Mars."         Mrs. Harp came down to earth a bit after 1973, when she began selling to Fifth Avenue stores like Henri Bendel and Bergdorf Goodman, whose fourth-floor Holly Harp shop showed her latest collection of $1,500 evening dresses three weeks ago.         But for all their initial counterculture flamboyance, the designs from the beginning included soft flowing chiffon dresses. Mrs. Harp had a disarming explanation for how she achieved that soft romantic look. "I took the construction out," she said.         For all the comparative elegance of her sensuous body-hugging evening dresses, Mrs. Harp's designs always had an edge, sometimes literally. In 1977, when one bright red creation reminded her of a flame, she proceeded to enhance the effect, taking a blowtorch and charring the garment's edges.         "I'm not trying to do tasteful little uniforms," she said in 1988. "Being dressed in perfect taste is very aging."         Mrs. Harp, a size 6 who designed for her own 5-foot-4-inch frame, had no patience for the presumed restrictions of age. As she put it when she appeared at an interview at the age of 47 wearing a short lame dress with glitter hose: "I still have a sexy little girl in me that won't quit."         Mrs. Harp was born in Buffalo and studied design at North Texas State University, where she met and married Mr. Harp, an English instructor. Her boutique became such a success that he abandoned his academic career. They divorced in 1980, but remained business partners.         Surviving are a son, Tom, of Los Angeles; two sisters, Sarah Bozzola of Orange, Conn., and Elizabeth Horn of Buffalo, and a brother, Thomas Speller of Buffalo.       
         Judith A. Goldman, who was long active in Jewish cultural, philanthropic and environmental causes, died yesterday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         The cause of death was cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Goldman was the president of the sisterhood of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue and the chairwoman of the book and author series of UJA-Federation of New York.         In 1977 she co-founded the Council for a Beautiful Israel, an environmental group, with Ora Herzog, a former First Lady of Israel.         Mrs. Goldman was also active in the women's division of the American Technion Society and the Yeshiva University women's organization.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jacob E. Goldman; a brother, Rabbi Burton Mehler of the Bronx; three sisters, Jean Kelman of Queens and Gloria Mehler and Mindella Lamm of Manhattan; three sons, Shalom L., of East Thetford, Vt., and Ari L. and Dov E., of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.         She is also survived by three stepchildren, Melvin Goldman of Chevy Chase, Md., Edith Goldman-Hoffman of Brookline, Mass., and Beth Goldman of Manhattan.         Correction:  May 3, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary on Sunday about Judith A. Goldman, who was long active in Jewish cultural and philanthropic causes, misspelled the given name of a former First Lady of Israel with whom she founded an environmental group. The former First Lady is Aura Herzog, not Ora.
