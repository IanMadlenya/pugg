        Dr. Lauretta Bender, a child neuro-psychiatrist, researcher and educator, died Jan. 4 in a nursing home in Annapolis, Md. She was 88 years old and lived in Annapolis.         Dr. Lauretta Bender, a child neuro-psychiatrist, researcher and educator, died Jan. 4 in a nursing home in Annapolis, Md. She was 88 years old and lived in Annapolis.         Dr. Bender was known for developing, in 1923, the Bender-Gestault Visual Motor Test, a neuropsychological examination that has become a worldwide standard. She spent many years researching the cause of childhood schizophrenia and was responsible for studies on child suicides and violence.         In 1955, Dr. Bender received the Adolf Meyer Memorial Award for her contributions to the understanding of schizophrenic children.         She became a staff member of Bellevue Hospital in 1930 and later was senior psychiatrist in charge of the Children's Service at the hospital, a post she held for 21 years. Consulant to Children's Guild         Also in 1955, Dr. Bender was appointed principal research scientist in child psychiatry, a new post in the State Mental Hygiene Department. She continued working with the state until 1973, when she moved to Annapolis. Dr. Bender taught at the University of Maryland and was a consultant to the Children's Guild Inc., a group that works with emotionally disturbed youngsters, and similar organizations.         She was born in Butte, Mont. Dr. Bender graduated with a B.S. from the University of Chicago in 1922 and an M.A. in pathology in 1923. She received a medical degree from the State University of Iowa in 1926.         After completing her internship and residency at Billings Hospital of the University of Chicago, she became a resident psychiatrist at Boston Psychopathic Hospital from 1928 to 1929. From 1929 to 1930, Dr. Bender was a research associate in psychiatry at the Phipps Clinic of Johns Hopkins Hospital.         Dr. Bender was a member of such organizations as the American Psychiatric Association; the American Neurological Association, the American Academy of Child Psychiatry and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She was also on the Citizen's Committee for Children of New York City Inc.         Dr. Bender had been married to Dr. Paul Schilder, a Viennese psychiatrist who was an associate of Freud. Dr. Schilder died in 1940. In 1968, Dr. Bender married Dr. Henry Banford Parks, a historian and professor at New York University. He died in 1973.         She is survived by a son, Dr. Peter Schilder of Annapolis; a daughter, Jane S. Knowles of Santa Fe, N.M.; three grandchildren, and a brother, Karl Bender of Milwaukee, Ore.       
        Lilliana W. Teruzzi, a former opera singer and donor of the $2,500 Teruzzi Award for aspiring singers in the mid-1960's, died Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         Lilliana W. Teruzzi, a former opera singer and donor of the $2,500 Teruzzi Award for aspiring singers in the mid-1960's, died Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         Mrs. Teruzzi, who sang under the name Lillian Lorma and whose name was originally Lilliana Weinman, presented the award to winners of Metropolitan Opera contract competitions from 1965 to 1969.         She married Gen. Attilio Teruzzi, commander of Italy's Fascist militia, in 1926 and obtained a legal separation in 1929. General Teruzzi died in 1950.         Mrs. Teruzzi was a member of the board of directors of the Opera Orchestra of New York from 1977 to 1985.       
        Elsa de Brun, who painted under the Gaelic name of Nuala, died last night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease.         Elsa de Brun, who painted under the Gaelic name of Nuala, died last night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease.         Nuala's lyrical abstractions hang at Carnegie Hall, the Bymusbun Museum in Copenhagen, the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington and at the University of Texas.         Nuala did not become a recognized artist until she was a grandmother. Her talent was first discovered by her manager-companion of more than 40 years, Patric Farrell, the former director of the Museum of Irish Art and the Irish Theater in Manhattan's Sheridan Square in the 1920's.         They were married at Carnegie Hall on June 14, 1984, in front of her brightly illuminated stained-glass window, adpated from her pastel painting, ''Pleasure in Eternal Tumult.''         The artist was born in Stockholm and was educated there at the Anna Sandstrom School.         When she was 19, she moved with her family to New York City, where her father was an engineer engaged in import-export trade. It was not until 1946 that she began the fine-line pencil drawings that developed into her own style.         Among her most noted pastels was a collection of 43 paintings titled ''Valentines for James Joyce,'' based on ''Finnegans Wake,'' that was purchased by the University of Texas in Austin where it is housed in the Humanities Center.         Survivors, in addition to her husband, are a son by a previous marriage, the Rev. Guy de Brun, of Waxhaw, N.C.; a stepdaughter, Mrs. Laurance Wilson, of Kalamazoo, Mich.; 8 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
        Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         She had been on the air with few interruptions from 1931 to 1975, and the programs led to books and records for children. Her 30 awards included a Peabody and an Emmy. On her radio show, heard in the early evening for decades, she told stories in which she acted each part - ranging from princesses and wicked stepmothers to dragons - with a piano accompaniment. For this she was known as the ''Lady With a Thousand Voices.''         In the late 1930's and early 40's, national polls of radio editors consistently placed her programs first in juvenile entertainment. More than 25 million children listened to her regularly.         She was born Irene Seaton in Quincy, Ill., in 1900 and educated at public schools there. She graduated from the University of Illinois, where she studied music and drama. She then studied at the Goodman School of the Theater in Chicago and appeared in professional roles at the Goodman Theater in 1929 and 1930. Letter Added for Luck         Early in her radio career, she changed the spelling of her first name to Ireene with three ''e's'' when she was told by a numerologist that one more letter would bring her great success.         With her first husband, Walter Charles Wicker, a radio writer, producer and actor, she performed in two early soap operas, ''Today's Children'' and ''Harold Teen.''         The Wickers had a son, Walter Charles Jr., who died in action as a fighter pilot in World War II, and a daughter, Nancy.         Her debut as a children's radio entertainer came as a direct result of the way she amused her own offspring, telling tales and singing songs. ''The Singing Lady'' began as a local radio program in Chicago. Her Routine Was Her Own         According to an account by Val Adams in The New York Times, the sponsoring Kellogg's cornflakes company handed her a list of nursery rhymes and told her to do a children's program. ''She developed the routine of dramatizing fairy tales and playing all the parts herself,'' Mr. Adams wrote in 1948.         When television came along, she adapted her ''Singing Lady'' format to the new medium, using marionettes to act out her stories while she supplied the voices.         During the 1950's, Red Channels, a private blacklisting publication, charged that the actress had sponsored a re-election committee for a Communist councilman in New York. She denied she had even heard of the man and the charges were later withdrawn with apologies.         After her program was discontinued on commercial radio, it was later resumed on the Public Broadcasting System, and she was also heard on network radio affiliates.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1938. In 1941 she married Victor J. Hammer, co-owner with his brother Armand of the Hammer Galleries in New York. He died in 1985.         Mrs. Hammer is survived by her daughter, Nancy Eilan of Stamford, Conn.       
        Elayne Hanley Varian, an art curator and exhibition organizer, died of cardiopulmonary arrest on Nov. 4 at her home in Orlando, Fla. She was 74 years old.         Elayne Hanley Varian, an art curator and exhibition organizer, died of cardiopulmonary arrest on Nov. 4 at her home in Orlando, Fla. She was 74 years old.         With her eye for the new and the lively, Mrs. Varian was best known in New York for the provocative shows of avant-garde art that she organized in the 1960's and 1970's as director of the contemporary wing of the Finch College Museum of Art. Among the more notable were a series called ''Art in Process,'' staged over an 11-year period ending in 1973, which exposed in detail the working methods and techniques of a number of contemporary artists; two ''Projected Art'' exhibitions of experimental films, videotapes and documentaries of artists at work; two Art Deco shows noted for scholarship and selectivity, and a documentary film by the artist Les Levine that portrayed the civil strife in northern Ireland. Mrs. Varian also taught courses in museology and art history at Finch.         Elayne Hanley was born in San Francisco on Oct. 10, 1913. She was graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and later received a master's degree in fine art there. She came to New York in 1933 and worked for a while as a dress designer. She married John Varian, a lawyer, in 1936, and retired to raise their son.         In the mid-1940's, she joined the Duveen Brothers gallery, where she became assistant to the president, Edward Fowles, and remained there for 15 years. She went to Finch College as director of its contemporary museum in 1964, a position she held until the college closed for lack of funds in 1975.         In that year, Mrs. Varian moved to Orlando, where her husband had retired. For three years, she served as curator of contemporary art at the John and Mabel Ringling Museum in Sarasota. After leaving there in 1978, she did art appraisal work and mounted several shows as a freelance curator.         She is survived by her husband and by a son, Alfred, of Stowe, Vt.       
        Mary E. T. Zabriskie, a retired president of the board of St. Agnes School in Alexandria, Va., died Sunday at her home in Washington. She was 90 years old.         Mary E. T. Zabriskie, a retired president of the board of St. Agnes School in Alexandria, Va., died Sunday at her home in Washington. She was 90 years old.         Mrs. Zabriskie was a 1919 graduate of Bryn Mawr College and was married the Rev. Alexander C. Zabriskie. She was executive director of the National Cathedral Association in Washington in 1958-59.         She is survived by three sons, the Rev. George Zabriskie 2d; Dr. Philip Zabriskie, and the Rev. Alexander Zabriskie Jr., and a daughter, Mary Zabriskie.       
        Diana Sheean, an author and the widow of Vincent Sheean, died of a stroke complicated by pneumonia at St. Stephen's Hospital in London last Wednesday. She was 72 years old.         Diana Sheean, an author and the widow of Vincent Sheean, died of a stroke complicated by pneumonia at St. Stephen's Hospital in London last Wednesday. She was 72 years old.         The daughter of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson and Lady Gertrude Forbes-Robertson, a well-known actor and actress, Mrs. Sheean was born in London and spent most of her childhood in Kent, near the cliffs of Dover. ''There the great events of the village,'' she recalled, ''were the arrivals of Channel swimmers and German mines, which still washed up on the beach from time to time.''         Mrs. Sheean, whose nickname was Dinah, wrote several books, including ''The Battle of Waterloo Road'' (1941), illustrated by Robert Capa's photographs, about the people in Britain during the war; ''War Letters From Britain'' (1941), edited with Roger W. Straus Jr.; ''A Cat and a King'' (1949), a novel about the theater, and ''My Aunt Maxine'' (1964), a biography of her aunt, Maxine Elliott, the American actress. #3 Plays 'Fizzed Out'         She was educated at boarding schools and at a French school in London, and she lived for several months with a family in Vienna. Her only connection with the theater, aside from the involvement of her parents, was writing three plays that, in her words, ''fizzed out.''         In 1935 she married Vincent Sheean, the noted American foreign correspondent, whose book ''Personal History'' was published to great success that year. They traveled widely in Spain, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in Europe before settling in the United States.         During those travels Mrs. Sheean wrote dispatches to The New York Herald Tribune, and before and during World War II she was active in committees raising money and distributing food for Spanish refugee children and victims of Nazism.         The Sheeans were divorced in 1946 and remarried in 1949.         Mrs. Sheean is survived by two daughters, Linda, of New York City, and Ellen, of London.       
        Sylvia Lewis, former director of the 92d Street Y Nursery School, died Friday after a long illness at her home in Manhattan. She was 81 years old.         Sylvia Lewis, former director of the 92d Street Y Nursery School, died Friday after a long illness at her home in Manhattan. She was 81 years old.         Mrs. Lewis was director of the nursery school from 1968 until her retirement in 1975. She played a major role in developing the school's preschool education program, which emphasized Jewish culture.         Before becoming director of the school, Mrs. Lewis had taught there for more than 10 years.         ''She was unbelievably gifted in every way,'' said Emily Rosenthal, who directed the school from 1946 to 1966, ''The children loved her.''         Born in Manhattan in 1906, Mrs. Lewis married Kassel Lewis in 1925. She was graduated in 1927 from Barnard College, where she studied English.         Mrs. Lewis is survived by her son, Anthony Lewis, a columnist of The New York Times, a sister, Frieda Berg of the Riverdale section of the Bronx, and nine grandchildren.       
        Hebe Dorsey, the fashion editor of The International Herald Tribune and a major figure in the fashion world, died of cancer yesterday morning at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. She was 62 years old and had been working for the paper for about 40 years.         Hebe Dorsey, the fashion editor of The International Herald Tribune and a major figure in the fashion world, died of cancer yesterday morning at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. She was 62 years old and had been working for the paper for about 40 years.         Known for her irreverence and for fascination with society, Mrs. Dorsey frequently combined fashion and social reporting, and was in fact a member of the international social set herself.         A witty and somewhat acerbic commentator, Mrs. Dorsey was a force in fashion circles in New York and Tokyo as well as Paris.         ''She had the courage to report fashion critically,'' said Bill Blass, the designer, who remembered meeting her soon after World War II in Paris with Art Buchwald and other Tribune contributors. She was somewhat blase in those days, and she never really changed her attitude, he said. ''She liked the social aspects of fashion and she drew the connection between the two worlds,'' he added.         Hebe (pronounced ay-bay) Dorsey was born March 5, 1925, in Sousse, Tunisia, one of five children of Mary and Clement Halfon. After attending a French high school, she went on to study English and French at the Sorbonne. She became a contributor to The Herald Tribune when it was the European edition of The New York Herald Tribune. At about the same time, she married Frank Dorsey, a copy editor there, according to her brother, Leon Halfon. They were divorced some years ago. Award From Fashion Group         Earlier this fall she was one of five nominees for the journalism award given by the French Federation of Couture Ready to Wear and Creators of Fashion, an organization of trade groups. On Jan. 11, she was to receive an award for international journalism from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in New York.         ''She had an appointment next week to be fitted for the dress she was planning to wear,'' Mr. Blass said. ''It was a simple little short red satin strapless dress trimmed in fake leopard.''         Christian Lacroix said he would miss ''her sharpness, her acute sense of analysis and her style.'' She had ''helped launch us,'' France's newest couturier said, and he was happy that she was in New York in October when the first showing of his fashions was held in this country. Mrs. Dorsey was one of the first women to be seen in a Lacroix design, turning up at parties in his strapless red pouf-skirt dress. 'The Girl From Tunis'         ''I think of her as the girl from Tunis who was so involved with her family,'' Mr. Lacroix said, ''not of the dragon-like editor who was so intimidating at the fashion shows.''         He had lunch with her 10 days ago at the Ritz in Paris. ''She was wearing a Valentino suit with a fox collar and all her diamonds - she was in great spirits.''         Mrs. Dorsey generally wore clothes from such French couture houses as Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Lacroix, but would occasionally turn up in, say, a blue denim suit by an unknown tailor. She was also interested in jewelry and decorating.         ''Hebe revolutionized fashion writing,'' said John Fairchild, chairman of Fairchild Publications. ''She invented the idea of reviewing fashion like a play and she always did it with a razor, not a knife.''         John Vinocur, executive editor of The Herald Tribune, called her ''loyal, fierce, enormously generous and wildly funny.'' He said she could be ''enormously entertaining in two languages,'' switching from French to English ''without losing an ounce of wit.'' Streak of Irreverence         Her irreverence is illustrated by the article she wrote a few years ago after being bannned from a Christian Dior fashion show for an unfavorable review of the house's previous collection. Instead of lamenting the ban, she described using the free time to have her hair done, go shopping and take care of other chores she would not otherwise have had time for.         She entertained lavishly, both in her large apartment on the Boulevard Malesherbes in Paris and her pied-a-terre on the East Side of Manhattan.         ''She helped put fashion in the public eye,'' said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times and co-chairman of The Herald Tribune. ''She had a good time with her life,'' added his wife, Carol Sulzberger, a friend of Mrs. Dorsey.         Walter N. Thayer, chairman of Whitney Communications and president of The Herald Tribune, commented, ''She was a great lady and a wonderful person who had friends in all walks of life.'' An 'Excellent' Reporter         ''I met her 30 years ago when she was a young fashion writer and I was a fashion writer on the 'Today' show,'' Barbara Walters said. ''She never took herself too seriously, though she knew fashion was a serious business.''         Her book, ''La Belle Epoque,'' a compilation of pieces from The Herald Tribune recalling Paris in its heyday, was published there last year. She also wrote a monthly column for French Vogue and contributed articles on fashion and decorating to other publications such as The New York Times.         She is survived by three sisters, Zilia Sfez of Tunisia, Yvonne Brami of Nice and Nelly Cohen of Versailles, in addition to her brother. Her son, Joseph, is a photographer in Paris, and her daughter, Monika, lives in New York City.         The family requests that instead of flowers contributions be made to the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation, 1150 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10128.         Burial will be tomorrow at 10:30 A.M. at the Pantin cemetery outside Paris.         A memorial service in New York is being planned by Miss Walters, Marilyn Evins, the fashion publicist, and other friends.       
        Margaret Scolari Barr, an art historian and teacher who was the wife and assistant of Alfred H. Barr, the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, died of cancer of the colon yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Margaret Scolari Barr, an art historian and teacher who was the wife and assistant of Alfred H. Barr, the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, died of cancer of the colon yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The diversity of Mrs. Barr's talents and the force of her personality made her a presence in the New York art world for half a century.         She was the author of ''Medardo Rosso (1858-1928),'' a monograph on the Italian modernist sculptor that was published by the Museum of Modern Art in 1963.         She taught art history for 37 years at the Spence School, where she inspired many future scholars, including Joan R. Mertens, curator of Greek and Roman art at the Metropolitan Museum.         Mrs. Barr was fluent in French, Italian, Spanish and German and was crucially involved in her husband's curatorial activities and in the wartime effort to provide refuge in the United States for European artists. 'An Essential Partner'         ''Marga was a remarkable person who was an essential partner in the achievements and legacy of Alfred Barr,'' said Richard E. Oldenburg, the director of the Modern. ''A gifted art historian with a fine sense of quality, she was also very intelligent, strong-willed and intensely honest about everything and everyone, including herself.''         ''The book on Rosso is still the best work on him in English,'' said Hilton Kramer, the editor of The New Criterion, whose issue last summer, ''Our Campaigns,'' was devoted to Mrs. Barr's biographical chronicle of the years 1930 to 1944, the turbulent period when Mr. Barr helped shape the Museum of Modern Art. Mr. Barr died in 1981 at the age of 79.         ''She was a very gifted linguist, and Alfred was not,'' Mr. Kramer said. ''So all of his dealings with Picasso, Matisse, Miro and virtually all non-English-speaking European artists were done with her as the interpreter. Neither of his two most important books, on Picasso and Matisse, could have been possible without her.''         Mr. Barr's monograph ''Picasso: Fifty Years of His Art,'' published in 1946, was dedicated to her.         ''I grew up in awe of Alfred and Margaret,'' said Anne d'Harnoncourt, the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, whose father, Rene d'Harnoncourt, was director of the Museum of Modern Art from 1949 to 1968. ''I think the remarkable thing about Margaret was her emphasis. She made everyone else, including me, feel fuzzy and vague. She had a real gift for drawing your attention and not letting it go.'' Born in Rome         Margaret Scolari was born in Rome in 1901. Her mother, Mary Fitzmaurice, was Irish. Her father, Virgilio Scolari, was an Italian antiques dealer. At the University of Rome from 1919 to 1922, she specialized in humanistic and linguistic studies.         She came to the United States in 1925 and taught Italian at Vassar, from which she also received a master's degree in art history.         In September 1929 she moved to New York City, where she studied art history at New York University. Late in the year, at the inaugural exhibition of the Museum of Modern Art, she met Alfred Barr.         They were married in Paris in 1930. In a profile on Alfred Barr in The New Yorker in 1953, Dwight Macdonald wrote: ''The day after the wedding, Barr started out to borrow pictures for a forthcoming Corot-Daumier show, with Mrs. Barr acting as his translator and secretary. They continued the arrangement through the thirties, going abroad almost every summer to beg and borrow pictures for the next year's exhibitions.''         During World War II, Mrs. Barr was involved in the Emergency Rescue Committee (now the International Rescue Committee), which was responsible for helping artists like Jacques Lipchitz, Piet Mondrian, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy and Andre Masson to leave Europe. Translations and Chronology         Mrs. Barr translated Charles Rufus Morey's catalogue of the Vatican Library's Museo Christiano into Italian. She also made the first complete English translation of Matisse's ''Notes of a Painter.''         At the time of her death she was working on the chronology of her life with her husband.         In the introduction to her art history course at Spence, where she taught from 1943 to 1980, Mrs. Barr wrote:         ''I spend no time defining what is art, you'll soon know. Not all of it is, at first sight, beautiful; little of it is pretty; all of it is interesting. And the more you know about a work of art - what preceded it, what followed it, the reasons why it is the way it is - the more it will come to life for you. The tourist who goes through museums exclaiming, 'Beautiful, Beautiful,' is something to be deplored. You jolly well must know why.         ''Now plan to enjoy yourselves. As Poussin, the great French painter of the 17th century, remarked, 'Le fin de l'art est la delectation,' '' - ''The goal of art is delight.''         Mrs. Barr is survived by a daughter, Victoria, a painter who lives in New York City.         A memorial service will be held at 4 P.M. on Jan. 12 at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, 921 Madison Avenue, at 73d Street.       
        Molly O'Day, who never became a major national star but who was prized by aficionados as one of the finest country-and-western singers ever, died of cancer of the colon Saturday at Cabell Huntington Hospital in Huntington, W.Va. She was 64 years old.         Molly O'Day, who never became a major national star but who was prized by aficionados as one of the finest country-and-western singers ever, died of cancer of the colon Saturday at Cabell Huntington Hospital in Huntington, W.Va. She was 64 years old.         Miss O'Day retired in 1952, when she was only 29. Yet she was called ''one of the greatest, if not the greatest, women singers in country music'' by Robert Shelton, former popular-music critic of The New York Times. Dolly Parton said Miss O'Day's singing had profoundly influenced her. And Earl Scruggs, the bluegrass banjo player, said he had once been beaten by her in a Kentucky banjo-picking contest, and that he had been awed by both her singing and her banjo playing.         Miss O'Day, whose original name was LaVerne Williamson, was born in McVeigh, Ky., in the same eastern Kentucky hills that also produced such country stars as Loretta Lynn and Ricky Scaggs. A Pure, Roughly Urban Sound         Her career began in 1939, when she joined her fiddle-playing brother, Skeets, in a touring country band. At that time she assumed the first of many stage names, Mountain Fern. Her name became Dixie Lee in 1940, and the next year she married a fellow band member, Lynn Davis. It was only later that she chose the stage name Molly O'Day.         Miss O'Day's recordings, 36 songs made for Columbia Records between 1946 and 1951, document a purer, more roughly rural country style than the urbanized, smoothed-over Nashville sound that has since come to dominate country music. Her most famous number was ''The Tramp on the Street''; others included ''Teardrops Falling in the Snow,'' ''Don't Sell Daddy Any More Whisky'' and Hank Williams's ''Singing Waterfall.''         Her recordings included considerable sacred music, exclusively so after 1950. In 1952 she contracted tuberculosis, which greatly curtailed her singing. Her secular career ended when she and her husband decided to become ministers in the Church of God.         Her later years were spent reclusively in Huntington. She refused honors, and insisted that her career had had no impact on modern country music.         She is survived by her husband.       
        Helen Taft Manning, professor emeritus of history and longtime dean of Bryn Mawr College, died Saturday of pneumonia at a nursing home in suburban Philadelphia. She was 95 years old.         Helen Taft Manning, professor emeritus of history and longtime dean of Bryn Mawr College, died Saturday of pneumonia at a nursing home in suburban Philadelphia. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Manning, a specialist in British colonial history, served as dean from 1917 to 1919 and from 1925 to 1941. She later served as professor of history and head of the department, retiring in 1957.         She was the daughter of William Howard Taft, the 27th President and, until his death in 1930, the 10th Chief Justice of the United States.         Miss Taft graduated from Bryn Mawr in 1915, was named dean in 1917 and rose to acting president in 1919. She left to earn her doctorate at Yale, reclaiming the deanship in 1925.         In 1920, she married Frederick Johnson Manning, a history professor who then moved from Yale to Swarthmore College.         Mrs. Manning is survived by two daughters, Helen Manning Hunter, an economics professor at Bryn Mawr, and Caroline Cunningham, a teacher at the Manhattan School of Music.         A funeral service has been scheduled for 2:30 P.M. Saturday at the Church of the Redeemer in Bryn Mawr.       
        Inna Kitrosskaya Meiman, the wife of a Soviet dissident, died yesterday at the Lombardi Cancer Research Center of Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, three weeks after she was allowed to go abroad for treatment of an inoperable tumor on her neck. She was 53 years old and had been waiting years for permission to travel.         Inna Kitrosskaya Meiman, the wife of a Soviet dissident, died yesterday at the Lombardi Cancer Research Center of Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, three weeks after she was allowed to go abroad for treatment of an inoperable tumor on her neck. She was 53 years old and had been waiting years for permission to travel.         Gerald Strober, a spokesman for the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, which helped to plead her case, said Mrs. Meiman was admitted to the center on Jan. 20. In asking to go abroad, Mrs. Meiman said she wanted to undergo specialized radiation treatment, her only remaining hope for survival. Complications Reported         According to Mr. Strober, she had various tests complicated by low blood pressure, drug-induced diabetes and infection.         ''Basically she was still being evaluated for the start of chemotherapy,'' Mr. Strober said.  She was the wife of Prof. Naum Meiman, a mathematician who himself had long been denied an exit visa on the ground that he did secret work 30 years ago. Professor Meiman, 76 years of age, was a member of a now-disbanded group that monitored Soviet compliance with the Helsinki accords of 1975.         Professor Meiman said last month that he did not think officials might relent and let him follow his wife now that her health had become precarious. He said that his wife had undergone chemotherapy and four operations and that her only chance lay in American experimental treatment.         Mrs. Meiman, a teacher of English, was married to Professor Meiman in 1981.         Word that she might be able to leave first came from Senator Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat and possible Democratic Presidential candidate, while he was on a visit to Moscow in December. He said he had made a special plea for her to Mikhael S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.         Later, in a meeting, with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Senator Hart was informed of that the case was being ''reconsidered.'' Another Soviet cancer patient, Rimma Bravve, left Moscow on Dec. 18 in Senator Hart's company to receive treatment in New York. Left With Mixed Feelings         At the time of her own departure, Mrs. Meiman said she was leaving with ''mixed feelings'' since her husband had to stay behind. She said she had been feeling weak for some weeks and was eager to enter the Georgetown center.         Donna Hartman, the wife of Ambassador Arthur A. Hartman, accompanied Mrs. Meiman through routine customs and passport controls.         Mrs. Meiman is survived by a son from a previous marriage, Leo Kitrossky, a scientist in Moscow with three children. Also surviving is a daughter of Professor Meiman by a previous marriage, Olga Plam of Boulder, Colo.         INNA MEIMAN, EMIGRE, DIES AT 53       
        Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         ''The information we have is that Mrs. Manley died last night in her sleep,'' the spokesman said, giving no cause of death.         Mrs. Manley was regarded as a major Caribbean and Latin American sculptor. At the same time, she was, as the wife of one of Jamaica's leading political figures, Norman Washington Manley, a major patron of the arts.         In colonial Jamaica as early as 1937 she fostered art with her own work and by teaching a generation of Jamaican artists.         She helped found Forum, a magazine in which young Caribbean poets and writers were often first published, and helped found the Jamaica Art School.         Her own sculpture earned her international recognition, including exhibitions in France and England.         Mrs. Manley was born Edna Swithenbank, in Hampshire, England, of a Jamaican mother and a British father. In 1921 she married her first cousin, a Rhodes scholar and lawyer who founded the People's National Party in Jamaica and helped lead his country to political independence in 1962. He died in 1969.         Mrs. Manley is survived by two sons: Michael, leader of the party his father founded and Jamaica's Prime Minister from 1972 to 1980, and Douglas, a social scientist who served in his brother's Cabinet.       
        Mura Dehn, a Russian-born dancer and choreographer who became known as a film maker and a specialist in American black dance, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Mura Dehn, a Russian-born dancer and choreographer who became known as a film maker and a specialist in American black dance, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Miss Dehn, who directed a company of black dancers until 1973, was considered a pioneer in documenting the various styles of black social dance. Last November, Joseph Papp's Film at the Public series presented ''The Spirit Moves,'' Miss Dehn's highly praised five-hour film about the evolution of black dance styles. Its images of the celebrated Lindy Hoppers, who danced at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem in the 1940's, are considered among the most valuable archival footage in a field that covers both social and theatrical history. Among the Savoy dancers recorded in the film are jazz dance stars such as Al Minns, Sarah Washington, Leon James and James Berry, who also recreated his song and dance routines of the 1920's.         ''I consider these films a portrait of our century because all the important events of our time were reflected in dance in one way or another,'' Miss Dehn told The New York Times in November. She said she turned to film because ''a film would be the first real book we had about these dances.'' Inspired by Josephine Baker         Born in Odessa, Miss Dehn came to the United States in 1930 after performing in Europe with a modern-dance group directed by Ellen Tells. Josephine Baker, the American dancer who became a star in Paris in the 1920's, ignited what was to be Miss Dehn's long-lasting passion for jazz dance.         In her New York dance debut in 1932, Miss Dehn choreographed a work, ''The Wise and Foolish Virgins,'' that used a chanting black chorus. Miss Dehn formed a jazz-dance company at that time. The troupe evolved into the Traditional Jazz Dance Company, which was made up of black entertainers and which toured internationally. The group also performed at the Olympic Games in Mexico.         Miss Dehn's second husband, Herman Thomas, a retired captain in the Merchant Marine, died in 1982. She was previously married to the American painter Adolph Dehn.       
        Nora Kaye, a leading American ballerina whose exceptional power as a dramatic dancer made her an international star, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles after a long illness. She was 67.         Nora Kaye, a leading American ballerina whose exceptional power as a dramatic dancer made her an international star, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles after a long illness. She was 67.         Miss Kaye was one of the foremost ballerinas of her time. Although she danced many classical roles, she became known for creating a new contemporary look among dancers, especially in Antony Tudor's dance-dramas in the 1940's and 1950's.         In an era when ballet was considered a Russian art, Miss Kaye remained steadfastly an American dancer. Her last name was originally Koreff, but she changed it to Kaye because ''an American dancer ought to have an American name,'' as she put it.         Called the ''Duse of the dance,'' Miss Kaye excelled in dramatic roles. The world premiere by Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, of Mr. Tudor's psychological ballet ''Pillar of Fire'' catapulted her to stardom in 1942. Symbol of Tenacity and Vigor         Mikhail Baryshnikov, Ballet Theater's current artistic director, said of the ballerina: ''She was undoubtedly a great woman of the theater and a symbol to any dancer of tenacity, vigor and what it means to be a great star. Everyone in the dance world mourns her and is sad today.''         Miss Kaye was a charter member of Ballet Theater from the company's first year, 1939. There she worked with Mr. Tudor, one of the company's choreographers and teachers, who revealed ballet to her as an expressive art.         During Ballet Theater's first New York season early in 1940, she danced in the chorus of several Tudor ballets. The choreographer offered Miss Kaye her first important dramatic or character role, that of the Russian ballerina in his comic ballet ''Gala Performance,'' for its premiere in February 1941.         But it was her portrayal of the sexually repressed Hagar in ''Pillar of Fire,'' that raised Miss Kaye to the status of prima ballerina and helped make her one of the best-known American ballerinas in the world.         Reviewing the ballet at its premiere in April 1942, John Martin, then dance critic of The New York Times, rated Miss Kaye's characterization as among ''the great examples of tragic acting of its generation.'' 'I Wanted to Extend Myself'         By 1943, Miss Kaye was dancing most of the lead female roles in the Ballet Theater repertory. She performed with the company through 1951, when she left to dance with the New York City Ballet.         She was not well suited to the City Ballet style, however. though she had notable triumphs, among them her portrayal of the man-killing Novice in ''The Cage,'' which Jerome Robbins created for her. ''I wanted to extend myself,'' she said in 1977 of her years with City Ballet, ''but I was wrong for it.'' She returned to Ballet Theater in 1954 and danced with the company until 1959. She retired from the stage in 1961.         Miss Kaye was known as a Tudor ballerina, but she danced ballets by many other contemporary choreographers, including Jerome Robbins, George Balanchine, Valerie Bettis, Kenneth MacMillan, John Taras and Herbert Ross, whom she married in 1959.         Born in New York City, and named after the heroine of ''A Doll's House,'' Miss Kaye was exposed at an early age to Stanislavskian acting by her father, Gregory Koreff, a former actor with the Moscow Art Theater. She began studying dance at the age of 5, working with the celebrated choreographer Michel Fokine.         At 8, Miss Kaye entered Margaret Curtis's ballet class at the Metropolitan Opera school. At 15, she graduated into the Metropolitan Opera's corps de ballet and danced with the American Ballet, a company founded by Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, when it became the Metropolitan's resident ballet troupe in 1935. She also studied at the School of American Ballet and with such noted teachers as Anatole Vilzak, Ludmila Shollar and Margaret Craske.         She then abandoned ballet for several years, feeling, as she later said, that it was ''something dragged up from 300 years ago that didn't make any sense and wasn't going anyplace.'' She performed in musical comedies, among them ''Virginia,'' in 1937, ''Great Lady'' (1938), ''Stars in Your Eyes'' (1939) and, in 1952, ''Two's Company.'' She also danced in the Radio City Music Hall corps de ballet for nine months in the late 1930's. Assisted on Film Projects         Miss Kaye was associate artistic director of Ballet Theater from 1977 to 1983. In later years, she also assisted Mr. Ross, by then a well-known film and stage producer and director, in his projects. Miss Kaye served as executive producer of ''The Turning Point,'' a 1977 film whose story was said to have been drawn from her own life, though she denied the rumor. Last summer, she assisted Mr. Ross in his filming of ''Giselle.''         Other credits included work as executive producer or co-producer on the films ''The Last of Sheila,'' ''The Seven Percent Solution,'' ''Nijinsky,'' ''Pennies From Heaven'' and ''The Secret of My Success.''         ''As an American ballerina,'' Miss Kaye wrote in 1950 in Theater Arts magazine, ''I never take anything for granted. I question each tradition, each interpretation, each movement. The answers I have found, sometimes right and sometimes wrong, constitute my contribution to the young American dancer of ballet: not to accept until you understand (at least to your own satisfaction), and not to dance any role, ancient or new, until you do understand. This urge to question and to discover is, I think, the trademark of American ballet.''         Miss Kaye is survived by Mr. Ross. Earlier marriages to Michael Van Buren and Isaac Stern, the violinist, ended in divorce. The funeral is on Monday at 4 P.M. at the Westwood Village Mortuary in Los Angeles.

Sadie Youngman, the target of one of the best-known and shortest one-liners in American comedy, died Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center after a long illness. She was 82 years old and had been married to Henny Youngman for 58 years.         ''Take my wife . . . please!'' was among several jokes the comedian cracked at his wife's expense.         ''She took it with a grain of salt,'' Mr. Youngman, 81, said. ''She knew I was just joking. She always stuck by me, and that's what counts.''         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Youngman is survived by a daughter, Marilyn; a son, Gary, and three grandchildren.       
        Maria Augusta von Trapp, the guiding force behind a family of singers who won world reknown when their story was portrayed in the play and film ''The Sound of Music,'' died of heart failure yesterday in Morrisville, Vt., three days after undergoing surgery.

She was 82 years old, and had lived in Stowe, Vt., for more than 40 years.         The story of the von Trapp family, which fled Austria to avoid complicity with Nazi rule and toured the United States as the Trapp Family Choir, was transformed into one of the movie industry's greatest financial successes, with the release of ''The Sound of Music'' starring Julie Andrews in 1965.         Baroness von Trapp, who had studied to become a nun before marrying an Austrian war hero, Baron Georg von Trapp, in 1927, said she and the rest of the family received little of the $180 million in revenues from the film. However, she praised it for honestly depicting her life story and for bringing joy and hope to millions of people. In interviews, she repeatedly asserted her faith in God and devotion to the Roman Catholic Church. Praised Film's Influence         ''The great good the film and the play are doing to individual lives is far beyond money,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times shortly after the film's release. ''There seems to be so much despair in the world. But so many people write about how much the film has helped them in restoring their confidence in God.''         Born on a train speeding from her parent's Tyrol village to a hospital in Vienna in 1905, Maria Augusta Kutschera was an orphan by her seventh birthday. She was raised by a court-appointed guardian, whom she described as a passionate socialist and extremely anti-Catholic.         After she graduated from the State Teachers College for Progressive Education in Vienna at age 18, she became a candidate for the novitiate at a Benedictine convent in Salzberg. Choice of Church or Family         The abbess of the convent sent her to become a governess at the villa outside Salzberg of Baron Georg von Trapp, a highly decorated submarine commander during World War I, who had retired with his seven children after his first wife's death. The young woman quickly won the affection of the children and, when the Baron proposed marriage, she was torn between her devotion to the church and the family.         She married the Baron in November 1927. The couple later had three children.         The family often sang together, particularly during religious observances. In 1935, a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Franz Waner, came to live with the family and began to tutor the children in Renaissance and Baroque music.         In August 1936, the family's informal singing became a professional enterprise when they won a choral competition at the Salzberg Festival. The Trapp Family Choir conducted a full tour of Europe the next year.         When Austria fell under Nazi rule in March 1938, the family realized that its performances could only continue if it cooperated with the Government. They fled with only a few possessions to Italy, then sailed on to New York, arriving penniliess. Concert at Town Hall         Their first major concert, which brought the Trapp Family Choir national attention, took place in New York in Town Hall on Dec. 10, 1938. In a review of their opening performance, The New York Times commented:         ''There was something unusually lovable and appealing about the modest, serious singers of this little family aggregation as they formed a close semicircle about their self-effacing director for their initial offering, the handsome Mme. von Trapp in simple black, and the youthful sisters garbed in black and white Austrain folk costumes enlivened with red ribbons. It was only natural to expect work of exceeding refinement from them, and one was not disappointed in this.''         The von Trapps toured Europe and the United States the next year, gaining an international reputation for the seven daughters and three sons who sang madrigals and old carols, played ancient instruments and re-enacted family customs on stage. For 15 years, their Christmas concerts at Town Hall were a tradition of the New York Yuletide season.         The family bought a 660-acre farm in Stowe in 1942, which later became a lodge and summer music camp.         The Baron died in 1947 at the age of 57. She Lectured Extensively         The family continued to perform around the world until 1955, and the Baroness lectured and wrote extensively on the family's hardships, faith in God and unity. Her book, ''The Story of the Trapp Family Singers,'' was published in 1949. After her husband's death, she also became heavily involved in Catholic missionary work.         The play, ''The Sound of Music,'' with music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, opened on Broadway in the fall of 1959, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel. It was a tremendous success, running for more than three years. The film version set box office records around the world, but the Baroness von Trapp said she received only about $500,000 in royalties.         The Baroness received the Honorary Cross First Class from the Austrian Government for improving cultural ties between her native country and the United States, and numerous awards from the Roman Catholic church.         She is survived by a son, Johannes, of Stowe; two daughters, Eleonore Campbell of Waitsfield, Vt., and Rosmarie Trapp of Pittsburgh; two stepsons, Rupert, of Stowe, and Werner, of Waitsfield; three stepdaughters, Agathe von Trapp of Glyndon, Md., Maria F.

        Carolin Babcock Stark, a women's amateur tennis star in the 1930's, died Wednesday, March 25, at Southampton (L.I.) Hospital, two days after suffering a stroke at her home in the North Haven section of Sag Harbor. She was 74 years old.         Carolin Babcock Stark, a women's amateur tennis star in the 1930's, died Wednesday, March 25, at Southampton (L.I.) Hospital, two days after suffering a stroke at her home in the North Haven section of Sag Harbor. She was 74 years old.         A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M., April 7, at St. Thomas Episcopal Church at Fifth Avenue and 53d Street in Manhattan. Mrs. Stark is survived by her son, Morgan Babcock Stark of Manhattan and North Haven and three grandchildren.         Mrs. Stark won the United States Lawn Tennis Association national doubles championship with Marjorie (Midge) Van Ryan in 1936. In 1932 she was the runner-up in women's singles to Helen Jacobs, who defeated her in the final, 6-2, 6-2, at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills.         Mrs. Stark was born in Billings, Mont., and was graduated from the Marlborough School in Los Angeles in 1934. She was highly ranked nationally in singles and doubles from 1932 to 1936 and played on four Wightman Cup teams from 1933 through 1936.         She also played regularly on the East Coast invitation tournament circuit, winning the singles championship in 1934 and the doubles in 1935 at the Seabright (N.J.) Lawn and Cricket Club. She also won the Wooden Gold Cup, emblematic of the doubles championship, in 1934 at the Maidstone Club in East Hampton, L.I. She was married for 10 years to Richard S. Stark and she resided from the mid-1940's until 1980 in Malibu, Calif., before making her home in North Haven.       
        Joan Greenwood, the husky-voiced British actress who starred in many film comedies and stage plays in the 1940's and 50's, has died at her home in London. She was 65 years old.         Joan Greenwood, the husky-voiced British actress who starred in many film comedies and stage plays in the 1940's and 50's, has died at her home in London. She was 65 years old.         Miss Greenwood's son, Jason Morrell, said his mother was found dead Saturday by friends she had invited to dinner. Mr. Morrell did not give a cause of his mother's death, but a BBC news report said she had apparently suffered a heart attack.         Miss Greenwood appeared on stage only two weeks ago in a sketch with Robert Morley at the Prince of Wales Theater in London. Mr. Morrell said his mother had not been ill recently.         Known primarily as a comic actress, Miss Greenwood starred in a series of British films in the 1940's and 50's that are now considered classics.         One of her frequent co-stars was Sir Alec Guinness, with whom she made ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' ''The Man in the White Suit'' and ''The Detective,'' a movie based on G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown books. In Film Version of 'Ernest'         Miss Greenwood also appeared with Michael Redgrave in the film version of Oscar Wilde's ''Importance of Being Ernest'' and with Basil Rathbone in ''Tight Little Island,'' a screen adaptation of Compton Mackenzie's novel ''Whiskey Galore.''         Miss Greenwood, born in the Chelsea section of London on March 4, 1921, was the daughter of Sydney Earnshaw Greenwood, an artist. She began taking dancing lessons when she was 8 years old, studied at St. Catherine's School in Surrey, and continued to take ballet lessons until she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at 17.         Her first stage appearance came at age 18 when she appeared as Louisa in Moliere's ''Malade Imaginaire'' at the Apollo Theater in London. Performances in ''Little Ladyship'' and ''The Women'' followed.         Leslie Howard saw her in ''The Women'' and made Miss Greenwood his leading lady in the film ''The Gentle Sex.'' From then on Miss Greenwood alternated film and stage work.         She appeared in the role of Wendy in ''Peter Pan'' and as Elie Dunn in Shaw's ''Heartbreak House,'' then undertook more serious roles, playing Ophelia in ''Hamlet'' with the Donald Wolfit company, Nora in Ibsen's ''Doll House,'' Celia in ''Volpone'' and Sabina in ''The Young Wives' Tale.'' Developed a Following         Her film career rocketed with the success of ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' and Miss Greenwood gained a following on both sides of the Atlantic. She appeared on Broadway with Claude Rains in 1953 in T. S. Eliot's ''Confidential Clerk.''         Miss Greenwood's career had recently revived with appearances in several British television series. Her son said yesterday: ''She enjoyed doing all the recent TV work. She kept a trueness to herself. If she didn't want to do something, she wouldn't do it.''         Miss Greenwood was married in 1960 to the actor Andre Morrell, who died in 1978. She is survived by her son.         Correction:  March 19, 1987, Thursday, Late City Final Edition

        Maxine Sullivan, whose cool, precise and rhythmic singing of the Scottish folk song ''Loch Lomond'' in the late 1930's gave her an identity that remained with her throughout her career, died of heart failure Tuesday at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 years old and lived in the         Maxine Sullivan, whose cool, precise and rhythmic singing of the Scottish folk song ''Loch Lomond'' in the late 1930's gave her an identity that remained with her throughout her career, died of heart failure Tuesday at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Miss Sullivan, who had a busy career both in this country and abroad, gave her last performance March 22 at the Westport Arts Center in Westport, Conn. She entered the hospital April 1, where she suffered a seizure and went into a coma.         Miss Sullivan was born Marietta Williams in Homestead, Pa., on May 13, 1911. She shot to fame in 1937 when she recorded ''Loch Lomond'' in an arrangement by Claude Thornhill, the pianist, who led a small accompanying group on the recording. It was an immediate hit, and she followed it with a series of recordings of swinging folk songs, including ''Molly Malone,'' ''It Was a Lover and His Lass'' and ''If I Had a Ribbon Bow.''         Although singing folk songs appeared to be a novelty at that time, Miss Sullivan was doing it in the very earliest stages of her career, when she was singing at an after-hours club in Pittsburgh called the Benjamin Harrison Literary Society.         Two of her future husbands, the bassist John Kirby and the pianist Cliff Jackson both first heard her singing there.         One of her songs was a musical setting of Joyce Kilmer's poem ''Trees.''         ''I couldn't sing it straight,'' she explained. ''I had no choice but to swing it.'' Married in 1938         The success of ''Loch Lomond'' led to an engagement for her at the Onyx Club on 52d Street. There she sang with a small band led by Mr. Kirby that played in a light and airy style, once described as ''orchestrated finesse'' that was an ideal complement to Miss Sullivan's singing and to her manner when she sang, standing motionless, her chin tilted confidently upward and a slightly mischievous smile lighting her face.         She married Mr. Kirby in 1938 and later she and his band became the stars of a weekly NBC radio network series, ''Flow Gently Sweet Rhythm,'' a precedent-setting event for black performers.         In 1938 Miss Sullivan went from the Onyx Club to Hollywood to appear in the film ''Going Places,'' in which she and Louis Armstrong introduced ''Jeepers Creepers.'' The following year she appeared in a second film, ''St. Louis Blues,'' and also performed on Broadway with Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman in a jazz version of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' called ''Swingin' the Dream,'' in which she sang ''Darn That Dream.''         During the 1940's she moved away from her early close association with folk songs, although until her death she could always respect - and respond to - requests for ''Loch Lomond.'' She developed a fresh repertory of standard pop songs such as ''I've Got the World on a String,'' ''Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams'' and ''I Got a Right to Sing the Blues.'' Won Tony Award in 1979         In 1950, after her marriage to Mr. Kirby had ended in divorce, she married Mr. Jackson and temporarily retired from singing to raise her daughter, Paula. During these years she developed an interest in physical therapy and nursing and was active in local civic affairs in the Bronx. After Mr. Jackson's death in 1970, she founded the House That Jazz Built, a community center at 1312 Stebbins Avenue in the Bronx. Dedicated to Mr. Jackson, the center continues to serve young people through the efforts of senior citizens.         In 1979 she received a Tony award for her performance in ''My Old Friends,'' a musical on aging that was described by a reviewer for The New York Times as ''jolly yet touching.''         She is survived by her daughter, Paula Morris, and her son, Orville Williams.         A service will be held at 7 P.M. tomorrow at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street.

        Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Since 1981 the actress had been under the care of her second daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, who by publicizing her mother's tragic illness had drawn national and international attention to Alzheimer's disease, about which little was known until recent years.         According to Princess Yasmin, Miss Hayworth's health had steadily deteriorated over the years and she lapsed into a semicoma in February.         The ''courage and candor'' of Miss Hayworth and her family in bringing attention to Alzheimer's disease was praised by President Reagan in a statement yesterday.         ''Rita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars,'' he said. ''Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on the stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl.         ''Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend whom we will miss.'' The Epitome of Glamour         Rita Hayworth was the epitome of Hollywood glamour and allure, a stunningly beautiful actress and dancer.         During World War II, her pinup pictures decorated barracks walls and ships' bulkheads wherever servicemen went, and over two decades her often tempestuous romantic life thrust her into the headlines.         Fred Astaire, who co-starred with her in two movies, said in his autobiography that she was his favorite dancing partner, and dancing was, indeed, one of her genuine talents.         As a singer, however, she was not similarly gifted, even though she was cast in many musicals. Anita Ellis dubbed Miss Hayworth's songs in four movies, including ''Pal Joey'' and ''The Loves of Carmen,'' and other ''ghosts'' did the singing for her in other films.         But that mattered little to Hayworth fans, who admired her chiefly for the sensuality she exuded, playing temptresses in movies such as ''Blood and Sand'' and ''The Lady From Shanghai.'' The Temptress of 'Gilda'         A particularly memorable temptress role was the title one in ''Gilda,'' in 1946, in which she did a striptease, demure by today's standards, inasmuch as it was limited to removing her arm-length gloves. While the controversial strip scene dazzled tens of thousands of young males, it upset more conservative people across the nation.         So did Miss Hayworth's open affair, in the late 1940's, when such behavior was far less commonplace than it is today, with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the spiritual leader of millions of Ismaili Moslems. They were married in 1949, but she divorced him, as she did four other husbands, including Orson Welles.         As Miss Hayworth grew older, she successfully shifted from her glamour image and took on mature roles in movies such as ''Separate Tables'' in 1958 and ''They Came to Cordura'' in 1959. But by the late 1960's she was appearing in minor movies, most of them made in Europe.         And ultimately, the once-idolized star's health was ravaged by Alzheimer's disease - senile dementia, a devastating mental illness that affects the brain, brings on loss of memory, and ravages bodily functions - which left her ''utterly helpless,'' according to Princess Yasmin.         Miss Hayworth was truly born to show business, in New York City, on Oct. 17, 19l8. Her father, Eduardo Cansino, was a Spanish-born dancer and her mother, the former Volga Haworth, had been a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl. They named their daughter Margarita Carmen Cansino, but she shortened the name to Rita Cansino when she began dancing professionally at the age of 12, and kept that name for her first 10 movies. Spotted by a Fox Producer         Mr. Cansino's career took the family to Los Angeles, where his daughter attended school through the ninth grade. Then she joined her father's act and performed in clubs in Tijuana and Agua Caliente, Mexico, where, when she was 16 years old, she was spotted by a Fox Film Company producer, who signed her to a contract.         Making her film debut in 1935 in ''Under the Pampas Moon,'' Rita Cansino appeared in a succession of lesser roles, such as that of a dance hall girl in a Spencer Tracy movie called ''Dante's Inferno.'' Other films in her Cansino period included ''Charlie Chan in Egypt,'' ''Human Cargo'' and ''Meet Nero Wolfe.''         The Fox company's merger with 20th-Century Pictures left the young dancer without a contract, but in 1937 she met and married the man who was to become her Svengali and dramatically change her career fortunes. He was Edward Judson, a shrewd businessman 22 years her senior, under whose guidance she had her eyebrows and hairline altered by electrolysis and transformed herself from a raven-haired Latin to an auburn-haired cosmopolitan.         As her manager, Mr. Judson also changed his wife's professional name, choosing her mother's maiden name of Haworth and adding a ''y'' to clarify the pronunciation. He hired press agents to get the name and picture of Rita Hayworth into newspapers and fan magazines, and ultimately won her a seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures.         But low-budget B movies continued to be Miss Hayworth's lot, except for the 1939 ''Only Angels Have Wings,'' with Cary Grant, in which the director, Howard Hawks, cast her as an unfaithful wife. It was the secondary female role, but one that got the actress her first good critical notices. A 'Love Goddess' Emerges         Beginning in 1941, Miss Hayworth rapidly developed into one of Hollywood's most glamorous stars, inspiring Winthrop Sargent, a Life magazine writer, to dub her ''The Great American Love Goddess,'' a sobriquet that she welcomed and that caught the public's fancy.         On loan to Warner Brothers, Miss Hayworth appeared opposite James Cagney in ''Strawberry Blonde'' in 1941 and, back at Columbia, she achieved full star status when she was cast as Mr. Astaire's dancing partner in ''You'll Never Get Rich,'' a 1941 hit that got her a Time magazine cover article and instant celebrity. In 1942, she appeared in three hit movies, ''My Gal Sal,'' ''Tales of Manhattan'' and ''You Were Never Lovelier,'' the last again as Mr. Astaire's co-star.         Her performance in ''Cover Girl,'' with Gene Kelly in 1944, earned Miss Hayworth the attention of Life magazine, which printed a photograph of her, posed seductively in black lace, that became famous around the world as an American servicemen's pinup. In what was intended, no doubt, as the ultimate compliment, the picture was even pasted to a test atomic bomb that was dropped on Bikini atoll in 1946.         Miss Hayworth, unlike stars who claimed to deplore their own publicity, reveled in hers. ''Why should I mind?'' she said. ''I like having my picture taken and being a glamorous person. Sometimes when I find myself getting impatient, I just remember the times I cried my eyes out because nobody wanted to take my picture at the Trocadero.''         A great boost to Miss Hayworth's career was ''Gilda,'' which ran into censorship trouble in some areas because of the so-called strip scene. In it, she wore a clinging black satin strapless gown and, while coyly peeling off long black gloves, sang a mildly suggestive song called ''Put the Blame on Mame.'' Actually, the voice was that of Anita Ellis. Marriage to Orson Welles         Miss Hayworth, who had divorced her first husband, married Orson Welles in 1943, and they had a daughter, Rebecca. While Mr. Welles was directing her in one of her best films, ''The Lady From Shanghai'' (1949), she filed for divorce from him. Miss Hayworth had met and fallen in love with Prince Aly Khan and, since neither was divorced at the time, their travels together through Europe provoked some public indignation.         When they were married in 1949, the fact that Miss Hayworth was visibly pregnant was widely reported. She divorced Aly Khan two years later and was subsequently married to and divorced from the singer Dick Haymes and then James Hill, a movie producer.         Miss Hayworth's more than 40 films also included ''Affair in Trinidad'' (1952), ''Salome'' and ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953), ''Fire Down Below'' (1957), ''The Story on Page One'' (1960), ''The Poppy Is Also a Flower'' (1967), and ''The Wrath of God'' (1972).         She attempted a stage career in 1971, but it ended abruptly because she was unable to remember her lines. Six years later, a court in Santa Ana, Calif., named an administrator for her affairs on the recommendation of a physician who said she was disabled by chronic alcoholism.         Despite her heavy drinking, however, it later appeared that the diagnosis of alcoholism might have been erroneous and that Miss Hayworth was actually suffering from the first stages of Alzheimer's disease.         In June 1981, a court in Los Angeles declared the actress legally unable to care for herself and she was put in the care of Princess Yasmin, who took her to New York to live. In 1985 the Princess married a Greek shipping executive, Basil Embiricos, but the marriage was short-lived. They had a son, Andrew. Miss Hayworth's other daughter, Rebecca Welles, lives in Tacoma, Wash.         Princess Yasmin, testifying in 1983 before a Congressional committee concerned with appropriating funds for Alzheimer's disease research, said that the disease had reduced her mother to ''a state of utter helplessness.''         The Princess's appearance was among her many efforts in recent years to draw attention to Alzheimer's disease. She has taken a major role in the growth of the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc., which has headquarters in Chicago and more than 130 chapters and affiliates, backing some 500 family-support groups. She is vice president of that organization and president of Alzheimer's Disease International, which she helped organize in 1985.         A funeral service for Miss Hayworth will be held Monday at 10 A.M. in the Church of the Good Shepherd, Beverly Hills, Calif.       
        Fanny Butcher, the literary editor of The Chicago Tribune for 40 years, has died at the age of 99.         Fanny Butcher, the literary editor of The Chicago Tribune for 40 years, has died at the age of 99.         Miss Butcher, who died Thursday at her apartment here, retired in 1963 after 50 years at The Tribune. She held a variety of posts besides literary editor, including society editor, fashion editor and crime reporter.         But she was best known for her book reviews. In 1971, she published her memoirs, ''Many Lives, One Love,'' which chronicled her love of books.         Among her close friends in the literary world were Bennett Cerf, Thornton Wilder, H. L. Mencken and the English playwright St. John Ervine. Her favorite writer, she said in a 1980 interview, was Ernest Hemingway. ''He was macho before the word was invented,'' she said.         Miss Butcher, born in Fredonia, Kan., moved to Chicago with her family when she was a child and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1910. She married an advertising executive, Richard Bokum, in 1935. He died in 1963. There are no survivors.

Faith Whitney Ziesing, a former trustee of Sarah Lawrence College, died of cancer last Friday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 75 years old.         Mrs. Ziesing was president of the New York Junior League from 1938 to 1940. She was a Sarah Lawrence trustee from 1942 to 1957. In 1944, Mrs. Ziesing was the first alumna appointed to the faculty, teaching about the social aspects of economics.         She was an officer on the boards of the Association of the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute and Princeton Hospital. In 1928, Mrs. Ziesing helped start the Women's National Republican Club.

        Vera Caspary, a novelist, playwright and screenwriter best known for her films ''Laura,'' ''Letter to Three Wives'' and ''Les Girls,'' died of a stroke Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Greenwich Village.         Vera Caspary, a novelist, playwright and screenwriter best known for her films ''Laura,'' ''Letter to Three Wives'' and ''Les Girls,'' died of a stroke Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Greenwich Village.         In her 18 published novels, 10 screen plays and 4 stage plays, Miss Caspary's main theme, whether in a murder mystery, drama or musical comedy, was the working woman and her right to lead her own life, to be independent.         In her autobiography, ''The Secrets of Grown-Ups,'' published in 1979 by McGraw Hill, Miss Caspary wrote, ''This has been the century of the woman, and I know myself to have been a part of the revolution.''         ''In another generation, perhaps the next, equality will be taken for granted,'' she said. ''Those who come after us may find it easier to assert independence, but will miss the grand adventure of having been born in this century of change.''         Miss Caspary, the youngest of three children, was born and raised in Chicago, where her father was a buyer in a department store. After she left school at 18, she wrote advertising copy for a mail-order concern.         ''I gave that up when I realized that one wrote the same thing over and over again whether it was for cold cream or plumbing fixtures,'' she once said.         ''I've always enjoyed making up stories,'' she said. ''I like to get my hands onto all sorts of ideas.'' 'The White Girl'         Her first novel, ''The White Girl,'' published in 1929, was about a black woman who leaves the South for Chicago and poses as a white. Her second and perhaps her favorite novel, ''Thicker Than Water,'' was a study of Portuguese-Jewish family life in Chicago.         Her most famous work was ''Laura,'' her first mystery story, published in 1943 by Houghton Mifflin, followed by ''Bedelia'' and ''Murder at the Stork Club.''         She rewrote ''Laura'' for the now-classic 1944 movie, which starred Gene Tierney as an enigmatic and ambitious career girl and Clifton Webb as Waldo Lydecker, her malicious mentor.         In 1946, with the help of George Sklar, ''Laura'' was adapted to the stage.         Another mystery story, ''The Weeping and the Laughter,'' published in 1950 by Little Brown, became a national best seller.         In 1958, ''Les Girls'' was chosen as best-written American musical by the screen writers branch of the Writers Guild of America.         Miss Caspary was married to I. G. Goldsmith, who produced such films as ''The Stars Look Down.'' He died in 1964.

She was 55 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fishman was born in Palestine. She spent part of her childhood in orphanages and on a kibbutz. She taught school for four years, working closely with the children of new immigrants.         In 1962, Mrs. Fishman wrote ''The Fifth Heaven,'' a novel based on her childhood. It became a best seller in Israel and earned her the Brenner Prize, the highest literary prize in Israel. The book is now included in high school curriculums in Israel.         In 1968, she married Jerry Fishman, a chemist for the Rockefeller Institute, and moved to New York. Two years later, she became an adjunct professor at Hofstra University.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, Yonatan, of Manhattan and Omri Eytan, of Tel Aviv, and a daughter, Tula, also of Tel Aviv.

La Guardia appointed her to it in 1935.         The daughter of a civil libertarian, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, she was the first woman to hold a judicial office above magistrate in the state.         As a judge, she fought strenuously for an improved Family Court and for better care for the children, especially from poor families, who came before it. She also helped establish a mental-health unit in the court. Children's Rights Advocate         After retiring, she continued her battle for children's rights as a leader of several organizations. She was the director of the juvenile justice division of the Children's Defense Fund, the president of the Marion E. Kenworthy-Sarah H. Swift Foundation and a director of the Tappanz Foundation.         Judge Polier's counsel was sought by other cities and states in developing court services for children and families and she provided similar help to other countries.         She wrote numerous articles and books about the legal and psychiatric problems of dealing with children and families.         During World War II, Judge Polier served as counsel to Eleanor Roosevelt in the Office of Civil Defense in Washington. With Mrs. Roosevelt and others, she helped found the nonsectarian Wiltwyck School for disturbed delinquent children in New York City. Fired for 'Agitating' Workers         Judge Polier was born in Portland, Ore., and her desire to correct social ills showed up early in life. While a sophomore at Radcliffe College, she lived at a settlement house in Boston for underprivileged children. She had also attended Bryn Mawr College.         After transferring to and graduating from Barnard College, she got a job with a woolens mill in Passaic, N.J., from which she was fired for what she later described as ''agitating'' workers who had been forbidden by management to organize.         She studied labor relations in Geneva for a year, then decided to become a lawyer on the advice of her father. He persuaded her to study law, she said years later, ''because I had good intentions but no skills.''         In 1928, she graduated from Yale Law School, where she had married Leon A. Tulin, a professor. He died in 1932. Active in Adoption Issues         After Yale, she served on a state committee to study workers' compensation laws and was an assistant corporation counsel of New York City before she was named a judge.         She was for many years the president of Louise Wise Services, an adoption and child-care agency founded by her mother in 1916.         Judge Polier headed an unofficial citizens commission that in 1974 looked into the alleged paddling of students, at the Jordan L. Mott Junior High School in the Bronx, by two deans. The commission called for an ombudsman, among other measures, to protect pupils against corporal punishment.         Judge Polier was a vice president of the American Jewish Congress and a member of the board, and former president, of the Field Foundation.         Her second husband, Shad Polier, died in 1976. She is survived by two sons, Stephen Wise Tulin of Larchmont, N.Y., and Jonathon Wise Polier of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Trudy Festinger of Manhattan; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

Vera Allen, an actress who performed in leading roles on Broadway, in Hollywood and on radio and television, died of heart failure Monday in a retirement home in Croton-on-Hudson, N. Y. Miss Allen, who was active in Actors Equity and was a president of the American Theater Wing, was 89 years old.         After graduating from Barnard College, Miss Allen began her stage career in the early 1920's at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, where she appeared in ''The Dybbuk,'' ''The Critic'' and ''Grand Street Follies.'' In the 1930's, she toured in 10 Shakespearian roles and performed with the Chicago Civic Repertory.         On Broadway, she appeared in ''The Silver Cord,'' ''Susan and God,'' ''The Phiadelphia Story,'' ''At Home Abroad,'' ''The Show Is On,'' ''The Two Mrs. Carrolls'' and ''Ladies of the Corridor.'' On the screen, she played opposite Will Rogers in ''Doctor Bull.''         Miss Allen was married for 60 years to Malcolm Schloss, who died in 1981. She is survived by a son, John Schloss Jr., and two grandchildren.       
        Maria Swoboda, a noted ballet teacher, died last Thursday at Lakewood (N.J.) Hospital, after a stroke in July. Miss Swoboda, who habitually refused to disclose her age, was believed to be 86.         Maria Swoboda, a noted ballet teacher, died last Thursday at Lakewood (N.J.) Hospital, after a stroke in July. Miss Swoboda, who habitually refused to disclose her age, was believed to be 86.         She taught at some of the leading ballet studios in New York, among them the schools of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, American Ballet Theater, the June Taylor School and the Igor Youskevitch studio. Her pupils included Gertrude Tyven, Norma Vance, Meredith Baylis, Perry Brunson, Roni Mahler and Andrea Vodehnal.         Born Maria Yurieva in St. Petersburg, Miss Swoboda studied dance with Lydia Nelidova in Moscow and entered the Bolshoi Ballet at 15. She was the first dancer taken into the Bolshoi company who trained with private teachers. She left Russia in 1917 and toured Europe with a dance company organized by her and her husband, Vecheslav Swoboda, formerly a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet and now dead.         The two came to the United States as lead dancers with the Chicago Civic Opera Ballet and toured the country several times. The Swobodas opened their own studio in New York in 1937. Miss Swoboda kept the school open after her husband died until 1954, when it became the company school of the Ballet Russe. Miss Swoboda was also married to Nicholas Nedbal.         Miss Swoboda lived in Lakewood, N.J. She taught at her own ballet schools in Asbury Park and Spring Lake and had conducted classes as a guest teacher at ballet companies around the country. She was retired at the time of her death. There are no survivors.       
        Raquel Torres, a Mexican-born actress who appeared in such early sound films as ''White Shadows of the South Seas'' (1928) and ''Duck Soup'' (1933), died of a heart attack Monday in Los Angeles.

She appeared in ''Under a Texas Moon,'' ''The Bridge of San Luis Rey,'' ''So This is Africa!'' and ''Red Wagon,'' among other movies. In 1931, Miss Torres brought a vaudeville act to the Loew's State Theater in New York; the following year she appeared briefly on Broadway in John McDermott's ''Adam Had Two Sons.'' In 1934, Miss Torres married Stephen Ames, a New York stockbroker.       
        Pola Negri, a tempestuous green-eyed vamp of the silent screen who tantalized audiences with her on- and off-camera romances, died Saturday at Northeast Baptist Hospital in San Antonio. She was 88 years old and lived in San Antonio.         Pola Negri, a tempestuous green-eyed vamp of the silent screen who tantalized audiences with her on- and off-camera romances, died Saturday at Northeast Baptist Hospital in San Antonio. She was 88 years old and lived in San Antonio.         Miss Negri was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia last week, hospital officials said yesterday. Her physician, Dr. Houston Wade, said she had been diagnosed two years ago as having a brain tumor. She decided not to undergo treatment, he said.         There were believed to be no survivors.  ----  Most Exotic of Stars         The 1920's and 30's were the Age of the Vamp in the movies, and of all the screen vamps, Pola Negri was, unquestionably, the most colorful, the most exotic, the most mysterious.         The Polish-born Miss Negri was a startlingly beautiful woman, with skin as delicately white as fine porcelain, jet black hair and flashing dark-green eyes.         Her off-screen life was more tempestuous than any role she ever played and, although she often insisted that she wished only to be left alone, she could shrewdly maneuver her love affairs and feuds into avalanches of personal publicity.         Men found her fascinating. She married two noblemen and divorced both. She was the mistress and fiancee of Charles Chaplin, whom she jilted in a whirl of headlines. She was living openly with Rudolph Valentino, the romantic idol of millions of women the world over, at the time of his death in 1926. And Adolf Hitler was so taken with her that he personally intervened to countermand an order, issued by the Nazis on the ground that they thought Miss Negri was part-Jewish, forbidding her to work in Germany.         The temperamental star flourished in the long-gone era of the flamboyant screen siren, competing for roles and popularity with such other stars as Gloria Swanson and Theda Bara. Festooned in Diamonds         Whenever she appeared in public, she was festooned in diamonds and pearl brooches from her $1 million collection, acquired cut-rate from Hapsburgs and Hohenzollerns who could no longer afford them. She popularized painted toenails in the mid-20's, and when she took to wearing turbans, or appeared in high boots, thousands of American women slavishly copied her.         She maintained a mansion in Beverly Hills, a villa on the Riviera and a chateau north of Paris, and just before the crash of 1929 her personal fortune was estimated at $5 million. She lost most of her money and possessions, however, and spent her last years living in elegant simplicity in San Antonio.         In ''Memoirs of a Star,'' published in 1970, Miss Negri wrote that she was born in Lipno, Poland, on New Year's Eve, 1899. (Other sources, however, give the date as three to five years earlier.) Her mother was the former Eleanora de Kielczeska, from a family of impoverished nobility; her father was Jerzy Mathias-Chalupec, a Slovak immigrant.         Miss Negri's two sisters died in childhood. Her father was arrested by Czarist troops in 1905 for revolutionary activity in what was then Russian Poland. He was sent to prison and, although he was ultimately released, he did not return to his wife and daughter.         Miss Negri's mother had to go to work as a cook to maintain a one-room apartment in a Warsaw slum and earn enough money to send Pola to the Imperial Ballet School. Pola's first public performance was in the role of a cygnet in ''Swan Lake,'' with the Imperial Ballet. Illness Ended Dance Career         Her dancing career ended when she was 13 years old, however, because she contracted tuberculosis and had to be sent to a sanitarium. Pronounced cured a year later, she returned to Warsaw and was admitted for study at the Imperial Academy of Dramatic Arts after falsely stating she was 17. It was at that time that she adopted her stage name - Pola, the diminutive of her given name, Apolonia, and Negri, after Ada Negri, an Italian poet whom she admired.         She was one of Poland's leading actresses when she was 17, at which time she made her first movie, a two-reeler called ''Slaves of Sin.'' In 1918 she went to Berlin to perform a leading role in Max Reinhardt's pantomime ''Sumurun,'' which was later filmed as her third full-length movie.         Miss Negri's roles in her first two pictures, ''The Eyes of the Mummy Ma'' and ''Carmen,'' typed her as the man-ruining vamp. She took time out from her career in 1919 to be the wife, briefly, of Count Eugene Dambski, a Polish army career officer, then returned to Berlin to make films. ''Madame Du Barry,'' released in the United States under the title ''Passion,'' won her a Paramount Pictures contract and she was brought here in 1922.         During the Atlantic crossing, Miss Negri's agent scolded her for spending most of her time in her cabin. ''Make a few appearances,'' he said. ''Think of the publicity.''         ''I am thinking of it,'' she replied. ''We will get more publicity this way. I have already learned that the fewer appearances you make, the more they will talk about you. All you have to do is to say you want to be alone - and the whole world thinks you are exotic and glamorous. It never occurs to them that you are simply tired.'' Feud With Swanson         In Hollywood, while carefully limiting her public appearances, Miss Negri, with equal assiduity, cultivated several headlined feuds, most notably with Gloria Swanson, her rival at Paramount. (The leading ladies once had a cat fight using real cats.) Miss Negri's Hollywood films were not artistic landmarks, but most were extremely successful at the box office. Among them were ''Belle Donna'' (1923), her first American movie; ''The Cheat'' (1923); ''Men'' (1924); ''The Spanish Dancer'' (1923); ''Shadows of Paris'' (1924); ''East of Suez'' (1925) and ''Forbidden Paradise'' (1924). At the height of her popularity, she was so much in demand that she ground out five pictures in a single year.         However, she always seemed able to find time for romance. Her first big headlined Hollywood affair was with Charlie Chaplin, who in 1964 wrote in his autobiography that the relationship was essentially one of the pursued (Chaplin) and the pursuer (Negri). In her own memoirs Miss Negri observed tartly:         ''A great deal has been written about my relationship with Charlie Chaplin. Unfortunately, much of it has been written by Mr. Chaplin. Still less fortunately, what he wrote was largely untrue. Rather than say he behaved in less than a gentlemanly fashion, I would prefer to excuse him on the grounds that all clowns live in a world of fantasy.''         Miss Negri went on to say that her relationship with Mr. Chaplin had been intimate and stormy, that he was an inept lover, that he proposed marriage and that finally she ended the affair, over Mr. Chaplin's tearful entreaties. Her Greatest Love         According to Miss Negri, the greatest love of her life was Rudolph Valentino. On their second meeting, she wrote in her memoirs, she found him so passionately overpowering that on that very night they became lovers and remained so for nearly a year, until his death in 1926.         Valentino, called by his adoring public ''The Great Lover,'' was indeed the great lover, she wrote, capable of making such romantic gestures as sprinkling rose petals on the bed before they retired. He could also be quite prosaic. For example, he often wept because he was losing his hair, and sometimes the sex symbol of American women preferred making spaghetti for Miss Negri to making love to her.         After collapsing at Valentino's funeral in New York, Miss Negri took his body back to California by train, stopping at dozens of stations along the way so that hysterical Valentino-worshipers could pay him tribute. She was accused of using the cortege to garner personal publicity, and, true or not, soon afterward her popularity at the box office waned. When her contract came up for renewal, she found she was no longer wanted at Paramount.         Her standing with the Valentino cult was forever shattered when, in 1927, less than a year after Valentino's death, Miss Negri was married to Serge Mdivani, an impecunious Georgian prince, and took him to live in her chateau in France. They were divorced in 1931, after Miss Negri had lost the bulk of her fortune through, she later wrote, her husband's mismanagement of her affairs during the stock-market crisis. Went to Berlin in 1935         After the indifferent reception to her first talkie, ''A Woman Commands,'' Miss Negri in 1935 fled Hollywood for Berlin, where she made pictures until the outbreak of World War II. For a time she was prohibited from working by Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, who put her name on a list of suspected ''non-Aryans.''         Hitler, who was said to be so fond of her German-made movie about mother love, ''Mazurka,'' that he had it run weekly so he could have a good cry, personally overruled Goebbels. Shortly after, newspapers in Europe and the United States printed reports of a romance between Hitler and Miss Negri. She sued the French magazine that initiated the reports and won a 10,000-franc judgment.         Miss Negri, who was living on the Riviera when Germany invaded France, returned to the United States in 1941. Two years later she played a featured comedy role in ''Hi Diddle Diddle,'' but no other film offers were forthcoming.         By the end of the war, she was reduced to living in one room in a small hotel in New York and selling off her jewelry to survive. Ultimately, she recovered some money and property tied up in Europe during the war.         From 1948 to 1963, Miss Negri lived in California and Texas with Margaret L. West, who bequeathed her property in San Antonio. In recent years Miss Negri lived in a duplex apartment in San Antonio, attended by a maid, a chauffeur and a secretary.         Miss Negri made her last attempted comeback in ''The Moonspinners,'' a Walt Disney film released in 1964. As production on the movie began in London in 1963, she proved she had not lost her knack for finding a bizarre gimmick sure to give her headlines. For her first press conference, she entered the room with a frisky cheetah on a leash.       
        Dorothy Blanchard Hammerstein, a former New York interior designer and the widow of the lyricist and librettist Oscar Hammerstein 2d, died in her sleep yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         Dorothy Blanchard Hammerstein, a former New York interior designer and the widow of the lyricist and librettist Oscar Hammerstein 2d, died in her sleep yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         A woman of commanding presence, Mrs. Hammerstein was considered a great beauty throughout her life. Of medium height, with bright blue eyes and, in her later years, snowy white hair, she was known for her flawless carriage and ready wit.         In the early 1930's, Mrs. Hammerstein founded an interior design business, Dorothy Hammerstein Inc., and quickly established herself as one of the most sought-after decorators on both coasts. She retired in the mid-1950's.         In 1949, with her husband and the novelist Pearl Buck, she was a founder of Welcome House (now Welcome House Adoption Sevices) in Doylestown, Pa., an organization that arranges for the adoption of children of American and Asian parents.         She was also actively involved with the Dance Theater of Harlem Inc., both as a board member and as a member of its national advisory board, from its inception in 1969 until her death. Born in Australia         Born in Tasmania, Australia, Mrs. Hammerstein was one of five daughters of Henry James Blanchard, a master mariner, and his wife, the former Marion Parmentier. At the age of 23, Dorothy Blanchard left Melbourne for London, seeking a movie career. Meeting with little success, she decided to return to Australia by way of New York.         In Manhattan, she joined the cast of ''Charlot's Revue,'' an English musical starring Beatrice Lillie. When the show closed in New York, she toured the United States and Canada for a year as Miss Lillie's understudy.         In 1925 she married Henry Jacobson, a New York businessman, with whom she had two children. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1929 she married Mr. Hammerstein. The marriage lasted until his death in 1960.         Mrs. Hammerstein is survived by a sister, Eleanor Biow of Santa Barbara, Calif.; two sons, Henry Jacobson of Santa Barbara and James Blanchard Hammerstein of Manhattan and London; a daughter, Susan Blanchard of Manhattan; two stepchildren, William Hammerstein of Kent, Conn., and Alice Mathias of Harrison, N.Y.; 10 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.

        Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Astor entered silent films in 1920 as a willowy 14-year-old and portrayed scores of vulnerable ingenues. Two decades later she gave her most indelible performance opposite Humphrey Bogart in ''The Maltese Falcon,'' John Huston's crime classic. Her subtle, mature portrayal of a seemingly sympathetic woman who was, in fact, evilly duplicitous, took audiences by surprise. Such women were rarely the heroines of movies then, nor had they been portrayed as deceptively as Miss Astor portrayed the homicidal Brigid O'Shaughnessy.         In the same year, 1941, she was a ruthless, egocentric concert pianist battling Bette Davis in ''The Great Lie,'' for which Miss Astor won an Oscar as the best actress in a supporting role. ''If I'd had my druthers,'' she later wrote, ''I would have preferred getting my Oscar for 'The Maltese Falcon.' '' Sophisticates and Villains         Other skillful characterizations included a warmly urbane widow in ''Dodsworth'' (1936), a spurned mistress in the 1937 version of the swashbuckling ''Prizoner of Zenda,'' a disillusioned wife in ''The Hurricane'' (1937) and a sympathetic prostitute in ''Act of Violence'' (1949).         But few of her films matched the turmoil of her private life. In 1936, she was the center of one of Hollywood's most spectacular scandals when she sued Dr. Franklyn Thorpe for legal custody of their 4-year-old daughter, Marylyn. Dr. Thorpe had divorced Miss Astor a year earlier.         The suit led to disclosure of her diary, which allegedly contained accounts of liaisons with many celebrities. Dr. Thorpe sought to use the diary to prove she was an unfit mother, and purported excerpts were published in newspapers under suggestive headlines.         Miss Astor repeatedly maintained that the excerpts were lurid forgeries. She later acknowledged that an authentic portion published by one newspaper included ''a rather overemotional account of a romantic interlude with George S. Kaufman,'' the playwright.         The trial judge ordered the diary sealed and impounded. It was inadmissible as evidence, she wrote later, because her former husband had removed pages involving himself. Miss Astor was granted custody of her daughter for nine months a year, with Dr. Thorpe allowed custody the three other months. The diary was never made public, and a judge witnessed its burning in 1952. Won Beauty Contest at 11         During the 30-day trial, Hollywood producers, fearing the scandal would damage the film industry, pressed Miss Astor to drop the suit, but she refused, risking her reputation and career to keep her daughter. Soon after the trial, throngs of people hailed her courage when she toured with screenings of ''Dodsworth.''         Mary Astor was born Lucile Langhanke on May 3, 1906, in Quincy, Ill., the only child of the former Helen Vasconcells, an American, and Otto Ludwig Wilhelm Langhanke, a German immigrant who made an uncertain income from such diverse activities as teaching German and poultry farming until he began to cash in on his daughter's film success.         The girl won her first movie contract with Famous Players-Lasky and, with it, the name Mary Astor. Within two years she was making features and her salary started soaring. In 1923, the family went to Hollywood and she became John Barrymore's leading lady in ''Beau Brummel.''         She was teamed with Barrymore again in ''Don Juan'' (1926), which introduced a Vitaphone background-music soundtrack, the harbinger of talkies. Her early sound films included ''Holiday'' (1930), playing the materialistic sister of Ann Harding, and ''Red Dust'' (1932), in which she portrayed a frustrated wife attracted to Clark Gable. Sued for Nonsupport by Parents         Later movies included ''Midnight'' (1939), ''Brigham Young - Frontiersman'' (1940), ''Across the Pacific'' (1942), ''The Palm Beach Story'' (1942), ''Claudia and David'' (1946) and ''Return to Peyton Place'' (1961).         Miss Astor's professional successes were punctuated by personal tragedies. In 1930, her first husband, Kenneth Hawks, was killed in a plane crash while directing a movie.         Her parents lived lavishly, taking nearly all her salary, but in 1934 she put them on an allowance. Unable to continue embellishing the mansion and estate she had given them, they sued her for nonsupport. She said that ''from 1920 to 1930, I gave my father $461,000'' while she kept only $24,000. She agreed to pay them $100 a month, and the suit was dismissed.         After the diary scandal, Miss Astor was married to Manuel del Campo, a Mexican sportsman, by whom she had a son, Anthony, and later to Thomas G. Wheelock, a businessman. Both marriages ended in divorce. A Drinking Problem         Her tangled personal life and the financial pressures to keep working worsened a longtime drinking problem. She sought help from a priest-psychologist, the Rev. Peter Ciklic, and to further her therapy, he had her write notes about her life. At his urging, she revised the notes into a 1959 autobiography, ''My Story.'' It was praised by reviewers for its style and uncompromising insights.         Personally regenerated, she began writing novels and completed a successful memoir on movie making, ''A Life on Film,'' in 1971. Her first novel, ''The Incredible Charlie Carewe,'' about a charming rotter, was described by a reviewer in The New York Times as ''lively entertainment.''         In ''A Life on Film,'' Miss Astor deplored a ''poverty of spirit'' in many contemporary movies, writing that ''whatever we did - we old moviemakers - we gave people a lot of fun. Through depressions and wars and calamities, we gave them the sense of glory, of a future that would be braver than today.''         Miss Astor retired to the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills in 1974 and contributed to it from her writing income.         Besides her daughter and son, the actress is survived by an undisclosed number of grandchildren. A funeral service will be private.       
        Antoinette Faissex du Bost Castelli, the president of Castelli Graphics Gallery in Manhattan, died of a hemorrhage yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was being treated for cancer. She was 58 years old.         Antoinette Faissex du Bost Castelli, the president of Castelli Graphics Gallery in Manhattan, died of a hemorrhage yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was being treated for cancer. She was 58 years old.         As president of Castelli Graphics, on East 77th Street, Mrs. Castelli showed such major artists as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and James Rosenquist, who were also affiliated with the galleries of Leo Castelli, her husband. But she ran her gallery independently and also exhibited such artists as Robert Cumming, Bernard Faucon and Pat Steir.         Mrs. Castelli was born near Limoges, France, and spent most of her early life in Paris. She married Mr. Castelli in 1963.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Jean-Christophe; her mother, Edmee Haviland, and two sisters.       
        Lady Delamere, a leading figure in colonial Kenyan society for decades and the woman at the center of a celebrated unsolved killing in 1941, died on Thursday in London, relatives said today.         Lady Delamere, a leading figure in colonial Kenyan society for decades and the woman at the center of a celebrated unsolved killing in 1941, died on Thursday in London, relatives said today.         She was 74 years old and had had a heart ailment for some years.         Lady Delamere, who amassed a fortune in land through four marriages, was widely believed to be the last person to know the full story of the unsolved murder of Earl of Erroll, a hereditary Lord High Constable of Scotland.         He was shot through the ear at point-blank range shortly after driving away from the home of Lady Delamere and her husband, Sir Henry Broughton, late on a January night in the Nairobi suburb of Karen. Lady Delamere and the Earl were said to have been lovers. A Sensational Trial         Sir Henry was acquitted of the murder after a sensational trial that made headlines around the world and brought to public attention the lavish ways of white Kenyans during World War II. Sir Henry died later in Britain, a suicide.         Lady Delamere was born Diana Caldwell in Hove, Sussex, in 1913. Her first marriage was to Vernon Motion. In 1940, she and Sir Henry married in Durban, South Africa, then moved to Kenya.         Her third husband, from 1943 to 1955, was Gilbert Colvile, a wealthy and reclusive rancher who owned vast tracts in Kenya's Rift Valley.         She became Lady Delamere when she married the fourth Earl Delamere in 1955.         Her family still owns a large estate at Elmenteita in the Rift Valley, but Lady Delamere's visits there had grown less frequent because of her heart condition, the relatives said.       
        Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         She was widely known as the sharp-tongued wife of one of the nation's most influential publishers, Henry R. Luce, whose magazines included Time, Life and Sports Illustrated.         But she won fame on her own as magazine writer and editor, author of ''The Women'' and other hit plays, controversial Republican member of the House of Representatives from Connecticut, and, finally, in the Eisenhower Administration, a hardworking and often praised Ambassador to Italy.         She had enough careers to satisfy the ambitions of several women, but none tied her down for long. She was often on lists of the world's 10 most admired women, but her glamorous existence and tart tongue drew criticism, sometimes partisan, sometimes envious.         Clare Boothe was born in New York City on April 10, 1903, the daughter of William Franklin Boothe, a pit orchestra violinist and sometime businessman, and the former Anna Clara Snyder, who had been a chorus girl. The child was christened Ann Clare, but she never used the Ann. When Parents Separated         Her parents separated when Clare was 8 years old. She was brought up in genteel poverty by her mother, who still managed to take her to France for a year and send her to the Cathedral School of St. Mary in Garden City, L.I., and the Castle School at Tarrytown-on-Hudson, N.Y. In 1919, her mother married Dr. Albert Elmer Austin, a prominent physician in Greenwich, Conn. On a trip to Europe in 1920, the 18-year-old Clare met Elsa Maxwell among other social figures. ''I'll have her to one of my parties,'' Miss Maxwell said. ''Whatever happens then, she'll get a rich husband.''         That happened, but not because of a Maxwell party. Clare Boothe met her future husband in church: George Tuttle Brokaw, millionaire-playboy son of a clothing manufacturer.         They married in 1923 in a wedding called ''the most important social event of the season.'' It was not to last. Mr. Brokaw, 23 years older than his bride, was a heavy drinker, according to one of his biographers, and was prone to abuse his wife. After six years of marriage she won a divorce on grounds of mental cruelty and was awarded $425,000 plus education expenses for her daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw. The Job at Vanity Fair         Declining to rest on her money, Clare Boothe importuned a society friend, Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue and Vanity Fair, for a job. After proving she was not another idle society matron whiling away her time between husbands, she did a stint writing photo captions for Vogue.         Vanity Fair's editor, Frank Crowninshield, hired her after demanding that she draw up a list of 100 ideas. She rose quickly to assistant editor and wrote satirical pieces about society that were later collected in a book, ''Stuffed Shirts.''         Her penthouse apartment on East 57th Street, Manhattan, drew the social, artistic and political types who peopled Vanity Fair's pages. She became managing editor, injecting more political material in an effort to revive the magazine. She left in 1934.         She had written three plays, none produced. She once said reading the plays of George Bernard Shaw was the impetus for her interest in the theater. Much later she met Shaw and is said to have gushed, ''Except for you, I wouldn't be here.'' Shaw supposedly replied, ''And now, let me see, dear child, what was your mother's name?''         Her first produced play, ''Abide with Me,'' in 1935, was unanimously deemed a disaster. It concerned a drunken, sadistic husband who is shot in the last act. Several critics commented on how quickly she responded to almost indiscernible cries of ''Author.'' She never went to another opening night. Sparks at First Sight of Luce         Two days after the opening, the author became the wife of Henry R. Luce, publisher of Time and Fortune. The two independent personalities had struck sparks on their first meeting, when they were seated together at a dinner party and Mr. Luce ignored her.         The next time they met, at a party at the Waldorf-Astoria, his future wife resolved to pay Mr. Luce back by asking rude questions. This time he was enthralled by her. He ordered her to accompany him to the Waldorf's lobby, where he said, ''You are the great love of my life, and some day I'm going to marry you.''         The marriage lasted, although there were rumored difficulties - perhaps inevitable in a marriage between two such strongminded personalities. She had her separate careers and Mr. Luce had his magazines - Life, the picture magazine, was reportedly her idea. The Successful Plays         Mrs. Luce returned to writing plays and with ''The Women,'' in 1936, recovered admirably from her maiden flop on Broadway. The play was an apotheosis of feminine bitchiness, concerning a devoted wife, the only sympathetic character, trying to win back her husband, who had been poached by a saleswoman. It earned her $2 million.         In 1938, Mrs. Luce was represented by ''Kiss the Boys Goodbye,'' a satire on the hoopla surrounding the search for the feminine lead in the movie of ''Gone With the Wind.'' It was a box-office success, as was her next play, ''Margin for Error,'' which purveyed a modish anti-Nazism.         With World War II, Mrs. Luce sought to involve herself on a larger stage. In February 1940, she sailed for Europe as an accredited correspondent for Life for a firsthand look at the war. One result was a book, ''Europe in the Spring.'' Dorothy Parker called it ''All Clare on the Western Front.''         In 1943 Mrs. Luce decided to run for the House of Representatives from Fairfield County, Conn. Criticism of Roosevelt         Despite her friendships with early New Dealers, she was by now a Republican and made speeches critical of the Roosevelt Administration's handling of the war effort. Riding an off-year tide of anti-Administration sentiment, she defeated a Democratic incumbent by 7,000 votes.         In her first speech in the House, she attacked a proposal by Vice President Henry A. Wallace calling for postwar freedom of the air. Mrs. Luce wrapped up the Wallace proposal in a single word, ''globaloney.'' In Congress she frequently spoke out on foreign policy as well as for racial equality in the armed forces and war production.         Despite her own brief infatuation with Communism in the 1930's, Mrs. Luce emerged as an early hardline anti-Communist (although as early as 1964 she was calling for more normal relations with China).         She won re-election in 1944, campaigning with fire but concealing sorrow. Her 19-year-old daughter was killed in an automobile accident that year. A Jesuit priest put her in touch with the Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, who was becoming known for his broadcasts. Before Sheen had talked three minutes, she demanded, ''Listen, if God is good, why did He take my daughter?''         ''In order that you might be here in the faith,'' Sheen replied. Became a Catholic         Their sessions, with Mrs. Luce arguing and Sheen explaining, resulted in her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1946. After that a friend noticed a gradual change in her: ''Twenty years ago she was like a diamond - beautiful, brilliant and cold. Now she is beautiful, brilliant and compassionate. She has become a kind and remarkably unselfish woman.''         Because of personal problems and long separations from her husband that her duties entailed, Mrs. Luce did not seek re-election in 1946. She remained politically active, in addition to writing a column for McCall's, and in 1952 she campaigned for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.         He offered her the post of Secretary of Labor, but she demurred. He then named her Ambassador to Italy, stirring controversy because of Mrs. Luce's Catholicism, her lack of diplomatic experience and because she was a woman.         But she waded into her job with customary energy and contempt for obstacles. She helped lay the diplomatic groundwork for an international conference that worked out a compromise on the status of Trieste, a dispute that threatened war between Yugoslavia and Italy. Effective Diplomacy         She made strongly anti-Communist speeches and warned of cutoffs of American aid to Italian industry: Communists dominated the labor unions. She drew fire from leftists.  Once her chauffeur misunderstood her directions and took her to the residence of President Giovanni Gronchi. Unable to back out, Mrs. Luce, whose relations with the President had been somewhat strained, took the occasion to persuade him to permit the stationing of American troops on Italian soil.         In Italy she caught a mysterious illness finally diagnosed as arsenic poisoning. The Central Intelligence Agency was called in. The cause was paint dust from her bedroom ceiling. A Controversy Over Brazil         In 1959 she was nominated Ambassador to Brazil. A determined one-man opposition to her appointment was mounted in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. Mrs. Luce was confirmed both by the committee and the Senate, but she could not resist a final jab at Morse.         ''My difficulties, of course, go back some years,'' she said, ''when Senator Morse was kicked in the head by a horse.'' (He was once kicked by a horse, but not in the head.) In the resultant furor, Eisenhower defended her while Mr. Luce publicly urged her to resign, which she did.         In 1964 she announced that she was running for the Senate in New York State as a Conservative Party candidate and supporter of Senator Barry Goldwater, whose nomination for President she had seconded at the Republican convention. Under pressure from the party's liberal wing and finally Senator Goldwater himself, she withdrew from the race on the eve of the Conservative convention. Moved to Honolulu         In later years she devoted herself to social life in Phoenix, where the Luces had a house - skindiving, doing mosaics and needlepoint, painting and writing. After Mr. Luce died in 1967, she moved to Honolulu, where she lived until 1983, when she moved into an apartment at the Watergate complex in Washington.''It's a city of human proportions,'' she said.         In recent years Mrs. Luce served on President Reagan's unpaid Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.         Of her writing she once said, ''I have been too involved with living to write much - or well - about life.'' A biographer, Alden Hatch, summed her up this way:         ''Brilliant, yet often foolish; idealistic, yet realistic to the verge of cynicism; tough as a Marine sergeant, but almost quixotically kind to unfortunates; with the mind and courage of a man and exceedingly feminine instincts; the complexities of her character are as numerous as the facets of her career. Probably the reason no one understands her completely is because she does not even understand herself.''         Mrs. Luce is survived by two stepsons, Henry Luce 3d and Peter Paul Luce. Interment will be private, A High Mass will be offered at noon Tuesday in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a memorial service Wednesday at 11 A. M. at the Church of St. Stephen Martyr in Washington.       
        Ione Gaul Walker, a painter, arts patron and former art dealer, died of cancer of the throat on Monday at her home in Provincetown, Mass. She was 72 years old.         Ione Gaul Walker, a painter, arts patron and former art dealer, died of cancer of the throat on Monday at her home in Provincetown, Mass. She was 72 years old.         Born in Pittsburgh, Mrs. Walker was an art student at the Carnegie Institute of Technology from 1933 to 1934, then moved to New York, where she studied dance with Ruth St. Denis. In 1936 she married Hudson D. Walker, an art historian, and from 1936 to 1940 the two operated the Hudson D. Walker Gallery on 57th Street, where they showed the work of such artists as Marsden Hartley, Mervyn Jules, Joseph Hirsch and Harry Sternberg.         Mrs. Walker exhibited her own paintings at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York and the Provincetown Art Museum. In 1967, she and her husband helped to found the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, which provides fellowships for emerging artists and writers. She was also a founder of the Provincetown Symphony Society and was its president from 1954 to 1958.         Mrs. Walker's husband died in 1976. She is survived by three daughters, Harriet Heron of Medford Lakes, N.J., Berta B. Walker of New York, and Louise W. Walker of Central Middlesex, Mass., and four grandchildren.         A memorial service will be held tomorrow at 3 P.M. at St. Mary's of the Harbor Church in Provincetown.       
        Lucy Monroe, who sang ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' at every New York Yankees opening day and every Yankees World Series between 1945 and 1960, died of cancer Tuesday at her Manhattan home. She was 80 years old.         Lucy Monroe, who sang ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' at every New York Yankees opening day and every Yankees World Series between 1945 and 1960, died of cancer Tuesday at her Manhattan home. She was 80 years old.         Miss Monroe, the official soloist for the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, spent much of her career singing the national anthem. She once estimated that she had sung it more than 5,000 times. In 1940 she starred in ''The American Jubilee'' at the New York World's Fair, closing each of 650 performances with the anthem. She sang for Presidents Roosevelt, Johnson and Kennedy, at President Truman's inauguration and at hundreds of other civic and patriotic gatherings.         In 1942, she conducted a community sing, sponsored by the Treasury Department, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. More than 40,000 people attended. During the next four years the Treasury and RCA Victor co-sponsored similar events nationwide to sell war bonds. Anthem Sometimes Barred         On some occasions, however, Miss Monroe refused to sing the song with which she had become so closely identified. When she performed for American troops, she did not sing the national anthem because, she said, ''the men are living it.''         Miss Monroe, who was born on Oct. 23, 1906, in New York, was the daughter of Anna Laughlin and Dwight Monroe, a diamond importer. She was a graduate of the Horace Mann School.         During the 1930's she was featured on three commercial radio programs a week and was a co-star for four years with Frank Munn on NBC's ''American Album of Familiar Music.'' She also appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia orchestras and with the Chicago, St. Louis and Metropolitan Opera companies.         Miss Monroe married Harold M. Weinberg, a New York lawyer, in 1961, and was widowed in 1977. She leaves no survivors.         A memorial service will be held at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday at St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets.       
        Jacqueline du Pre, a brilliant and charismatic English cellist whose career was cut short by multiple sclerosis, died last night in London, her concert managers said. She was 42 years old.         Jacqueline du Pre, a brilliant and charismatic English cellist whose career was cut short by multiple sclerosis, died last night in London, her concert managers said. She was 42 years old.         Miss du Pre, who was stricken with the disease in 1971, had a career that lasted barely a decade. But during her prime she was recognized as one of the world's leading cellists, and served as a role model for many young musicians. During the late 1960's and early 1970's, Miss du Pre and her husband, the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, seemed a charmed couple. Often compared with Robert and Clara Schumann, they were admired for their energy, musicality and youthful glamour.         Miss du Pre's playing was characterized by an unusual mixture of elegance and ferocity. ''Miss du Pre is a cellist in the modern vein,'' Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times after a 1967 concert. ''There is plenty of strength to her playing, and a good measure of romanticism without the romantic string mannerisms of portamento (sliding from note to note) and a fast wide vibrato. She can produce a mellow sound of unusual size and clearly was born to play the cello.''         Miss du Pre excelled in a wide variety of music, specializing in the sonatas of Johannes Brahms and the concertos of Haydn, Boccherini, Schumann, Dvorak and Saint-Saens. She had a particular affinity for English music, and made memorable recordings of the Delius and Elgar concertos. The Elgar was associated more closely with her than with any other cellist since Beatrice Harrison, who died in 1965.         Raymond Ericson, reviewing a 1965 performance of the Elgar work for The Times, observed that ''Miss du Pre and the concerto seemed made for each other, because her playing was so completely imbued with the romantic spirit. Her tone was sizable and beautifully burnished. Her technique was virtually flawless, whether she was playing the sweeping chords that open the concerto, sustaining a ravishing pianissimo tone, or keeping the fast repeated note figures in the scherzo going at an even pace.'' 'Couldn't Feel the Strings'         The first signs of Miss du Pre's illness appeared when she was 26 years old and at the height of her fame. ''My hands no longer worked,'' she recalled in 1978. ''I simply couldn't feel the strings.'' She withdrew from concertizing for one year, then returned, to mixed reviews. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis followed shortly, and Miss du Pre retired.         By the mid-70's, Miss du Pre was virtually paralyzed. She could no longer dress herself, nor stand unaided, nor travel without a great deal of planning. She put all of her energies into two major activities - teaching, whenever possible, and working for the cause of multiple sclerosis research.         ''I had to learn to reconstruct my life,'' she said in 1978. ''But I have found a great deal to do. I go to concerts and see my friends. And the music is still alive in my head.''         Jacqueline du Pre was born in Oxford, England, on Jan. 26, 1945. Her talent was obvious from an early age, and she began cello lessons when she was 5 years old. Her early teachers included Herbert Walenn and William Pleeth; she later studied with Paul Tortelier, Mstislav Rostropovich and Pablo Casals. At the age of 11 she won her first competition, and she eventually took every possible prize for cellists at the Guildhall School of Music.         Her career began in earnest in 1961, when she played a concert at Wigmore Hall in London, using a 1672 Stradivarius that had been presented to her anonymously. ''She was immediately acclaimed for her instinctive feeling for style and breadth of understanding as well as technical proficiency,'' Noel Goodwin wrote in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. When Mr. Rostropovich first heard her play, he remarked that he had found somebody to carry on his work. Married in June 1967         Miss du Pre met Daniel Barenboim at a party in London in 1966. ''Instead of saying good evening,'' she later recalled, ''we sat down and played Brahms.'' They were married in June 1967. Together, they helped begin the South Bank Summer Musical Festival in London the following year.         Mr. Barenboim was once asked what it was like to accompany his wife. ''Difficult,'' he replied. ''It doesn't dawn on her sometimes that we mortals have difficulties in following her.'' In the next few years, they performed throughout the world, both separately and as a duo.         After her incapacitation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, in tandem with an organization called the Jacqueline du Pre Research Fund, presented several benefit concerts at Carnegie Hall. Among the participants were the violinist Pinchas Zukerman, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the pianist Eugene Istomin and several others. Reviewing a 1980 concert, John Rockwell wrote in The New York Times: ''The consistently high quality of these particular benefits can be traced to the close professional and social circle in which Miss du Pre and her husband move. They know the best, and the best play at their benefits.''         In 1981, Miss du Pre's story became the subject of a Broadway play, ''Duet for One,'' by Tom Kempinski, which starred Anne Bancroft and Max von Sydow.         Throughout her illness, Miss du Pre remained sanguine about the future. ''Nobody knows if I'll ever regain mobility,'' she said in 1978. ''It could be that next week I'll find myself walking down the road. I believe in realistic optimism but not wishful thinking.''         She is survived by her husband.       
        Edith Luckett Davis, Nancy Reagan's mother, died of a stroke today at her home in Phoenix, Ariz. She was 91 years old.         Edith Luckett Davis, Nancy Reagan's mother, died of a stroke today at her home in Phoenix, Ariz. She was 91 years old.         President and Mrs. Reagan will travel to Phoenix Tuesday morning, and the President will return to Washington Tuesday night, leaving Mrs. Reagan behind. Mr. Reagan will return to Arizona for the funeral, when arrangements are completed, the White House said.         Mrs. Davis, who went by the name ''Lucky,'' had been in poor health for the last several years. The White House said she died at 12:15 P.M., mountain standard time. Mrs. Reagan was at the White House when told of her mother's death. Career as an Actress         Mrs. Davis began work as an actress at the age of 15 and appeared in several films, including ''The Other Girl'' in 1915. She also acted on stage, in New York and with several regional stock companies. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1928 when she played with Walter Huston and Kay Francis in ''Elmer the Great.''         Her first marriage, to Kenneth Robbins of Pittsfield, Mass., ended in divorce. In 1929 she met and married Dr. Loyal Davis, a Chicago neurosurgeon.         Mrs. Davis performed volunteer work in various areas of health care for more than 50 years. She served on several boards and foundations. She also served as honorary chairman of the women's division of United Cerebral Palsy.         After Dr. Davis retired as head of the surgery department at Northwestern University in 1963, she moved with him to Phoenix. Dr. Davis died in 1982.         In 1983 Mrs. Davis was awarded the Arizona Lifetime Achievement Award by the Association for Retarded Citizens.         She is survived by one daugther, Mrs. Reagan; one son, Richard Davis of Philadelphia, and seven grandchildren.       
        Marie Kryl, a concert pianist who appeared with the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis Symphony Orchestras, died Sunday in Orlando, Fla. She was 90 years old.         Marie Kryl, a concert pianist who appeared with the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis Symphony Orchestras, died Sunday in Orlando, Fla. She was 90 years old.         Miss Kryl was born in Philadelphia on July 4, 1897, but lived most of her early life in Chicago, where she studied with the well-known pianist and teacher Rudolph Ganz.         Her father, Bohumir Kryl, a bank president, art collector, composer and bandmaster, so wanted his daughters, Marie and Josephine, to become musicians that, in 1921, he promised them each $100,000 if they would not marry before reaching age 30. They both agreed.         But neither daughter lived up to her vow. Josephine, a violinist of note, married the composer Paul Taylor White before turning 30. Marie forfeited her fortune when, in 1926, she became engaged to a Greek Count, Spiro Hadji-Kyriacos. A year later, however, the engagement was broken, and in 1932, she married Michel Gusikoff, a composer and a former assistant conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony.       
        Maria Ivogun, the leading coloratura soprano of German opera in the period between the World Wars, died yesterday. She was 95 years old and lived in Beatenberg, Switzerland.         Maria Ivogun, the leading coloratura soprano of German opera in the period between the World Wars, died yesterday. She was 95 years old and lived in Beatenberg, Switzerland.         The soprano was born Maria Kempner in Budapest on Nov. 18, 1891. Her stage name was a construction based on the name of her mother, Ida von Gunther, a well-known operetta singer.         Ivogun made her debut as Mimi in ''La Boheme'' in 1913, under the direction of Bruno Walter in Munich. She quickly became one of the most popular singers on the German scene, a position she maintained for two decades. Guest appearances took her to the leading opera houses of New York, Chicago, London and Milan. Her artistic home base remained Munich until 1925, when she followed Walter to Berlin.         Her principal roles were Susanna in ''The Marriage of Figaro,'' the Queen of the Night in ''The Magic Flute'' and the leading female parts in ''The Barber of Seville,'' ''Rigoletto,'' ''Don Pasquale'' and other operas. She was the first to sing Zerbinetta in the revised version of Richard Strauss' ''Ariadne auf Naxos.''         In 1921 she married the noted tenor Karl Erb. They were divorced in 1932, and in the next year she married the pianist Michael Raucheisen, who died in 1984.         At the time of her second marriage she retired from singing - still, as her recordings of 1932 demonstrate, at the height of her powers - and began a long and notable career as a teacher. Among her many successful pupils were the sopranos Rita Streich and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. The latter maintained close contact with Ivogun and continued to consult her on pedagogical issues to the end of her life.         Ivogun made about 60 recordings from 1916 to 1932. They show a fresh, silvery voice and a merry style that could be tinged with pathos in melancholy arias. Her version of Zerbinetta's long aria from ''Ariadne'' has long been considered a classic, and her Johann Strauss waltzes sparkled with life.       
        Dorothy Read Thomas, the widow of James A. Thomas, the tobacco company executive, died Friday of cardiac arrest. She was 96 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dorothy Read Thomas, the widow of James A. Thomas, the tobacco company executive, died Friday of cardiac arrest. She was 96 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Thomas was born in Boulogne, France. She spent the first 10 years of her life in Tientsin, China, where her father, Sheridan Pitt Read, was the American consul general.         She did not attend college but instead traveled to Russia, where she taught English in Leningrad for five years.
