She was 70 years old.  Mrs. Spellman, a Democrat, was running for her fourth term in the House when her heart stopped beating temporarily on Oct. 31, 1980, while she was judging a Halloween costume contest at a shopping mall.         Two days later, she was re-elected with 80 percent of the vote over a little-known Republican, Kevin R. Igoe.         Mrs. Spellman remained hospitalized in critical condition for several weeks after her heart attack. Her condition later stabilized, and she was able to breathe without the aid of life-support equipment, but she never regained consciousness. Seat Is Declared Vacant         After receiving a medical analysis stating that Mrs. Spellman was in a ''trance-like state'' and unable to take the oath of office, the House declared her seat vacant in February 1981. It was the first time the House vacated the seat of a member who had become mentally or physically disabled.         Thirty-two Republican and Democratic candidates, including Mrs. Spellman's husband, Reuben, entered a special primary on April 7, 1981, to select the nominees to run for election in Maryland's Fifth District.         Mr. Spellman was defeated for the Democratic nomination by Steny H. Hoyer, who went on to defeat the Republican candidate, Mayor Audrey Scott of Bowie, Md., in a special election on May 19, 1981. Mr. Hoyer continues to serve in the House.         Mrs. Spellman, who was born Gladys Noon in New York City on March 2, 1918, was educated in public schools in the District of Columbia, George Washington University and the Graduate School of the Department of Agriculture.

She is survived by her husband; two sons, Stephen and Richard; a daughter, Dana Spellman O'Neill, and four grandchildren.

A year later, Mrs. Sullivan was elected to her husband's seat in the House. She held it until she stepped down in 1976. Mrs. Sullivan was succeeded by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, a Democrat who remains the Third District's Representative.         ''She was a distinguished and an effective legislator, much loved by the people of St. Louis,'' Mr. Gephardt said. 'Her contributions to our community and the nation will have long-lasting effects.''         In her years in Congress, Mrs. Sullivan became a prominent environmentalist and consumer advocate.

Estelle Wolf, a founder of Friends of Central Park, died of pneumonia Sunday at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 102 years old and lived in Manhattan.         An avid bird watcher in Central Park, Miss Wolf became the informal membership chairman of Friends when it was founded in 1966. At the time she was 80 and, as a member of Community Board 8, the oldest community-board member in New York. She has since retired.  Six years ago, she was still an active member of the Lenox Hill Democratic Club and the League of Women Voters.         Born in Grand Rapids, Mich., she attended Simmons College in Boston and moved to New York during the Depression. A cat lover and a photographer, Miss Wolf combined those passions and exhibited her cat pictures in New York galleries.         In her work for Central Park, Miss Wolf recruited members for Friends and helped out during parks events. Staunchly opposed to encroachment into the park, she fought establishment of the croquet fields, a proposed polo ground and expansion of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         When she turned 100, she was honored by the Parks Department at a ceremony at City Hall. ''She's the grand old lady of parks,'' said Henry J. Stern, the Parks Commissioner. ''She went tirelessly to meetings. She was an old-fashioned civic activist.''         There are no survivors.
