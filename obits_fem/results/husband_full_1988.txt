        Florence Eiseman, a designer of children's clothes who was known for excellent workmanship, top quality fabrics and simple but elegant styles, died of emphysema Friday at Columbia Hospital in Milwaukee, Wis. She was 88 years old and lived in Milwaukee.         Florence Eiseman, a designer of children's clothes who was known for excellent workmanship, top quality fabrics and simple but elegant styles, died of emphysema Friday at Columbia Hospital in Milwaukee, Wis. She was 88 years old and lived in Milwaukee.         A native of Minneapolis, Mrs. Eiseman began her career in 1945 when her husband, Laurence, packed up some of the dainty, organdy pinafores she made as gifts for friends and took them to a buyer at Chicago's Marshall Field & Company. He came home with a $3,000 order.         Ten years later she became the first children's designer to receive the Neiman Marcus award for her contributions to fashion, an honor that has also gone to Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, James Galanos and Norman Norell. Designs Honored by Museum         Early features of Mrs. Eiseman designs included French seams, hand-sewn hems, bound buttonholes and hand-rolled edges. Among those who dressed their children in her clothes were Princess Grace of Monoco, members of the Kennedy family and Elizabeth Taylor.         In 1964 the Denver Art Museum highlighted her career in a fashion retrospective that is believed to be the first time that a designer of children's wear was so honored by a museum.         ''Florence Eiseman has been one of the most influential figures in the children's fashion industry over the last several decades,'' said Carla Slocum, vice president and merchandise manager of children's wear for Saks Fifth Avenue. ''She was responsible for raising the standards of fashion and quality in better children's wear.''         Mr. Eiseman worked closely with his wife until his death in 1967. Their sons, Robert and Laurence Jr., then shared management with their mother and today are chief executive officer and president of the Florence Eiseman Inc. respectively.         In addition to her sons, Mrs. Eiseman is survived by a sister, Eva Tankel, of Minneapolis, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

She retired in 1981.  She is survived by her husband, Andrew; a daughter, Paulette Barrett of Manhattan, and three grandsons.       
        Beth Campbell Short, who covered Eleanor Roosevelt for The Associated Press and held a top White House job in Harry S. Truman's Presidency, died of cancer Monday. She was 79 years old.         Beth Campbell Short, who covered Eleanor Roosevelt for The Associated Press and held a top White House job in Harry S. Truman's Presidency, died of cancer Monday. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Short worked for The Springfield (Mo.) Leader and The Daily Oklahoman before she was hired in 1936 to cover Mrs. Roosevelt, who allowed only women to her news conferences.         Mrs. Short's husband, Joseph, became Truman's press secretary in 1950, and the President hired her as correspondence secretary when Mr. Short died in 1952.

Janice Raskin, a singer who performed on radio programs, died of colon cancer yesterday at a nursing home in Del Mar, Calif. She was 77 years old.         Mrs. Raskin, a native of New York City, won a scholarship to the Juilliard School when she was 16. She began as a concert and opera singer but soon found work singing popular music on radio.         From 1938 until 1952, she performed regularly on the ''Texaco Star Theater.'' She was a founding member of the New York chapter of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.         She is survived by her husband, Bernard; a son, John, of Van Nuys, Calif.; a sister, Evelyn Blackstone of Tamarac, Fla.; and a brother, Robert Kraushaar of El Toro, Calif.       
        Patricia Anne Hoffman Friedman, executive vice president and a partner in International Contract Furnishings, an importer and manufacturer of modern office and residential furniture, died of cancer Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 44 years old.         Patricia Anne Hoffman Friedman, executive vice president and a partner in International Contract Furnishings, an importer and manufacturer of modern office and residential furniture, died of cancer Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 44 years old.         An interior and furniture designer, Pat Hoffman, as she was known professionally, was influential in introducing avant-garde and early 20th-century European designs to the United States.         Ms. Hoffman was born March 7, 1943, in Detroit and graduated from the University of Michigan's College of Architecture and Design. From 1965 to 1970, she worked as director of design for Koch & Lowy, a lighting firm in New York City. After spending two years in Rome working for an architectural firm, Ms. Hoffman returned to New York to join I.C.F., in charge of the company's design programs, including graphics, advertising and showroom design.         For the last 15 years, Ms. Hoffman was instrumental in introducing designs that quickly became synonymous with the avant-garde. In the early 1970's, that included Giovanetti's Anfibio sofa, by Alessandro Becchi, an oversize leather upholstered raftlike sofa bed from Italy and the Interlubke system, a sleek German storage system. Introduced International Designs         Most influential in the modern home furnishings field was Ms. Hoffman's introduction in 1975 of the furniture designs by Josef Hoffmann, the Viennese leader of the early 20th-century Wiener Werkstatte movement. The Hoffmann furniture designs were pivotal in the rediscovery and revival of many other early 20th-century classics and played a critical role in the current interest in this important period of 20th-century design.         A lamp Ms. Hoffman designed in 1969 was exhibited in ''High Styles: 20th-Century American Design'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1985. Some of her other furniture designs have been shown at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, as well as at the Mobelmesse, in Cologne, West Germany, the Salon International de Meubles in Paris and the Saloni di Mobili in Milan.         Ms. Hoffman is survived by her husband, Samuel Friedman, president of I.C.F.; her parents, John and Mae Hoffman of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and a sister, Jane Knaus.         The funeral will be held tomorrow at 11:30 A.M. at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.       
        Alice Citron Begun, a former teacher in New York City and a member of the faction-ridden New York Teachers Union in the 1930's, died of a heart attack Sunday at her home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 79 years old.         Alice Citron Begun, a former teacher in New York City and a member of the faction-ridden New York Teachers Union in the 1930's, died of a heart attack Sunday at her home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Begun, with her husband, Isidor, also a teacher and longtime Communist Party member, were affiliated with the extreme leftwing faction in the union. The union, Local 5 of the American Federation of Teachers, its parent, lost its charter in 1941.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Adelaide Schnittman of West Palm Beach and Barbara Batnik of Montana.       
        Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937.         Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937. But it was in the Roaring Twenties that she put her stamp on American social history, creating in dozens of films the image of the wide-eyed, insouciant flapper with her bobbed hair and short skirts.         There was one other distinction known to every fan, even in the days before Technicolor: she had one brown eye and one blue eye. The eyes sparkled at audiences the world over beginning with the 1923 hit that made her big splash, ''Flaming Youth.'' Her Dutch bob was soon copied by hairdressers across America and her air of an emancipated young woman inspired countless imitations. Actress, Trend-Setter and Author         Miss Moore was at the vanguard of fashion's first revolution of the 20th century as skirts rose above the knee, bosoms vanished and waistlines slid down to the hips.         There followed such films as ''The Perfect Flapper,'' ''Naughty but Nice,'' ''Little Orphan Annie,'' and ''We Moderns.'' Her favorite, she said shortly after the end of her career, was a talkie, ''The Power and the Glory,'' which co-starred Spencer Tracy.         At the height of her popularity she earned a million dollars a year from films and she was also an author, writing ''Silent Star,'' her autobiography and ''How Women Can Make Money in the Stock Market.'' In another work, ''Colleen Moore's Doll House,'' she dealt with an elaborate miniature doll house she built in the mid-1920's that cost $470,000 and was designed in the form of a castle, complete with electricity, running water, an organ and a radio. The doll house later was sent around the country for display in department stores to raise money for charity.         Miss Moore was born Kathleen Morrison in Michigan on Aug. 19, 1902. She arrived in Hollywood at age 15 when an uncle arranged a screen test with the director D. W. Griffith. She wanted to be a second Lillian Gish, playing dramatic roles, but instead found herself playing pure-as-snow heroines in Westerns with stars like Tom Mix. She later observed that she usually came out second best to the star's horse. 'A New Type Was Born'         She had long, curly hair then, but at her mother's suggestion in 1923 she cut the curls off and landed the part of the flapper.         ''Here was a chance for a girl who had straight hair, who was not buxom and not a great beauty,'' she told an interviewer half a century later. ''A new type was born - the American girl.''         In 1926, three years after her flapper had burst upon the screen, Miss Moore wrote: ''Don't worry, girls. No edict of fashion arbiters will ever swathe you in long and cumbersome skirts.'' She added: ''The American girl will see to this. She is independent, a thinker will not follow slavishly the ordinances of those who in the past have decreed this or that for her to wear.''         Although she started the short-skirt fad with her appearances on screen, Miss Moore at first dressed quite differently in private life, favoring jeans, baggy sweaters and saddle shoes. But when she became a national fixture as the flapper, a designer friend accused her of being the worst-dressed woman in Hollywood. She took the criticism to heart and changed her manner of dress, managing to look both the all-American girl and chic and urbane.         In 1937 she married Homer Hargrave, a stockbroker, her third husband, and ended her film career. She had previously been married to a film producer, John McCormick, and a New York broker, Albert F. Scott. Mr. Hargrave was a widower with two children, whom she came to consider her own. He died in 1967.         Four years later Miss Moore hired a builder, Paul Maginot, to construct a home in Hidden Valley south of Paso Robles. In 1983 she and Mr. Maginot were married.         Her husband survives, as does her son, Homer Hargrave Jr. of Paso Robles; her daugher, Mrs. Roger Jackson Coleman, several grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.

Mab Wilson Moltke, a former advertising and publicity executive in New York, died Jan. 1 at her home in Blackrock, County Dublin, after a long illness. She was 78 years old and had moved to Ireland in 1970.         Mrs. Moltke, a native of San Francisco, began her career in New York with Saks Fifth Avenue and Vogue. She was the magazine's beauty editor in 1941 when Bergdorf Goodman appointed her advertising director.         In World War II, she went overseas for the Office of War Information. Posted in Stockholm, she met Count Carl Adam Moltke, a member of the Danish underground, who became her second husband in 1944.         Mrs. Moltke, known professionally as Mab Wilson, was director of publicity at Tiffany & Company in 1968 when she rejoined Bergdorf Goodman as director of advertising and publicity. A history of precious stones she wrote, ''Gems,'' was published by Viking in 1967.         Her marriage to Count Moltke, now of Monaco, ended in divorce. She is survived by two daughters, Alexandra Isles of New York City, and Victoria, of Dublin, and a grandson.

        Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year. Known for her dramatic power, Ms. Kaye, who was born in New York City in 1920, was a member of American Ballet Theater from its inception in 1940 until 1951, and again from 1954 to 1959.         Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year. Known for her dramatic power, Ms. Kaye, who was born in New York City in 1920, was a member of American Ballet Theater from its inception in 1940 until 1951, and again from 1954 to 1959. In between, she appeared with the New York City Ballet. Celebrated for her interpretations of the psychological ballets of Antony Tudor, she also danced in works by Agnes de Mille and Jerome Robbins.         The memorial included speeches by two ballerinas: Alicia Alonso, the Cuban dancer who was part of American Ballet Theater from 1940 until 1955, and Dame Margot Fonteyn, the former star of England's Royal Ballet. ''In her dance,'' Ms. Alonso said of Ms. Kaye, ''there was life always.'' Dame Margot called Ms. Kaye ''the most wonderful friend - understanding, perceptive, encouraging.''         Mr. Robbins analyzed Ms. Kaye's dramatic gift, saying that he believed she was theatrically striking not because she was flamboyant, but because of her gestural economy. Mr. Robbins recalled how last summer, while sitting at a cafe in Spoleto, Italy, he fancied he saw Ms. Kaye pass by.         Other tributes came from Leo Lerman, the theatrical writer; Mike Nichols, the director, and John Taras, Ballet Theater's associate director. Several speakers recalled how Ms. Kaye assisted her second husband, Herbert Ross, the choreographer and director, in his theatrical and film projects. Musical Tributes, as Well         Ms. Kaye had been married first to the violinist Isaac Stern. Mr. Stern was present to play Mozart's Violin Sonata in E minor, with Leonard Bernstein as pianist. Other musical selections included songs by Bernadette Peters and Barbara Cook. Leslie Browne and Robert Hill, of Ballet Theater, offered an excerpt from Tudor's ''Leaves Are Fading.''         The afternoon's touching conclusion came when Lynn Seymour, a British ballerina whose intensity has been likened to that of Ms. Kaye, danced Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan.'' When she stepped forward scattering rose petals, she could have been offering a floral tribute to Ms. Kaye.         Then, with Mr. Bernstein at the piano, Stephanie Friede sang ''Im Abendrot,'' one of Richard Strauss's ''Four Last Songs,'' which accompanied Tudor's ''Hail and Farewell,'' his last ballet for Ms. Kaye. It had been given its premiere by the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1959, with Ms. Kaye as guest artist; she retired in 1961. Possessing a theme that symbolized death and transfiguration, ''Im Abendrot'' sounded especially eloquent.

Coral Eaton Kinsolving, a former advertising and newspaper executive who was active in New York City community affairs and the management of Democratic political campaigns, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 57 years old.         Mrs. Kinsolving, who graduated from the Hewlett School in Islip, L.I., and Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pa., was a media researcher and program analyst for the McCann-Erickson and Bryan Houston advertising agencies in the 1950's.         She was a sales promotion and research executive for The New York Herald Tribune from 1960 until the paper ceased publication in 1966. Later, she placed commercials for advertisers on radio and television and bought, sold and managed real estate.         She was president of the Murray Hill Democratic Club from 1967 to 1969 and was a member of Community Planning Board 5 in midtown Manhattan in the 1970's. She managed Nanette Dembitz's campaign for the State Court of Appeals in 1972 and was an executive in campaigns by Paul O'Dwyer for the United States Senate in 1970 and Herman Badillo for mayor in 1973.

        Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Franco's doctor, Dr. Vicente Pozuelo Escudero, said she died of complications from bronchial pneumonia contracted on Feb. 1.         Queen Sofia went to Mrs. Franco's Madrid apartment to deliver condolences to Mrs. Franco's daughter, Carmen Franco de Martinez-Bordiu, 60, and her husband, on behalf of King Juan Carlos and herself.         In 1969, Franco designated Juan Carlos to be his successor, and Juan Carlos resumed the Spanish monarchy two days after Franco's death on Nov. 20, 1975. Figurehead of Movement         When her husband died, Mrs. Franco became the figurehead of a loosely formed organization of Franco's political followers, called ''El Movimiento.'' Each anniversary of Franco's death prompts thousands of fascists to march in the streets.         Mrs. Franco annually attended a funeral Mass in her husband's memory at the underground basilica in the Valley of the Fallen outside Madrid, where thousands of Nationalists killed in the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War are buried.         Ill health kept her from attending the 1987 memorial. An estimated 5,000 people attended the Mass, at the end of which they gave the fascist salute and shouted ''Franco! Franco! Franco!''         Mrs. Franco was born Carmen Polo on July 9, 1900, in the northern city of Oviedo, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. She was educated by Salesian nuns. In Spanish Morocco         She married Francisco Franco, then an up-and-coming army lieutenant colonel, on Oct. 22, 1923, and the couple left soon after for Spanish Morocco, where Franco was responsible for much of the conduct of the Riff Wars and where he built the military power base that served his successful uprising against the Republican Government.         Mrs. Franco exercised a strong influence on her husband, particularly in connection with affairs of the Roman Catholic Church and public morality.         Social historians say her puritanical upbringing was responsible for the heavy censorship of anything touching on sex or sexual matters in Spanish literature, theater and cinema during most of the 1939-75 Franco regime.         A man who answered the telephone at the apartment of Mrs. Franco's daughter said burial was scheduled for Sunday in the village of El Pardo on the outskirts of Madrid.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Franco is survived by seven grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.

Laura Louise Foster, a botanical artist, died last Sunday at Sharon (Conn.) Hospital after a brief illness. She was 70 years old and lived in Falls Village, Conn.         Many of Mrs. Foster's depictions of flowers are in the Hunt Botanical Library in Pittsburgh. With her husband, she received the Silver Medal of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society.         She is survived by her husband, H. Lincoln; two sons, Ellery Sinclair and John Sheldon Sinclair, both of Falls Village, and two stepchildren, Benjamin Griswald Foster of Wallingford, Conn., and H. Rebecca Light of Guilford, Conn.       
        Marghanita Laski, a novelist, critic and prolific amateur lexicographer, died Saturday, according to her family. She was 72 years old.         Marghanita Laski, a novelist, critic and prolific amateur lexicographer, died Saturday, according to her family. She was 72 years old.         A graduate of Somerville College at Oxford, Miss Laski published her first novel, ''Love on the Supertax,'' in 1944, and followed it with five others by 1953, including ''The Victorian Chaise-Longue.''         She then turned to criticism, with books on Charlotte Yonge, Jane Austen, George Eliot and Rudyard Kipling and two studies of religious and esthetic experience, ''Ecstasy'' and ''Everyday Ecstasy.''         One of her novels, ''Little Boy Lost,'' was turned into a movie in 1953 that starred Bing Crosby. Her 1959 television play ''The Offshore Island'' was about life in Britain after an atomic holocaust.         Miss Laski was widely known as a radio broadcaster. From 1979 to her death she was a member of the Arts Council of Great Britain, which channels government aid to the performing and visual arts.         Throughout her life, language remained one of Ms. Laski's great passions. Dr. Robert Burchfield, who started editing the four supplements to the Oxford English Dictionary in 1960, said Ms. Laski was his biggest contributor.

Ethel Henck Grant, a social worker, died of a heart attack Friday while traveling in Agra, India, a representative of the United Nations Children's Fund said yesterday. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Grant had been on a field trip with her husband, James P. Grant, executive director of the agency widely known as Unicef.         Born in San Pedro, a southern Los Angeles community, Mrs. Grant was a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley and had a master's degree from Simmons College. She worked at several hospitals, including the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and in the Washington, D.C., school system.         She worked on the organizing staff of the Peace Corps. At the time of her death, she was president of the International Women's Forum at the United Nations.

        Burnita Shelton Matthews, a senior judge on the Federal District Court here and the first woman appointed to a Federal trial court, died Monday at Sibley Memorial Hospital after suffering a stroke. She was 93 years old.         Burnita Shelton Matthews, a senior judge on the Federal District Court here and the first woman appointed to a Federal trial court, died Monday at Sibley Memorial Hospital after suffering a stroke. She was 93 years old.         Judge Matthews was named to the bench by President Harry Truman in 1949 and assumed senior status in 1968, allowing her to go into semiretirement while still hearing cases.         In the 1970's, she was designated to sit on the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. She remained active in the District Court until September 1983.         Earlier in her career, Judge Matthews had practiced law for almost 30 years and had developed a reputation as an advocate for women's rights.         One of her most notable cases was when she presided over the 1957 trial of Jimmy Hoffa, at that time the vice president of the teamsters union, on charges that he had bribed his way into the files of a Senate committee that was investigating him. A jury acquitted Mr. Hoffa.         In another celebrated case, Judge Matthews in 1955 refused to order the State Department to issue a passport to the singer and actor Paul Robeson. Mr. Robeson had been accused of membership in the Communist Party and of various activities in support of the Communist movement.         While sitting on the Court of Appeals in 1971, Judge Matthews ruled that disabled people receiving benefits from the Social Security Administration were entitled to hearings before their benefits were terminated.         President Reagan in 1984 wrote to her that ''in furthering the administration of justice in our legal system,'' her ''diligence, distinguished efforts and pioneering spirit serve as an inspiration to all.''         Judge Matthews studied law at the National University Law School, now part of George Washington Univerity, and received her degree in 1919. Her husband, retired Army Lieut. Col. Percy A. Matthews, died in 1969. She left no immediate survivors.       
        Burnita Shelton Matthews, the first woman to serve as a Federal district judge, died here Monday at the age of 93 after a stroke.         Burnita Shelton Matthews, the first woman to serve as a Federal district judge, died here Monday at the age of 93 after a stroke.         Judge Matthews was named to the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia by President Truman in 1949. At the time of her nomination, she was a familiar figure in Washington as a lawyer for the National Women's Party and an active campaigner for women's rights.         Judge Matthews presided over a number of major trials, including the 1957 bribery trial of James R. Hoffa, then vice president of the teamsters' union, at which he was acquitted. Help From Friends in Senate         She recalled in an interview several years ago that her friendship with a number of senators had blunted opposition to the notion of a woman on the Federal bench. When her nomination was being considered, one of the judges on the district court, T. Alan Goldsborough, said publicly that while ''Mrs. Matthews would be a good judge,'' there was ''just one thing wrong: she's a woman.''         While Judge Goldsborough told her some years later that his opposition had been mistaken, she received an icy welcome from her fellow judges, who agreed among themselves to assign her all the ''long motions,'' the most technical and least rewarding part of the court's docket.         Judge Matthews never retired from the court. In 1968 she took senior status, permitting her to reduce her workload on the district court while also hearing occasional cases in other Federal courts in Washington. She sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and on the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. She continued hearing district court cases until five years ago.         Judge Matthews retained a strong sense of her own role as a pioneer, and never wavered in her commitment to expanding opportunities for women. In a 1985 interview with the Third Branch, a newsletter published by the Federal court system, she said she had always chosen women to be her law clerks.         ''The reason I always had women,'' she said, ''was because so often, when a woman makes good at something they always say that some man did it. So I just thought it would be better to have women. I wanted to show my confidence in women.''         Burnita Shelton decided as a young girl that she wanted to be a lawyer, although professional opportunities in the law were extremely limited for women. She was born Dec. 28, 1894, in Copiah County, Mississippi, where her father owned a plantation and served as clerk of the local chancery court. She often accompanied him to court. But while the family sent her brother to law school, she was sent to the Conservatory of Music in Cincinnati, where she studied voice and piano.         She was teaching piano when the United States entered World War I. Hoping to find a Government job that would enable her to go to law school at night, she moved to Washington, passed a Civil Service examination, and took a job with the Veterans Administration. She went to night school at National University Law School, which later became part of George Washington University.         After her graduation in 1919, Mrs. Matthews, now married to a lawyer, Percy A. Matthews, applied to the Veterans Administration for a job as a lawyer. When the agency told her that it would never hire a woman in the legal department, she opened her own law office. More Obstacles to Legal Career         There were other stumbling blocks as well. The local bar association refused to accept her application for membership, returning the check she had sent for membership dues. Judge Matthews included that check among the papers she donated to what is now the Burnita Shelton Matthews Collection at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, at Radcliffe College.         Her activities on behalf of women's rights began in law school. In 1919, she was among several dozen women who regularly picketed the White House on Sundays on behalf of women's suffrage. ''You could carry a banner,'' she recalled in the 1985 interview, ''but if you spoke, you were arrested for speaking without a permit. So when they asked me why I was there, I didn't answer.''         After women got the vote in 1920, she shifted the focus of her activities. She became the lawyer for the National Woman's Party, which was trying to persuade state legislatures to lift legal barriers to women. Mrs. Matthews researched state laws and drafted proposed bills. The National Woman's Party owned the property across the street from the Capitol where the Supreme Court's building is now located. In the 1920's, when Chief Justice William Howard Taft proposed acquiring the land for the Court, she went to the Chief Justice's home to try to persuade him to look elsewhere. Her efforts failed, but she represented the party in the condemnation proceedings and won a generous settlement for it.         In the 1940's she also taught at the Washington College of Law, now part of American University. Upheld Right of Black Muslims         In 1949, President Truman named her to one of 20 new district judgeships that Congress had created to relieve a backlog in district court dockets. Among her rulings was one upholding the right of Black Muslims in the local prison to conduct religious services.         In a 1955 case, she refused to order the State Department to issue a passport to the singer Paul Robeson, who was accused of being a member of the Communist Party and of supporting various pro-Communist activities, . Mr. Robeson's passport was withheld from 1950 to 1958 and was restored to him when, in a similar case, the Supreme Court ruled the State Department's action unconstitutional.         On the Court of Appeals, Judge Matthews ruled that the Social Security Administration could not cut off disability benefits without a hearing.         In 1984, President Reagan commended her for her ''diligence, distinguished efforts and pioneering spirit.''         Her husband died in 1969. They had no children. Judge Matthews is survived by four sisters-in-law and 11 nieces and nephews. She will be buried in the family cemetery in Copiah County, Mississippi.

Elaine Black Yoneda, a radical labor activist during the Depression and the 1934 San Francisco general strike, died of a heart attack here on Thursday. She was 81 years old.         Mrs. Yoneda, known in labor circles as ''the Red Angel'' and as ''Tiger Woman'' in the Hearst newspapers because of her militancy, was the only woman on the steering committee of the 1934 San Francisco general strike, which was a response to the killing of two longshoremen participating in a West Coast walkout.         Until she retired in 1973, Mrs. Yoneda was a clerical worker for the pension fund of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union-Pacific Maritime Association. She was a member of Local 29 of the Office and Professional Employees International Union until this year and was president of the women's auxiliary of Local 16 of the longshoremen's union. Became a Communist         She was born in New York City on Sept. 4, 1906. She moved to Los Angeles in 1931 and there joined the Communist Party. She was active with International Labor Defense, a group that worked for the legal rights of strikers and others active in the labor movement.         She met a young Japanese-American and fellow Communist named Karl Yoneda when she went to bail him out of jail, where he was being held for strike activities. They were married in 1933.         Her husband said her death came on the 55th anniversary of their wedding as they were preparing to celebrate.         Mr. Yoneda said they had remained members of the party: ''We believe in minority parties. If you let the big shots run the country, what will happen to us?'' Husband Interned in War         In 1942, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt signed an order for the internment of people of Japanese ancestry. Mr. Yoneda was interned at the camp at Manzanar, Calif.         Mr. Yoneda said his wife and son remained with him until he volunteered to perform intelligence work for the United States military against the Japanese Army in Burma. Mrs. Yoneda was allowed to move with her son to San Francisco, but for the next two years she had to report monthly to military authorities on the child's whereabouts, her husband said.         In later years, she remained active in union and political work. The day before she died, she attended a longshoremen's rally for the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential campaign, her husband said.         A private funeral service was held Saturday in San Francisco. In addition to her husband, Ms. Yoneda's survivors are her daughter from a previous marriage, Joyce Ebangelista, her son, Thomas Yoneda, and two grandchildren.

Mrs. Spellman remained hospitalized in critical condition for several weeks after her heart attack. Her condition later stabilized, and she was able to breathe without the aid of life-support equipment, but she never regained consciousness. Seat Is Declared Vacant         After receiving a medical analysis stating that Mrs. Spellman was in a ''trance-like state'' and unable to take the oath of office, the House declared her seat vacant in February 1981. It was the first time the House vacated the seat of a member who had become mentally or physically disabled.

A hero in World War II and Vietnam, he later became a brigadier general and commander of the United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs. They had two daughters.         After her marriage, Ms. Raines appeared in films less frequently. In 1967, when her husband was serving in Vietnam, she characterized herself in a newspaper article as ''an Army wife'' and paid tribute to ''service wives . . . for maintaining a home that is as normal as possible for the children while keeping their worries to themselves.''         She and her husband were divorced in 1975. She is survived by her daughters, Christina Newman and Susan Olds, and a granddaughter.       
        Eleanor Estes, a prolific author of children's books, died of complications following a stroke at the Whitney Manor Nursing Home in Hamden, Conn., on Friday. She was 82 years old and lived in New Haven.         Eleanor Estes, a prolific author of children's books, died of complications following a stroke at the Whitney Manor Nursing Home in Hamden, Conn., on Friday. She was 82 years old and lived in New Haven.         Mrs. Estes was born in West Haven. She graduated from the Pratt Institute Library School and worked as children's librarian in branches of the New York Public Library system.         Her first book was ''The Moffats,'' written in 1941 and an instant hit. It illustrated the life of a family of four children growing up in a small New England town. Two other books about the Moffats followed.         The most popular of her 19 books, many of which she illustrated herself, was ''The Hundred Dresses,'' a tale about a poor child who is ridiculed for her tattered clothing and who insists that she owns 100 dresses. They turn out to be drawings, and when they win a prize, the girl's tormentors are abashed - and perhaps reformed. Won a Newbery Medal         Mrs. Estes won several literary prizes, the most prestigous being a John Newbery Medal for the most distinguished children's book, in 1952 for ''Ginger Pye.''         She was once asked by The New York Times Book Review what she was trying to say to children. She replied: ''I am holding up a mirror, and the scene reflected in the mirror is a true image of childhood, and the mirror, besides reflecting, also speaks and echoes the clear, profound, unpremeditated utterances, thoughts and imageries of children. I like to make children laugh or cry, to be moved in some way by my writing.''         Mrs. Estes wrote a single adult novel, ''The Echoing Green,'' which never achieved the popularity of her children's works.         She is survived by her husband, Rice, and a daughter, Helena Sileo of Brooklyn.

        Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Mrs. Berlin, the last of whose four novels, ''The Best of Families,'' was published in 1970, was also a prolific short-story writer and contributed several articles to The New Yorker before her marriage to Mr. Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926. Mr. Berlin observed his 100th birthday last May 11.         Their marriage was one of the most sensational social events of the 1920's, for it united the famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, with the former Ellin Mackay, a Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's fortune for love.         The Municipal Court wedding came after several events that made it clear that Ellin Mackay, one of the great beauties of her time, was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill society heiress.         She had all but turned her back on the exclusive so-called 400, which ruled her mother's day, choosing the new ''cafe society.'' She said she preferred the ''dizzy twenties'' to the ''dull old days'' when she was one of New York's most celebrated debutantes. Abandoning 'Polite Society'         Miss Mackay wrote what her friends called her ''saucy but amusing'' opinions in articles for The New Yorker. In one article she defended her generation's abandonment of the Junior League and ''polite society'' for the gayer life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.         ''It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ''They go to find privacy.''         That article shocked society and newspaper editorial writers, as did one that followed in The New Yorker dated Dec. 25, 1925, titled ''The Declining Function,'' in which she explained how, as a liberated young woman, she intended to seek her joys as she liked.         More portentous was her statement, ''Modern girls are conscious of their identity and they marry whom they choose, satisfied to satisfy themselves.'' Less than a month later she married the widowed Mr. Berlin, who was 15 years her senior and an immigrant Russian whose fame as a songwriter failed to impress the Mackay social circle.         The marriage so infuriated her father, Clarence Mackay, whose fortune was based in the Postal Telegragh Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, mining and several other inherited interests, that he barred her from his home and threatened to disinherit her. They were not reconciled until five years later. Marriage of 62 Years         The marriage, during which Mr. Berlin wrote several songs just for her, including ''Always'' and ''The Song Is Ended,'' was a true love match and was to last 62 years.         Ellin Mackay was born March 22, 1903, on her father's $6 million estate in Roslyn, L.I. Her mother was the former Katherine Duer, a successful writer. An aunt, Alice Duer Miller, was to become the author of the long, popular World War II poem ''The White Cliffs of Dover.''         She was also a granddaughter of John W. Mackay, an Irish immigrant and one of the Nevada pioneers who made fortunes from the Comstock Lode. He parlayed his fortune into diversified business interests that made him a billionaire.         Miss Mackay was educated in private schools and took special courses at Barnard College. She was a debutante during the season of 1922-23, when her father gave her a ball at the Ritz-Carlton.         Mr. Mackay, who had been divorced in 1913, doted on little Ellin, and he took her on several trans-Atlantic crossings. Because of their close relationship, he was all the more unwilling to give his blessing to the ''unsuitable'' Mr. Berlin.  In the first few years of her marriage, Mrs. Berlin put aside her budding writing career to have a family. Their only son, Irving Berlin Jr., died in infancy, and they had three daughters. Short Stories and Novels         In 1933 she began contributing short stories to The Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal and other popular magazines. Her first novel, ''Land I Have Chosen,'' was published in 1944. Depicting the evils of Nazi Germany, the novel was sold to the movies for $150,000, then a record. Her other novels were ''Lace Curtain,'' 1948; ''Silver Platter,'' a 1957 semifictional account of her Nevada pioneer forebears, and ''The Best of Families.''         Mrs. Berlin was re-baptized in the Catholic faith in the 1930's, and throughout her life she worshiped at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where a funeral will be held at 2 P.M. Tuesday. She was a major supporter of the Girl Scout movement.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Berlin is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett, of New York; Linda Louise Emmett, of Paris, and Elizabeth Irving Peters, of New York; a brother, John W. Mackay, of Locust Valley, L.I.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

Hurley Thompson, a nutrition scholar whose research linked some dietary deficiencies of expectant mothers with birth defects, has died at age 66.         The professor at the University of California at Davis died Thursday morning in a Sacramento hospital after open-heart surgery.         Beginning in the 1950s, she studied the effects of the trace metals manganese, zinc, magnesium, iron and copper on fetal development.         In her career, she received two Guggenheim Fellowships, five visiting scholar appointments abroad and numerous nutrition research awards. She served on several committees of the National Institutes of Health and the National Academy of Sciences national research council.         She was named editor of the Journal of Nutrition in 1984 and had served as president of three national scientific organizations.         Known professionally as Dr. Hurley, she was born in Riga, Latvia, and immigrated to the United States with her family at age of 3.         She is survived by her husband, Kenneth Thompson of Sacramento; a daughter, Barbara Jungerman of San Francisco; a son, Michael Hurley of Shingle Springs, Calif.; a stepdaughter, Tamara Wright of Seattle; stepsons, Nicolas Thompson of West Sacramento and Marcus Thompson of San Jose; a brother, Dr. Milton Shapson of Milwaukee; a sister, Phyllis Shapson of Los Angeles; and two grandsons.

She was 59 years old. Mrs. Nasher, a friend of many of the artists whose work she collected, began by collecting pre-Columbian art, later becoming interested in Texas artists and 20th-century American painters and sculptors.         Since the early 1970's, Mrs. Nasher had increasingly turned her interest toward the works for which the collection is now best known: modern sculpture by artists ranging from Picasso and Henry Moore to Giacometti, David Smith, Matisse and Maillol.         A major exhibition of works from that collection, ''A Century of Modern Sculpture: The Patsy and Raymond Nasher Collection,'' opened at the Dallas Museum of Art in April 1987 and has since been shown at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and at the Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid. The show opened yesterday at the Forte di Belvedere in Florence.         She is survived by her husband, Raymond, of Dallas; by her mother, Ivy Rabinowitz, of Dallas; by her daughters, Andrea, Joan and Nancy Nasher; by her sisters, Judy Tycher and Sandra Cohen, and by her brother, Stanley Randall.       
        Barbara Woodhouse, the dog trainer whose teaching methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died today, relatives said. She was 78 years old.         Barbara Woodhouse, the dog trainer whose teaching methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died today, relatives said. She was 78 years old.         Her family said she died in a hospital in Buckinghamshire, northwest of London, having suffered a second stroke a month ago. She had a first stroke in 1984.         ''We shall miss her very much but she had been very ill for some time,'' Mrs. Woodhouse's son, Patrick, said today.         In the 1970's and early 1980's, millions of dog owners in Britain and the United States watched Mrs. Woodhouse schooling pets on the BBC television program ''Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way,'' which became widely syndicated in this country. Before long, loyal viewers were telling their dogs, ''Walkies!'' as her byword caught on. With Love and Breath         Her book, ''No Bad Dogs, The Woodhouse Way,'' was a bestseller in 1982.         She insisted that any dog could be trained and showed that they could be taught within minutes with ''tone of voice, telepathy and a little bit of loving.'' Her way of getting to know an animal was to breathe into its nose.         Mrs. Woodhouse's smiling, bespectacled face, framed by short gray hair, became a familiar sight on television talk shows. In 1980, she was ''flabbergasted'' to be named female television personality of the year in Britain.         ''She had an amazing ability with animals,'' her husband, Dr. Michael Woodhouse, said.         The Woodhouses lived in Croxley Green in Hertfordshire north of London.         The daughter of a clergyman, Mrs. Woodhouse developed her knack with animals as a child when her mother boarded dogs. She learned she could stop their barking by talking to them in a quiet voice. Innkeeper for Man and Beast         She trained dogs as her three children were growing up, and at one time ran a hotel for dogs and their owners.         She made her first dog-training film, ''Love Me, Love My Dog,'' in 1955 using a Great Dane, Juno. It was shown in movie theaters around the country. Her first record album, in 1967, had advance sales of 25,000.         Mrs. Woodhouse said she received 400 letters a day when the television program was running.         She once said that because of the television appearances, she could not go out in public without being asked for her advice.         The public recognition could be helpful, she said. Once, going through passport control at a London airport, the inspector said: ''Oh, here's the dog lady. No need to see your passport. Walkies!''

        Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         The immediate cause of the actress's death was not disclosed, but she had been in frail health for several years. She had lived in a condominium in Montecito, a suburb of Santa Barbara, since 1974. For many years previously, she and Mr. March, who died in 1975 at the age of 77, lived in Manhattan and on a 40-acre farm near New Milford, Conn.         Miss Eldridge, who made her New York stage debut in the chorus of Jerome Kern's ''Rockabye Baby,'' in 1918, was a versatile actress who played in touring stock companies, motion pictures and on Broadway. She Played Mary Tyrone         She topped a distinguished career on the stage in 1956 with her memorable portrayal of the tragic drug addict Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical drama, ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' For that performance she was named best actress by the New York Drama Critics Circle.         Miss Eldridge was named Florence McKechnie when she was born on Sept. 5, 1901, in Brooklyn. She graduated from Girls High School and immediately set her sights on an acting career. By 1921 she had made her mark, appearing in the Theater Guild's ''Ambush'' and impelling one critic to call her ''one of the brightest chapters in the season's theatrical history.''         She became one of her era's most celebrated performers, appearing in ''The Cat and the Canary'' (1922), Pirandello's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' (1922), and as the neurotic and spoiled Daisy Buchanan in a stage version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.''         In 1927 she met and appeared opposite Mr. March in Molnar's ''The Swan,'' and they were married within the year. Then, on a repertory tour, they were not allowed to appear in the same plays together, for management considered it unromantic to have a man and wife play lovers. Ascendancy of the Voice         The Marches wound up in Los Angeles in 1928, so the actor could appear in ''The Royal Family'' at a local theater. Sound had just been introduced into films, and Hollywood was eager to give work to stage-trained actors with excellent voices, like Miss Eldridge and Mr. March, and so they settled there.         Miss Eldridge had appeared briefly in a New York-made film in 1923, but her first good movie roles came in 1929, when she made three films, ''The Studio Murder Mystery,'' co-starring Mr. March, ''Charming Sinners'' and ''The Greene Murder Case.'' During the 1930's, while her husband became a major box-office star, she appeared in several movies, including ''The Story of Temple Drake'' (1933), based on William Faulkner's ''Sanctuary,'' ''Les Miserables'' (again with Mr. March, in 1935) and ''Mary of Scotland'' (1936), in which she played Elizabeth I. The acting couple returned to Broadway in 1938 in ''Yr. Obedient Husband,'' a vehicle based on Samuel Pepys's diary, and failed so resoundingly they bought advertising space to apologize. The advertisement, in trade publications, showed the Marches as trapeze artists missing each other's grip in midair. ''Oops, sorry!'' read the caption.  In 1942, during the Broadway run of Thornton Wilder's ''Skin of Our Teeth,'' Miss Eldridge and Mr. March carried on an epic feud with their notoriously temperamental co-star, Tallulah Bankhead. The director of the play, Elia Kazan, in his recent autobiography, ''A Life,'' recalled that nightly, while Miss Eldridge was giving her main speech, Miss Bankhead would conspicuously comb her hair to upstage her. To retaliate, Mr. March stood in the wings gargling loudly while Miss Bankhead gave her big speech. Other Roles Together         In 1948 Miss Eldridge returned to Hollywood to play Mr. March's wife in Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest.'' That same year they appeared in a daring and controversial film about euthanasia, variously called ''An Act of Mercy'' and ''An Act of Murder.'' They also acted together in ''Christopher Columbus,'' in which Miss Eldridge was seen as Queen Isabella, in 1949, and, again playing man and wife, in ''Inherit the Wind,'' in 1960.         The Marches had no children of their own, but adopted two, Anthony and Penelope. Miss Eldridge is survived by her daughter, Penelope Fantacci of Florence, Italy; five grandchildren; a great-granddaughter, and two brothers, David I. McKechnie, who lives in Oregon, and Cromwell McKechnie, of Carpenteria, Calif.

Mattie Rice Coney, a schoolteacher and civic leader in Indianapolis known as an advocate for the inner-city poor, died Friday at Cambridge Health Care Center, Indianapolis, after a long illness. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Coney, born in Gallatin, Tenn., grew up in Indianapolis, where she lived for the rest of her life. A graduate of Butler University, she taught in the Indianapolis public school system for 35 years, retiring in 1965.         She was active in a variety of neighborhood causes and, in 1964, with her husband, Elmo Cooney, founded a neighborhood group, Citizens Forum, to combat housing discrimination against blacks. The group disbanded in 1984 because of the Coneys' poor health. Mr. Coney died that year.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Jean Porter Dubos, who collaborated in biological and environmental research for several decades with her husband, Rene Dubos, died of ovarian cancer Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.         Jean Porter Dubos, who collaborated in biological and environmental research for several decades with her husband, Rene Dubos, died of ovarian cancer Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.         Mrs. Dubos, who was born in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, joined the Dubos Laboratory at the Harvard Medical School in 1942 and moved two years later to the Rockefeller Institute (now Rockefeller University) in New York City when Dr. Dubos rejoined it. Together, they established a new laboratory to study tuberculosis. They were married in 1946.         Mrs. Dubos was co-author with her husband in 1950 of ''The White Plague - Tuberculosis, Man and Society,'' which stressed the role of social reform rather than surgical intervention or drugs to control disease and was a forerunner of other works in the social history of medicine.         The couple's close collaboration led to several books on a philosophy of the human environment. Mrs. Dubos was a founder of the Rene Dubos Center for Human Environments, in which she remained active until her death.         Mrs. Dubos, whose husband died in 1982, is survived by a niece, Jennifer Porter of Cambridge, Mass.

She was 89 years old.         A native of Vienna, she was the daughter of an industrialist and came to the United States in 1929. She married Charles Hodges, a New York University professor, and their rooftop loft on lower Fifth Avenue became a meeting place for New York intellectuals and artists in the 1930's and 40's.         From 1936 until 1965, she taught at Dalton, where she established a community-service program that became a widely copied model.         In 1966, after her husband's death, she taught English in Tunisia as a Peace Corps volunteer, then toured the United States to promote enlistment of the elderly in the corps.         She is survived by a daughter, April H. Herbert of Pound Ridge, N.Y.

Mrs. Ramsey also appeared in ''Goonies'' and played Nick Nolte's mother in ''Weeds,'' but her role as the domineering, loud-mouthed mother in ''Throw Momma From the Train'' gave her stardom.         It was the removal of part of her tongue during throat cancer surgery three years ago that gave her the speech impediment heard in ''Throw Momma,'' which starred Danny DeVito and Billy Crystal.         The diminutive, hunch-shouldered actress played her most tormented and tormenting role in the movie, in which Mr. DeVito, as her browbeaten son, Owen Lift, tries to arrange a swap of murder victims. His writing teacher (Mr. Crystal) will kill Mr. DeVito's mother, while Mr. DeVito will murder Mr. Crystal's former wife. They abandon their efforts after a series of mistakes. 4 Films Still to Be Released Mrs. Ramsey was nominated for an Oscar this year for ''Throw Momma,'' but lost to Olympia Dukakis of ''Moonstruck.'' She will be seen in four films that have yet to be released: ''Doctor Hackenstein,'' ''Scrooge,'' ''Good Ol' Boy'' and ''Homer and Eddie.'' Mrs. Ramsey's show business career spanned 37 years.         She appeared in two Barbra Streisand films, ''Up the Sandbox'' and ''For Pete's Sake.''         Mrs. Ramsey's television credits included roles in ''The Young and the Restless,'' guest appearances on ''Hill Street Blues,'' ''Night Court'' and ''Knight Rider,'' and movies-of-the-week roles in ''White Mama,'' ''The Boy in the Plastic Bubble,'' ''Blind Ambition'' and ''Marilyn.''         The actress often appeared with her husband, Logan Ramsey, in projects, including Clint Eastwood's ''Any Which Way You Can.''         During the filming of ''Throw Momma,'' Mrs. Ramsey was undergoing oral surgery and was enduring intense pain, Mr. DeVito said. She began a series of chemotherapy treatments after suffering a recurrence of the cancer in April.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Ramsey is survived a brother and a sister.

        Ray Eames, who as a partner in the design firm The Office of Charles and Ray Eames exerted a powerful influence on furniture and industrial design over the last 40 years, died of cancer on Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         Ray Eames, who as a partner in the design firm The Office of Charles and Ray Eames exerted a powerful influence on furniture and industrial design over the last 40 years, died of cancer on Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         As a professional partner of her husband, Charles, who died in 1978, Ray Eames collaborated in the design of hundreds of chairs, tables, and other pieces of furniture that combined mass production with a high sense of style and comfort.         Their most famous work is the ''Eames Chair,'' two pieces of molded plywood connected by stainless steel tubing. Other chairs and tables designed by the Eameses, who worked in Venice, Cal., were made from such materials as reinforced plastic and fiberglas.         Today, their designs are commonly found in airports, high schools and hospitals in mass-produced form, and as showpieces in the most stylish offices and homes. Their Home Was a Showcase         The Eameses' home in Santa Monica, Calif., was designed and built in 1949 as a demonstration project to encourage the use of mass-produced industrial materials. Virtually all of the materials used were bought out of manufacturers' catalogues. The house was a harbinger of the era of prefabricated buildings, but was also widely praised for the lightness, delicacy, intelligence and beauty of its design.         Mrs. Eames, a painter by training, and Mr. Eames, an architect, collaborated in dozens of design projects ranging from films and books to fabric design and museum exhibitions.         Their work in films was especially noted. Most of the films were educational, and many attempted to make scientific notions understandable to a wide public through striking visual means.         The best-known of these efforts is ''Powers of Ten,'' completed by the Eameses in 1968 for the Commission on College Physics. The film illustrates the concept of tenfold magnification by zooming a camera from the surface of the earth to the edge of the universe, then back down to a carbon atom in a man's hand.         A native of Sacramento, Calif., Mrs. Eames was trained as a painter, and studied with Hans Hoffman in New York City for six years in the 1930's. In 1940, she met Mr. Eames, an architect, at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. They married and moved to California in 1941.         Mrs. Eames is survived by her daughter, Lucia Demetrios of San Francisco, and by five grandchildren.

        Nancy Hale, a novelist and short-story writer, died Saturday at the Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Va., after suffering a stroke. She was 80 years old and lived in Charlottesville.         Nancy Hale, a novelist and short-story writer, died Saturday at the Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Va., after suffering a stroke. She was 80 years old and lived in Charlottesville.         Flickers of prim Boston, social New York and proper Virginia danced through her works, the earlier ones focusing on the follies and foibles of well-bred women.         ''I specialize in women,'' Miss Hale said in an interview in 1942, ''because they are so mysterious to me. I feel that I know men quite thoroughly, that I know how, in a given situation, a man is apt to react. But women puzzle me.''         Nancy Hale was born in Boston on May 6, 1908, the daughter of Philip L. Hale and Lilian Westcott Hale, both painters. As a toddler she played in their studios, often setting up a palette and trying to copy whatever they were working on. Brief Career Painting         She graduated from the Winsor School in Boston in 1926, studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and worked briefly as a painter.         Bored with Boston, she moved to New York in 1928. After working as an assistant editor at Vogue (''I pinch-hit as a model''), she joined The New York Times as a reporter. In 1929 she began to contribute ''casuals'' - humorous sketches - and stories to The New Yorker.         She became one of the New Yorker's best-known writers, and once boasted that she sold the magazine more stories in a single year than any other writer. First Novel About the Young         Miss Hale's first novel, ''The Young Die Good,'' was published in 1932. It was based on her idea that young New Yorkers wanted something more than they were getting in life but had neither ''the courage nor strength to go out and get it.'' Her second novel, ''Never Any More,'' appeared in 1934, followed in 1936 by a collection of short stories, ''The Earliest Dreams.''         Among her other works were ''New England Discovery'' (1963), ''Life in the Studio'' (1969), ''Secrets'' (1971), ''Mary Cassatt'' (1975) and ''The Night of the Hurricane'' (1978).         She is survived by her husband, Fredson T. Bowers, of Charlottesville, a former chairman of the English department of the University of Virginia; two sons by previous marriages, William Wertenbaker, of New Haven, Conn., and Mark Hardin; five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

        Dorothy Scott Gerber, the widow of Daniel F. Gerber, who founded the Gerber Products Company, died in her sleep Sunday at her home in Fremont, Mich., according to a company spokesman. She was 84 years old.         Dorothy Scott Gerber, the widow of Daniel F. Gerber, who founded the Gerber Products Company, died in her sleep Sunday at her home in Fremont, Mich., according to a company spokesman. She was 84 years old.         Mrs. Gerber played a key role in the introduction of Gerber baby food in 1928. Tired of straining foods for her own children, it occurred to her that if the Fremont Canning Company could puree tomatoes, it could also puree fruits and vegetables. Fremont was the predecessor to Gerber Products; the name was changed in 1941.         Her husband thought the idea was sound and that other mothers might welcome commercially strained baby foods if they could be sold cheaply at regular grocery outlets.         The first batches of strained vegetables were then produced. Mrs. Gerber, a native of Ithaca, Mich., who married Daniel Gerber in 1923, liked them and, more important, so did her 7-month-old daughter Sally. The new baby food was priced at 15 cents, considerably cheaper than similar foods, which until then had been obtainable largely through drug stores at 40 to 60 cents each.         Besides her daughter, Sally Phinny of Fremont, Mrs. Gerber is survived by four other children, Paula Warm of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Gay Cummings, Scottie Merrill and Daniel Gerber Jr., all of Fremont. She is also survived by 18 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren.

Muriel Snowden, co-founder of the non-profit Freedom House that pushed for integration and self-help in Boston's predominantly black Roxbury section, died of cancer at her home Friday. She was 72 years old.         Mrs. Snowden and her husband, Otto, began Freedom House in 1949 after calling 17 people to their home to discuss how black and white residents of Boston could unite on common problems.         They ran the organization from their home for three years and then bought a building for it.         By the time the Snowdens retired in 1984, the organization had become a catalyst for urban renewal, job fairs, affirmative action and innovative school programs. The Snowdens were also a force for calm during Boston's school integration crisis of the 1970's.         ''The work of an organization like ours is never done,'' Mrs. Snowden once said.         In June 1987, she was one of 32 Americans who were given ''no strings'' grants by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. For five years, each fellow receives an annual stipend ranging from $30,000 to $75,000.         In June, the Boston School Committee voted to rename a high school in Mrs. Snowden's honor.         Mrs. Snowden is survived by her husband, a daughter and a granddaughter.       
        Bonita Granville Wrather, a child film star of the 1930's and a longtime executive in the Wrather Corporation, a complex of oil, entertainment and real estate businesses founded by her husband, Jack Wrather, died of cancer yesterday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 65 years old and had homes in Holmby Hills, Calif., and         Bonita Granville Wrather, a child film star of the 1930's and a longtime executive in the Wrather Corporation, a complex of oil, entertainment and real estate businesses founded by her husband, Jack Wrather, died of cancer yesterday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 65 years old and had homes in Holmby Hills, Calif., and London.         As Bonita Granville, the actress was the epitome of malevolent little girls, particularly in ''These Three,'' Lillian Hellman's heterosexual film adaptation of her play about lebsianism, ''The Children's Hour.'' The performance won the actress a 1936 Oscar nomination.         Among her more than 50 other movies were ''Ah, Wilderness!'' (1935), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Maid of Salem'' (1937), ''Quality Street'' (1937), ''Now Voyager'' (1942) and ''Hitler's Children'' (1943). The spunky blond actress also played the inquisitive title role in the ''Nancy Drew'' detective-reporter series. A Family of Entertainers         She was born in Manhattan on Feb. 2, 1923, into a family of entertainers and went on the stage at 3. She became a leading lady in films of the late 40's and retired from the screen in 1947 to marry Mr. Wrather. She appeared occasionally in television plays and, in 1958, became the associate producer of her husband's popular ''Lassie'' television series and later its producer.         Mr. Wrather was a founding member of the ''kitchen cabinet'' of prominent Californians who encouraged Ronald Reagan to run for Governor in 1967, and he and his wife were close friends of the Reagans. In a statment by the White House yesterday, the President and his wife lauded Mrs. Wrather as ''a warm and caring friend'' who had for so many years ''enriched our lives with her sparkling personality, her wonderful sense of humor, her loyalty and her love.''         Mrs. Wrather held a series of major executive posts in the Wrather Corporation and succeeded her husband as board chairman after his death in 1984, holding the post until last January, when the company was sold to the Walt Disney Company and Industrial Equity (Pacific) Limited, a Hong Kong investment concern. Civic Appointments         Mrs. Wrather was the chairman of the American Film Institute, a trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center and of Loyola Marymount University, a director and former president of the Los Angeles Orphanage Guild, a member of the advisory committee of the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles, a founder and board member of the Los Angeles Music Center and a board member of the Women's Council of the Public Broadcasting Service's Channel 28 there.         For her work on the ''Lassie'' television series and for talks around the country in behalf of environmental conservation, Mrs. Wrather received a Boy Scouts of America National Award and a National 4-H Congress Conservation Award.         Surviving are two daugthers, Molly Dolle and Linda Finocchiaro; a son, Christopher, and nine grandchildren, all of the Los Angeles area.

Henrietta Jacobson, a longtime star of the Yiddish theater in New York, died of heart failure Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Jacobson was one of the most venerable actresses and comediennes of the Yiddish theater, which flourished on the Lower East Side during the first half of the century. The daughter, wife and mother of Yiddish actors, she made her stage debut at age 3 in Chicago, where she was born.         After her 1912 New York debut in ''Israel's Hope,'' Miss Jacobson spent much of the next seven decades performing in such Yiddish plays and musicals as ''It Could Happen to You,'' ''The World of Mrs. Solomon,'' ''Go Fight City Hall'' and ''Kosher Widow.'' Her husband, Julius Adler, was almost always her co-star in New York and on the road. They produced and directed at the Downtown National Theater and other Lower East Side playhouses, with Miss Jacobson often designing the sets and doing the choreography.         Miss Jacobson starred on the long-running radio series ''My Mother and I'' in the 1940's. She made her Broadway debut in Neil Simon's 1962 ''Come Blow Your Horn,'' and appeared in the 1971 musical ''70, Girls, 70'' and in the 1980 film ''Hero at Large.''         In addition to her husband, Miss Jacobson is survived by a son, Bruce, of Manhattan.

        Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Feinberg was the author of nine novels including ''A World Full of Strangers,'' ''Fairytales,'' ''The Days of Winter,'' ''Portraits,'' ''Come Pour the Wine'' and ''Seasons of the Heart.'' Her books have been translated into 33 languages and sold more than 20 million copies.         Mrs. Feinberg was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a child of German immigrants, and was brought up in San Francisco from the age of 6 months. She dropped out of school in the sixth grade and continued her education by auditing classes at the University of California at Berkeley. Seeking a Sedentary Pursuit         At 18, she married Dr. Herman Feinberg, who was her grandmother's physician. Subsequently Mrs. Feinberg became an interior decorator for 25 years, until a serious illness forced her to take up a more sedentary activity.         ''I'd been writing all my life - little things for Hadassah, plays for the Sisterhood,'' she said in a 1980 interview. ''I never thought of myself as a writer, but the simplest thing seemed to be to put a piece of paper in the roller and start typing.''         Her first novel was not published until she was 55. It took her four years to write ''A World Full of Strangers,'' chronicling four generations in the life of a Jewish family in the United States.         The novel was rejected by four houses before it was published in 1975 by the Arbor House Publishing Company. It sold 20,000 hard-cover books, ''a very respectable figure for a first novel,'' said Donald I. Fine, her first publisher, who edited her first six novels. The book went on to sell nearly 2 million copies in paperback. Explanation of Success         Although her books were not received enthusiastically by reviewers, they were immensely successful. Gilbert Millstein, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said about ''A World Full of Strangers'': ''It is soap opera - in this case, Jewish soap opera - and the audience for soap opera, in print or on televsion, Jewish or not, runs into the millions.''         ''The Last Princess,'' which was her final book, was published last April and will be brought out in paperback next spring. ''We know of no other book she was working on,'' said a spokesman for G. P. Putnam's Sons, which published her last three novels, all of them best sellers. Her Common Theme         A common theme of the novels was the struggle of Jewish immigrants to make themselves at home in the United States while holding true to their traditions. ''I'm very interested in the perpetuation of Jewish life,'' she once said. ''My own family is very close. I suppose that's why I'm drawn to family sagas.''         Mrs. Feinberg's husband died in May 1986, and her daughter, Arlene, died in an automobile accident in 1985.         Mrs. Feinberg is survived by her father, Albert C. Freeman of Atherton, Calif.; two sisters, Ruth Sevier of San Francisco and Helen Dwane of Redwood City, Calif.; a son, Sheldon, of Danville, Calif.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

        Mary Elizabeth Tippett, an owner and breeder of such racing thoroughbreds as Mr. Gus, Tumbleweed, Pretense and Racing Room, died late Saturday after a long illness at Llangollen Farm, her 4,000-acre estate at Upperville, Va. She was 83 years old.         Mary Elizabeth Tippett, an owner and breeder of such racing thoroughbreds as Mr. Gus, Tumbleweed, Pretense and Racing Room, died late Saturday after a long illness at Llangollen Farm, her 4,000-acre estate at Upperville, Va. She was 83 years old.         Horses racing under her colors have won the Woodward, the English Grand National, the Santa Anita Handicap and many other major races. At one time she owned the second largest stable of thoroughbreds in North America.         She was born Mary Elizabeth Altemus in Wynnewood, Pa., where she attended school. When she was 15, her uncle, Samual D. Riddle, an internationally known turfman, presented her with her first horse.         She was most active in racing in the 1930's, during her marriage to John Hay Whitney. It ended in divorce in 1940. She was later married to Dr. E. Cooper Person, who died in the mid-1940's, and to Richard Dwight Lunn, from whom she was divorced.         Mrs. Tippett set a trend among thoroughbred owners when she had her helicopter and Rolls-Royce painted with her racing silks: dark purple and fuchsia. The helicopter was invariably piloted by her fourth husband, Col. Cloyce Joseph Tippett, of the Air Force. Colonel Tippett, who formerly headed the Lima, Peru, office of the International Civil Aviation Organization, is her only immediate survivor. A private service is to be held at Upperville Cemetery in Upperville, Va., today at 11 A.M.

Margerie Bonner Lowry, an actress and a writer, and the widow of the writer Malcolm Lowry, died in a Los Angeles nursing home last Wednesday. She was 83 years old.         Mrs. Lowry worked closely with her husband on his 1947 novel ''Under the Volcano,'' typing and editing the manuscript, and is generally considered to be the model for its central female character, the consul's wife, Yvonne.         Born in Washington, Mrs. Lowry acted in B movies starting in 1923 and was the co-star with her sister, Priscilla Bonner, in ''Paying the Price'' (1927). She wrote two mystery novels published in the late 1930's, ''The Shapes That Creep'' and ''The Last Twist of the Knife.''         She and Mr. Lowry married in 1940. After his death in 1957, she was the co-editor of his ''Dark as the Grave Wherein My Friend Is Laid'' (1968), and she edited his ''Psalms and Songs'' (1975) among other works.         Mrs. Lowry is survived by her sister.       
        Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         As Lois W., she was revered as ''the first lady of Al-Anon,'' and as a living reminder of the beginnings five decades ago of the Alcoholics Anonymous self-help movement.         Al-Anon members help one another and themselves to deal with personal problems by speaking about them -''sharing their experience, strength and hope,'' as they like to say - at group meetings. They also help each other on a one-to-one basis, and they read the movement's many inspirational pamphlets and books. Thousands of Groups Formed         An executive on the staff of the Al-Anon Family Group headquarters in Manhattan, where Mrs. Wilson's death was announced yesterday, said 30,000 groups - including several thousand Alateen groups for the teen-age children of alcoholics - are in operation.         The executive, who in accordance with Al-Anon policy declined to give her name, said more than 20,000 of the groups were in the United States and Canada, with groups in about 100 other nations. She estimated worldwide membership of Al-Anon at about 500,000.         In the 1930's, Mrs. Wilson - a spirited, small woman with lively brown eyes - stuck by her alcoholic husband, William G. Wilson, who had become a self-described ''hanger-on in Wall Street.'' She hoped he would manage to stop drinking for good.         Mr. Wilson did, and in 1935 he became a co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. One of its groups flourished in the Wilsons' home, then an apartment at 182 Clinton Street in Brooklyn. Since those early days, Alcoholics Anonymous has grown to an international membership of more than 1.5 million. Known within that organization as Bill W., Mr. Wilson died in 1971. A Time of Discontent         After Alcoholics Anonymous was founded, Mrs. Wilson became discontented. ''It seemed I saw nothing of the man I had tried to help,'' she later recalled.         ''He was always with his A.A. cronies'' who helped him to resist alcohol, she said, adding that ''I guess I was jealous and resentful that these strangers had done for him what I could not do.''         A turning point for her came one day when, as she said, ''I threw my shoe at him as hard as I could.''         ''I was so ashamed of myself,'' she said, ''that I went out and walked around the block several times. I soon had to admit that I needed some therapy myself.''         Mrs. Wilson, who was not an alcoholic, began applying to herself the same self-help principles that her husband and his Alcoholics Anonymous friends were using.         ''I shared my experience with other relatives of alcoholics, and we began to hold informal meetings,'' she said. ''We did not discuss our alcoholic relatives, but tried to straighten out our own lives. This attitude became basic to Al-Anon.'' Two Separate Organizations         Though Al-Anon is in many ways patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous, the two organizations are organizationally separate. Both groups are self-supporting; they do not accept funds from nonmembers. Members of both groups are supposed to maintain anonymity in the news media - which is why Mrs. Wilson and her husband were widely known only by their first names.         Mrs. Wilson was said never to have voiced blanket condemnation of the drinking of alcoholic beverages, affirming that she opposed ''only the disease of alcoholism and the damage it does to a family.''         She was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of a physician. She graduated from the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn, worked in a Y.W.C.A. and taught school in Short Hills, N.J., before her marriage to Mr. Wilson in 1918. After her marriage she worked for a time as an occupational therapist, wrote magazine articles and worked as a Macy's sales clerk.         After Mrs. Wilson and other alcoholics' relatives began their meetings, similar self-help discussion groups for members of alcoholics' families were founded elsewhere in the United States during the 1940's. In 1951, Mrs. Wilson, along with a friend and Westchester County neighbor, Anne B., set up a central information center for these groups. The center was initially in her Westchester home. First Alateen Group         Not long afterward, the center moved into offices in Manhattan, and the movement took the name Al-Anon Family Groups. In 1957, the first Alateen self-help group was set up, in California, for young people with alcoholism in their families.         Mrs. Wilson remained active and prominent in Al-Anon into the 1980's, traveling on its behalf and appearing at and addressing Al-Anon gatherings. At the first international convention of Al-Anon, in 1985 in Montreal, an audience of 45,000 -members of Alcoholics Anonymous as well as Al-Anon - gave her a standing ovation.         Mrs. Wilson wrote an autobiography, ''Lois Remembers,'' first published in 1979.         There are no immediate survivors. Funeral arrangements have not yet been set.       
        Cay M. Andersen, a faith healer and co-founder of the Community of Jesus, a residential religious community based in Orleans, Mass., died of heart failure in her sleep on Wednesday at her home in Orleans. She was 75 years old.         Cay M. Andersen, a faith healer and co-founder of the Community of Jesus, a residential religious community based in Orleans, Mass., died of heart failure in her sleep on Wednesday at her home in Orleans. She was 75 years old.         Mrs. Andersen, known in the community as Mother Cay, and Judy H. Sorensen, both lay members of the Episcopal Church, founded the community 30 years ago in an effort to bring about reconciliation among the various Christian denominations and to develop healing as a way of life.         The ecumenical community of 300 adults and children, as well as 500 nonresident members, includes among its residents 12 members of the clergy from five denominations.         The community also has become a focal point for religious music, in particular a movement to preserve the Gregorian chant, an ancient form of worship, in collaboration with Benedictine monks and nuns in France.         Earlier this year Mrs. Andersen and Mrs. Sorensen had an audience with Pope John Paul II in recognition of their spiritual work.         Mrs. Andersen was born in East Weymouth, Mass., and atttended the Vesper George Art School in Boston.         She is survived by her husband, John W. Andersen.

Ruth Harris Bunche, a former teacher and the widow of Ralph J. Bunche, the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former Under Secretary General at the United Nations, died of pancreatic cancer yesterday at her home in Kew Gardens, Queens. She was 82 years old.         Mrs. Bunche was active in many civic and community organizations over the years.

        Judith Charach Wyker, who as Judith Garden delighted generations of New Yorkers with her flower designs, died of cancer yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Judith Charach Wyker, who as Judith Garden delighted generations of New Yorkers with her flower designs, died of cancer yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.         In the 1940's, she opened a flower shop on East 57th Street under the name Judith Garden. Her arrangements were the opposite of the stiff, formal style of the day. She combined unusual flowers with natural materials, like twigs and branches, and often placed them in unconventional containers. She retired from the shop in 1970.         She is survived by her husband, Ben Wyker, and a brother, Bernard Charach of Fort Lee, N.J.       
        Mildred Johnstone, a patron of the arts who created abstract canvas needlepoint tapestries that toured colleges and art galleries, died Thursday at her home in Manhattan after a brief illness. She was 88 years old.         Mildred Johnstone, a patron of the arts who created abstract canvas needlepoint tapestries that toured colleges and art galleries, died Thursday at her home in Manhattan after a brief illness. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Johnstone, known to her friends as Milly, was the widow of William Harcourt Johnstone, vice president in charge of financial and legal matters for Bethlehem Steel. She traveled widely with her husband and developed two great interests: needlepoint and the Japanese tea ceremony.         In later years her abstract needlepoint tapestries of the 1940's and 1950's, depicting surreal human and mythical figures, gave way to calligraphy-based designs. Her work appeared in museums around the country.         In her 60's, Mrs. Johnstone became fascinated with the Japanese tea ceremony. She narrated an exhibit on the ceremony at the 1964 World's Fair in New York.         Her first marriage to Oliver W. Holton ended in divorce.         Mrs. Johnstone is survived by a grandson, Thomas Lee Holton, of Manhattan.       
        Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         The reports said Ms. Onassis had been staying with childhood friends at an exclusive country club outside the Argentine capital. Her father, Aristotle Onassis, laid the foundation of his self-made fortune in shipping, real estate and high finance in Argentina and was a dual citizen of that country and Greece.         Mr. Onassis died in 1975 in France and his daughter and only surviving child was left in charge of the Onassis Group, with assets then variously estimated at $500 million to $1 billion, most of it in shipping. Forbes magazine, citing a worldwide slump in that industry, reported in 1987 that the figure probably had shrunk to $250 million or less.         Mr. Onassis' two major shipping companies were Springfield Shipping of New York City and Olympic Maritime of Monte Carlo.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Onassis gave up her American citizenship. She learned about business and finance in the New York offices of her father, beginning as a 20-year-old secretary. After his death, she gradually strengthened her hold over the Onassis Group, although some questions remained in the late 1970's as to just how much control she exerted and how much she left to day-to-day managers.         One of the world's richest women, Miss Onassis was no stranger to personal misfortune. There was the death of her only brother, Alexander, in a private-plane crash in 1973. She herself went through four much-publicized marriages and divorces. Churchill and Callas         The social life on ''Ari'' Onassis' 325-foot yacht, named Christina, was legendary and included the likes of Winston Churchill and the soprano Maria Callas. In fact, Mr. Onassis was romantically linked with Miss Callas when his own marriage to the former Athina (Tina) Livanos, another shipping heiress, broke up in 1959.         Tina Onassis eventually was remarried to her former husband's arch rival, Stavros Niarchos. And Ari Onassis, in 1968, married Mrs. Kennedy, the widow of President John F. Kennedy, whom he first met in 1963.         Christina Onassis defied her father in 1971 by marrying Joseph Bolker, a millionaire home builder and real-estate man, A divorced father of four, he was 27 years her senior and the union broke up within months, apparently at the insistence of her father.         Her next marriage, strongly promoted by her father, took place shortly after his death. Her second husband was Alexander Andreadis, a Greek shipping and banking heir. It, too, lasted only 14 months.         Miss Onassis' third marriage, in Moscow in 1978 to Sergei Kauzov, a Soviet shipping agent, again made front-page headlines, as did her flight to Greece a few days later and their separation in 1979. Marries Frenchman         She married a French businessman, Thierry Roussel, in 1984 and had a daughter with him, Athina, the following January. They filed for divorce eight months later.         Ms. Onassis was said to have never felt close to her stepmother. Friends in Athens said Mr. Onassis was thinking of divorcing the former Mrs. Kennedy at the time of his death and had intended to limit a divorce settlement to $3 million rather than the $250,000 a year provided in his will.         The reports of a forthcoming divorce were denied by Christina, who in 1977 was said to have made a much more generous multi-million settlement in return for which Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis dropped all further claims against the estate.       
        Esther Gottlieb, retired dean of girls at the Fashion Industries High School in New York and the widow of Adolph Gottlieb, the Abstract Expressionist painter, died of cerebral meningitis on Monday. She was 81 years old and lived in New York City and East Hampton, L.I.         Esther Gottlieb, retired dean of girls at the Fashion Industries High School in New York and the widow of Adolph Gottlieb, the Abstract Expressionist painter, died of cerebral meningitis on Monday. She was 81 years old and lived in New York City and East Hampton, L.I.         Mrs. Gottlieb was the founder and president of the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation, set up in 1976 according to provisions in her husband's will to assist older artists in need. The foundation, with assets of some $6 million derived from the sale of Mr. Gottlieb's works, gives 10 grants a year and maintains an emergency assistance program. The foundation will continue, its director, Sanford Hirsch, said.         Mrs. Gottlieb was born in Danbury, Conn., on April 15, 1907. She came to New York in 1924, studied art at Pratt Institute and became a painter, working in the garment industry to support herself. In 1932 she married Mr. Gottlieb, and began teaching tailoring skills at the Cental Needle Trades High School - now Fashion Industries High School. She supported her husband financially, eventually giving up her own painting to work as his studio assistant. She retired in 1960. Mr. Gottlieb died in 1974.         Mrs. Gottlieb is survived by two sisters, Frances Dick and Gladys Sikora, both of New York City, and six nieces and nephews.         A funeral service will be held today at 10:30 A.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.

        Irmgard Seefried, a German-born Austrian soprano who gained great success in the postwar years in operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss, died of cancer yesterday in Vienna. She was 69 years old.         Irmgard Seefried, a German-born Austrian soprano who gained great success in the postwar years in operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss, died of cancer yesterday in Vienna. She was 69 years old.         Though Miss Seefried spent most of her career with the Vienna State Opera, she sang frequently at Covent Garden in London, at La Scala in Milan and at music festivals in Salzburg, Edinburgh, Lucerne and elsewhere. She was also a respected recital and concert singer. She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in November 1953, as Susanna in Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro'' - one of her signature roles.         Miss Seefried was born on Oct. 9, 1919, in Kongetried, a small town in Bavaria. Her father started to give her music lessons when she was a small child, and at the age of 11 she sang the role of Gretel in a performance of Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel.'' She studied at the Augsburg Conservatory, and in 1939 joined the Aachen Opera at the invitation of Herbert von Karajan.         She made her Vienna State Opera debut in 1943, as Eva in Wagner's ''Meistersinger,'' and remained with the company until her retirement in 1980.         Miss Seefried made several concert tours of Europe, the United States and the Far East in the 1950's. In 1953, she and her husband, the violinist Wolfgang Schneiderhan, did a world concert tour together. 'Authority of Style'         From the start of her career, Miss Seefried was praised for the clarity of her voice and her appealing stage presence. Reviewing her Metropolitan Opera debut, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times, ''The shining light of this performance was Miss Seefried, whose beautiful voice and brilliancy and authority of style won her instant recognition.''         During several seasons in the 1950's, she appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony orchestra under the direction of Bruno Walter. Reviewing her 1956 performance of ''Et Incarnatus Est'' from the Mozart Mass in C minor, Howard Taubman said in The Times: ''The top of her soprano may not have the brilliance of some other singers, but she is an artist. She sang with warmth and tenderness and with a richness of understanding.''         Though her repertory came to include works by Hindemith, Poulenc, Berg and other modern composers, she was best known for her work in operas by Mozart, including Fiordiligi in ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' and Zerlina in ''Don Giovanni,'' and by Strauss, including Octavian in ''Der Rosenkavalier'' and the Composer in ''Ariadne auf Naxos.'' She also sang Marzelline in Beethoven's ''Fidelio.''         Miss Seefried recorded most of her operatic repertory and several albums of lieder.         She is survived by her husband and two daughters.

        Marian P. Welch, the editor of two publications for the John Birch Society, which was founded by her late husband, died Tuesday at Glover Memorial Hospital. She was 88 years old.         Marian P. Welch, the editor of two publications for the John Birch Society, which was founded by her late husband, died Tuesday at Glover Memorial Hospital. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Welch, who graduated from Wellesley College in 1922, was editor of the society's weekly newspapers, The New American and Review of the News.         The society was founded in 1958 by 12 men, including her husband, Robert, and named after a young American missionary who was killed in China in 1954. The group has its headquarters in Belmont, a Boston suburb, where the Welches lived for 40 years. Robert Welch died in 1985.         The John Birch Society first gained national attention in the 1950's when it accused former President Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles of being implicated in a Communist plot to take over the United States Government.         Correction:  December 4, 1988, Sunday, Late City Final Edition         An obituary by The Associated Press in some copies last Sunday about Marian P. Welch, editor of two John Birch Society publications, described the namesake of the society incorrectly. Capt. John Birch, a missionary in China before World War II, served in the war as an intelligence officer. He was killed by Chinese Communists on Aug. 25, 1945, 10 days after V-J Day.       
        Gwendolyn Cafritz, known as one of Washington's leading hostesses for several decades, died of cancer Tuesday at her home. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, known as one of Washington's leading hostesses for several decades, died of cancer Tuesday at her home. She was 78 years old.         Mrs. Cafritz gave elegant and lavish parties from the end of World War II until the early 1970s, when failing health curtailed her social schedule.         Her husband, Morris Cafritz, a millionare Washington real estate developer and businessman, died in 1964. After his death, she became president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, which gave about $6 million a year to local organizations devoted to the arts, community service, health and education.         The Cafritz party guests ranged from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who once danced on a transparent dance floor lighted from below, to Supreme Court justices. President Harry Truman, however, favored Mrs. Cafritz's competitor, Perle Mesta.         Mrs. Cafritz, born in Budapest, Hungary, moved to Washington in the 1920's. In June 1986 she gave her last large party, which was described as a ''trip back into Washington social history.''         In 1969, four masked men broke into her mansion, bound and gagged Mrs. Cafritz and others, and escaped with more than $1 million in furs and jewelry.

        Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         The widow of Morris Cafritz, a wealthy real estate entrepreneur, Mrs. Cafritz glittered on the capital's social scene in the 1950's and 1960's. As president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, she oversaw annual contributions of about $6 million to local community and arts organizations.         Mrs. Cafritz combined wealth, effervescence and numerous contacts in business and government into a potent concoction of lavish entertainments that, in Washington, are as much a part of political life as sessions of Congress.         Initially, she competed with Pearl Mesta as Washington's premier hostess, the two vying to snare the most prominent guests. After Mrs. Mesta was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949, Mrs. Cafritz undertook her campaign in earnest. A four-page account in Life magazine depicted her favorite summer soiree - one or two hundred guests, in evening dress, gathered for mint juleps and steaks on the barbecue in her backyard overlooking all of Washington.         She gave dozens of parties every year in her 57-room, white brick mansion on a seven-acre hilltop that included a basement night club with illuminated dance floor, a gym and an Olympic-size swimming pool. Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, Ambassadors, movie stars, Supreme Court Justices and heads of state played happily there over four administrations.         Born in Budapest, Mrs. Cafritz was the daughter of a Hungarian father and an American mother. She was a graduate of the University of Budapest. In the 1920's the family moved to Washington.         She met her husband in 1928 and they were married the next year. He died in 1964. In the early 1970's Mrs. Cafritz was forced to withdraw from the social scene because of poor health.         Surviving are three sons, Calvin, Carter and Conrad, all of Washington, and 13 grandchildren.

Ms. Sherover-Marcuse, the widow of the Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse, was a co-director of New Bridges, a group formed in 1985 to promote multicultural awareness among teen-agers.

        Melanie Kahane, an interior designer whose bold use of color created a new look for homes, died of lung cancer Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old. Miss Kahane, the widow of Ben Grauer, a broadcaster for NBC News, caught the public's eye in 1946, when she designed one of the first colored kitchen appliances, a shiny red stove.         Melanie Kahane, an interior designer whose bold use of color created a new look for homes, died of lung cancer Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old. Miss Kahane, the widow of Ben Grauer, a broadcaster for NBC News, caught the public's eye in 1946, when she designed one of the first colored kitchen appliances, a shiny red stove. In 1949, her design for a black-and-white French provincial bedroom accented with pumpkin-colored furniture became one of the most photographed interiors in magazines and books.         ''She was a great inspiration when I was a student in the 50's,'' said Mario Buatta, an interior designer in Manhattan. ''I remember rooms in pink and orange. It was very distinctive. Her work had guts.''         Miss Kahane (pronounced ka-HAIN) was born in Manhattan. She graduated from the Parsons School of Design and worked as an illustrator of women's clothing. In 1939, she went into business as an interior designer. 'The Ability to Visualize'         She designed light bulbs, hotels, studio apartments and theaters. A client, Anne Windfohr Marion, is the second generation of her family to be a client. ''She did mother's house when I was 15,'' said Mrs. Marion, whose husband, John, is chairman of Sotheby's North America. ''She was very easy to work with, a vital, energetic person.''         Miss Kahane had the ability to charm clients while sticking firmly to her finely honed esthetic of glamour and tasteful pizzazz. ''The decorator has the ability to visualize a finished room before it is begun,'' she said, ''and the strength of character not to deviate from a plan, no matter what the opinion of loving friends and relatives.''         After she married, Miss Kahane transformed her dining room into a library for Mr. Grauer's book collection. Then she moved the dining table back in, creating another much-photographed interior. The couple appeared together on an NBC Radio program, ''Decorating Wavelengths,'' which offered news and advice.         Miss Kahane produced a television documentary on contemporary Scandinavian design. She was on the design committee for the United States Pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels. In 1959, Miss Kahane traveled to the Soviet Union for NBC to record women's views. Under the aegis of the State Department, she conducted symposiums on textiles in Southeast Asian countries. Book for Children         Miss Kahane was a fellow and former treasurer of the American Institute of Interior Designers, a former president of the Decorators Club and an honorary life member of the American Society of Interior Designers.         She wrote a book for children, ''There's a Decorator in Your Doll House,'' published by Atheneum in 1968. In 1985, she was inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame.         Miss Kahane had a wit that was often as sharp as her clothing. In an interview in which she revealed that much of the art in her home had been bought by her husband without consultation, she observed, ''When a man's wife is a decorator, he frequently gets the compulsion to assert himself.''         Her recipe for a happy marriage included two sinks in the bathroom. ''A great meeting place,'' she noted.         Surviving are her daughter, Joan Ebenstein Porter of Pipersville, Pa., and two grandchildren. A memorial will be held Jan. 19 at 10:30 A.M. at the David M. Schwartz Center at Parsons, 560 Seventh Avenue at 40th Street.

She was killed Wednesday in an auto crash near Seagrave in central England, her family said.         In 1952, she and her second husband, Greville Mee, went to live in Rio de Janeiro. She had recently returned to Britain to open an exhibition of her paintings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in west London.         Mrs. Mee was also in Britain for the publication last month of her diaries, ''In Search of the Flowers of the Amazon Forests,'' and a lecture tour.         Mrs. Mee was born near London and studied art as a child.         She made the first of her 15 Amazon expeditions in 1956 to observe, collect and paint flowers. Her last trip there was in May when she traveled to the Igapo forest on Brazil's Rio Negro to paint the rare, night-blooming Amazonian moonflower.         ''As I stood there with the dim outline of the forest all around, I was spellbound, '' she wrote in her diaries. ''Then the first petal began to move and then another as the flower burst into life,''         Mrs. Mee became a leader in the campaign to conserve the rain forests and protect the forest Indians.         The recently established Margaret Mee Amazon Trust provides scholarships to help Brazilian botanists study in Britain.         She is survived by her husband.

Dorothy de Rothschild, a philanthropist, died Saturday at her home in London after a brief illness. She was 93 years old.         Mrs. de Rothschild and her husband, James A. de Rothschild, were longtime supporters of Israel, active in pressing the British Government for what became known as the Balfour Declaration, the 1917 commitment to work toward a Jewish homeland in British-administered Palestine.         When Mr. de Rothschild died in 1957, he bequeathed to Israel the money for a new building for the national Parliament, which Mrs. de Rothschild dedicated in 1966. Toward the end of her life she gave Israel a new Supreme Court building.         Born Dorothy Pinto in London, she married Mr. de Rothschild in 1912.         After her husband's death, their home at Waddesdon Manor, a 6,000-acre estate in Buckinghamshire, was left to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, along with a considerable art collection.
