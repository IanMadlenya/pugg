         Edith Bry, an artist who was best known for her work in fused glass, died on Jan. 19 at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         Miss Bry's glass pieces were installed at the Central Synagogue and the Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan, and at the Second Reformed Church in Tarrytown, N.Y. In a 75-year career that began in a New York batik studio when she was 15 years old, Miss Bry also produced oil paintings, enamels, mosaics, lithographs, woodcuts and silkscreen prints.         Miss Bry was born and brought up in St. Louis. She studied at the Art Students' League and with Guy Pene du Bois, and in the 1950's she worked with the painter Abraham Rattner. Her oils and lithographs are in the collections of several museums and institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of the City of New York, the New-York Historical Society, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and Carnegie Hall. She also gave lectures and demonstrations to the public at Wave Hill, the National Academy of Design and the Donnell Public Library. In 1983, a retrospective exhibition of her work was presented at the Loeb Student Center at New York University.         In 1929 Miss Bry and her husband, Maurice Shevelson Benjamin, a founder of the brokerage firm Benjamin, Hill & Company, commissioned the noted architect Ely Jacques Kahn to design an Art Deco apartment for them in the Beresford building on Central Park West. The apartment, which became the subject of considerable attention in recent years when architectural magazines proclaimed it one of the city's most intact relics of the Art Deco period, includes woodcut panels Miss Bry executed with Kahn.         Mr. Benjamin died in 1984. Miss Bry is survived by her son, Dr. Bry Benjamin of Manhattan, two grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
         When Carol Perkins sat down in the New York Times cafeteria last week, she pulled down her lower lip and exposed two big white blisters. "They're not herpes," she announced, which certainly turned a lot of heads. But that is something she expects.         Ms. Perkins is a model with the Eileen Ford Agency, and her face -- not to mention the rest of her -- is familiar to anyone who shops through the Victoria's Secret catalogue or reads Vogue. Recently, she has been moonlighting at "Penn and Teller: The Refrigerator Tour," playing at the Eugene O'Neill Theater, which is where the blisters come in. Ms. Perkins works with Penn and Teller, the comic magic team, who bill themselves as "a couple of eccentric guys who've learned to do a few cool things," as a fire-eater.         And if the show's opening act is for the children -- a giant refrigerator is dropped directly on top of the two stars -- then the bit called "Burnin' Luv" is the adults' payoff. Ms. Perkins and Penn Jillette perform a hilarious parody of sex by eating fire, after which Ms. Perkins, wearing an impossibly low-cut dress, strikes a match and lights a cigarette directly from Mr. Jillette's mouth.  An Unmodel-like Model         That someone whose face is her livelihood should take such risks is the height of perversity. But looks aside, Ms. Perkins seems nothing like most models. During the entire lunch she never once mentioned the size of her pores, or how many glasses of water she drank before noon, and she told her age, 33, without hesitation. "Why not?" she asked. "I look pretty good for 33."         She said she loved cafeteria food, and had never had a weight problem. And though she skipped the steam table meat, she eagerly ate up a plate of mashed turnips and peas, which she covered in butter, and followed it with a roll, coffee and a cigarette.         She does dress like a model, perfectly pulled together in a dark turquoise Harris tweed jacket, cashmere sweater, Hermes scarf, corduroy pants and a string of pearls. Then she admitted that she bought the jacket in a thrift shop, on what she called a "junkin' " spree.         Since she learned to eat fire last fall, Ms. Perkins said, she has been "burnt really bad." She pointed to her chin, which looked fine. But she insistently rubbed off her makeup, until the maroon shadow of a burn finally appeared.  A Well-Timed Ignition         Isn't this just about the most awful thing that could happen to her         face?         Her fortune? Apparently not. "I'm not real fussy about things like breaking a nail or getting a wrinkle." Yes, but isn't this is a little more serious? "I couldn't work when I got burned," she said, "but I had taken those two weeks off anyway for rehearsal. It took a couple of weeks for the big old scab to fall off."         Mr. Jillette, who is the tall one, with the ponytail, is Ms. Perkins's partner in "Burnin' Luv." He said in a phone interview: "Her chances of being disfigured and landing in the hospital are slim. Eating fire is safer than walking on the street. She got a nickel-sized blister on her chin, that's all."         Isn't she giving Eileen Ford an ulcer? "Not at all," Ms. Perkins said. "She told me she's never had a model go to Broadway before."'         Also, Ms. Perkins said, there is no insurance policy for her face. She said she didn't need one. "When you're learning to eat fire you're fearful and respectful," she said. "But I got confident and kind of cocky about it, and I just wasn't paying attention. I'm back on guard again."         How did she ever get mixed up in all of this? A longtime fan of Penn and Teller, she arranged an introduction through a friend about a year ago. Last fall, when the duo was rehearsing for an NBC television special, Mr. Jillette called her and asked if she could help find a replacement for Isabella Rossellini, for whom he had written the bit, who had just been cast in a movie. They needed someone famous, Ms. Perkins said, to satisfy the network.         "I suggested Lauren Hutton, who's pretty gutsy, Joan Severance and Carrie Fisher," she said. "I called some girls for him but none came through. Then about a week before the special taped they got into a jam. Penn called me and said: 'We're really on our knees. Can you learn to eat fire so you can show whoever it is we get? You can be the understudy.' And I thought, what a cool thing. I live around the corner from the rehearsal place, so I threw on my jeans and left. I was terrified."         But she turned out to be a quick study, and when no one better known was willing to risk her face, she got the job. "She was our absolute last choice," said Mr. Jillette. "She really likes fire eating, which I don't. When she was learning we would scream at her not to really get comfortable, just to look comfortable."         As the act progressed, the two got comfortable with each other as well, and soon found themselves in the gossip columns. What is it like to kiss after eating fire? "What happens is you burp up gasoline," Ms. Perkins said, laughing. "It's pretty gross." How New York Is Unlike Sarasota         But still exciting for a woman who grew up Sarasota, Fla., where the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus spent its winters and was home to the Ringling Brothers Museum and Clown College. As a child, Ms. Perkins said, she performed in the children's Sailor Circus, along with Emmett Kelly's daughter and a daughter of one of the Flying Wallendas. She specialized in tumbling and riding the unicycle.         Since she didn't have to run away to join the circus, she graduated from high school a year early and ran away from it, to New York at the age of 16: "It seemed so alive compared to the resort-town feel in Sarasota, which catered to vacation living. I loved the chaos in New York, the subways and the dirt. I hung out with a musician boyfriend and modeled for a minute at Wilhelmina. But I wasn't mentally prepared for it, until a few years later."         Ms. Perkins says she has a one-year commitment to the Penn and Teller show, which has been extended on Broadway indefinitely. Then, she said, she plans to split her time between New York and Sarasota, where she wants to establish a women's resource center similar to Hope for Housing in New York, which teaches skills to women on welfare, in rehabilitation programs and recently released from prison. She said her family still lives in Sarasota, where her father is a school principal, and her mother is a painter.         But for now, she is still a model and a fire-eater. At a recent weekend performance full of children, a number of them lined up outside after the show to get the stars' autographs. When Ms. Perkins was spotted near the stage door, a small group of prepubescent boys shyly lined up in front of her, programs in hand. Though she had changed out of her costume, the dress she was wearing was equally low cut. And judging from the looks of rapture on those faces as she bent over to sign the Playbills, the fascination with the falling refrigerator was a thing of the past.         She's getting a kick out of it, too. "It's a once in a lifetime opportunity," she said. "If I had tried to plot it out this way it couldn't have happened. And it really is the perfect part-time job. Because I eat fire a lot better than I type."       
         Lisa Taylor, director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design from 1969 to 1987, died on Friday in a hospital in Nassau, the Bahamas, said David McFadden, the museum's curator of decorative arts. She was 58 years old and lived in Naples, Fla.         Mr. McFadden said she died of liver cancer.         The museum's current director, Dianne Pilgrim, said through a spokesman that Mrs. Taylor "had a passionate belief in the importance of design and brought that passion and excitement to the museum."         The museum, in the former Andrew Carnegie mansion at 2 East 91st Street, is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It closed in 1963 but reopened in 1976, after Mrs. Taylor played a major role in raising funds to install it in the renovated mansion.         Grace Glueck, The New York Times critic, wrote in 1976, "The museum's far-reaching collection covers 3,000 years of artistic production, but it is also very much in touch with contemporary concerns, such as urban planning and the environment." 'Wallpaper to Bird Cages'         What is now the Cooper-Hewitt Museum originated as a part of Cooper Union, which had housed it since 1897. In the 1960's, financial problems led Cooper Union to end its ties with the museum, which by then was what Paul Goldberger, The Times critic, called "one of the world's finest storehouses of objects of design and the decorative arts -- with everything from collections of wallpaper to bird cages."         In 1969, the secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, named her as head of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. In 1972 the Carnegie Corporation donated the mansion, and over the next four years Mrs. Taylor and her staff managed to obtain more than $6 million from private individuals, corporations and foundations.         It was Mrs. Taylor who had the idea for the annual Museum Mile open house and street fair involving museums along upper Fifth Avenue. It was first held in 1979, and 10 museums participated last year.         In 1976, Mrs. Taylor said, "I think we'll be a great success, because we have a superb collection and people are becoming more and more aware of how design relates to the quality of life. And besides, there's a feeling of love for us because we've made it." Edited Design Series         Mr. McFadden said Mrs. Taylor retired in 1987 for reasons of health and to work on the final volumes in a series of books she edited. The series, titled "Immovable Objects," comprises six books of essays by various authorities on the impact of design on daily life. The volumes have separate topics ranging from urban open spaces to the subways.         Mrs. Taylor was born on Jan. 8, 1933, in New York, the daughter of Theo von Bergen-Maier, an architect, and the former Martina Weincerl, a painter.         She studied at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington and at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities.         She was on the staff of the President's Fine Arts Commission in Washington from 1958 to 1962 and membership director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington from 1962 to 1966. She then joined the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, where she helped to devise a highly successful Smithsonian educational program before being named to head the Cooper Union Museum.         She was awarded honorary doctorates by the Parsons School of Design and Cooper Union.         She is survived by her second husband, Bertrand L. Taylor 3d, who is an investor; their daughter, Lauren, and their son, Lindsay, all of Naples, Fla.

         Letitia Grierson, an educator and freelance editor, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia, said her son, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of the Bronx.         Mrs. Grierson, who was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, came to the United States in the early 1930's and taught English at colleges and private schools in the metropolitan area. After her retirement in 1965, she became a free-lance editor and reviewed books for newspapers.         Her marriage to Helmut Lehmann-Haupt ended in divorce in 1947.         In addition to her son Christopher, book critic for The New York Times, she is survived by two other sons, Carl, a graphic artist and painter, and Alexander, a sound engineer, both of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Jay Hollins, an author who wrote under the name Elizabeth Etnier, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hollins wrote "On Gilbert Head," a critically praised journal of her life in the 1930's with her first husband, the painter Stephen Etnier, on an island in Maine.         The marriage ended in divorce, and in 1948 she married Harry B. Hollins. She published short stories and a novella, and in 1966 she edited "Peace Is Possible: A Reader on World Order." Achieving world peace was a cause for which she worked closely with Mr. Hollins, who died in March.         She was born in New York and graduated from Barnard College.         She is survived by two daughters, Stephanie Doane and Victoria Villamil; a stepson, Harry Hollins; four stepdaughters, Elizabeth Aldrich, Lilias Outerbridge, Evelina Kats and Angelica Braestrup; a brother, Peter Jay; three sisters, Sybil Waldron, Augusta Huffman and Katharine Bacon, and four grandchildren.         A memorial service is to be held at Christ and St. Stephen's Church, 120 West 69th Street, at 4 P.M. on Thursday.       
         Candy Jernigan, a painter, sculptor and set designer, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She was 39 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of liver cancer, said a friend, Jed Wheeler.         Ms. Jernigan was known for witty, vivid collagist work that was as much social commentary as art. It incorporated maps, landscapes, rocks and found objects, and it often took the form of one-of-a-kind printed books that included short autobiographical writings. Her work has been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Albright-Knox Museum in Buffalo, the Bronx Museum and the Boston Children's Museum, as well as several galleries in New York City. Her theater work included sets for John Moran's multi-media opera "The Manson Family" and collaborations with XXY Dance/Music, a multi-media dance company.         Ms. Jernigan is survived by her husband, the composer Philip Glass, a stepdaughter, Juliet, and a stepson, Zachary, all of Manhattan; her mother, Pauline Bauer of Jupiter, Fla., and a sister, Audrey Hart of Key West, Fla.         A memorial service will be held at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street, on Friday at 1 P.M.       
         Jane Piper, a prominent Philadelphia painter, died on Thursday at her home in the Center City section of the city. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, a friend of the family said.         Ms. Piper's works were primarily still lifes and are in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the National Academy of Design.         In an article in Art in America magazine, the critic Walter Thompson described her paintings as "a panoply of forms in which the rhythms and interrupting accents have the intricacy of a complex musical score."         Ms. Piper briefly attended the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts and studied with Arthur B. Carles, a former student of Henri Matisse. At her death, she was still painting.         Ms. Piper is survived by her husband, E. Digby Baltzell, a professor emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and the man who coined the term WASP; two daughters, Eve Baltzell of Boston and Jan C. Baltzell of Philadelphia, and two sisters, Helen Piper Cresswell and Eleanor Piper De La Cour, both of Bryn Mawr, Pa.

         Bena Frank Mayer, a painter best known for her portraits, died on Thursday at the St. Luke's division of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack, her lawyer, Martin Bressler, said.         Mrs. Mayer exhibited in many group shows with the National Association of Women Artists, winning several of its awards, and was a past president of the New York Society of Women Artists.         She was the widow of Ralph Mayer, also a painter and an expert in the field of artists' materials and techniques, who died in 1979. Twenty years earlier, with the support of the A.&P. heir Huntington Hartford, the couple had founded the nonprofit Artists Technical Research Institute, whose aim was to establish reliable scientific data on artists' materials. Mrs. Mayer also helped her husband research and edit several reference books he wrote for artists, including "The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques," first published in 1940 and now considered a classic in the field.         In 1990 she was instrumental in establishing the Ralph Mayer Learning Center, successor to the Artists Technical Research Institute, at the Yale University School of Art. The center supports research and writing on the use of materials and the study of artists' techniques. A show of Mrs. Mayer's landscapes and portraits was held at Yale in connection with the opening of the institute in September 1990.         Mrs. Mayer was born in Norfolk, Va., in 1898, spent her early years in Wyoming, and came to New York in 1914. She studied at the Cooper Union and the Arts Students League, and also privately with the painter Stuart Davis. She married Mr. Mayer in 1927.         There are no immediate survivors. A funeral service is to be held today at 9:30 A.M. at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street, Manhattan.       
         Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid, great-aunt of King Hussein of Jordan and an artist best known as an abstract painter of the Paris School in the 1950's and 60's, died on Thursday after a short illness. She was 89 years old.         During an artistic career that spanned more than 60 years, the princess blended elements of Islamic and Byzantine art with abstract and other influences from the West. She had exhibitions in major galleries in Paris, London and New York City.         The princess was born in 1901 in Istanbul to a prominent Ottoman family that included many artists. She began painting at the age of 14 and was one of the first women to attend the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul.         In 1934 she married King Hussein's great-uncle Prince Zeid el Hussein, a diplomat serving as a minister plenipotentiary in Turkey for his brother King Faisal I of Iraq. He died in 1970.         She is survived by a son, Prince Raad bin Zeid, and two children from a previous marriage: another son, Nejad Devrim of Warsaw, a painter, and a daughter, Sirin Devrim Trainer of New York City, an actress.       
         Anne Marie Jauss, an author of books for children and an illustrator, died on Friday at a nursing home in Milford, N.J. She was 89 years old.         She died of natural causes, said a friend, Florence Stephens.         Ms. Jauss was born in Munich, Germany, and studied at the state art school in Berlin. She left Germany in 1942 and moved to Lisbon, making a living as a painter, an illustrator and a pottery-maker. In 1946, she moved to the United States and began a career as a writer of children's books.         Her best-known book is "Under a Green Roof" which was published in 1960 by J.B. Lippincott of Philadelphia and New York in 1960.         She is survived by one nephew.       
         Mary S. Painter Garin, an American economist who was an important innovator in the use of statistical techniques during and immediately after World War II, died Monday in Toulon, France, near her home in Sollies-Toucas. She was 71 years old.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said a niece, Sarah Wells.         Miss Painter, as she was known professionally, was one of a small group of economists who made national-income analysis a powerful tool for government and military policy-making from World War II on. She served in the Marshall Plan and at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris,         A native of Minneapolis, Miss Painter graduated from Swarthmore College in 1942 with high honors and went directly to the Board of Economic Warfare and then to the Office of Strategic Services. There she pioneered the development of original techniques for analyzing Nazi Germany's military abilities. She devised a statistical model for estimating the size of the German submarine fleet in the North Atlantic, which after the war, was found to have been startlingly accurate. Calculated Past G.N.P.         After the war, she served at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Her article "Estimates of Gross National Product, 1919 Through 1928," published in the Federal Reserve bulletin in September 1945, used new Commerce Department concepts to calculate the gross national product for the 10 years after World War I.         In 1948, Miss Painter went to Paris in the first wave of economists who set up the European headquarters of the Marshall Plan. She was in charge of analyzing the French and German economies at the United States Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other regional organizations until 1960. She returned to the United States for two years, working on problems of arms control and disarmament with Prof. Emile Benoit at Columbia University.         In 1962, she returned to Paris to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the successor to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, originally established to administer Marshall Plan aid to Europe.         Miss Painter was also known as a remarkable cook. In 1969, she married Georges Garin, one of the outstanding chefs of France, who was the proprietor of Chez Garin, a restaurant on the Left Bank.  Work in Restaurants         When Miss Painter retired as an economist from O.E.C.D., she became, in the best French tradition of restaurateur's wives, la Patronne of Chez Garin, presiding over its cash register.         The Garins closed the restaurant in 1973 and established a new one, Le Lingousto, at Sollies-Toucas. Mr. Garin died in 1979, and Miss Painter lived there the rest of her life.         She was a close friend and early supporter of the author James Baldwin, and his book "Another Country" is dedicated to her.         She is survived by her sister, Charlotte Morse of Minneapolis, five nieces and three nephews.       
         Ethel Halsey Blum, a painter, water colorist and former journalist, died on Wednesday at her home in Lakeville, Conn. She was 90 years old.         She died of pneumonia, her family said.         Mrs. Blum studied at the Art Students League and the Brooklyn Academy and had her work shown in New York and New England. Among her subjects were the land, sea and animals of Long Island, Maine, Connecticut and the Bahamas, places where she and her husband lived and vacationed.         She was a graduate of Wellesley College and had worked as a reporter in New Orleans, in France for The Paris Herald and in New York for The Associated Press.         Mrs. Blum was a past governor and president of the Cosmopolitan Club of New York, a founder of the Brooklyn Committee for Planned Parenthood and a former president of the Brooklyn Juvenile Guidance Center.         In Bal Harbor, Me., she was a trustee of the Mount Desert Island Hospital, a founder and former vice president of the Mount Desert Island Highway Safety Council and a trustee of the Mount Desert Biological Laboratory.         Mrs. Blum is survived by her husband, Robert E.; a son, John R. H., and a daughter, Alice B. Yoakum, both of Lakeville; a brother, Donald Halsey of New Orleans; 10 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Minna Citron, a painter and printmaker best known for her Social Realist images of New York City, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 95 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a long illness, said her granddaughter Christiane Citron of Denver.         Mrs. Citron, whose maiden name was Wright, was born in Newark on Oct. 15, 1896, and grew up in Brooklyn. She began to study art as a diversion in the 1920's when she was living in Brooklyn, married and the mother of two sons. By 1928, she was studying at the Art Students League with John Sloan and Kenneth Hayes Miller, whose satirical depictions of city life influenced her own style. She had her first solo exhibition in 1930 at the New School for Social Research.         By 1934, she was divorced and working in a studio on Union Square. She soon became associated with a loosely knit group of Realist painters known as the 14th Street school, who included Moses and Raphael Soyer and Isabel Bishop. In the late 1930's she taught art and painted murals for the Works Progress Administration. In the early 1940's, she changed to abstraction, which remained her primary style for the rest of her life.         Mrs. Citron had many exhibitions, both in the United States and abroad; her most recent show in New York City was held last year at the Susan Teller Gallery in SoHo. Her work is represented in many museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, and the National Museum of American Art and the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.         She is survived by her sons, Casper, of Manhattan a radio and television commentator, and Tom, of Short Hills., N.J.; seven grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Greta Kempton, a painter whose portrait of President Harry S. Truman hangs in the White House, died on Monday at her home in New York City. She was 89 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Daisy Dickson of Norfolk, Va.         Miss Kempton, who was born in Vienna, started painting life-size portraits while still a child. She studied art in Vienna and, after her family moved to the United States in the early 1920's, at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League in New York City. By the mid-1930's, she was living in California and was well-established as a painter of commissioned portraits, with Hollywood studio heads like Louis B. Mayer and Adolf Zukor among her clients.         In the 1940's she painted portraits of several members of the Truman Administration and their families, which led to commissions for portraits of the President, his wife and daughter.         Miss Kempton's husband, A. M. McNamara, a lawyer and business executive, died several years ago.
