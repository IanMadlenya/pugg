         Susan Strasberg, who at 17 electrified Broadway with her luminous portrayal of the title role of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' and -- with highs and lows professional and private -- went on to a career onstage and in movies, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 and also had a home in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her stepmother, Anna Strasberg.         As the daughter of Lee Strasberg, the director of the Actors Studio, and the acting coach Paula Miller, Ms. Strasberg spent her childhood surrounded by celebrated figures of the American theater, people who were, she said, ''supremely talented, alive, sensitive, eccentric, and some were neurotic and miserable.''         When she made her Broadway debut as Anne Frank in 1955, she was unknown, except for her last name. She had appeared in an Off Broadway play and had acted in two films, ''The Cobweb'' and ''Picnic,'' that had not been released. And she had never studied acting with her father.         With a naturalness and an authority that belied her limited theatrical experience, she was an astonishing success in her first major role. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson characterized her as ''a slender, enchanting young lady with a heart-shaped face, a pair of burning eyes and the soul of an actress.''         Ms. Strasberg's father was among those surprised by her performance. He and his wife had tried to talk to her about the interpretation of the role, but then left her to work on her own and with her director, Garson Kanin. ''When we saw Susie in action  we were all amazed at her great sensitivity,'' Mr. Strasberg said at the time. ''I just don't know how she picked it all up. She's never had any formal training.''         Ms. Strasberg was born in Manhattan, and her birth announcement heralded her as ''a four-star hit.'' After working briefly as a model, she made her theatrical debut Off Broadway in ''Maya,'' and followed that with several roles on television, including ''Romeo and Juliet,'' live on the Kraft Television Theater.         She auditioned for the role of Anne Frank, but the producer Kermit Bloomgarden made no decision about casting and the show was postponed. When the play was rescheduled in 1955, Ms. Strasberg was in Hollywood acting in the film of William Inge's ''Picnic.'' Mr. Bloomgarden and Albert and Frances Hackett, the authors of the play ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' asked her to read for the role again.         ''Susan was so terrified at the thought of being rejected that she declined to read at all,'' Mr. Bloomgarden had said in an interview. ''Finally, with tears in her eyes, Susan did read the last, touching scene from play. Within 10 minutes, she knew the part was hers.''         The play was an enormous hit, running for two years and winning the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the New York Drama Critics award and Tony Award for best play. Within the year, she was a certified Broadway star, with her name above the title on the Cort Theater marquee.         In 1957 she starred with Richard Burton and Helen Hayes in Jean Anouilh's ''Time Remembered.'' The next year she was in the Actors Studio revival of Sean O'Casey's ''Shadow of a Gunman'' and then she toured with Franchot Tone in ''Caesar and Cleopatra.'' In 1963 she returned to Broadway in the title role of Franco Zeffirelli's production of ''The Lady of the Camellias.'' When her first two films were released, she was on her way to movie stardom, and was soon playing opposite Henry Fonda in ''Stage Struck.''         Within several years, her career had crested and her private life was in turmoil. In the early 1960's she  was using a wide variety of drugs. When she wrote her autobiography in 1980, it was titled ''Bittersweet,'' a word that seemed to sum up her life. Her marriage to the actor Christopher Jones had ended. Her daughter, Jennifer, was born with a congenital birth defect: Ms. Strasberg blamed herself even though there was no medical evidence linking the drugs and the daughter's disabilities.         A reason she wrote her book, she  said, was that her career was stalled: ''It become totally untenable to me that after acting for 25 years -- I've played Juliet, Cleopatra and Anne Frank -- there I was, sitting in Hollywood, just waiting for somebody to want me.'' Her films include ''Kapo,'' ''The Trip,'' ''Manitou,'' ''Delta Force'' and ''Prime Suspect.'' In the book, she criticized her father for being preoccupied with his acting classes and she criticized her mother for being overly supervisory about her daughter's work.         She was also close to some of her father's students, especially Marilyn Monroe, whom she wrote about in ''Bittersweet'' and in her 1992 book, ''Marilyn and Me, Sisters, Rivals and Friends.''         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms. Strasberg is survived by her brother, John, who lives in Paris and New York, and by two half-brothers.         Even as Ms. Strasberg's life spiraled, those who saw her in her Broadway debut remembered her as the image of Anne Frank. After that opening night performance, she entered Sardi's with her parents, followed by Ms. Monroe. Before the reviews were read, Mr. Tone offered a toast: ''Little Susan, you have been launched on a long and glittering career.''       
         Lucille Kallen, the lone woman in the raucous, celebrated and astonishingly untidy group of television writers behind Sid Caesar's ''Your Show of Shows,'' died on Monday at her home in Ardsley, N.Y. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Lise Engel.         ''Your Show of Shows,'' which starred Mr. Caesar and Imogene Coca, was broadcast live for 90 minutes on Saturday nights from 1950 to 1954 and is today revered as a classic of television's golden age. For writers, a job on the program was a coveted plum; many of Ms. Kallen's colleagues, including Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner and Neil Simon, would become show business luminaries in their own right.         The quick-witted, fast-talking gang of writers was so famous that it was memorialized repeatedly in popular culture, including the 1982 film ''My Favorite Year'' (remade as a Broadway musical in 1992) and Mr. Simon's play ''Laughter on the 23d Floor'' (1993). But Ms. Kallen, one of a tiny handful of women employed as television comedy writers in the 1950's, was curiously absent from these works: they featured instead a generic female character who was an amalgam of Ms. Kallen and Selma Diamond, a writer for ''Caesar's Hour,'' which succeeded ''Your Show of Shows.''         The two women were also conflated in the character of Sally Rogers, played by Rose Marie on ''The Dick Van Dyke Show.'' That program, created by Mr. Reiner, starred Mr. Van Dyke as a television comedy writer.         ''Lucille got lost a little bit,'' said Mel Tolkin, the head writer on ''Your Show of Shows.''  ''She was generally the least given credit because the other people are so loud and so famous.''         But if her co-workers barreled into posterity as hit playwrights, movie directors and 2,000-year-old men, Ms. Kallen was, in Mr. Reiner's words, ''a real writer'' -- the profession's most dignified accolade -- who possessed a finely honed ear for dialogue.         ''She was quite a talented girl, and she was cute as a button, too,'' Mr. Reiner, who also performed as Mr. Caesar's second banana on ''Your Show of Shows,'' said recently. ''And being the woman, she did give it the woman's touch.''         In addition, Ms. Kallen was the author of six novels, including the C. B. Greenfield mystery series.         Last year, Ms. Kallen unearthed in her attic a faded piece of paper that neatly encapsulated her craft. The paper contained notes for a sketch in which a wife (Ms. Coca) bemoaned the spark gone from her marriage to Mr. Caesar:         Wife: Where is the sense of adventure? Where is the fun? Where is the romance?         Husband: How do I know where you put things? I can't even find my shirt!         ''This was so typical of their exchanges that I could practically write it in my sleep,'' Ms. Kallen observed in an oral history videotaped last April for the Archive of American Television in Hollywood.         Lucille Kallen was born on May 28, 1922, in Los Angeles. At 3, she moved with her mother to Toronto after her parents separated; she was raised there by her grandparents after her mother's death seven years later. As a girl, she trained to become a concert pianist; as a teen-ager, she founded a theater troupe, for which she wrote songs and sketches.         At 16, Ms. Kallen moved to New York to study at the Juilliard School, but in the years that followed she had two epiphanies that pre-empted her classical-music career: one, her fingers were too short; two, she hated to practice.         She turned instead to writing, putting together a nightclub revue that included the young Martin Balsam. The act was spotted by the producer Max Liebman, who invited Ms. Kallen to hone her craft at Camp Tamiment, a Poconos resort renowned for its Saturday night shows. At Tamiment, she was teamed with Mr. Tolkin, who would become her longtime writing partner. She also met her future husband, Herbert Engel, who worked there as a soda jerk; they were married in 1952. Mr. Engel, a businessman, survives her, as do her daughter, of Manhattan; her son, Paul, of Oceanside, N.Y., and four grandchildren.         On the strength of their Tamiment sketches, Ms. Kallen and Mr. Tolkin were hired to write for a new television show produced by Mr. Liebman, ''The Admiral Broadway Review,'' which paired Mr. Caesar and Ms. Coca for the first time. Undeterred by the fact that she had never even seen a television program, Ms. Kallen signed on, dashing off sketches with Mr. Tolkin in a corner of the male dancers' dressing room. The program, broadcast simultaneously on NBC and the Dumont network from January to June of 1949, was the direct progenitor of ''Your Show of Shows,'' which made its debut on NBC the following year.         As Ms. Kallen recalled, she and her colleagues didn't simply write ''Your Show of Shows,'' they lived it, working seven days a week, 39 weeks a year at the program's offices in midtown Manhattan, producing a series of now-classic sketches, including movie parodies (''From Here to Obscurity''), opera sendups (''Galipacci'') and the weekly travails of the married couple Charles and Doris Hickenlooper for the live broadcast on Saturday night.         In their cramped domain, known as the Writers' Room, the air was blue with cigar smoke and invective and the decor was early fraternity house: dogeared sofa, discarded paper cups crunching underfoot, half-eaten sandwiches abandoned beneath piles of typescript, acoustical-tile ceiling stuck with pencils hurled there in moments of frustration, and widening pools of spilled coffee. ''I learned,'' Ms. Kallen wrote afterward, ''to wear dark skirts.''         As the men paced and the room erupted with jokes and argument, Ms. Kallen was a small, ordered island in a roiling sea, sitting calmly, her legs tucked under her, taking down the good stuff in pencil on a yellow legal pad as it hurtled by, all the while contributing her share. ''She was the only one who could write and talk at the same time,'' Mr. Caesar recalled recently. ''The rest of us were all crazy. It was all being made up at that moment: 'Put it in!'  'Take it out!'  'You've got to put it back!' So it was a very, very frustrating job.''         Most of the writers were extremely large. All of them were extremely loud. Ms. Kallen was 5 foot 1 and, when off duty, spoke with measured thoughtfulness.         ''I was torn between preserving my femininity and preserving my career,'' she later said. ''It was difficult to be forceful enough to get through.''         At one point, she resorted to standing on the sofa and waving a red scarf to command attention. It worked -- briefly.         When ''Your Show of Shows'' went off the air, Ms. Kallen turned down a job with its successor, ''Caesar's Hour'' (1954-57), to write for ''The Imogene Coca Show,'' which lasted only a single season. With Mr. Tolkin, she wrote a short-lived Broadway play, ''Maybe Tuesday'' (1958). In addition to writing five mysteries, she was the author of the novel ''Outside There, Somewhere,'' (1964), a comic, early feminist exploration of the competing demands of career and motherhood.         Reflecting on her Writers' Room days, Ms. Kallen was forthright about the condescension as well as the camaraderie she encountered there. ''At the time I felt it was one big happy family, but later I said, What an idiot!'' she remarked. ''There was a male phalanx, and then there was me. But when we were working, there was no difference.''       
         Indrani, a distinguished dancer who familiarized Americans with several styles of India's classical dance as a performer and teacher, died on Friday in Beekman Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Sukanya Wicks, said.         Indrani was an artist of international repute and often appeared before heads of state in her native India and abroad. But she also became a highly respected figure in the dance world of New York after her debut there in 1960. The hallmark of her dancing, a blend of dramatic vibrancy and technical refinement, carried over to her teaching at American colleges and festivals.         Although she had a home in New Delhi until recently, she spent most of the last two decades in the United States, where she toured extensively. In 1961, Indrani was the first dancer presented on a national tour by the Asia Society. She had been on the faculty of the Juilliard School since 1976.         ''Indrani was an exquisite dancer, a great teacher and a true rasika, in the largest spirit of that word, meaning a lover of the arts,'' Rachel Cooper of the Asia Society said yesterday. Ms. Cooper, associate director of the society's performing arts and public programs, also praised Indrani's role as a producer of concerts in New York by younger Indian dancers. She said the society had planned to give Indrani a lifetime achievement award. ''The event will now be a memorial as well,'' Ms. Cooper said.         Unlike many Indian dancers of her generation, Indrani did not specialize in a single school of classical dance but studied with leading gurus in India to master the contrasting styles of Bharata Natyam, Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam and Orissi.         In the 1950's, Indrani was the first professional dancer to perform Orissi onstage; Orissi, then a neglected dance form, was inspired by temple sculpture in the state of Orissa, in eastern India. Indrani was instrumental in the revival of Orissi, introducing it to audiences in India by touring widely there and doing the same abroad when she performed as a soloist or with her ensemble of musicians and dancers.         In championing rarely seen or forgotten classical dance forms, Indrani followed naturally in the footsteps of her mother, Ragini Devi, an American-born dancer who was internationally known for her leading role in the revival of classical dance in India in the 1930's.         As Esther Sherman in Petoskey, Mich., the future Ragini Devi was already in love with Indian dance when she met Ramlal Bajpai in Minneapolis. After she married Bajpai, an Indian scientist and activist for Indian independence, she traveled to India to study dance in 1930. Their daughter, Indrani, was born that year in Madras. In her book ''Dance Dialects of India,'' Ragini Devi described how she would take the infant Indrani on her own visits to gurus. As a dancer, Indrani was her  ''alter ego,'' Ragini Devi wrote. ''Her dance career is a continuation of mine.''         Ragini Devi, who died in 1982, made her last stage appearance at a memorable concert in 1979 at New York University. She was joined by Sukanya, Indrani's daughter and also a dancer, as well as Indrani. The vivacity of all three generations came into play.         Indrani's playfulness and gaiety at that performance were typical of her vivid personality. In the dramatic Kuchipudi solos, Indrani's quick shifts in characterization were always subtle and deep.         Having started at age 5 in her mother's company, she was steeped in the content of classical dance. As a professional, she began with Bharata Natyam, where she could display the rhythmic complexity of her footwork. But mime within this style and in others allowed her to exhibit her brilliant dramatic gifts.         The Indian Government sponsored Indrani's tours. Her warmth and artistry, as well as the beauty of her costumes and presentations, made her a perfect choice. In 1961 she performed for President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during Nehru's official visit to Washington. Indrani received the Indian Government's national award, Padma Shri, and the Sangeet Natak Akadami Award in the performing arts.         Indrani married Habib Rahman, who was named India's chief architect and who died in 1995. In addition to her daughter, of Orr's Island, Me., she is survived by her son, Ram Rahman, of New Delhi, and two grandsons, Wardreath Wicks of Orr's Island, and Habib Wicks of New York City.       
         Peggy Cass, a brassy-voiced comedian best known for her portrayal of the pregnant, unwed secretary in ''Auntie Mame,'' died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 and had homes in Manhattan and Westhampton, N.Y.         The cause was heart failure, Eugene Feeney, her husband and only survivor, said.         Born in Boston, Mary Margaret  Cass succumbed to the lure of Broadway and moved to New York at 19 after spending three years in the Cambridge Latin School drama club without winning a single speaking role.         After turns as a stenographer, telephone operator, advertising solicitor and model, she finally convinced a producer that she was an actress. She was cast in a U.S.O. tour of ''The Doughgirls'' and spent seven months in Australia without stepping into costume because the United States Army had by then moved to the Philippines.         Her break came when, as an understudy, she took over for Jan Sterling in Chicago in the national tour of ''Born Yesterday.'' Soon after, the producer George Abbott hired her for the 1949 Broadway musical ''Touch and Go.''         But it was the role of the dimwitted secretary, Agnes Gooch, in the 1956 Broadway show ''Auntie Mame'' with which Ms. Cass was most associated. Her performance earned her a Tony Award for best supporting actress. She was nominated for an Academy Award for her work in the  1958 film version.         By the late 1950's, Ms. Cass's facility for brash repartee landed her regular appearances on the television quiz show ''Keep Talking.'' She also appeared often on ''The Jack Paar Show'' in the late 50's and early 60's.         The possessor of an encyclopedic mind, she could be seen during the 60's as often as seven times a week on the quiz shows ''Match Game,'' ''Password'' and ''To Tell the Truth.''       
         Lucille Lortel, whose pioneering efforts to bring innovative theater and adventurous new playwrights and actors to the American stage earned her the title Queen of Off Broadway, died on Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 and had homes in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         Among the legacies of Miss Lortel's cutting-edge career, which spanned more than 70 years, is the theater that bears her name in Greenwich Village; the still thriving White Barn Theater that she started in Westport in 1947; the Lucille Lortel Room at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, and the funds and fellowships she established to aid the arts. She also leaves a veritable Who's Who of people in international theater -- playwrights, actors, directors, composers and designers -- whose careers were advanced by her daring and her confidence in young talent.         ''If you love the theater you must be innovative,'' she once said. ''You must try new ideas and new faces. That's the only way theater can develop. You can't do it on Broadway because it costs too much. The costs are lower Off Broadway, so you can afford to take a chance, and you must take a chance.''         Forsaking the Footlights For a Backstage Role         Miss Lortel gave up a career as an actress in 1939 in deference to her wealthy husband's wishes and in 1947 began an experimental summer theater for American and foreign plays and playwrights in the barn of the couple's summer estate in Westport. From the start she wanted White Barn, as she called it, to be a sanctuary from commercial pressures, a place where writers could take a chance with their plays and where actors could stretch their talents. It was there that Miss Lortel staged readings, mothered performers like Eva Marie Saint, Geoffrey Holder and Zero Mostel and presented plays by Samuel Beckett, Edward Albee, Eugene Ionesco and Sean O'Casey.         In 1955 her husband, Louis Schweitzer, gave her a Manhattan theater, now known as the Lucille Lortel Theater, as a 24th wedding anniversary gift. The first production in the house, at 121 Christopher Street, then called the Theater de Lys, was Marc Blitzstein's adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ''Threepenny Opera. '' It caused such a sensation that the production ran for seven years and put Off Broadway on the map.         As Stuart W. Little observed in his 1972 book ''Off Broadway: The Prophetic Theater'': ''For thousands of theatergoers, a visit to the de Lys was the authentic Off Broadway experience. Off Broadway meant the discovery of new talent and fresh theatrical experiences in unfamiliar parts of the city. . . .The de Lys at the far end of Christopher Street, near the Hudson River docks, was situated in a borderline neighborhood between the known residential part of the city and the open seaport. The unknown world beyond, in imagination, merged with the pulsing underworld life of 'The Threepenny Opera' and became sinister, exotic, menacing.''         Miss Lortel was frustrated by the success of ''Threepenny Opera'' because she wanted to bring more plays into her theater, so she  persuaded the American National Theater and Academy to support a matinee series as a ''laboratory for innovation.'' The series ran for 20 years and became a legend. A verse adaptation of Alan Paton's novel ''Cry the Beloved Country'' became the first venture of the series in 1956, followed that  season by such groundbreaking productions as Anna Sokolow's Kafkaesque dance-drama ''Metamorphosis'' and May O'Donnell's modern-dance interpretation of Maeterlinck's play ''Pelleas and Melisandre.''         Over the years the series offered ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' a dramatization of Langston Hughes poems with Godfrey Cambridge; adaptations of poetic works by Robert Frost, Archibald MacLeish, W. H. Auden and Conrad Aiken; performances of rarely seen plays by O'Casey, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Albee and William Inge, and presented actors like Richard Burton in ''An Afternoon of Poetry,'' Siobhan McKenna as Hamlet, Helen Hayes in an anthology of Shakespeare and Dame Sybil Thorndike and Sir Lewis Casson in a joint dramatic reading. Terrence McNally and Adrienne Kennedy were among the new writers whose works were presented.         She brought Jean Genet to the attention of American audiences with a production of ''The Balcony,'' which she co-produced at Circle in the Square in 1960. She also oversaw the first American production of a play by Athol Fugard, the South African playwright; it was ''Blood Knot,'' starring James Earl Jones and J. D. Cannon, and it ignited audiences at the Cricket Theater on Second Avenue in 1964. She introduced many plays by Beckett, including ''Rockaby,'' on Theater Row on West 42d Street.         Creating a Setting For Cutting-Edge Work         At the Theater de Lys, she provided a home for such plays as David Mamet's ''A Life in the Theater,'' Sam Shepard's ''Buried Child'' and ''Getting Out,'' early work by Marsha Norman, Caryl Churchill's ''Cloud Nine'' and Wendy Wasserstein's ''Isn't It Romantic.'' The house was renamed the Lucille Lortel Theater in 1981, and has been the setting for Larry Kramer's ''The Destiny of Me,'' for ''Groucho'' and for ''Gertrude Stein and a Companion,'' the recipient of the National Education Film and Video Award for historical biographies.         The 38th volume of John Willis's ''Theater World'' (1981-82) is dedicated ''To Lucille Lortel, whose vibrant spirit and untiring efforts have made immeasurable contributions to all components of the theater by discovering and encouraging new talent, and whose devotion to Off Broadway provided the impetus for its proliferation.''         In 1960 Miss Lortel began sponsoring dramatic productions and seminars at the Library of Congress. The presentations included O'Casey's ''Time to Go,'' Mark Van Doren's ''Last Days of Lincoln'' and Albee's ''Fam and Yam.''         Miss Lortel produced or co-produced some 500 plays, 5 of which were nominated for Tony Awards -- ''As Is'' by William M. Hoffman, ''Angels Fall'' by Lanford Wilson, ''Blood Knot'' by Mr. Fugard, ''Sarafina!,'' an import from South Africa, and ''A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing. Several were produced in Broadway theaters and the others moved to Broadway.         The theater on Christopher Street was only one of many unusual gifts that Mr. Schweitzer lavished on Miss Lortel before his death in 1971. A chemical engineer who made his fortune manufacturing cigarette papers, he also owned the FM radio station WBAI.         In 1957, when his wife told him it was sometimes difficult to find a cab after the theater, he bought a gray Mercedes-Benz. He had been told there was a cab driver named Louis Schweitzer in town and he arranged to get a taxi medallion for the car and for his namesake to act as its part-time driver. When the driver wasn't transporting  Miss Lortel, he was free to use the car as a taxi and split the earnings with the boss.         In 1956, Mr. Schweitzer was the first foreigner in more than 400 years allowed to buy a gondola in Venice. Although traditionally gondolas were identified only by numbers, he was given permission to name his purchase ''Lucille.'' The gondola continued to carry passengers and the gondolier was told that if American visitors used Mr. Schweitzer's name to book a ride, they were to be charged double. ''My friends can afford it,'' he explained.         For some years, the Schweitzers spent part of each winter on a houseboat in Florida. The two-story villa on a raft, anchored off Miami Beach, had two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, servants' quarters and a bar sheltered by a thatched roof.         Lucille Lortel was born in Manhattan on Dec. 16, 1900, the daughter of Harry and Anna Wadler. Lucille was her given name, Lortel an alliterative concoction for the stage. Her father was a manufacturer of women's clothes and frequently traveled to Europe to buy designs that he would copy. For some years, Miss Lortel was tutored at home and although she said, ''I think I went to public school after that,'' she did remember that she never graduated. She attended Adelphi College briefly and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. A 1921 review in ''The Musical Leader'' of her  graduating class's production of D'Annunzio's ''Honeysuckle'' described her as ''an exquisite little creature who seemed to be inspired.'' Later, she studied briefly with Max Reinhardt in Berlin.         Miss Lortel made her Broadway debut in 1925 in the Theater Guild production of George Bernard Shaw's ''Caesar and Cleopatra'' with Helen Hayes as Cleopatra and Lionel Atwill as Caesar. She had a small role, which she said had been added by the director, playing what she described as a whore. She never forgot her unwhorelike lines: ''No no, no, I'll have nothing to do with you,'' addressed to the line of men following her.         She met Mr. Schweitzer in 1930. ''I wasn't interested in getting married,'' she recalled. ''I was involved in the theater.'' Mr. Schweitzer pursued her. During a business trip to France he telephoned and told her he was sending a ticket and that they would get married in Paris. Friends persuaded her to accept -- ''You can always get a divorce,'' they said.         When she arrived in March 1931, the couple discovered that official proclamations of their intended marriage had to be posted for several weeks before the marriage could take place. They sailed back to the United States on the Leviathan and were married by the captain. ''I wouldn't have anything to do with my husband until we came back to New York,'' she said, and even then she waited for two more ceremonies,  one at City Hall and a religious service in Manhattan performed by the Jewish chaplain at West Point.         The year after her marriage, Miss Lortel appeared on stage with Jean Arthur and Claude Rains in ''The Man Who Reclaimed His Head,'' but her husband objected to her absence in the evenings. His unhappiness led to a new activity that continued until 1939 -- acting in movie shorts filmed in Brooklyn in the afternoons. This was followed by a temporary retirement.         ''My husband's mother disapproved of acting, and he was very possessive,'' Miss Lortel said in a 1996 interview. ''After a while, I was getting bored. I thought I'd go nuts so I started readings at Westport, moving the tractors and Ping-Pong table from the barn.''         From a White Barn To Off Broadway         In 1947 Miss Lortel was approached by the actor Canada Lee and Philip Huston, a playwright, who needed a place and a distinguished audience for a staged reading of a new play called ''The Painted Wagon.'' Miss Lortel provided both. This was followed by a request from the agent Audrey Wood, who wanted a showcase for a musical, ''No Casting Today.'' Thus the White Barn was opened with Miss Lortel as its sole backer and hostess, providing room and board for the actors.         She had a permanent stage built, brought in new and innovative troupes like the Dublin Players Company, the Oxford University Players and Mr. Holder and his Trinidad Dance Troupe, established an apprentice school, introduced seminars in Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov, and offered playwrights, actors, designers, composers and directors a chance to spread their wings.         ''When the White Barn began, it was to summer theater what Off Broadway is to the commercial theater,'' the actress and producer Eva Le Gallienneonce said. ''An avowed pioneer, it proved that summer productions could be stimulating, avant-garde and enthusiastically received.''         Nurturing Newcomers And Seasoned Actors         Among the newcomers who got a chance at the White Barn were Peter Falk, Vincent Gardenia, Sada Thompson, George Peppard and Sidney Lumet. Working with them were more established actors seeking challenges  -- Mildred Dunnock, Mr. Mostel, Kim Hunter, James Coco and Peggy Wood.         Mr. Schweitzer initially enjoyed his wife's new enthusiasm and the idea of having actors around the estate in the summer. Later, his enthusiasm waned and although he continued to support her endeavors, it wasn't until his later years that his interest revived.         Miss Lortel was showered with virtually every theatrical award and honor except a Tony, which is given for achievement on Broadway. She received the first Margo Jones Award (1962) and the Lee Strasberg Lifetime Achievement Award (1985), as well as induction into the Theater Hall of Fame (1990) and recognition from the School of the Arts at Columbia University (1996). The first theater chair to be named for a woman bears her name, the Lucille Lortel Distinguished Professorial Chair in Theater at the City University of New York. A permanent tribute to her career is on display at the archives of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The Lucille Lortel Theater Collection, an archive of theatrical history and memorabilia, is on permanent exhibition at the Westport Public Library.         In 1986, the Lucille Lortel Awards were established by the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers to honor outstanding achievements in the Off Broadway theater. Recipients have included the playwright A. R. Gurney, for ''The Cocktail Hour''; John Tillinger, the director; Playwrights Horizons, and Lincoln Center Theater for ''Woza Afrika!''         Miss Lortel, who leaves no immediate survivors, was a generous donor in other theatrical areas. She established the Lucille Lortel Fund for New Drama at Yale University to support the production of new plays at the Yale Repertory Theater (the fund's premiere production was August Wilson's ''Fences''). The Lucille Lortel Fellowship in Playwriting was started at Brown University in Providence, R.I., in 1996. She also donated money for the annual Drama Circle awards and made sizable financial contributions to dance and music groups.         ''Honey, I've got a one-track mind and it's theater, theater, theater,'' she once said. ''I have no time for anything else.''         One of Miss Lortel's favorite possessions in her memento-filled midtown apartment at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, where she lived after her husband's death, was a box covered with notices of plays she had produced. The lid opened to the sound of applause and a voice calling out ''More! More!''         Circulating in a milieu where youth often takes the starring role, she frequently sidestepped the matter of age by saying ''age is a number and mine is unlisted.'' When a gossip column last year reported that Miss Lortel would soon celebrate her 98th birthday, Blanche Marvin, a friend, reported that she was furious.         ''This will kill my love life,'' she said.       
         Bobbe Brox, the last surviving member of the vocal trio who called themselves the Brox Sisters and who appeared on stage and in films, died  on May 2 in Glens Falls, N.Y. She was 98.         Miss Brox, whose original name was Josephine Brock, and her sisters were American-born but were  brought up in Edmonton, Alberta.  Embarking on a career in show business, they changed their name to Brox when a producer persuaded them the new spelling looked better on a marquee.         She then changed her given name  to Dagmar and then to Bobbe. Her sister Eunice became Lorayne, and Kathleen decided to call herself Patricia.         As the Brox Sisters, they sang in the first ''Music Box Revue'' in 1921 and also appeared in the 1923 and 1924 editions of the show.         In the summer of 1926 they performed in the musical comedy ''The Cocoanuts'' with the Marx Brothers, singing a number called ''Monkey Doodle Doo.'' They also appeared in the 1927 Ziegfeld Follies with Eddie Cantor.         The trio also made a number of recordings during the 1920's and appeared in several films, including ''Hollywood Review of 1929'' and ''King of Jazz'' (1930).         Miss Brox's marriage to William Perlberg, who was her agent before becoming a film producer, ended in divorce in the 1960's. She married the songwriter Jimmy Van Heusen in 1969. He died in 1990. Her sister Patricia died in 1988 and Lorayne in 1993.         She is survived by a son, William Brock Perlberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif.       
         Vanessa Brown, who originated the role of the girl upstairs in the Broadway production of ''The Seven Year Itch,'' a role played in the film version by Marilyn Monroe, died on Friday at the Motion Picture Country Home in Los Angeles, Calif. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, her son, David, said.         Born Smylla Brind in Vienna, Ms. Brown was blessed with beauty and  an I.Q. of 165 that she said made her feel ''squirmy.'' Her family fled the Nazis when she was 9, moving first to France and then to New York, where she came to the attention of the Broadway producer Herman Shumlin. He offered her the role of a 10-year-old Viennese girl in his production of Lillian Hellman's play ''Watch on the Rhine.'' Her parents refused to allow her to leave school, so she understudied Ann Blyth but later stepped into the role.         While in Chicago with the play, she was a guest on the radio show ''Quiz Kids,'' and did so well that she was offered and accepted a regular spot on the panel. After two years, she returned to New York, then moved to Los Angeles, where she made her first movie, ''Youth Runs Wild'' (1944), at age 16. While in college  she signed up with 20th Century Fox, and appeared in such movies as ''Tarzan and the Slave Girl'' (1950), in which she swung from trees with Lex Barker; ''The Heiress,'' and ''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.''         Ms. Brown returned to Broadway in 1952. Her stage career included the tour of ''As You Like It'' with Katharine Hepburn.         In later years Ms. Brown turned to politics and writing. She was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic Convention and was active in the Presidential campaigns of Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy. As a freelance correspondent for the Voice of America, she covered topics including  politics, science and medicine.         She is survived by her son, David, and a daughter, Cathy, both of Los Angeles.       
         Shirley Potash Clurman, a retired magazine editor and television producer, died yesterday at St. Rose's Home in Manhattan. She was 74 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Clurman, a native of Los Angeles, began her career in the publicity department of 20th Century Fox before moving to New York to work as an assistant to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d.         She did public relations work for Time Inc. and, until the early 1960's, for the Rockefeller family, then worked as an editor at People magazine. When she retired, she was working for ABC News as an associate producer of the news magazine program ''20/20.''         Mrs. Clurman was the widow of Richard M. Clurman, a longtime leader in New York City's cultural life and former chief of correspondents and head of Time-Life News Service. He died three years ago. She is survived by their son, Michael, of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Susan Emma Clurman of Manhattan and Carol Mae Duning of Alexandria, Va., and a sister, Ellen Schwartz of Waco, Tex.       
         Francine Everett, a singer, dancer and actress who was one of the stars of the all-black cast ''race'' movies of the 30's and 40's, died at a nursing home in the Bronx on May 27.         She gave her birth year as 1920, however by 1933 she was already appearing with the Four Black Cats, a nightclub variety act. Shortly thereafter, she began acting with the Federal Theater in Harlem, which was sponsored by the Works Progress Administration.         After marrying the actor Rex Ingram, she moved to Hollywood in 1936. Upon her arrival, she is said to have turned down a part as one of the angels in the Warner Brothers all-black spectacle ''Green Pastures,'' in which her husband starred as De Lawd, and she later refused to accept the stereotypical roles of servants that were offered by the studios.         Her marriage to Mr. Ingram ended in divorce in 1939, and Ms. Everett returned to Harlem. She quickly became a familiar face as a lead in low-budget, independently produced black films like ''Keep Punching'' (1939), which starred the boxing champion Henry Armstrong; ''Big Timers'' (circa 1945), which featured Moms Mabley and Stepin Fetchit, and ''Dirty Gerty From Harlem U.S.A.'' (1946), which was directed by Spencer Williams Jr., who later portrayed Andy in the ''Amos 'n' Andy'' television series.         Among her Hollywood film credits were bit parts in ''Lost Boundaries'' (1949) and in Sidney Poitier's first film, ''No Way Out'' (1950), which was her final appearance on the screen.         The entertainment historian Henry T. Sampson said that Ms. Everett  and Edna Mae Harris were the last of the leading ladies of the all-black films. The cultural historian and lecturer Delilah Jackson said that Billy Rowe, an editor of The Pittsburgh Courier and writer for The Amsterdam News in New York, called Ms. Everett ''the most beautiful woman in Harlem.''         The former actor and award-winning filmmaker and producer William Greaves said that Ms. Everett  ''was a true legend of black film and theater, one of the top stars of the 40's race movies.''         He added, ''She would have been a superstar in Hollywood were it not for the apartheid climate in America and the movie industry at the time.''         Her arresting looks may not have benefited her career as a Hollywood player at a time when black actresses were rarely portrayed as glamorous, but they served her well as a model and singer.         As a vocalist, Ms. Everett appeared in more than 50 ''soundies,'' short musical films featuring the most renowned jazz and popular musicians of the 1940's. One was the 1947 release ''Ebony on Parade,'' which starred Dorothy Dandridge, Cab Calloway and the Count Basie band. She was also a popular print model who appeared in clothing and cosmetic advertisements in the 40's.         She is survived by an aunt, Lucy Williams.         Ms. Everett retired from show business in the 1950's. She held a clerical job at Harlem Hospital until her retirement in 1985. But she maintained a keen interest in black film and entertainment. She was a member of the Negro Actors' Guild and often lectured and participated on panels and in seminars sponsored by the International Agency for Minority Artists Affairs, which promotes black films.       
         Patricia Kerr Ross, former director of the State University of New York's Programs in the Arts, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Albany. She was 60 and lived in Albany.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         As director of the university-wide arts programs from 1971 to 1991, Ms. Ross was instrumental in producing statewide arts festivals, workshops and exhibitions. Over the years her office provided creative assistance and support to artists and arts administrators throughout the State University system.         Ms. Ross helped bring dance to SUNY campuses by producing such festivals as the Early Years of Modern Dance (1981) and Merce Cunningham and the New Dance (1987). Dance Black America (1984) was produced with the Brooklyn Academy of Music and filmed for public television.         From 1979 to 1987 she was executive producer of a series of public television specials, ''SUNY in the Arts on Television.'' She also organized faculty and student visits to artists, actors, directors and producers, as well as the SUNY Writer's Festival of readings, discussions and workshops. In 1985 she was co-producer of ''The Educated Eye,'' an exhibition at the New York State Museum of 400 artworks from 25 SUNY campuses.         Ms. Ross, who taught arts policy at Empire State College, was also director of the Thayer Fellowship, which supported outstanding SUNY arts graduates in their first year of professional activity.         In 1989 she founded and directed what became an annual ''Come Sunday'' celebration of music and dance in Albany's historic Center Square neighborhood. The festival presented such performers as Dizzy Gillespie, Branford Marsalis and Garth Fagan as well as emerging local artists. She retired from the university in 1997.         Ms. Ross is survived by a daughter, Linda Proctor of Concord, N.H.; her companion, George Hofmann, an artist and professor at Hunter College, and two grandchildren.       
         Marie St. Louis, a jazz festival talent executive who booked such artists as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald during a 37-year career, died of cancer yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71.         Mrs. St. Louis was senior vice president of Festival Productions Inc., which promotes the JVC Jazz Festival, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the Newport Jazz Festival and other major events. Officials of the JVC Festival, which begins in New York next week, announced that they would dedicate the event to her. She was one of the first women to achieve prominence in the jazz music industry.         Mrs. St. Louis was married briefly to Roy St. Louis in the 1950's. Survivors include her brother, Jack Barrow; her son, Marc St. Louis, a music producer, and a grandson, Cameron.       
         Marguerite W. Cullman, a longtime theatrical investor who was also an author, died yesterday in her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 94, and her main residence was in Purchase, N.Y.         After working as an editor of the old Stage magazine, Mrs. Cullman began investing with her husband, Howard S. Cullman, who was chairman of what was then called the Port of New York Authority and was prominent in the tobacco industry, serving on the board of Philip Morris  Inc. He died in 1972.         The couple began investing in Broadway productions in the 1930's because, as their children said yesterday, while Mrs. Cullman worked at Stage she liked to be sure that a play the magazine wrote about would not fold before the next issue appeared.         As a family story has it, Mrs. Cullman proved prescient in guessing on behalf of the magazine which plays would prove durable. When her husband learned that, he proposed that she read the scripts of forthcoming Broadway productions and he study the financial prospectuses issued by their producers.         After Mrs. Cullman left the magazine, the couple began their investing, which continued into the 1970's and brought them renown for their shrewdness and energy.         Robert Whitehead, the theatrical producer, recalled last night, ''I could see that she got a kick out of the theater and a kick out of being associated with it through investment.''         Among the hits that the Cullmans helped bring to the stage were ''Life With Father,'' ''Oklahoma!,'' ''Carousel,'' ''Brigadoon,'' ''South Pacific,'' ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Teahouse of the August Moon,'' ''Death of Salesman'' and ''A Streetcar Named Desire.''         During the 1940's and 1950's, their children said, the couple's success rate was so high that their participation in a forthcoming show was enough to guarantee its full funding.         Marguerite Sanders, as she then was, was born and reared in Manhattan, attended Columbia University, worked as a writer and editor for the McNaught Newspaper Syndicate and contributed articles to The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker and other publications.         In addition, she wrote two books, ''Occupation Angel'' (1962), about Broadway, and ''Ninety Dozen Glasses'' (1960), about her life with Mr. Cullman in 1958, when he was the United States Commissioner for the World's Fair in Brussels.         She was also vice chairman of the Lighthouse for the Blind and served on the board of the Spence-Chapin Home for Adoption.         An early marriage was annulled. She married Mr. Cullman in 1935.         She is survived by a daughter, Marguerite P. Cullman of Severna Park, Md.; a son, Brian Henry Cullman of Manhattan; two stepsons, Hugh Cullman of Beaufort, N.C., and Paul T. Cullman of Ferndale, Wash.; 12 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren.       
         Jennifer Paterson, the over-the-top co-star of the quirky television cooking show ''Two Fat Ladies,'' died yesterday at a hospital in London, where she lived. She was 71.         Lung cancer had been diagnosed last month after Ms. Paterson fell ill while filming installments of the cooking series with her partner, Clarissa Dickson Wright.         The show, featuring the two unashamedly corpulent and opinionated eccentrics, is a hit in Britain and the United States and has been syndicated in other countries following its debut on the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1996.         Ms. Paterson and Ms. Dickson Wright were unknown to each other until they were brought together by a BBC producer in what was described as a match made in ratings heaven. One fan who apparently contributed to the ratings was Prince Charles, who sent a gift of homemade organic tomato soup and vanilla ice cream to Ms. Paterson after she disclosed her illness last month.         Ms. Paterson and Ms. Dickson Wright offered their viewers cholesterol-soaked dishes that they favored in their own homes. One show, called ''Meat,'' featured meatloaf draped with strips of bacon, lamb stew, fillet of beef and, perhaps as a nod to health fanatics, a pan-fried chicken dish.         ''I blame Americans for this fear of red meat and fat that's spread all over England,'' Ms. Paterson told an interviewer last year while taking a sip of vodka in a restaurant before heading to the sidewalk for a pre-lunch cigarette.         Ms. Dickson Wright agreed, although she credited the success of the show to a backlash against what she called the health police. ''Our show seems to say to Americans that it's O.K. to eat red meat and cook with butter,'' she said in the same article. ''I don't know why they feel they need permission.''         Each episode of ''The Two Fat Ladies'' was recorded at a different location. Every show began with Ms. Paterson astride a motorcycle with her partner squeezed into a sidecar, zooming toward their destination. When they did their ''Meat'' show, for example, they cooked for a girls' lacrosse team in the kitchen of a boarding school.         They each cooked two dishes per show, working in tandem and punctuating their culinary advice with a raucous sense of humor on any subject that took their fancy. They delighted in skewering the pretensions of haute cuisine.         Last year Ms. Paterson said she was in fine shape for her age. ''Lots of meat, drink and cigarettes and not giving in to things,'' she said in an interview.         She was born into an army family and was unconventional even as a child. At 15 she was expelled from convent school for being disruptive; she later became a matron at a girls' boarding school near Reading.         Ms. Paterson went on from there to become a professional chef. She was the cook for the Ugandan legation in London and later provided weekly lunches for celebrities, including Prince Charles. She was a food columnist for The Spectator when she met Ms. Dickson Wright, a former barrister who wrote a column for Decanter magazine and owned a cookbook store in Edinburgh, where she lives.         The pair was characterized by Suzanne Hamlin in a 1998 article in The New York Times as being ''as appealing as someone else's dotty aunts.'' But Ms. Hamlin, in reviewing their cookbook ''Cooking With the Two Fat Ladies'' (Clarkson Potter),  reported that all six of six recipes she tested did not work as described and that eccentricities and farce failed to be compelling in a cookbook that purported to be useful.         Following its instructions, she said, one dish ended up looking as though ''it had barely survived a brush fire'' and a pudding that was touted as thick and creamy turned out ''wan and thin as a sauce.''         ''It is their rapid rise here, of course, that makes this careless effort at a cookbook so regrettable,'' she wrote.         The Food Network began broadcasting the shows in the United States in 1997 and, as Ms. Hamlin noted, ''in the blink of an eye, they developed a cult following among those who have an innate fondness for British eccentrics.'' American Public Television also distributes ''Two Fat Women'' to stations all over the country.         The Food Network is planning a two-hour tribute to Ms. Paterson, who is survived by an uncle and two brothers, on Sunday night at 9.         Ms. Dickson Wright told the BBC that she had last seen Ms. Paterson 10 days ago, although they had spoken each day on the telephone. She had intended to visit her today to drop off a tin of caviar, she said.         ''She didn't see the point of flowers,'' Ms. Dickson Wright said. ''She'd rather have caviar.''       
         Ruth Roman, a screen actress who parlayed her electrically charged combination of sexiness and wholesomeness into Hollywood stardom in the late 1940's and 50's, died on Thursday at her home in Laguna Beach, Calif. She was 75.         She died in her sleep, said her son, Richard Hall.         After her breakout role opposite Kirk Douglas in Stanley Kramer's ''Champion,'' a 1949 adaptation of a Ring Lardner short story about a maniacal prize fighter, Warner Brothers gave her starring roles in nine films in under two years.         In one day she leaped from working with Bette Davis in ''Beyond the Forest'' to supporting Milton Berle in ''Always Leave Them Laughing.'' A week after the completion of ''Strangers on a Train'' opposite Robert Walker, she was whisked into ''Tomorrow Is Another Day'' with Steve Cochran.         From 1948 to 1965, Ms. Roman appeared in more than 30 movies, and in the 1960's and 70's in numerous television shows.         Her romantic partners in films included Randolph Scott in ''Colt .45,'' James Stewart in ''The Far Country'' and Gary Cooper in ''Dallas.''         Few of her films are studied in film schools today. But in their time they made box office cash registers ring like sleigh bells and in 1951 Ms. Roman was receiving 500 letters a week from around the world.         There were plenty of cheesecake queens in Hollywood seeking roles when Ms. Roman arrived in 1945, but it was her come-hitcher warmth, combined with her shapely, dark-haired good looks, that made her a standout. When Collier's profiled her in 1951, the magazine declared that Ms. Roman's career had been built on a ''pervasive air of wholesomeness.''         It was an appeal that even Ms. Roman did not fully understand. When she auditioned for a part in ''Champion,'' she thought she would be right for the role of the fighter's gold-digging floozy and accordingly wore a tight-fitting black dress and heavy makeup when she swivel-hipped into Stanley Kramer's office.         But somehow the wholesomeness showed through. ''Actually, I thought of you for the other girl,'' said Mr. Kramer, then serving as the film's producer.         Marilyn Maxwell played the floozy, with Kirk Douglas as the fighter and Ms. Roman as his demure and steadfast wife.         It had been that same quality that landed Ms. Roman her first film role: a bit part as a WAVE in ''Stage Door Canteen'' in 1942.         Clem Beauchamp, company manager for ''Stage Door Canteen,'' told an interviewer in 1951 that he chose Ms. Roman from dozens of eager actresses because ''I felt right away that here was a girl who would show up on time in the morning with her lines learned and no nonsense.''         By Hollywood standards, Ms. Roman's romantic life was a bit dull. She dated Bill Walsh, a publicity agent, for five years. She once stepped out with Ronald Reagan. And in 1950 she married Mortimer Hall, a Los Angeles television executive. The marriage ended in divorce.  A second marriage, to Budd Burton Moss, also ended in divorce. She told interviewers that she disliked nightclubs and flashy clothes. Her one extravagance, she said, was her collection of 35 pairs of shoes, and that consisted mainly of Indian moccasins.         Not all of the excitement in her life was make-believe. In 1956 Ms. Roman was aboard the luxury passenger liner Andrea Doria when it was struck by the Stockholm. Ms. Roman was returning from Italy with her 3-year-old son, Dickie. She was dancing in the ship's Belvedere room, she told a reporter for The New York Times, when ''we heard a big explosion like a firecracker.''         She said she saw smoke coming from the general area of her cabin and rushed there to protect her son. He was sound asleep. She said she awakened Dickie and told him,  ''We're going on a picnic.''         When it was clear that the liner was sinking and passengers began entering lifeboats, a seaman lowered Dickie into a boat. Ms. Roman said she followed down a rope ladder, but when she was halfway down the lifeboat pulled away. She called out to the boat but it did not return. She was put on another lifeboat.         Ms. Roman told a reporter she was never in fear for her son's life, but felt sure he would be safe in the lifeboat, which turned out to be true. Ms. Roman and her son were among the 760 survivors of the Andrea Doria.         Her son, her only survivor, lives in California.         Born in Lynn, Mass., on Dec. 23, 1923, she was the youngest of three daughters of immigrants from Lithuania. Her father, Anthony Roman, a carnival barker, died when she was a child, forcing her mother to work as a waitress, cleaning woman and laundress.         Ms. Roman was proud of her family's endurance. ''For a while,'' she once told a reporter, ''we were moving regularly once a month because we couldn't pay our rent.''         But she never felt sorry for herself, she said, remarking, ''When you start out poor, you don't know what you're missing.''         Ms. Roman quit high school in her second year when she decided to become an actress. During the day she worked as a movie usher and at night she performed with the New England Repertory Company, a semi-professional group in Boston.         With $200 in her pocketbook, she  soon struck out for Hollywood. For a while, she lived in a boarding house with several other aspiring actresses. They called their home the House of the Seven Garbos.         For six years she endured a series of disappointments. She got a good part in a western called ''White Stallion,'' but it was never released. Then came a role in ''A Night in Casablanca,'' but after the filming her part was cut. But then everything changed after her audition with Stanley Kramer.       
         Bethel Leslie, a lifelong presence onstage and on television whose final Broadway performance earned her a Tony nomination, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, said Leslie McCullough Jeffries, her daughter.         The daughter of a lawyer and a socialite, Ms. Leslie was a 15-year-old student at the Brearley School on the Upper East Side when she was discovered by the producer George Abbott and cast as the girl next door in the 1944 Broadway production of ''Snafu,'' a comedy.         The role began Ms. Leslie's career, which included appearances in 10 Broadway plays before she was 25 and which had her acting alongside the likes of Fredric March (''Years Ago,'' in 1946), Sam Wanamaker (''Goodbye, My Fancy'' in 1948) and Helen Hayes (''The Wisteria Trees,'' in 1950).         Her breakthrough came in 1955, in ''Inherit the Wind,'' in which she played the conflicted daughter of a Bible-wielding reverend. The part earned Ms. Leslie strong reviews, and she soon headed to Hollywood. There she found steady work in television, parlaying her dark good looks into roles on shows like ''Gunsmoke,'' ''Perry Mason'' and ''The Fugitive.''         A 1965 press biography listed some of her character roles as ''a cheating wife, a husband-framing mistress'' and ''the wife of a confessed murderer.''         Ms. Leslie made her film debut in 1964 in ''Captain Newman, M.D.,'' as the wife of a traumatized Air Force pilot, played by Robert Duvall.         By 1965 she had returned to New York and to the theater, though appearances on soap operas helped support that passion. As a side pursuit Ms. Leslie began to write, eventually becoming a head writer for the daytime drama ''The Secret Storm.''         It was not until 1986, however, that she scored her biggest triumph, appearing as the morphine-addicted mother in Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey into Night,'' a performance that Frank Rich of The New York Times called ''exceptionally beautiful.'' Her work earned her a Tony nomination.         In recent years she appeared Off Broadway in productions with the Signature Theater Company and most recently with the Women's Project, where she won praise this spring for her work in Joan Vail Thorne's play ''Exact Center of the Universe.''         In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York, Ms. Leslie is survived by a brother, Warren Leslie, also of New York, and two grandchildren.       
         Jill Craigie, a devoted socialist and feminist who became one of Britain's first successful female film directors and whose half-century marriage to the Labor Party leader Michael Foot put her at the heart of the country's leftist politics, died on Monday in London. She was 85.         Ms. Craigie first made her mark in documentary filmmaking with ''Out of Chaos,'' a 1943 film about modern art; ''The Way We Live,'' a 1946 study of the effects of the German blitzkrieg on Plymouth, and ''Blue Scar,'' a 1948 look at life in an impoverished Welsh mining village. It was while making her film in Plymouth that she met Mr. Foot, then a candidate for Parliament. She interviewed him and a relationship began.         Ms. Craigie was born in Derbyshire to a Scottish father and a Russian emigre mother and had, by her own estimation, a wretched childhood. Her parents divorced when she was an infant. Her father was killed in World War I and her mother lived mostly abroad.         ''I used to spend most of my holidays at boarding school,'' she once said. ''I went to a dozen different boarding schools over the years and never learned anything. I was one of the rootless people. I had a very lonely childhood indeed. I turned to writing because I was lonely.''         After school, she moved to London and began writing an advice column and horoscopes for a women's magazine called Betty's Paper. She quickly found her way into artistic and literary circles. When she was 19, she married a sculptor, Claude Begbie-Clench, and they had a daughter, Julie. The marriage was short-lived.         Soon after, she married Jeffrey Dell, a scriptwriter for the movie producer Alexander Korda, and they wrote a play called ''The Judge,'' which was staged in London in 1938. This marriage was also short-lived, but Ms. Craigie was able to use the connections she made through Mr. Dell to get work in the British film industry, first making sports films and later turning to feature-length documentaries.         During these years, Ms. Craigie was romantically linked to many prominent artists and writers.         Mr. Foot and Ms. Craigie did not marry for almost two years after their meeting in Plymouth, though they lived together for much of that time. They finally married in 1949, she once said, to assuage the concerns of Mr. Foot's family.         Though many at the time doubted that Ms. Craigie's third marriage would last longer than the first two, theirs turned out to be a close and loving relationship, friends said.         She is survived by her husband and daughter.         Ms. Craigie's work as a filmmaker and writer dwindled after her third marriage, though she did write the screenplay for ''The Million Pound Note,'' renamed ''Man With a Million,'' a 1953 film starring Gregory Peck that was filmed in London.         In 1952, she wrote and produced a BBC radio documentary about the British suffragist movement, a subject that was near to her heart since a chance meeting in 1940 with a group of aging suffragists at a memorial service for one of their members.         For the last decades of her life, Ms. Craigie was said to be at work on a  history of the movement, left unfinished at her death.         In 1967, she made a television documentary called ''Who Are the Vandals?'' that was critical of housing developers. In 1995, she made ''Two Hours From London,'' a documentary about the former Yugoslavia.         As Mr. Foot's political career prospered, Ms. Craigie became known as one of his confidantes as well as the hostess for many Labor Party gatherings at the couple's home. When Mr. Foot became chief of the Labor Party in 1980, beginning a three-year leadership that ended with a crushing defeat for the party in 1983, a few asserted that he was being pushed by an ambitious wife. Ms. Craigie demurred.         ''He would be in exactly the same position he is in today had he not been married to me, except he wouldn't have had such a nice house,'' she said.
