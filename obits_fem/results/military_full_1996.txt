         Susan K. Kamen, an engineer for the military and, in a second career, a vice  president at the New York Life Insurance Company, died last Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Mrs. Kamen, who also maintained a home in Wainscott, L.I., was 59.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Harry P. Kamen, the chairman and chief executive of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.         Mrs. Kamen graduated from Smith College in 1957 and from Yale with a master's degree in science and physics in 1958. She spent the next six years as  a radar engineer with Sperry Gyroscope's Advanced Studies Department in Lake Success, N.Y. She held patents on radar receivers. At New York Life, she was a vice president for information systems.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Kamen is survived by two daughters, Katherine K. Berkowitz of Bethesda, Md., and Abigail K. Holland of Manhattan; her parents, Thelma and Murray Klein of Brooklyn, and a brother, Eric Klein of Manhattan.       
         Siti Hartinah Suharto, the wife of President Suharto of Indonesia, died today of a heart attack, a spokesman for the President said. She was 72.         Mrs. Suharto died in the Gatot Subroto military hospital in central Jakarta.  The Government ordered a week of mourning.         Her death came as the President, who is 74, enters the campaign for next year's general election. That is to be followed in early 1998 by a presidential  race in which Mr. Suharto, a former army general who has been President since 1968, is expected to run for a seventh term.         Mrs. Suharto's body was taken to her hometown in Solo, in central Java, for burial on Monday at the family mausoleum. Thousands lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the hearse transporting her body to the military airport in Jakarta.         The Suhartos were married in 1947. In addition to her husband, Mrs. Suharto is survived by three sons, three daughters and several grandchildren.       
         Sabina Zlatin, who rescued dozens of Jewish children from the Nazis during World War II, died on Saturday in a Paris hospital. She was 89.         The Children's Home of Izieu, which she founded, helped more than 100 children elude capture by the occupying Germans before it became one of the more enduring and horrific symbols of Nazi barbarism.         One spring morning in 1944, the Gestapo raided the home and plucked 44 Jewish children from their breakfast and trucked them to their eventual deaths in concentration camps.         When Klaus Barbie, the wartime head of the German police in Lyons who ordered the raid on the home, went on trial in 1987, Mrs. Zlatin was among those who testified against him.         ''Her death makes even more necessary our duty to remember,'' said Lionel Jospin, the French Socialist Party leader.         Sabina Schwast was born to a Jewish family in Warsaw. She married a French agronomist named Miron Zlatin, settling with him on a farm in northern France and becoming a French citizen.         When war broke out in 1939, the Zlatins left their farm and she became a nurse at a military hospital in Montpellier. The job was short-lived. Once it was discovered that she was Jewish, the collaborationist government dismissed her. Soon after, she was drawn to the work of the Children's Rescue Charity, which assisted children endangered by the war.         In 1943, putting herself and her husband at grave risk, she decided to open a home to help these children. She chose as a refuge a farmhouse in Izieu, a quiet, tiny hilltop hamlet with a sweeping view of the Rhone River Valley and the snowy peaks of the Alps.         In that idyllic setting, she gave Jewish children of all ages sanctuary while she arranged to shuttle them out of France to safety in Switzerland. She managed to smuggle some 100 children from the Izieu home over the Swiss border and beyond the grasp of the Gestapo before the day the trucks came.         It was a neighboring farmer of German descent who betrayed the safe house. He had hired a teen-age boy from the children's home, somehow found out that the children were Jewish, then apparently passed the information to German troops garrisoned in a nearby town.         On April 6, 1944, as the children were having breakfast, German trucks rolled up in front of the farmhouse. Mrs. Zlatin was away at the time, arranging for another batch of children to be smuggled to Switzerland. But 7 teachers and 44 children between the ages of 4 and 17 were arrested. Only an assistant to Mrs. Zlatin escaped, managing to squeeze through an upstairs window and hide in the garden.         The rest, including Mrs. Zlatin's husband, were herded into the trucks. Witnesses told of the children being kicked and hurled into the trucks like sacks of potatoes.         Mr. Barbie commanded his officers to transport the captives to deportation centers. As they rode along, jounced about in the back of the trucks, the 44 children sang a song declaring their defiance. They had learned it from their history lessons: ''Vous n'aurez pas l'Alsace et la Lorraine'' (You will not have Alsace and Lorraine).         Mrs. Zlatin learned of the roundup via a telegram that said: ''Family ill. Contagious disease.'' Those were the code words that meant the worst: the Nazis had arrived at Izieu.         At once, Mrs. Zlatin hurried to Vichy to beg for the lives of the children before the collaborationist French government. She was spurned. ''Why do you bother about those dirty Jews?'' a senior French official asked her.         Five of the adults and 42 of the children died in gas chambers at Auschwitz. Mr. Zlatin and the two remaining children were executed by firing squad in Estonia. A single adult, a 25-year-old teacher, managed to survive.         When Mr. Barbie went on trial for crimes against humanity in May 1987, Mrs. Zlatin, then 80, went to testify against his brutalities. The assistant who had escaped from the farmhouse the day of the Izieu raid testified that as he hid outside, he saw Mr. Barbie among the Germans.         Mr. Barbie was convicted and later died in a French prison.       
         Kathleen Carlin, a social service executive who devoted her professional life to the proposition that men can learn to get along quite well without beating up their wives and girlfriends, died on Sept. 20 at a hospice near her home in Atlanta. She was 57 and had been a leading voice in the movement to stop violence against women.         Colleagues said the cause was cancer.         Ms. Carlin, a native of Maywood, Neb., who graduated from the University of Nebraska and received a master's in social work there, married right after college and began raising a family, first in Atlanta and later in Houston. She did not begin her career until the mid-1970's, when she and her family returned to Atlanta and settled there for good.         But once she got started, taking a job in suburban Atlanta as director of Georgia's first shelter for battered women, Ms. Carlin became so outraged by what she viewed as society's indifference to the problem that she was soon in the forefront of national efforts to curb domestic violence.         Although Ms. Carlin held high positions in the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, helped found the National Women's Abuse Prevention Project and was keynote speaker at national conferences, her major contribution came as the executive director of Men Stopping Violence, an organization based in Atlanta that she helped establish in 1982.         With a $5 million annual budget, the group seeks to effect change  across the spectrum of what Ms. Carlin described as a continuum of sanctioned abuse of women. In addition to running programs of intensive behavior modification for men with a history of abusing women and training instructors to operate similar programs across the country, the organization works to change the social norms of male supremacy and control that Ms. Carlin came to see as the underlying causes of abuse.         Although the organization has shown some promise -- for example, winning contracts with the military and religious denominations to help them change their organizational cultures to take the issue seriously -- Ms. Carlin did not need to be reminded that her efforts were barely a beginning.         After all, as she was quick to point out, an estimated 3 million to 4 million women suffer some degree of physical abuse at the hands of men each year, and surveys indicate that women in two-thirds of American marriages are battered at least once by their husbands.         And Ms. Carlin, who saw physical violence as just one extreme measure men use to control women, had an answer for anyone who might suggest that in the vast majority of those marriages the violence was so rare as to be inconsequential. She would be ready with a case history to show that a single beating was often all it took for a man to establish domination.         The case involved a woman whose husband beat her severely one Thanksgiving and never laid a hand on her after that -- because he did not have to. As Ms. Carlin recalled, after that all he had to do when his wife balked at bowing to his wishes was to say ''remember Thanksgiving,'' and the terrified wife would submit.         Just as that wife had learned to conduct herself to avoid the serious consequences of displeasing her husband, Ms. Carlin felt that men would decide not to beat their wives at the exact moment that society came to regard domestic abuse as a serious criminal offense to be dealt with swiftly, surely and severely.         And that, she argued, will never happen until society abandons the notion of across-the-board male domination that tends to justify violence against women in the first place. That may be a tall order, but Ms. Carlin was not one to shrink from a challenge. In 1990, for example, she joined a group of women who scaled Mount Kenya, and for all her frustrations in trying to reform an entire society, she knew how to have a good time.         Indeed, her annual high-spirited Christmas parties made such an impression on her staff and friends that they provided an antidote of sorts to the grim ''remember Thanksgiving'' tag line of Ms. Carlin's anecdote of domestic abuse. Or, as those who vowed to continue her work might put it, ''remember Christmas.''         Ms. Carlin is survived by her husband, John; two daughters, Suzanne Rianhard of San Francisco and Elizabeth Carlin of New York; her mother, Arlene Hough of Atlanta, and a sister, Janet Allen of Dallas.       
         Eleanor Lansing Dulles, an economic specialist for the State Department who played a major part in planning the reconstruction of West Berlin in the 1950's, died on Wednesday in the Knollwood military retirement home in Washington. She was 101.         Her death was reported by The Associated Press on Friday.         Mrs. Dulles, who was sometimes called ''the Mother of Berlin'' for her enthusiastic efforts to revitalize the economy and culture of that battered capital as it recovered from World War II, managed to carve for herself a formidable reputation even though her two brothers, John Foster Dulles and Allen Welsh Dulles, held much higher rank in the American Government.         She was offered the State Department's Berlin desk in 1952, just before Foster Dulles was named Secretary of State.         She quickly saw trouble coming, she said in a memoir published in 1980, because Foster had been criticized for using his influence to get Allen the top job in the C.I.A. and wanted to avoid further accusations of nepotism. She was already a career diplomat, and her West Berlin position came through before Mr. Dulles's appointment, yet once he was in office, he tried to force her out. He did not succeed, she noted with some satisfaction.         Mrs. Dulles said it was difficult for a woman to serve in the State Department in that era.         ''This place is a real man's world if ever there was one,'' she said in 1958. ''It's riddled with prejudices. If you are a woman in Government service you just have to work 10 times as hard -- and even then it takes much skill to paddle around the various taboos. But it is fun to see how far you can get in spite of being a woman.''         Mrs. Dulles was born in Watertown, N.Y., one of five children of a Presbyterian minister and his wife. One ancestor, John Welsh, served as envoy to Britain in Rutherford B. Hayes's Administration, and her grandfather John W. Foster and an uncle, Robert Lansing, each served as Secretary of State, under Presidents Benjamin Harrison and Woodrow Wilson, respectively.         She graduated from Bryn Mawr College with a major in social sciences, worked in refugee rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in France after World War I and returned to Bryn Mawr to earn a master's degree in labor and industrial economics.         She took odd jobs in the early 1920's -- running a punch press at the American Tube & Stamping Company in Bridgeport, Conn., and working as payroll clerk for a hair net company in Long Island City, Queens.         She also traveled extensively in Europe, studied at the London School of Economics, investigated industrial methods in 75 British firms and received a master's degree from Radcliffe College and a doctorate in economics from Harvard.         In the 1930's she studied and taught economics and finance in Paris, Geneva, Basel, Boston, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Bryn Mawr. She produced scholarly books including ''The French Franc, 1914-1928,'' ''The Facts and Their Interpretation'' and ''The Bank for International Settlements at Work.'' She wrote more than a dozen books in all.         When she was 30 she met David Simon Blondheim, a philologist who, as an Orthodox Jew, was not regarded by her family as marriage material, she indicated in her memoir. She married him anyway, in 1932. In 1934, not long before the birth of their son, Dr. Blondheim committed suicide.         Mrs. Dulles, who used her maiden surname, entered Government service in 1936 as director of financial research for the Social Security Board. In 1942 she moved on to the State Department. At the Bretton Woods international monetary conference in New Hampshire in 1944, she was a prominent member of the American delegation.         The next year, she went to Vienna as the State Department's financial attache. She demonstrated keen bargaining powers -- helping to feed starving Austrians by arranging the barter of horses for German cabbages and potatoes.         Later, as special assistant to the director of the State Department's office of German affairs, Mrs. Dulles was credited with ''working miracles,'' as one biographer put it. She helped to reduce West German unemployment and increase production.         To hasten those developments, she said, she would ''send requests from Berlin for money and rush back to Washington in time to compose favorable answers.'' She wangled more than $1 billion for West Berlin, adorning it with the now-famous Congress Hall, which Berliners for many years fondly referred to as the ''Dulleseum'' and ''Frau Dulles's Hut,'' as well as a hospital and educational centers.         Beginning in 1959, Mrs. Dulles was assigned to studying foreign aid programs and visited 60 countries on behalf of the State Department's office of intelligence and research.         She left the State Department in 1962, after her brother Allen had been dismissed from the C.I.A. in the wake of the Bay of Pigs catastrophe. Leonard Mosley wrote in his 1978 book ''Dulles'' that early in 1962, during the Kennedy Administration, Secretary of State Dean Rusk summoned her and said, ''The White House has asked me to get rid of you.''         Mrs. Dulles, in her memoirs, ''Eleanor Lansing Dulles: Chances of a Lifetime,'' published in 1980, wrote affectionately of her older brothers but did not hesitate to say that since childhood there were frictions among the siblings. She also admitted that her strong personality won her her share of enemies.         She suffered from poor eyesight since childhood and developed deafness but remained active well into her old age.         Her survivors include her son, David, of Washington, and her daughter, Ann Dulles Joor, of Manlius, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Lidiya Chukovskaya, the Russian writer who risked her life to record the horrors of Stalinism and speak out against the persecutions of dissidents in the Soviet Union, died on Wednesday at her home in Moscow. She was 88.         As a champion of human rights, Miss Chukovskaya criticized the trial of Andrei D. Sinyavsky and Yuli M. Daniel, who were jailed in the 1960's for their  satiric commentaries on the Soviet system. She also defended the dissident nuclear physicist Andrei D. Sakharov in 1973 and lent her country house to Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel Prize-winning author, before he was arrested and deported from the Soviet Union in 1974.         Ideas should be fought with ideas," she said, "not with camps and prisons."         In a statement yesterday, reported by The Associated Press, Mr. Solzhenitsyn  said: "Our literature has lost an exquisite connoisseur of Russian poetry and a  precious witness of the Soviet half-century. She preserved for us concealed treasures, which would have perished but for her."         Mr. Solzhenitsyn called Miss Chukovskaya an "incorruptible" and "passionate"  defender of writers and literature.         Miss Chukovskaya was 66, nearly blind and afflicted with a weak heart when her defense of Mr. Sakharov resulted in her expulsion from the Moscow Writers Union by a unanimous vote in 1974.         Accused of having "slipped into an anti-Soviet swamp," she was in effect blacklisted, since expulsion from the organization deprived writers of the means and the legal right to publish their work.         Summoned to a meeting with the union's secretary, Yuri F. Strekhinin, and another writer, A. M. Mednikov, she was questioned about her criticism of the treatment of dissidents.         "How do you know these things?" she said she was asked.         "From my life," Miss Chukovskaya said she answered. "From mothers, wives, sisters. In order not to see, you have to shut your eyes and cover your ears. It's all around."         "They put one of my friends who was completely healthy in an insane asylum,"  she later recounted having told them. "I knew he was healthy."         She said Mr. Mednikov asked her, "Why does all this happen around you and nothing like that happens around me?"         Miss Chukovskaya replied: "I don't know -- maybe you are living on an island. You make a special effort not to see."         Her differences with the authorities did not end with the breakup of the Soviet Union. When the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, awarded Miss Chukovskaya a literary prize last year, she refused the money because she disagreed with Moscow's military campaign to keep Chechnya a part of Russia, said her longtime friend and English translator, Sylvia Rubashova, who lives in  London.         "She was very uncompromising," Mrs. Rubashova said.         The work that brought Miss Chukovskaya the prize was "The Akhmatova Journals," a recollection of her friendship with the great Russian poet Anna Akhmatova (1889-1966), who lost two husbands to Soviet repression.         Miss Chukovskaya was the daughter of a prominent writer and the widow of an author who died in the Stalinist purges of the 1930's. She was renowned for her  love of poetry and for a prodigious memory that enabled her to save countless poems from destruction by learning them by heart.         Among her other books were "Sofiya Petrovna," written in the winter of 1939-40 but not published until 1967, when it was smuggled to the West and issued under the title "The Deserted House."         The semi-autobiographical novel, set down while the memory of Stalin's Great  Purge was still fresh, conveyed the atmosphere of fear and terror that engulfed  the Soviet Union as the crackdown gathered force.         John J. Stephan, a friend who is a professor of history at the University of  Hawaii, said the manuscript of "Sofiya Petrovna" was passed along and hidden at  a time when its possession would have been tantamount to a death sentence.         She was also the author of "Going Under" (1976), a description of the corruption of writers by Soviet power.         Miss Chukovskaya's "To the Memory of Childhood," also published in 1988, was  a tribute to her father, Kornei Chukovsky, a Russian critic, translator and popular author of children's verse and fairy tales. Covering the years 1910 to 1917, it recalled her upbringing at the family home in Kuokkala on the Gulf of Finland.         Miss Chukovskaya was born on March 23, 1907 in Leningrad and spent her summers in Kuokkala. She served as her father's amanuensis, and in "To the Memory of Childhood" she described him as a humorous, fun-loving man who was passionate about language and fanatical about poetry.         She married M. P. Bronshtein, an eminent physicist who died in prison in 1938. For some years she worked as an editor for a children's book publisher in  Moscow.         Miss Chukovskaya is survived by her daughter, Yelena, of Moscow.
