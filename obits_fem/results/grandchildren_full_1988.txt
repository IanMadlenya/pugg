        Florence Eiseman, a designer of children's clothes who was known for excellent workmanship, top quality fabrics and simple but elegant styles, died of emphysema Friday at Columbia Hospital in Milwaukee, Wis. She was 88 years old and lived in Milwaukee.         Florence Eiseman, a designer of children's clothes who was known for excellent workmanship, top quality fabrics and simple but elegant styles, died of emphysema Friday at Columbia Hospital in Milwaukee, Wis. She was 88 years old and lived in Milwaukee.         A native of Minneapolis, Mrs. Eiseman began her career in 1945 when her husband, Laurence, packed up some of the dainty, organdy pinafores she made as gifts for friends and took them to a buyer at Chicago's Marshall Field & Company. He came home with a $3,000 order.         Ten years later she became the first children's designer to receive the Neiman Marcus award for her contributions to fashion, an honor that has also gone to Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, James Galanos and Norman Norell. Designs Honored by Museum         Early features of Mrs. Eiseman designs included French seams, hand-sewn hems, bound buttonholes and hand-rolled edges. Among those who dressed their children in her clothes were Princess Grace of Monoco, members of the Kennedy family and Elizabeth Taylor.         In 1964 the Denver Art Museum highlighted her career in a fashion retrospective that is believed to be the first time that a designer of children's wear was so honored by a museum.         ''Florence Eiseman has been one of the most influential figures in the children's fashion industry over the last several decades,'' said Carla Slocum, vice president and merchandise manager of children's wear for Saks Fifth Avenue. ''She was responsible for raising the standards of fashion and quality in better children's wear.''         Mr. Eiseman worked closely with his wife until his death in 1967. Their sons, Robert and Laurence Jr., then shared management with their mother and today are chief executive officer and president of the Florence Eiseman Inc. respectively.         In addition to her sons, Mrs. Eiseman is survived by a sister, Eva Tankel, of Minneapolis, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

        Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937.         Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937. But it was in the Roaring Twenties that she put her stamp on American social history, creating in dozens of films the image of the wide-eyed, insouciant flapper with her bobbed hair and short skirts.         There was one other distinction known to every fan, even in the days before Technicolor: she had one brown eye and one blue eye. The eyes sparkled at audiences the world over beginning with the 1923 hit that made her big splash, ''Flaming Youth.'' Her Dutch bob was soon copied by hairdressers across America and her air of an emancipated young woman inspired countless imitations. Actress, Trend-Setter and Author         Miss Moore was at the vanguard of fashion's first revolution of the 20th century as skirts rose above the knee, bosoms vanished and waistlines slid down to the hips.         There followed such films as ''The Perfect Flapper,'' ''Naughty but Nice,'' ''Little Orphan Annie,'' and ''We Moderns.'' Her favorite, she said shortly after the end of her career, was a talkie, ''The Power and the Glory,'' which co-starred Spencer Tracy.         At the height of her popularity she earned a million dollars a year from films and she was also an author, writing ''Silent Star,'' her autobiography and ''How Women Can Make Money in the Stock Market.'' In another work, ''Colleen Moore's Doll House,'' she dealt with an elaborate miniature doll house she built in the mid-1920's that cost $470,000 and was designed in the form of a castle, complete with electricity, running water, an organ and a radio. The doll house later was sent around the country for display in department stores to raise money for charity.         Miss Moore was born Kathleen Morrison in Michigan on Aug. 19, 1902. She arrived in Hollywood at age 15 when an uncle arranged a screen test with the director D. W. Griffith. She wanted to be a second Lillian Gish, playing dramatic roles, but instead found herself playing pure-as-snow heroines in Westerns with stars like Tom Mix. She later observed that she usually came out second best to the star's horse. 'A New Type Was Born'         She had long, curly hair then, but at her mother's suggestion in 1923 she cut the curls off and landed the part of the flapper.         ''Here was a chance for a girl who had straight hair, who was not buxom and not a great beauty,'' she told an interviewer half a century later. ''A new type was born - the American girl.''         In 1926, three years after her flapper had burst upon the screen, Miss Moore wrote: ''Don't worry, girls. No edict of fashion arbiters will ever swathe you in long and cumbersome skirts.'' She added: ''The American girl will see to this. She is independent, a thinker will not follow slavishly the ordinances of those who in the past have decreed this or that for her to wear.''         Although she started the short-skirt fad with her appearances on screen, Miss Moore at first dressed quite differently in private life, favoring jeans, baggy sweaters and saddle shoes. But when she became a national fixture as the flapper, a designer friend accused her of being the worst-dressed woman in Hollywood. She took the criticism to heart and changed her manner of dress, managing to look both the all-American girl and chic and urbane.         In 1937 she married Homer Hargrave, a stockbroker, her third husband, and ended her film career. She had previously been married to a film producer, John McCormick, and a New York broker, Albert F. Scott. Mr. Hargrave was a widower with two children, whom she came to consider her own. He died in 1967.         Four years later Miss Moore hired a builder, Paul Maginot, to construct a home in Hidden Valley south of Paso Robles. In 1983 she and Mr. Maginot were married.         Her husband survives, as does her son, Homer Hargrave Jr. of Paso Robles; her daugher, Mrs. Roger Jackson Coleman, several grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.

        Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Franco's doctor, Dr. Vicente Pozuelo Escudero, said she died of complications from bronchial pneumonia contracted on Feb. 1.         Queen Sofia went to Mrs. Franco's Madrid apartment to deliver condolences to Mrs. Franco's daughter, Carmen Franco de Martinez-Bordiu, 60, and her husband, on behalf of King Juan Carlos and herself.         In 1969, Franco designated Juan Carlos to be his successor, and Juan Carlos resumed the Spanish monarchy two days after Franco's death on Nov. 20, 1975. Figurehead of Movement         When her husband died, Mrs. Franco became the figurehead of a loosely formed organization of Franco's political followers, called ''El Movimiento.'' Each anniversary of Franco's death prompts thousands of fascists to march in the streets.         Mrs. Franco annually attended a funeral Mass in her husband's memory at the underground basilica in the Valley of the Fallen outside Madrid, where thousands of Nationalists killed in the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War are buried.         Ill health kept her from attending the 1987 memorial. An estimated 5,000 people attended the Mass, at the end of which they gave the fascist salute and shouted ''Franco! Franco! Franco!''         Mrs. Franco was born Carmen Polo on July 9, 1900, in the northern city of Oviedo, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. She was educated by Salesian nuns. In Spanish Morocco         She married Francisco Franco, then an up-and-coming army lieutenant colonel, on Oct. 22, 1923, and the couple left soon after for Spanish Morocco, where Franco was responsible for much of the conduct of the Riff Wars and where he built the military power base that served his successful uprising against the Republican Government.         Mrs. Franco exercised a strong influence on her husband, particularly in connection with affairs of the Roman Catholic Church and public morality.         Social historians say her puritanical upbringing was responsible for the heavy censorship of anything touching on sex or sexual matters in Spanish literature, theater and cinema during most of the 1939-75 Franco regime.         A man who answered the telephone at the apartment of Mrs. Franco's daughter said burial was scheduled for Sunday in the village of El Pardo on the outskirts of Madrid.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Franco is survived by seven grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.

        Frances Midlam Kennedy, a former executive vice president of the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton, died of lung cancer Saturday at the home of her daughter in Weston, Mass. She was 75 years old and had lived in Manhattan until last fall.         Frances Midlam Kennedy, a former executive vice president of the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton, died of lung cancer Saturday at the home of her daughter in Weston, Mass. She was 75 years old and had lived in Manhattan until last fall.         With such campaigns as ''What's a woman to do'' for Total cereal and ''Bake a Gold Medal memory'' for the flour brand, Mrs. Kennedy rose to prominence in a field with few women executives. Working for what was then Dancer-Fitzgerald-Sample Inc., she was Chicago's Advertising Woman of the Year in 1960. She moved to the company's office in New York two years later to become a senior vice president and creative director.         For several years until she retired last year, Mrs. Kennedy also headed the company's creative review board and the creative strategy advisory board. Evaluated Campaign Ideas         Eventually, as chairman of D.F.S.'s creative review and advisory boards, she evaluated all campaign ideas before the client got to see them. In 1972, she also started a continually updated project meant to guide advertisers in their approach to women.         A native of Wilmington, Del., Mrs. Kennedy attended public schools and started writing copy for Compton Advertising in New York in 1939, leaving for D.F.S. in 1947. Saatchi & Saatchi, which had taken over Compton and D.-F.S. separately, merged them into the present firm last year.

        Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Mrs. Berlin, the last of whose four novels, ''The Best of Families,'' was published in 1970, was also a prolific short-story writer and contributed several articles to The New Yorker before her marriage to Mr. Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926. Mr. Berlin observed his 100th birthday last May 11.         Their marriage was one of the most sensational social events of the 1920's, for it united the famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, with the former Ellin Mackay, a Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's fortune for love.         The Municipal Court wedding came after several events that made it clear that Ellin Mackay, one of the great beauties of her time, was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill society heiress.         She had all but turned her back on the exclusive so-called 400, which ruled her mother's day, choosing the new ''cafe society.'' She said she preferred the ''dizzy twenties'' to the ''dull old days'' when she was one of New York's most celebrated debutantes. Abandoning 'Polite Society'         Miss Mackay wrote what her friends called her ''saucy but amusing'' opinions in articles for The New Yorker. In one article she defended her generation's abandonment of the Junior League and ''polite society'' for the gayer life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.         ''It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ''They go to find privacy.''         That article shocked society and newspaper editorial writers, as did one that followed in The New Yorker dated Dec. 25, 1925, titled ''The Declining Function,'' in which she explained how, as a liberated young woman, she intended to seek her joys as she liked.         More portentous was her statement, ''Modern girls are conscious of their identity and they marry whom they choose, satisfied to satisfy themselves.'' Less than a month later she married the widowed Mr. Berlin, who was 15 years her senior and an immigrant Russian whose fame as a songwriter failed to impress the Mackay social circle.         The marriage so infuriated her father, Clarence Mackay, whose fortune was based in the Postal Telegragh Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, mining and several other inherited interests, that he barred her from his home and threatened to disinherit her. They were not reconciled until five years later. Marriage of 62 Years         The marriage, during which Mr. Berlin wrote several songs just for her, including ''Always'' and ''The Song Is Ended,'' was a true love match and was to last 62 years.         Ellin Mackay was born March 22, 1903, on her father's $6 million estate in Roslyn, L.I. Her mother was the former Katherine Duer, a successful writer. An aunt, Alice Duer Miller, was to become the author of the long, popular World War II poem ''The White Cliffs of Dover.''         She was also a granddaughter of John W. Mackay, an Irish immigrant and one of the Nevada pioneers who made fortunes from the Comstock Lode. He parlayed his fortune into diversified business interests that made him a billionaire.         Miss Mackay was educated in private schools and took special courses at Barnard College. She was a debutante during the season of 1922-23, when her father gave her a ball at the Ritz-Carlton.         Mr. Mackay, who had been divorced in 1913, doted on little Ellin, and he took her on several trans-Atlantic crossings. Because of their close relationship, he was all the more unwilling to give his blessing to the ''unsuitable'' Mr. Berlin.  In the first few years of her marriage, Mrs. Berlin put aside her budding writing career to have a family. Their only son, Irving Berlin Jr., died in infancy, and they had three daughters. Short Stories and Novels         In 1933 she began contributing short stories to The Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal and other popular magazines. Her first novel, ''Land I Have Chosen,'' was published in 1944. Depicting the evils of Nazi Germany, the novel was sold to the movies for $150,000, then a record. Her other novels were ''Lace Curtain,'' 1948; ''Silver Platter,'' a 1957 semifictional account of her Nevada pioneer forebears, and ''The Best of Families.''         Mrs. Berlin was re-baptized in the Catholic faith in the 1930's, and throughout her life she worshiped at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where a funeral will be held at 2 P.M. Tuesday. She was a major supporter of the Girl Scout movement.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Berlin is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett, of New York; Linda Louise Emmett, of Paris, and Elizabeth Irving Peters, of New York; a brother, John W. Mackay, of Locust Valley, L.I.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

        Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         The immediate cause of the actress's death was not disclosed, but she had been in frail health for several years. She had lived in a condominium in Montecito, a suburb of Santa Barbara, since 1974. For many years previously, she and Mr. March, who died in 1975 at the age of 77, lived in Manhattan and on a 40-acre farm near New Milford, Conn.         Miss Eldridge, who made her New York stage debut in the chorus of Jerome Kern's ''Rockabye Baby,'' in 1918, was a versatile actress who played in touring stock companies, motion pictures and on Broadway. She Played Mary Tyrone         She topped a distinguished career on the stage in 1956 with her memorable portrayal of the tragic drug addict Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical drama, ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' For that performance she was named best actress by the New York Drama Critics Circle.         Miss Eldridge was named Florence McKechnie when she was born on Sept. 5, 1901, in Brooklyn. She graduated from Girls High School and immediately set her sights on an acting career. By 1921 she had made her mark, appearing in the Theater Guild's ''Ambush'' and impelling one critic to call her ''one of the brightest chapters in the season's theatrical history.''         She became one of her era's most celebrated performers, appearing in ''The Cat and the Canary'' (1922), Pirandello's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' (1922), and as the neurotic and spoiled Daisy Buchanan in a stage version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.''         In 1927 she met and appeared opposite Mr. March in Molnar's ''The Swan,'' and they were married within the year. Then, on a repertory tour, they were not allowed to appear in the same plays together, for management considered it unromantic to have a man and wife play lovers. Ascendancy of the Voice         The Marches wound up in Los Angeles in 1928, so the actor could appear in ''The Royal Family'' at a local theater. Sound had just been introduced into films, and Hollywood was eager to give work to stage-trained actors with excellent voices, like Miss Eldridge and Mr. March, and so they settled there.         Miss Eldridge had appeared briefly in a New York-made film in 1923, but her first good movie roles came in 1929, when she made three films, ''The Studio Murder Mystery,'' co-starring Mr. March, ''Charming Sinners'' and ''The Greene Murder Case.'' During the 1930's, while her husband became a major box-office star, she appeared in several movies, including ''The Story of Temple Drake'' (1933), based on William Faulkner's ''Sanctuary,'' ''Les Miserables'' (again with Mr. March, in 1935) and ''Mary of Scotland'' (1936), in which she played Elizabeth I. The acting couple returned to Broadway in 1938 in ''Yr. Obedient Husband,'' a vehicle based on Samuel Pepys's diary, and failed so resoundingly they bought advertising space to apologize. The advertisement, in trade publications, showed the Marches as trapeze artists missing each other's grip in midair. ''Oops, sorry!'' read the caption.  In 1942, during the Broadway run of Thornton Wilder's ''Skin of Our Teeth,'' Miss Eldridge and Mr. March carried on an epic feud with their notoriously temperamental co-star, Tallulah Bankhead. The director of the play, Elia Kazan, in his recent autobiography, ''A Life,'' recalled that nightly, while Miss Eldridge was giving her main speech, Miss Bankhead would conspicuously comb her hair to upstage her. To retaliate, Mr. March stood in the wings gargling loudly while Miss Bankhead gave her big speech. Other Roles Together         In 1948 Miss Eldridge returned to Hollywood to play Mr. March's wife in Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest.'' That same year they appeared in a daring and controversial film about euthanasia, variously called ''An Act of Mercy'' and ''An Act of Murder.'' They also acted together in ''Christopher Columbus,'' in which Miss Eldridge was seen as Queen Isabella, in 1949, and, again playing man and wife, in ''Inherit the Wind,'' in 1960.         The Marches had no children of their own, but adopted two, Anthony and Penelope. Miss Eldridge is survived by her daughter, Penelope Fantacci of Florence, Italy; five grandchildren; a great-granddaughter, and two brothers, David I. McKechnie, who lives in Oregon, and Cromwell McKechnie, of Carpenteria, Calif.

Adela Rogers St. Johns, the journalist, author and screenwriter, died yesterday morning in the South County Convalescent Hospital in Arroyo Grande, Calif., her grandson, George St. Johns, said. She was 94 years old and had lived in Arroyo Grande for several years.         As a journalist for Hearst and other publications, she wrote about such stories as the Leopold-Loeb murder trial, the abdication of Edward VIII, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and the trial of the kidnapper, Bruno Hauptmann.         She also wrote many articles for Photoplay magazine, becoming known as its ''Mother Confessor of Hollywood.''         Her screenwriting included two Tom Mix westerns, and her published fiction included short stories and serials for The Saturday Evening Post, Good Housekeeping and other magazines. Worked for Several Papers         The Hearst publications for which she worked over the years included The San Francisco Examiner, The Los Angeles Herald and The Chicago American. She also worked for the Hearst-owned International News Service.         Mel Durslag, another longtime writer for Hearst publications, said yesterday, ''She was a tough, hard newspaper woman, a figure from the old, roaring days of Hearst journalism, which no longer lives.''         Mrs. St. Johns was the daughter of a California criminal lawyer, and she spent much time in courtrooms in her youth. She wrote in a 1969 volume of memoirs, ''The Honeycomb,'' that what she did not learn at school she had ''learned from pimps, professional prostitutes, gamblers, bank robbers, poets, newspapermen, jury bribers, millionaire dipsomaniacs and murderers.'' Began Career in 1913         She was born in Los Angeles on May 20, 1894, the daughter of Earl Rogers and the former Harriet Belle Greene. She grew up mainly in Los Angeles, attending several schools, including Hollywood High School, and then traveled widely, with time out to study piano in Leipzig.         She began her newspaper career in 1913 as a reporter and feature writer with The San Francisco Examiner. She worked for The Los Angeles Herald from 1914 to 1918, The Chicago American in 1928 and The New York American in 1929.         Mary Pickford, Tom Mix, Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino were some of the celebrities she interviewed over the years.         Mrs. St. Johns's first short story, ''The Black Cat,'' was published in 1918. Her first novel, ''The Sky Rocket'' (1923) became a movie, and so did ''A Free Soul'' (1924) and ''A Single Standard'' (1925). Taught at Universities         She taught at the Graduate School of Journalism of the University of California at Los Angeles from 1950 to 1952, and at other universities over the years.         Her books included ''How to Write a Short Story'' (1952) and ''Affirmative Prayer in Action'' (1955), and ''Final Verdict,'' a biography of her father, in 1962.         Other magazines to which she contributed included McCall's, Ladies Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and Reader's Digest.         Mrs. St. Johns was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Nixon in 1970.         Her 1914 marriage to William Ivan St. Johns ended in divorce in 1929, and so did her subsequent marriages, to Richard Hyland and to Francis P. O'Toole.         She is survived by a daughter, Elaine St. Johns of Arroyo Grande; two sons, McCullah St. Johns of Thousand Oaks, Calif., and Richard Rogers St. Johns of Los Angeles; 10 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren.

        Ray Eames, who as a partner in the design firm The Office of Charles and Ray Eames exerted a powerful influence on furniture and industrial design over the last 40 years, died of cancer on Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         Ray Eames, who as a partner in the design firm The Office of Charles and Ray Eames exerted a powerful influence on furniture and industrial design over the last 40 years, died of cancer on Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         As a professional partner of her husband, Charles, who died in 1978, Ray Eames collaborated in the design of hundreds of chairs, tables, and other pieces of furniture that combined mass production with a high sense of style and comfort.         Their most famous work is the ''Eames Chair,'' two pieces of molded plywood connected by stainless steel tubing. Other chairs and tables designed by the Eameses, who worked in Venice, Cal., were made from such materials as reinforced plastic and fiberglas.         Today, their designs are commonly found in airports, high schools and hospitals in mass-produced form, and as showpieces in the most stylish offices and homes. Their Home Was a Showcase         The Eameses' home in Santa Monica, Calif., was designed and built in 1949 as a demonstration project to encourage the use of mass-produced industrial materials. Virtually all of the materials used were bought out of manufacturers' catalogues. The house was a harbinger of the era of prefabricated buildings, but was also widely praised for the lightness, delicacy, intelligence and beauty of its design.         Mrs. Eames, a painter by training, and Mr. Eames, an architect, collaborated in dozens of design projects ranging from films and books to fabric design and museum exhibitions.         Their work in films was especially noted. Most of the films were educational, and many attempted to make scientific notions understandable to a wide public through striking visual means.         The best-known of these efforts is ''Powers of Ten,'' completed by the Eameses in 1968 for the Commission on College Physics. The film illustrates the concept of tenfold magnification by zooming a camera from the surface of the earth to the edge of the universe, then back down to a carbon atom in a man's hand.         A native of Sacramento, Calif., Mrs. Eames was trained as a painter, and studied with Hans Hoffman in New York City for six years in the 1930's. In 1940, she met Mr. Eames, an architect, at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. They married and moved to California in 1941.         Mrs. Eames is survived by her daughter, Lucia Demetrios of San Francisco, and by five grandchildren.

Sweet in 1842. Her sister, Lea Lake, died in April at 89 after having been a co-owner of Sweets since 1933, when their father died.         Mrs. McFarland was involved with the restaurant in childhood but was associated for several decades with Ohrbach's specialty store. In 1962, after her retirement there, she rejoined Sweets. She worked there until two years ago, when she was severely injured by an intruder at the restaurant during the victory parade in lower Manhattan for the New York Mets, who had won the World Series.         Mrs. McFarland is survived by two sons, John, of East Hanover, N.J., and Benjamin, of Andover, N.J.; five grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.

        Nancy Hale, a novelist and short-story writer, died Saturday at the Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Va., after suffering a stroke. She was 80 years old and lived in Charlottesville.         Nancy Hale, a novelist and short-story writer, died Saturday at the Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Va., after suffering a stroke. She was 80 years old and lived in Charlottesville.         Flickers of prim Boston, social New York and proper Virginia danced through her works, the earlier ones focusing on the follies and foibles of well-bred women.         ''I specialize in women,'' Miss Hale said in an interview in 1942, ''because they are so mysterious to me. I feel that I know men quite thoroughly, that I know how, in a given situation, a man is apt to react. But women puzzle me.''         Nancy Hale was born in Boston on May 6, 1908, the daughter of Philip L. Hale and Lilian Westcott Hale, both painters. As a toddler she played in their studios, often setting up a palette and trying to copy whatever they were working on. Brief Career Painting         She graduated from the Winsor School in Boston in 1926, studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and worked briefly as a painter.         Bored with Boston, she moved to New York in 1928. After working as an assistant editor at Vogue (''I pinch-hit as a model''), she joined The New York Times as a reporter. In 1929 she began to contribute ''casuals'' - humorous sketches - and stories to The New Yorker.         She became one of the New Yorker's best-known writers, and once boasted that she sold the magazine more stories in a single year than any other writer. First Novel About the Young         Miss Hale's first novel, ''The Young Die Good,'' was published in 1932. It was based on her idea that young New Yorkers wanted something more than they were getting in life but had neither ''the courage nor strength to go out and get it.'' Her second novel, ''Never Any More,'' appeared in 1934, followed in 1936 by a collection of short stories, ''The Earliest Dreams.''         Among her other works were ''New England Discovery'' (1963), ''Life in the Studio'' (1969), ''Secrets'' (1971), ''Mary Cassatt'' (1975) and ''The Night of the Hurricane'' (1978).         She is survived by her husband, Fredson T. Bowers, of Charlottesville, a former chairman of the English department of the University of Virginia; two sons by previous marriages, William Wertenbaker, of New Haven, Conn., and Mark Hardin; five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Dr. Myrtle Bryan McGraw, a psychologist and researcher in child development, died of pnuemonia last Tuesday at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 89 years old.         Dr. McGraw, whose work was hailed by Dr. John Dewey, the educator and philospher, conducted a behavior study with the Woods twins, Johnny and Jimmy, and others at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, where she was associate director of the Normal Child Development Center from 1930 to 1942.

She was 84 years old.         Dorothy Scott Gerber, the widow of Daniel F. Gerber, who founded the Gerber Products Company, died in her sleep Sunday at her home in Fremont, Mich., according to a company spokesman. She was 84 years old.         Mrs. Gerber played a key role in the introduction of Gerber baby food in 1928. Tired of straining foods for her own children, it occurred to her that if the Fremont Canning Company could puree tomatoes, it could also puree fruits and vegetables. Fremont was the predecessor to Gerber Products; the name was changed in 1941.         Her husband thought the idea was sound and that other mothers might welcome commercially strained baby foods if they could be sold cheaply at regular grocery outlets.         The first batches of strained vegetables were then produced. Mrs. Gerber, a native of Ithaca, Mich., who married Daniel Gerber in 1923, liked them and, more important, so did her 7-month-old daughter Sally. The new baby food was priced at 15 cents, considerably cheaper than similar foods, which until then had been obtainable largely through drug stores at 40 to 60 cents each.         Besides her daughter, Sally Phinny of Fremont, Mrs. Gerber is survived by four other children, Paula Warm of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Gay Cummings, Scottie Merrill and Daniel Gerber Jr., all of Fremont. She is also survived by 18 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren.

She was 65 years old and had homes in Holmby Hills, Calif., and London.         As Bonita Granville, the actress was the epitome of malevolent little girls, particularly in ''These Three,'' Lillian Hellman's heterosexual film adaptation of her play about lebsianism, ''The Children's Hour.'' The performance won the actress a 1936 Oscar nomination.         Among her more than 50 other movies were ''Ah, Wilderness!'' (1935), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Maid of Salem'' (1937), ''Quality Street'' (1937), ''Now Voyager'' (1942) and ''Hitler's Children'' (1943). The spunky blond actress also played the inquisitive title role in the ''Nancy Drew'' detective-reporter series. A Family of Entertainers         She was born in Manhattan on Feb. 2, 1923, into a family of entertainers and went on the stage at 3. She became a leading lady in films of the late 40's and retired from the screen in 1947 to marry Mr. Wrather. She appeared occasionally in television plays and, in 1958, became the associate producer of her husband's popular ''Lassie'' television series and later its producer.         Mr. Wrather was a founding member of the ''kitchen cabinet'' of prominent Californians who encouraged Ronald Reagan to run for Governor in 1967, and he and his wife were close friends of the Reagans. In a statment by the White House yesterday, the President and his wife lauded Mrs. Wrather as ''a warm and caring friend'' who had for so many years ''enriched our lives with her sparkling personality, her wonderful sense of humor, her loyalty and her love.''         Mrs. Wrather held a series of major executive posts in the Wrather Corporation and succeeded her husband as board chairman after his death in 1984, holding the post until last January, when the company was sold to the Walt Disney Company and Industrial Equity (Pacific) Limited, a Hong Kong investment concern. Civic Appointments         Mrs. Wrather was the chairman of the American Film Institute, a trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center and of Loyola Marymount University, a director and former president of the Los Angeles Orphanage Guild, a member of the advisory committee of the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles, a founder and board member of the Los Angeles Music Center and a board member of the Women's Council of the Public Broadcasting Service's Channel 28 there.         For her work on the ''Lassie'' television series and for talks around the country in behalf of environmental conservation, Mrs. Wrather received a Boy Scouts of America National Award and a National 4-H Congress Conservation Award.         Surviving are two daugthers, Molly Dolle and Linda Finocchiaro; a son, Christopher, and nine grandchildren, all of the Los Angeles area.

        Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Feinberg was the author of nine novels including ''A World Full of Strangers,'' ''Fairytales,'' ''The Days of Winter,'' ''Portraits,'' ''Come Pour the Wine'' and ''Seasons of the Heart.'' Her books have been translated into 33 languages and sold more than 20 million copies.         Mrs. Feinberg was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a child of German immigrants, and was brought up in San Francisco from the age of 6 months. She dropped out of school in the sixth grade and continued her education by auditing classes at the University of California at Berkeley. Seeking a Sedentary Pursuit         At 18, she married Dr. Herman Feinberg, who was her grandmother's physician. Subsequently Mrs. Feinberg became an interior decorator for 25 years, until a serious illness forced her to take up a more sedentary activity.         ''I'd been writing all my life - little things for Hadassah, plays for the Sisterhood,'' she said in a 1980 interview. ''I never thought of myself as a writer, but the simplest thing seemed to be to put a piece of paper in the roller and start typing.''         Her first novel was not published until she was 55. It took her four years to write ''A World Full of Strangers,'' chronicling four generations in the life of a Jewish family in the United States.         The novel was rejected by four houses before it was published in 1975 by the Arbor House Publishing Company. It sold 20,000 hard-cover books, ''a very respectable figure for a first novel,'' said Donald I. Fine, her first publisher, who edited her first six novels. The book went on to sell nearly 2 million copies in paperback. Explanation of Success         Although her books were not received enthusiastically by reviewers, they were immensely successful. Gilbert Millstein, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said about ''A World Full of Strangers'': ''It is soap opera - in this case, Jewish soap opera - and the audience for soap opera, in print or on televsion, Jewish or not, runs into the millions.''         ''The Last Princess,'' which was her final book, was published last April and will be brought out in paperback next spring. ''We know of no other book she was working on,'' said a spokesman for G. P. Putnam's Sons, which published her last three novels, all of them best sellers. Her Common Theme         A common theme of the novels was the struggle of Jewish immigrants to make themselves at home in the United States while holding true to their traditions. ''I'm very interested in the perpetuation of Jewish life,'' she once said. ''My own family is very close. I suppose that's why I'm drawn to family sagas.''         Mrs. Feinberg's husband died in May 1986, and her daughter, Arlene, died in an automobile accident in 1985.         Mrs. Feinberg is survived by her father, Albert C. Freeman of Atherton, Calif.; two sisters, Ruth Sevier of San Francisco and Helen Dwane of Redwood City, Calif.; a son, Sheldon, of Danville, Calif.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

Ruth Harris Bunche, a former teacher and the widow of Ralph J. Bunche, the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former Under Secretary General at the United Nations, died of pancreatic cancer yesterday at her home in Kew Gardens, Queens. She was 82 years old.         Mrs. Bunche was active in many civic and community organizations over the years. She served as a director on a number of boards, among them the New York City Youth Board, the Inwood House for Unwed Mothers, the Japan International Christian University and the advisory board of the Metropolitan Chapter of the United Nations Association of the United States of America. At her death, she was a board member of the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations, the Irving Berlin God Bless America Fund and the Play Schools Association, which honored her last year for 37 years of service.         Mrs. Bunche was a native of Montgomery, Ala., where her father had been a Republican national committeeman and an advocate of civil rights. She met her husband when she was a first-grade teacher at a school in Washington, where Mr. Bunche was a political science professor at Howard University. They were married in 1930; he died in 1971.         She is survived by a daughter, Joan, of Manhattan; a son, Ralph Jr., of London; a sister, Aileen Davis of Washington; a brother, Booker Harris of Hartford, and six grandchildren.         A service will be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home at 1076 Madison Avenue on Tuesday at 1 P.M.       
        Miranda Reeves, a slave's daughter who was believed to be 113 years old, died Thursday at a convalescent home here.         Miranda Reeves, a slave's daughter who was believed to be 113 years old, died Thursday at a convalescent home here.         Her oldest grandddaughter, Ruby Fletcher, 57 years old, said her grandmother, a native of Camden, S.C., moved to Connecticut in the 1940's.         Mrs. Fletcher said survivors included two daughters, Cathron Harris and Thelma Ford, both of Colchester; 9 grandchildren; 39 great-grandchildren; 40 great-great-grandchildren and 1 great-great-great-grandchild.         Her exact age could never be officially verified. At her last birthday, Mary Ellen Klinck, State Commissioner on Aging, said that if she were indeed 113 she would be Connecticut's oldest resident.       
        Vet Boswell, the last surviving member of the popular and influential 1930's singing trio the Boswell Sisters, died Saturday. She was 77 years old and lived here.         Vet Boswell, the last surviving member of the popular and influential 1930's singing trio the Boswell Sisters, died Saturday. She was 77 years old and lived here.         Miss Boswell died in Peekskill Community Hospital, where she had been admitted with pneumonia, her daughter, Chica Minnerly, said.         Helvetia Boswell - she was known by her nickname - and her sisters Martha and Connee were born and brought up in New Orleans.         They gained fame in the late 1920's and early 30's for harmonies and arrangements that filtered jazz and blues into a style that was a precursor of swing and influenced such performers as Ella Fitzgerald, the Mills Brothers and the Andrews Sisters.         Among the trio's popular songs were ''Dinah,'' ''Yes Sir, That's My Baby,'' ''The Music Goes Round and Round'' and ''Top Hat.'' They appeared in three feature films and several shorts.         She retired from performing when the trio broke up. Martha died in 1958 and Connee, who had a successful solo career, died in 1976.         Vet Boswell is survived by her daughter, three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
        Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Miss Graham, who also served as a war correspondent in Europe in World War II and who at various times had her own Hollywood-based radio and television shows, is probably best remembered for her love affair with F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose last unhappy years she described in her first book, ''Beloved Infidel,'' published in 1958.         That book concentrated on the Pygmalion and Galatea aspect of the relationship between the novelist and Miss Graham, in which he created a ''college of one'' for her, drawing up lists of books she read to complete ''the education of a woman,'' as her book was subtitled. 'The Very Best Portrait'         ''Beloved Infidel,'' which Miss Graham wrote in collaboration with Gerold Frank, became an international best seller, received critical approval for its warmth and authenticity, and was hailed by Edmund Wilson in a long review in The New Yorker as ''the very best portrait of Fitzgerald that has yet been put into print.''         Born into poverty in an East London slum, Miss Graham parlayed a native intelligence and her great good looks, under the guidance of several worldly and cultivated men, into a reputation as a bright, brittle and often witty sophisticate.         She labored under no illusions, however, and late in life characterized herself as ''a fascinating fake who pulled the wool over Hollywood's eyes.'' She was also not above turning her talent for abrasive criticism of ''the lightweight pinheads of Hollywood'' upon herself.         For example, in ''The Rest of the Story,'' published in 1964, she wrote: ''Sitting at my typewriter, banging out the items, I sometimes laugh as I stir my witch's brew, putting in the onions and the herbs to give indigestion to people I don't like or to those I think have slighted me, the great me. And it's true that I sometimes mistake my typewriter for my teeth, because the more I bite the more my column will be read.'' A Hard Childhood         Miss Graham's real name was Lily Shiel, which ''to this day horrifies me to a degree impossible to explain,'' she wrote in ''Beloved Infidel.'' When she was an infant, she said, her father died of tuberculosis, and her childhood was characterized by a string of Dickensian hardships. For six years she lived with her mother, a domestic, in a rented basement room, then wound up in an orphanage. As a young woman, she put in a brief stint as a domestic, which she hated, and then went to work in Gamage's department store as a toothbrush demonstrator. Miss Graham said she got the job because she was pretty and had a dazzling smile and perfect teeth, ''thanks to a sweets-deprived childhood in the orphanage.''         At Gamage's she met her first Pygmalion, Maj. John Graham Gillam, who employed her in the iron and steel company in which he was an executive, taught her table manners and coached her to free herself of her Cockney accent. After their marriage, she adopted the name of Sheilah Graham, studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and finally was hired as a chorus girl by C. B. Cochran, the British equivalent of Florenz Zeigfeld, who put her in a 1927 musical revue called ''One Dam Thing After Another.'' When the star fell ill, Miss Graham went on in her place, and, of course, was a smashing success, she said.         Cochran signed her to a contract for other shows and she soon began selling articles about show business to the penny press. She recognized that as a writer she possessed a quality of ''salable mediocrity,'' she said, and decided to carve out a career in journalism. At Home in Hollywood         In 1933, Miss Graham said, she moved to New York and for two years wrote for The New York Mirror and The Evening Journal. In 1935 she was offered North American Newspaper Alliance's syndicated Hollywood column, and she moved to Los Angeles. She divorced Major Gillam in 1937.  She felt at home in Hollywood, more so than she had in New York, she said, because ''Hollywood was notorious even in London for the ignorance of the people who made the films - no one could embarrass me with erudite conversation.''         It was in July 1937, at a party given for her by Robert Benchley to celebrate her engagement to the Marquess of Donegall, that she met Fitzgerald. It was love at first sight for both of them, she said. She broke off her angagement and entered into an affair with Fitzgerald that was to last more than three years, until Dec. 21, 1940, when he died in her arms.         The years with Fitzgerald were, for Miss Graham, both idyllic and harrowing. The famed novelist was in failing health, fighting an epic and losing battle with alcoholism. He looked upon himself as a burned-out case, and he was having trouble turning out movie scripts to pay for his daughter's education and his wife Zelda's mental asylum bills.         But they were devoted to one another and Miss Graham gave him not only her love and patience but also a measure of peace of mind. She served as the model for Kathleen, the heroine in ''The Last Tycoon,'' the Fitzgerald novel that was unfinished at his death.         ''I was never a mistress,'' Miss Graham said. ''I was a woman who loved Scott Fitzgerald for better or worse until he died.'' War Correspondent in England         After his death Miss Graham returned to England as a war correspondent. It was there that she met, and married in 1941, Trevor Cresswell Lawrence Westbrook, an executive of the company that manufactured the Spitfire fighter plane. Before the marriage ended in divorce in 1946, they had two children, Wendy and Robert. A brief third marriage, in 1953, to a man she identified only as ''an American of Polish ancestry with an unpronounceable name,'' also ended in divorce.         Miss Graham resumed her Hollywood column after the war and, to earn as much money as she could, also wrote for magazines and conducted a radio show and a television show, ''Hollywood Today,'' in the mid-1950's. By 1964 Time magazine could report that Miss Graham had ''deposed Hopper and Parsons as doyenne of the Hollywood columnists,'' appearing in 178 newspapers, compared to about 100 for Miss Hopper and 69 for Miss Parsons.         Miss Graham also produced several more books, three of them centering on Fitzgerald - ''The Real Scott Fitzgerald,'' ''The Rest of the Story'' and ''College of One.'' That volume, published in 1967, after Miss Graham found the handwritten Fitzgerald ''curriculum'' he created for her, listed his favorite books and musical works that he insisted she become familiar with. Other Graham books included ''The Garden of Allah,'' ''Confessions of a Gossip Columnist'' and the steamy autobiographical novel ''A State of Heat'' (1972). She also published ''Hollywood Revisited'' in 1985.         Miss Graham is survived by her daughter, Wendy Fairey, who is dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Brooklyn College; her son, Robert Westbrook, now living in Khania, Crete; and by three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in New York next month.

        Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         The widow of Morris Cafritz, a wealthy real estate entrepreneur, Mrs. Cafritz glittered on the capital's social scene in the 1950's and 1960's. As president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, she oversaw annual contributions of about $6 million to local community and arts organizations.         Mrs. Cafritz combined wealth, effervescence and numerous contacts in business and government into a potent concoction of lavish entertainments that, in Washington, are as much a part of political life as sessions of Congress.         Initially, she competed with Pearl Mesta as Washington's premier hostess, the two vying to snare the most prominent guests. After Mrs. Mesta was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949, Mrs. Cafritz undertook her campaign in earnest. A four-page account in Life magazine depicted her favorite summer soiree - one or two hundred guests, in evening dress, gathered for mint juleps and steaks on the barbecue in her backyard overlooking all of Washington.         She gave dozens of parties every year in her 57-room, white brick mansion on a seven-acre hilltop that included a basement night club with illuminated dance floor, a gym and an Olympic-size swimming pool. Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, Ambassadors, movie stars, Supreme Court Justices and heads of state played happily there over four administrations.         Born in Budapest, Mrs. Cafritz was the daughter of a Hungarian father and an American mother. She was a graduate of the University of Budapest. In the 1920's the family moved to Washington.         She met her husband in 1928 and they were married the next year. He died in 1964. In the early 1970's Mrs. Cafritz was forced to withdraw from the social scene because of poor health.         Surviving are three sons, Calvin, Carter and Conrad, all of Washington, and 13 grandchildren.       
        Adele Scott Saul, the first woman in Philadelphia to run for Congress, died Dec. 6 at her former home in Rose Valley, Pa. She was 101 years old and lived in Key West, Fla.         Adele Scott Saul, the first woman in Philadelphia to run for Congress, died Dec. 6 at her former home in Rose Valley, Pa. She was 101 years old and lived in Key West, Fla.         Mrs.Saul, a graduate of Smith College, was active for years in Democractic politics. She ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1940.         She was a former board member of the Woman's Medical College in Philadelphia and a former trustee of Bennington College.         Surviving are her daughter, Barbara Sprogell Jacobson, of New Hope, Pa., and Manhattan; a sister, Mildred Scott Olmsted, of Rose Valley; six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
        Melanie Kahane, an interior designer whose bold use of color created a new look for homes, died of lung cancer Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old. Miss Kahane, the widow of Ben Grauer, a broadcaster for NBC News, caught the public's eye in 1946, when she designed one of the first colored kitchen appliances, a shiny red stove.         Melanie Kahane, an interior designer whose bold use of color created a new look for homes, died of lung cancer Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old. Miss Kahane, the widow of Ben Grauer, a broadcaster for NBC News, caught the public's eye in 1946, when she designed one of the first colored kitchen appliances, a shiny red stove. In 1949, her design for a black-and-white French provincial bedroom accented with pumpkin-colored furniture became one of the most photographed interiors in magazines and books.         ''She was a great inspiration when I was a student in the 50's,'' said Mario Buatta, an interior designer in Manhattan. ''I remember rooms in pink and orange. It was very distinctive. Her work had guts.''         Miss Kahane (pronounced ka-HAIN) was born in Manhattan. She graduated from the Parsons School of Design and worked as an illustrator of women's clothing. In 1939, she went into business as an interior designer. 'The Ability to Visualize'         She designed light bulbs, hotels, studio apartments and theaters. A client, Anne Windfohr Marion, is the second generation of her family to be a client. ''She did mother's house when I was 15,'' said Mrs. Marion, whose husband, John, is chairman of Sotheby's North America. ''She was very easy to work with, a vital, energetic person.''         Miss Kahane had the ability to charm clients while sticking firmly to her finely honed esthetic of glamour and tasteful pizzazz. ''The decorator has the ability to visualize a finished room before it is begun,'' she said, ''and the strength of character not to deviate from a plan, no matter what the opinion of loving friends and relatives.''         After she married, Miss Kahane transformed her dining room into a library for Mr. Grauer's book collection. Then she moved the dining table back in, creating another much-photographed interior. The couple appeared together on an NBC Radio program, ''Decorating Wavelengths,'' which offered news and advice.         Miss Kahane produced a television documentary on contemporary Scandinavian design. She was on the design committee for the United States Pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels. In 1959, Miss Kahane traveled to the Soviet Union for NBC to record women's views. Under the aegis of the State Department, she conducted symposiums on textiles in Southeast Asian countries. Book for Children         Miss Kahane was a fellow and former treasurer of the American Institute of Interior Designers, a former president of the Decorators Club and an honorary life member of the American Society of Interior Designers.         She wrote a book for children, ''There's a Decorator in Your Doll House,'' published by Atheneum in 1968. In 1985, she was inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame.         Miss Kahane had a wit that was often as sharp as her clothing. In an interview in which she revealed that much of the art in her home had been bought by her husband without consultation, she observed, ''When a man's wife is a decorator, he frequently gets the compulsion to assert himself.''         Her recipe for a happy marriage included two sinks in the bathroom. ''A great meeting place,'' she noted.         Surviving are her daughter, Joan Ebenstein Porter of Pipersville, Pa., and two grandchildren. A memorial will be held Jan. 19 at 10:30 A.M. at the David M. Schwartz Center at Parsons, 560 Seventh Avenue at 40th Street.
