         Martha Barber Montgomery, assistant vice president for program evaluation at Drexel University in Philadelphia, died Saturday at Presbyterian Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 62 years old..         She died of cancer, university officials said.         Dr. Montgomery, who held a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Pennsylvania, joined the Drexel faculty in 1972. She was chairman of the humanities and communications department from 1976 to 1985, and was assistant vice president for research and development before being assigned to her post in program evaluation.         She was an author and lecturer on professional ethics, a past chairman of the Pennsylvania Humanities Council and a member of the National Architectural Accrediting Board. She also worked on the accreditation of various academic programs for the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.         Dr. Montgomery, who lived in Philadelphia, was the fiancee of Prof. George L. Farre of Reston, Va. She is survived by her parents, Willard F. and Gladys Dorris Barber of Washington; two sons, DeWitt H. Montgomery 3d of Portland, Ore., and Dr. Owen C. Montgomery of Philadelphia; two daughters, Dr. Mary Montgomery Sickles of Larchmont, N.Y., and Dr. Ruth Rebecca Montgomery of Hamden, Conn., and 10 grandchildren.       
         Beatrice I. Lerner, a longtime Democratic party worker and government aide in New Jersey and a leader in Jewish, cultural and charitable causes, died on Monday at the Cedar Grove Manor Convalescent Home in Cedar Grove, N.J. She was 76 years old and was a resident of South Orange, N.J.         She died of complications from Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Mrs. Lerner worked as an assistant to Senator Harrison A. Williams and Governors Robert Meyner and Brendan T. Byrne. She also worked in the presidential campaigns of John F. Kennedy and George McGovern.         She served as president of the Garden State Ballet and the New Jersey Ballet and on the board of the Zionist Organization of America.         A native of Newark, Mrs. Lerner studied drama at New York University and wrote several plays.         Surviving are her husband, Joseph H., a retired judge; a daughter, Patricia Vradenburg, a screenwriter, of Encino, Calif.; a son, Michael, editor of Tikkun magazine, of Berkeley, Calif.; a brother, Irving Hirschman of Basking Ridge, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Gertrude Shurr, who performed in the 1920's and 30's with such pioneering American modern dance companies as Denishawn, the Humphrey-Weidman Concert Company and the early Martha Graham company, died on Thursday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 88 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Dr. Rachael Yocom, a friend.         Born in Riga, Latvia, Miss Shurr came to the United States as a child. Her first professional fee, as she later described it, was a penny she earned dancing in the streets with an organ grinder whose music she liked. She began her formal dance training at the Denishawn school of Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn and also studied with Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Martha Graham. Taught Notable Figures         She danced with the Denishawn company from 1925 to 1927, leaving to join the earliest Humphrey-Weidman company, with which she danced from 1927 to 1929. She left to teach at the Graham school, corralling students at other studios for Miss Graham's first classes for adults. Miss Shurr joined the Graham company in 1930, dancing in many Graham classics in her eight years there. Among them was "Primitive Mysteries," which she helped Miss Graham revive in 1982.         Miss Shurr left the Graham troupe to perform with May O'Donnell, another company member, with whom she opened a dance studio in New York City; students there included Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino, who later founded the Joffrey Ballet. In the early 1940's she received bachelor's and master's degrees in physical education, specializing in dance, from San Francisco State College and the University of Oregon, respectively.         Miss Shurr taught at the High School of Performing Arts in New York for more than two decades, serving as chairman of the dance department for three years. A tiny woman with a robust sense of humor, she established a reputation as a tough but loyal and influential teacher. Her students included the entertainers Ben Vereen and Liza Minnelli. She also was assistant choreographer for the Broadway musicals "Sadie Thompson" (1944) and "Top Banana" (1951).         Miss Shurr retired in 1971 but continued to work sporadically as a rehearsal coach. She was a dance adviser for the Arizona Commission on the Arts and directed the University of Utah's Opportunity Theater and Dance Workshop, a summer program. Last year she was named an Arizona Dance Treasure by the Arizona Dance Arts Alliance.         She is survived by her brother, George, of Manhattan.       
         Dr. Carole Chenitz-Manley, a nursing administrator, educator and researcher who became an advocate for women with AIDS, died Tuesday at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, Calif. She was 45 years old and lived in Greenbrae.         The cause of death was AIDS-related pneumonia, her family said.         When Dr. Chenitz-Manley learned she had AIDS in 1988, she quit her job at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in San Francisco and began speaking around the country for the National Association of People with AIDS. Her focus was on women. She did not disclose how she was infected except to say it was not by exposure to an AIDS patient in medical work.         Dr. Chenitz-Manley was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from Kings County Hospital Center School of Nursing and Boston College and earned a master's degree and a doctorate at Columbia University.         At her retirement she was the associate chief for research in the nursing service at the hospital and an assistant professor at the University of California at San Francisco. She also worked in family therapy at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto.         Her first marriage, to William Chenitz, ended in divorce. Surviving are her husband, Ray Manley; two daughters, Rebecca Chenitz of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Kim Manley of Greenbrae; a sister, Lucille Allison of Greenbrae, and her mother, Yvette Allison of Summerfield, Fla.       
         Marguerite Ross Barnett, who as president of the University of Houston was the first black woman to lead a major American university, died yesterday at Maui Memorial Hospital in Wailuku, Hawaii. She was 49 years old.         She had a blood disorder involving hypoglycemia and metastatic cancer, said Timothy Maloney, the hospital administrator. Dr. Barnett was on medical leave from the University of Houston, where she had been president since 1990. She was visiting Hawaii with her husband, Walter E. King, on a trip to where they had spent their honeymoon.         Before becoming president at Houston, Dr. Barnett had been an administrator at other major universities, including the City University of New York. She had a reputation as a successful fund-raiser and a pragmatic academic who urged that urban universities play a dominant role in spurring economic growth and solving social problems in the same way that land-grant colleges of a century ago did in developing America's agricultural economy.  Seeking Stronger Links         "What will characterize the superb 21st century university," she said at her inaugural in 1990, "will be its ability to manifest and focus areas of unquestioned institutional excellence on the challenging issues of the day."         Her views were representative of a substantial shift in higher education as universities, once isolated from their locales, sought stronger connections to their surroundings. And in many ways, Dr. Barnett was seen as representing a new generation of educational leader. While she had access to politicians and business leaders, she also worked to reach out to the public schools where she worked.         As vice-chancellor for academic affairs at the City University of New York from 1983 to 1986, she was instrumental in establishing a program to help poor high school students make the transition to college and good jobs. She instituted a similar program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, where she was chancellor from 1986 to 1990, and did the same in Houston.         Houston is a public university with 33,000 students that performs $45 million a year in scientific research. It has become especially well known for its work in superconductivity. Recording Firsts         In 1989, Dr. Barnett was considered a leading candidate to replace Chancellor Richard R. Green of the New York City schools after Dr. Green died. The position went to Joseph A. Fernandez.         When she was named the first black and the first woman to be president of the University of Houston, there were few other women in charge of colleges that were neither historically black nor all female, a situation that still exists. The only woman to lead a campus larger than the University of Houston is Donna Shalala, who is chancellor of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, which has 38,000 students.         But Dr. Barnett constantly tried to play down the racial distinction of her position. When interviewers persisted in asking her how it felt to be the first black woman to head the University of Houston, she would turn to her assistant, Wendy H. Adair, and ask "Well, how does it feel to be the first red-haired associate vice president of the university?" That usually ended the conversation.         During her brief tenure in Houston, Dr. Barnett became a leading spokeswoman for urban universities and university-driven economic development. She also played a key role in raising more than $150 million for her institution, including a donation of more than $50 million from an alumnus, John Moores, one of the largest gifts ever made to a publicly financed university.         Dr. Barnett was born in Charlottesville, Va., on May 21, 1942. She graduated from Antioch College in 1964 and received her master of science and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Chicago. She taught at the University of Chicago and at Princeton, Howard and Columbia universities before turning to university administration.         She was a member of the boards of the Student Loan Association and the Educational Testing Service. Last July she was the only university representative named to the President's Commission on Environmental Quality, a group that will recommend ways to slow the destruction of the environment without restricting business excessively.         Dr. Barnett is survived by Mr. King; her daughter by a previous marriage, Amy Barnett, of New York City, and her mother, Mary Eubanks, of Houston.       
         Shirley R. Levittan, an Acting State Supreme Court judge from 1974 until she retired last year, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pemphigus vulgaris, a rare skin disease, a court spokeswoman said.         Before her service on the State Supreme Court, Justice Levittan sat on New York City's Criminal Court and Civil Court, where she was first appointed in 1969. Before her appointment, she was a law clerk to Justice Samuel H. Hofstadler of State Supreme Court.         Judge Levittan, who was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 8, 1918, graduated from Barnard College in 1939 and received a master's degree in French literature a year later at Syracuse University. During World War II, she was attached to the Office of Strategic Services in Paris, London and Germany. She also worked as the executive assistant to the Principal of the Ramaz School, a Jewish day school on Manhattan's East Side. Taught French and English         After traveling and teaching English and French, she entered New York Law School, where she got a law degree in 1956. She worked for several years in private practice and was appointed to several state and city commissions, including the Temporary Commission on the Courts, where she drafted reports on the Family Court and adoption as well as drafted proposed legislation.         Justice Levittan served as an officer of the New York Women's Bar Association and was a member of the New York city and state bar associations and the National Association of Women Lawyers.         During her judicial career, she wrote and lectured often on the Constitution, adoption, pornography, alimony and divorce and the rights of children.         The judge, who was not married, is survived by a sister-in-law, Olive Levittan of Halifax, Nova Scotia.       
         Marion F. Schappel, a retired vice president at Citibank and one of the first women there to reach that rank, died on Wednesday at her home in Somers, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died of complications of cancer, her family said.         Miss Schappel was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Mahwah, N.J. She started at Citibank when she was 18, after graduation from high school. Her first job was as a page. She worked her way up to become secretary to a branch manager. After years of experience, she often found herself explaining procedures to younger male executive trainees.         In 1961 she was promoted to assistant manager, only the third woman in the bank's 151-year history to hold such a post. By 1964 there were a dozen female assistant managers and she was chosen from them to study at the Stonier Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers University. She and 22 other students from other banks that year were the first women admitted at Stonier.         In 1965 she was one of four women promoted to assistant vice president at Citibank and in 1972 became a vice president. Most of her work was in branch banking. She spent 22 years in the branch at the bank's headquarters at 399 Park Avenue in Manhattan and became its manager. She was also manager of the branch in the Pan Am Building. She retired from full-time work in 1987 but continued as a consultant to the bank for three years.         Surviving are two brothers, Robert B. of Pasco, Wash., and Richard B. of Oak Ridge, Tenn.       
         Mary Childs Black, an art historian, folk art expert, former museum director and writer, died yesterday at her home in Germantown, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, said M. J. Gladstone, a friend.         Mrs. Black's greatest contribution to American folk art scholarship was her identification of the unsigned paintings of known American 18th- and 19th-century artists, attributions she based largely on social history.         Mrs. Black organized more than 100 exhibitions seen in the United States, Britain or Israel. She made her most important discovery in the late 1960's, when she identified portraits attributed to four unidentified painters as the work of one man, Ammi Phillips, an itinerant 19th-century artist born in Connecticut. She disclosed her findings in 1969 in the book "Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter, 1788-1865," which she wrote with Barbara and Lawrence Holdridge, folk art collectors. The biography was published when she was director of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York City, where she had organized the first major show of Phillips's work. A Start at Williamsburg         Her museum career began in 1956 when she was hired as a research assistant at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Two years later she became curator at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center at Williamsburg, and was named director in 1961.         She left Williamsburg in 1964 to become the director of the Museum of American Folk Art. In 1969 she moved to the New-York Historical Society, where she remained as the curator of sculpture, painting and decorative arts until 1982, when she was abruptly dismissed by the director, Dr. James B. Bell.         Mrs. Black protested the dismissal and was widely supported in the museum world. After a complaint was filed with Federal and state agencies contending that the society had violated sex- and age-discrimination laws, the society settled out of court, awarding Mrs. Black a sum equal to the back pay and vacation owed to her, and restoring her full pension. Dr. Bell resigned in 1988.         At her death, Mrs. Black was working on an exhibition of Colonial American painters to be presented at the New-York Historical Society, said Barbara Knowles Debs, the director and president. A Childhood Interest         Mrs. Black often said her interest in folk art stemmed from seeing Erastus Salisbury Field's 19th-century portraits of her ancestors in her grandparents' home when she was a child in Pittsfield, Mass., where she was born.         Mrs. Black graduated from the Women's College of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1943, did graduate work at Catholic University in Washington and earned a master's degree in art history at George Washington University in 1952.         Her books include "Old New York in Early Photographs" (1973), "What Is American in American Art" (1971), "Erastus Salisbury Field" (1984) and "Gracie Mansion: A History of the New York Mayor's House" (1984). She was the co-author with Jean Lipman of "American Folk Painting" (1967).         She is survived by a daughter, Merrill Black of New Durham, N.H., and a grandson.       
         Shirley Ullman Wedeen, a Brooklyn College educator and past chairwoman of the City University's Faculty Senate, died on Thursday at home in Brooklyn.         She was 65 years old and died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Wedeen taught education courses at Brooklyn College since 1948 and was also assistant dean of students from 1966 to 1968.         Her academic specialty was reading skills. She created the first remedial reading program in the City University system and ran it from 1961 to 1964. She also wrote two books, "College Remedial Reader" (Putnam, 1958) and "Advanced College Reader (Putnam, 1963).         She was elected chairwoman of the Faculty Senate for the entire City University from 1986 to 1990, and in that post sat as an ex-officio member on the university's Board of Trustees. She had also served as the Senate's vice chairwoman for four years and its Governance Committee chairwoman for two years.         Dr. Wedeen graduated from Brooklyn College in 1946. At New York University she earned a master's degree in guidance counseling in 1947 and a doctorate in psychology in 1951.         Surviving are her husband, Dr. Peter Wedeen; two sons, Dr. Van Wedeen of Boston, and Dr. Glenn Wedeen of Manhattan, and her father, Hugo Ullman of Brooklyn.       
         Anita Colby, perhaps the nation's first "supermodel" and known as "The Face" after her picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine, died yesterday at her home in Oyster Bay, L.I. She was 77 years old.         Miss Colby died of lung disease, her sister, Francine Okie of East Greenwich, R.I., said.         Although her career was launched and revolved around her widely acclaimed beauty, Miss Colby became an author, a newspaper columnist, an advertising executive, chief assistant to Hollywood moguls and a host on the "Today" show -- as well as a model and film actress.         Born Anita Counihan in Washington, on Aug. 5, 1914, Miss Colby was the eldest daughter of Bud Counihan, a cartoonist for the New York Evening World and the artist for the Betty Boop series. A Stunning $100 an Hour         At the age of 19, Ms. Colby moved to New York and soon became the nation's most famous and highest-paid model, working for the John Powers agency. With her willowy, ash-blonde beauty, she was the first model ever to receive $100 an hour -- a stunning figure in those days -- and she once appeared on the covers of 15 magazines in a single month, including Time.         "She was the first great model," Miss Colby's longtime friend, Frances Koltun, said yesterday. "She was an extraordinarly stylish woman, and I hate to use that word because it sounds superficial, but she had exquisite taste."         Realizing that she had chosen a short-lived career, Miss Colby moved to Hollywood after only one year as a model and, while on contract with R.K.O., appeared in nine movies, including "Mary Queen of Scots" and "Brute Force." A New Career         But her reviews were hardly raves, and Miss Colby returned to New York in the early 1940's to take a position selling advertising for Harper's Bazaar. A column about her in The Herald Tribune on Jan. 4, 1950, written by Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg, said, "Her contract called for a salary of $55 a week, plus -- and that proved to be a big plus -- 10 percent of all the advertising she brought into the magazine." Miss Colby's sister, Francine, said yesterday, "She sold more advertising than all of them."         To her friends, according to the Herald Tribune column, she said: " 'If I ever go to Hollywood again, I'll tell those stars what to do.' And she did."         In 1944, Miss Colby was hired by David O. Selznick as his studio's "feminine director." Ms. Falkenburg, who became a close friend of Miss Colby, said yesterday: "She was in charge of coordinating all of these stars of the Selznick stable, on screen and off. She decided how they should be photographed, how they would dress, how public they should become, what interviews they should do. She was the den mother for the top beauties in America." Turned Down Clark Gable         And in the process, Miss Colby became friends with Ingrid Bergman, Jennifer Jones, Shirley Temple, Joan Fontaine, Katharine Hepburn and others. She also turned down marriage proposals from Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart, but let them down easy. "I introduced them to their wives," she told a reporter in 1970 on the occasion of her first and only marriage, to Palen Flagler, a business executive. Mr. Flagler died in 1980.         In 1947, after working for the Selznick organization, Miss Colby served as a $150,000-a-year executive assistant to the head of Paramount Pictures. She later started a public relations company in New York, wrote "Anita Colby's Beauty Book," bought and sold the Women's News Service, for which she wrote a syndicated newspaper column called "Anita Says," and appeared for six months on the "Today" show with Dave Garroway. There he hired Barbara Walters to write her scripts.         Miss Colby is survived by her sister.       
         Melissa Stutsman Topping, an executive of the Henry Luce Foundation, died on Friday at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 49 years old and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.         She died of complications from cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Topping was the vice president and secretary of the Henry Luce Foundation in Manhattan and principal staff officer of its Clare Boothe Luce Fund. She administered $21 million in grants for scholarships, fellowships and professorships for women in science, to help remedy their under-representation in that field.         She was born in St. Louis and graduated from Vassar College in 1964. After working for a law firm and Citibank, she joined the foundation in 1969, where she progressed from research assistant to program associate, program officer, associate director and vice president.         Mrs. Topping was also a trustee of Pratt Institute, manager of the National Society of Colonial Dames in New York, an advisory council member of the New York Women's Foundation and a past board member of the Women's Prison Association and was also active in the Trust for Cultural Resources.         Surviving are her husband of 14 years, Henry J. Topping Jr., a private investor; her mother, Helen Eades Stutsman of St. Louis; a sister, Nancy Lamb of Cambridge, Mass.; a brother, Albert C. Stutsman Jr. of St. Louis; and two stepchildren, Henry J. 4th, and Samantha S. Topping, both of Manhattan.       
         Jean Tilford Palmer, a former director of the Navy Waves and longtime administrator at Barnard College, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.         During World War II, Miss Palmer was a Wave captain, serving as women's reserve assistant to the Navy's director of enlisted personnel. She rose to the position of director of the Waves in 1945.         Upon leaving the Navy, Miss Palmer joined the staff of Barnard as director of admissions in 1946. Three years later, she was appointed general secretary, in charge of the college's development plan.         Remaining in this position for 23 years, Miss Palmer supervised all of the college's non-academic operations from admissions to fund-raising to the design of student dormitories.         Born in Omaha, Miss Palmer was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College. Before enlisting in the Naval Reserve in 1942, she served as business manager of the Association of the Junior Leagues of America for 14 years.         For her wartime service, she was awarded a Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy in 1944 and the Legion of Merit in 1946.         She is survived by a brother, Morse Palmer of Delray Beach, Fla.       
         Theodora Wiesner, the former director of the American Dance Festival and of the dance division of Brooklyn College, died on Saturday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 83 years old.         She died of cancer, said her brother, Alwin, of Lake Nebagamon, Wis.         Dr. Wiesner, who was born in Rice Lake, Wis., was a physical-education major at the University of Wisconsin in Madison when she discovered the university's dance program. After receiving a bachelor's degree in 1930, she did graduate work in dance and physical education at New York University.         Dr. Wiesner taught dance before World War II at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago. She served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy Women's Reserve during the war and was director of emplacement for the Waves in San Diego.         In 1949, she became an administrative assistant at the Connecticut College School of Dance in New London, which presented the American Dance Festival, this country's leading summer festival of modern dance.         Dr. Wiesner was also director of the dance program at Brooklyn College from 1950 to 1975, when she retired.         Her brother is her only survivor.       
         Marlene Dietrich, the magnetic movie star and singer who was an international symbol of glamour and sex for more than half a century, died yesterday at her home in Paris. She was 90 years old.         In her films and record-breaking cabaret performances, Miss Dietrich artfully projected cool sophistication, self-mockery and infinite experience. Her sexuality was audacious, her wit was insolent and her manner was ageless. With a world-weary charm and a diaphanous gown showing off her celebrated legs, she was the quintessential cabaret entertainer of Weimar-era Germany.         The Dietrich image, personified by Lola-Lola, the seductive cabaret singer in top hat and silk stockings whom she portrayed in "The Blue Angel," was that of a liberated woman of the world who chose her men, earned her own living and viewed sex as a challenge. Audiences were captivated by this creature out of no one's experience but out of everyone's imagination. 'Most Vulnerable Fantasies'         Her manner, the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, was that of "a serpentine lasso whereby her voice casually winds itself around our most vulnerable fantasies."         "She has sex but no positive gender," Tynan wrote. "Her masculinity appeals to women and her sexuality to men."         Her friend Maurice Chevalier said: "Dietrich is something that never existed before and may never exist again. That's a woman."         The Dietrich image was born in the Berlin of the 1920's, when she appeared in plays, cabaret, and film roles of varying importance (she was an extra in G. W. Pabst's 1925 "Joyless Street," which featured Greta Garbo). Her mentor, the American director Josef von Sternberg, made her an international star with "The Blue Angel," which was filmed in 1930 in both German and English. Although in the movie's offstage scenes her 5-foot-5-inch frame seemed a bit blowzy and her manner a bit too Teutonic, her portrayal of Lola-Lola, who degrades and destroys an infatuated elderly professor (Emil Jannings), won her a Hollywood contract. She shed 30 pounds, and in six more von Sternberg movies the director and his star molded the legend.         Her hair became a golden blond, makeup and lighting made her cheekbones and nose appear patrician, and her dreamy blue eyes were framed by thinly penciled, sweepingly arched brows.         Perhaps the best description of her face was provided by Erich Maria Remarque, her longtime friend, in his novel "Arch of Triumph":         "The cool, bright face that didn't ask for anything, that simply existed, waiting -- it was an empty face, he thought; a face that could change with any wind of expression. One could dream into it anything. It was like a beautiful empty house waiting for carpets and pictures. It had all possibilities -- it could become a palace or a brothel." A Lifelong Task Of Creating an Image         Working with von Sternberg, the actress became a thorough professional and perfectionist, expert in makeup, lighting, clothes and film editing. In later decades, she repeatedly had cosmetic surgery to keep her face taut, and adroitly had herself filmed with soft-focus, gauze-covered lenses.         "Glamour," she observed, "is assurance. It is a kind of knowing that you are all right in every way, mentally and physically and in appearance, and that, whatever the occasion or the situation, you are equal to it."         In clothes, she was a trend setter. Both on screen and off, she often wore trousers and mannish costumes. By proving that a woman could still look feminine in such clothes, she established "the Dietrich silhouette," emphasizing trimness and inconspicuous hips and bust.         The Dietrich-von Sternberg collaboration produced "Morocco" (1930), in which Miss Dietrich, again a cabaret singer, spurns and then pursues a French legionnaire (Gary Cooper) in the Sahara; "Dishonored" (1931), about a spy who betrays her country for love of a worthless man (Victor McLaglen), and "Shanghai Express" (1932), a melodrama in which she is a China Coast prostitute who offers herself to a warlord (Warner Oland) to save the life of a former lover (Clive Brook).         The last three Dietrich-von Sternberg films were "Blonde Venus" (1932), a mother-love soap opera; "The Scarlet Empress" (1934), an opulent and visually stunning melodrama about a lascivious Catherine the Great, and "The Devil Is a Woman" (1935), an erotic tale about a soldier-corrupting vamp in turn-of-the-century Seville.         Because it displayed her beauty most effectively, "The Devil Is a Woman" was her particular favorite. But it angered Spanish officials, at whose demand Paramount Pictures soon withdrew it and destroyed the master print. Miss Dietrich gave her own print of the film to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it is shown frequently.         The von Sternberg movies were increasingly self-indulgent, lyrical, exotic romances with pallid plots that trapped the actress in elaborate decor and special effects. They were losing a fortune, so Paramount's top executives, to protect their big investment in Miss Dietrich, barred von Sternberg from directing her again.         Seeking variety, she made her first comedy, "Desire," in 1936. It was a satire about an urbane jewel thief who steals a choice necklace from a Parisian jeweler and, in efforts to keep it, becomes involved with a hayseed Detroit engineer (Gary Cooper).         A second comedy, "Destry Rides Again," a 1939 spoof of the Old West, was even more successful. The actress, as a freewheeling saloon entertainer, seduces a valiant sheriff (James Stewart) and has a hair-pulling, face-pummeling brawl with a competitor (Una Merkel).         Miss Dietrich was a Berliner who was an early and passionate opponent of Nazism. When Hitler started arresting Jews, she financed the escape of several friends. Rejects Germany; Films Are Banned         In 1937, while filming the melodrama "Knight Without Armour" in England, she was approached by agents of Hitler offering her an almost blank check to return to Germany to star in movies of her choice. She angrily rejected the offer, and her films were banned in Germany. Soon after, she applied for American citizenship, which was granted in 1939.         During World War II, Miss Dietrich became somewhat of a symbol of free Germany. She made anti-Nazi broadcasts in German, took part in many war-bond drives and, in three years, entertained half a million Allied troops and war prisoners across North Africa and Western Europe.         Tirelessly and good-humoredly, she roughed it with the G.I.'s, standing patiently in food lines, washing with snow and sleeping in dugouts and ruins, often near the front lines. She sang her movie songs, the international wartime ballad "Lili Marlene" and some current songs, and even played a musical saw, a skill she had mastered for the Berlin stage. The troops loved her.         After the war, she was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor the United States Government bestows. France named her a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor and Belgium dubbed her a Knight of the Order of Leopold.         Her most noteworthy movie roles after the war were as an exotic gypsy in Mitchell Leisen's "Golden Earrings" (1947), with Ray Milland; a manipulative Berlin cabaret singer in Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair" (1948); a saloon manager hiding outlaws in Fritz Lang's "Rancho Notorious" (1952); a duplicitous wife in Mr. Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution" (1958); a cynical brothel-keeper in Orson Welles's "Touch of Evil" (1958) and an aristocratic widow in Stanley Kramer's "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961).         "Touch of Evil" provided Miss Dietrich with one of her most memorable lines. She admonished the character played by the corpulent Welles to "lay off the candy bars."         Her last film was a small part in the forgettable 1979 melodrama called "Just a Gigolo." In 1986, Maximilian Schell made a documentary about her, entitled "Marlene"; she did not appear on screen because of vanity, but she was interviewed and her voice is heard almost continuously.         Miss Dietrich began her cabaret performances in 1954, and for more than two decades, for fees up to $30,000 a week, she hypnotized audiences in such disparate cities as London, Las Vegas, Paris, New York, Montreal, Johannesburg and Tokyo and Tel Aviv (where she sang in German with some apprehension, but with stunning success). Her manner matched her movie image: at once intimate and elusive.         In 1960, also with trepidation about wartime animosities, she sang in Berlin. There were a few hecklers, but the vast majority of Berliners welcomed her home.         To keep her shows up to date, she interspersed the nostalgia with new songs, and in 1963 she performed in London with -- or perhaps against -- the youthful Beatles.         Marie Magdalene Dietrich was born in Berlin on Dec. 27, 1901. Her father, Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, who was a police lieutenant and a former cavalry major, died when she was 9 years old.         Her mother was Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine Felsing, the daughter of a well-to-do watch merchant, who soon after being widowed, married Edouard von Losch, a cavalry lieutenant. He was killed on the Russian front in 1918.         The young Marie Magdalene and her elder sister, Elisabeth, were brought up strictly in an upper-middle-class Prussian home. Marie Magdalene attended a private school in Weimar, studied French and took violin lessons, hoping for a concert career. But when she was 18, a hand injury threatened that dream and she decided to try dramatics, contracting her two given names to Marlene because her family disapproved of acting.         She failed an audition with Max Reinhardt and joined the chorus of a touring musical revue. A year later, she passed a second audition and was admitted to Reinhardt's drama school.         Soon after, she won small roles on the stage and in German films. Her only substantial role was in the film "Tragedy of Love" (1923). She was assigned the part by Rudolph Sieber, a young Czechoslovak production assistant. They were married on May 17, 1924, and the next year had a daughter, Maria.         After the early years of their marriage, Mr. Sieber was rarely seen with his wife. He held movie jobs in New York and Hollywood and, in 1953, became a chicken farmer in California in the San Fernando Valley. They never divorced, but lived apart for most of their remaining years. He died in 1975.         In the late 1920's, Miss Dietrich won increasingly important leading roles on the German stage and was likened in the German press to Greta Garbo. A Director's Search For a Cruel Temptress         In early 1930, von Sternberg arrived in Berlin to make "The Blue Angel," based on the Heinrich Mann novel "Professor Unrat." The director had been searching for an actress who could exude the electric eroticism of the movie's cruel temptress. He saw Miss Dietrich in a play and knew his search was over.         Two decades later, the actress was referred to by the press as "the world's most glamorous grandmother." Her daughter, also an actress, married William Riva, a scenic artist, in 1947, and had four sons. Miss Dietrich was often seen with her grandsons in Manhattan, wheeling their carriages in Central Park, later seeing them off to camp at Grand Central Terminal and even carrying their laundry.         She was deeply devoted to her family, worked hard to advance her daughter's career and helping her daughter and son-in-law financially. To be with her family, Miss Dietrich lived in Manhattan when not touring, but in 1972 she moved her chief residence from Park Avenue to Paris, where she lived in a four-room apartment on Avenue Montaigne, in the Eighth Arrondissement.         She was a close friend of many famous people, including Ernest Hemingway and Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. She also had widely reported love affairs with the writer Erich Maria Remarque and the actors Jean Gabin, Michael Wilding and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. "I've always been attracted to intelligent men," she once said. "I can pick 'em in a full room, just like that. I don't care what age they are."         Miss Dietrich kept in touch with friends around the world by telephone and letter. She often cooked delicacies for friends, as well as for stagehands and doormen. Her specialties included goulash and apple strudel. She was also knowledgeable about antiques, and owned paintings by Delacroix, Cezanne, Utrillo and Corot. A Faith in Astrology, For Herself and Others         Deeply influenced by astrology, she regularly had horoscopes prepared for friends. On that subject, she once remarked: "Astrology! Of course. After all, everyone knows that the moon pulls the sea away from the land, and farmers don't plant when the moon is wrong.         "Why should humans escape?"         She granted occasional interviews to friendly journalists, but over the years she grew impatient with those who asked questions she regarded as stupid or pointless.         In her memoirs, "Marlene Dietrich's ABC," published in 1962, she wrote: "Once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast."         Miss Dietrich, who stopped performing in the mid-1970's, lived the last years of her life as a virtual recluse in her Paris apartment.         A photograph of her in "Shanghai Express" was chosen to publicize this year's Cannes International Film Festival, which starts Thursday. The poster adorns billboards all over France.       
         Dr. Mary Ann Spencer Pulaski, a retired children's psychologist, lecturer and author, died on Saturday at Glen Cove Hospital on Long Island. She was 75 years old and lived in Port Washington, L.I.         Her family said she died after a long illness.         Dr. Pulaski graduated from Wellesley College in 1938 and earned a Ph.D. in child psychology at City University of New York three decades later. In between, she worked in merchandising and advertising and as an editorial assistant at Glamour magazine.         While her children were in school, she earned master's degrees in education and school psychology and taught at the Buckley Country Day School in Roslyn, L.I. From 1967 until her retirement in 1979, she served as a psychologist in the Herricks public school system in New Hyde Park, L.I.         Dr. Pulaski was the author of many articles, including "Understanding Piaget." A revised edition of it was published by Harper & Row Publishers Inc. in 1980. She lectured widely and taught at Hofstra University, Adelphi University and Queens College of the City University of New York.         Dr. Pulaski is survived by her husband of 52 years, Charles A. Pulaski; a son, Charles A. Jr., of Tempe, Ariz.; a daughter, Elizabeth Mertens of Glen Head, L.I., and three grandchildren.       
         Sister Margaret Carthy, former president of the College of New Rochelle and dean of its graduate school, died on Sunday at the Marian Residence in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She was known as Mother Mary Peter during her long career as a Roman Catholic college administrator.         She had Alzheimer's disease and died of pneumonia, said Sister Eileen Fane, prioress of the Convent of St. Teresa, an Ursuline community in New Rochelle.         Sister Margaret was born and raised in Manhattan and graduated from the College of New Rochelle in 1933. She worked for several years in the business office at Teachers College at Columbia University but, after taking her vows in the Order of St. Ursuline in 1939, she returned to New Rochelle to teach at the Ursuline School. A Former Dean         Sister Margaret began her years in the administration at the College of New Rochelle as assistant registrar in 1941 and served as dean of the college from 1950 to 1957 and then as president until 1961. She earned a master's and, in 1957, a Ph.D. in American church history at Catholic University in Washington.         She added a master's degree in theology from the University of Notre Dame in 1962 and worked for four years as staff editor of The New Catholic Encyclopedia while also lecturing at Catholic University. She then taught at the University of Maryland, becoming assistant director of the general ecducation program and then assistant dean of graduate studies.         In 1975, she returned to her alma mater to accept the post of dean of the graduate school, which she held until her retirement in 1979.         Both before and after her retirement, Sister Margaret wrote articles and books about American church history, including "Catholicism in English-Speaking Lands" (Hawthorn Books, 1964). Much of her writing focused on the Archdiocese of New York, including "A Cathedral of Suitable Magnificence" (St. Patrick's, 1984). In addition, she served as archivist for the Eastern Province of the Ursulines.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Connolly of Jericho, L.I., and many nieces and nephews.       
         Sherry Goldman Abel, a retired managing editor of Commentary magazine, died on May 28 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She had suffered from a stroke and respiratory illness, friends said.         Mrs. Abel was born in Chicago and graduated from the University of Chicago. She held a variety of editorial jobs, including compiling a Yiddish encyclopedia, editing a book on cinema and working at Time magazine.         She joined Commentary about 1950 as an editorial assistant and eventually rose to managing editor. She retired in the 1960's.         Her marriages to William McKenzie and Lionel Abel, a playwright and author, ended in divorce. Her daughter, Merry, died in 1964.         Mrs. Abel is survived by a brother, Jack Goldman of Chicago.       
         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Barbara Miller Solomon, a Harvard educator and leader in women's studies, died Thursday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Solomon, a historian, taught Harvard's first course on the history of American women, the forerunner of what evolved into a broader women's studies program.         She also directed a major collection of historical material on women, served as Harvard's first female assistant dean and was a mentor to other female scholars.         Her book "In the Company of Educated Women: A History of Women and Higher Education in America" (Yale University Press, 1985) won the Frederick W. Ness book award. The text traced the struggle of American women to gain access to college and assessed the importance of their education to them and to society in opening up new careers and roles. Family and Studies         Dr. Solomon, a native of Boston, graduated from Radcliffe in 1940, continued her studies there part time while starting a family and earned a doctorate in American civilization in 1953.         She first gained attention by turning her doctoral thesis on immigration into a book, "Ancestors & Immigrants: A Changing New England Tradition" (Harvard University Press, 1956). It is widely used as a college text and was honored by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.         Dr. Solomon started her teaching career at Wheelock College in Boston in 1957 and joined Harvard's faculty in 1959.         That year she became the director of the Women's Archives at Radcliffe, now known as the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. Her work won national recognition when Lady Bird Johnson invited her to be guest of honor at the White House.         She also served as a college administrator, first as an associate dean at Harvard's affiliated Radcliffe College from 1963 to 1970, then as an assistant dean at Harvard from 1970 to 1974. After retiring from teaching in 1985, she was a scholar in residence at the Schlesinger Library.         Her husband of 48 years, Peter H. Solomon, a shoe company executive, died in 1988. She is survived by two sons, Peter Solomon of Toronto and Daniel Solomon of Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Maida Solomon of Cambridge, and four grandchildren.       
         Helen Del Monte, the fiction editor of McCall's magazine from 1969 to 1990, died Aug. 21 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 62 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Del Monte died of cancer, said her husband, Roy.         A native of Los Angeles, Calif., Mrs. Del Monte graduated from Reed College in Portland, Ore., in 1952 and moved to New York City, where she soon took a job as a secretary at McCall's. She worked there until her retirement in 1990, advancing from secretary to editorial assistant to editor to fiction editor.         During her early career, Mrs. Del Monte worked with such writers as Ben Hecht, John Steinbeck, William Saroyan and Irwin Shaw. She also edited the fiction of newer writers like Alice Adams, Margery Finn Brown, Ron Carlson and Nora Johnson. She was widely considered an editor of great sensitivity and insight, said Roberta Silman, one of the many writers whose work appeared in McCall's during Mrs. Del Monte's tenure.         Mrs. Del Monte is survived by her husband.       
         Karena P. Somerville, the manager of Consolidated Edison's Customer Outreach program, died on Thursday. She was 46 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         Mrs. Somerville died in an automobile accident on the Hutchinson River Parkway near the Orchard Beach exit in the Bronx. Her car struck a tree early Thursday morning in a construction area, the police said.         Mrs. Somerville, a native of Manhattan, was a graduate of Syracuse University. In 1973 she joined Con Edison's public-affairs department in Westchester. In 1987 she was named director of public affairs for Con Edison's Westchester customer service unit, and in 1990 she was named assistant to the chairman of Consolidated Edison.         Mrs. Somerville is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Kelley; a son, Chad; a twin sister, Tamara Westover, all of Rye, and her father, Paul Buiar of Pound Ridge, N.Y.       
         Dr. LaDonne H. Schulman, a prominent researcher in advanced genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 56 years old.         The college said the cause of death was cancer.         Dr. Schulman, a professor of developmental biology and cancer, was known for her work with transfer RNA, or tRNA -- molecules that complete the process of synthesizing proteins according to the DNA code. Before their discovery, Francis Crick, the Nobelist and a discoverer of DNA, had foreseen their existence as the "bilingual molecules" that understand the chemical languages of DNA and protein.         As it turned out, each tRNA molecule bears one amino acid that it ultimately inserts into the growing protein at the proper location, as prescribed by the DNA sequence. Dr. Schulman's particular interest lay in the process of recognition by which tRNAs came to carry the correct amino acids.         The hospital said she helped to demonstrate that enzymes rely on a particular section of the tRNA molecule -- the anticodon -- to match the right amino acids with their tRNA carriers. In the process, she found ways to test tRNA activity and showed why all proteins start with the same amino acid, methionine.         LaDonne Heaton Schulman was born in Jacksonville, Fla., and graduated summa cum laude from Wheaton College before spending a year as a Fulbright scholar at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. She received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in chemistry at Columbia University and did postdoctoral studies at New York University Medical Center in 1966.         She joined Albert Einstein as an assistant professor in the Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer in 1968 and became a full professor 10 years later.         Dr. Schulman is survived by her brother, Cherrill Paul Heaton of Gainesville, Fla.       
         Jane Wasey, a sculptor known for her carvings of animals, died on Thursday at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Glen Cove, Me. She was 80 years old and lived in Lincolnville, Me.         Ms. Wasey died of cancer, said Priscilla Pattison, an artist and longtime friend.         Ms. Wasey's work in stone, wood and bronze has been exhibited in New York at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the American Museum of Natural History, and at other museums in Maine and around the nation. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and of the William A. Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Me.         Ms. Wasey was born in Chicago and began her career at the age of 17 in Paris as the only female assistant to the sculptor Paul Landowski.
