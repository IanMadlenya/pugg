         Inge Morath, a photographer who brought a whimsical, lyrical touch to her images from travelogues to reportage to portraits, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in Roxbury, Conn.         Arthur Miller, her husband, said the cause of death was lymphoma.         ''She made poetry out of people and their places over half a century,'' Mr. Miller said.         Her work included striking portraits of both posed celebrities and fleeting images of anonymous passers-by. Her feeling for places as reflected in images of Boris Pasternak's home, Chekhov's house and Mao Zedong's bedroom was so sensitive that some viewers insisted they could see invisible people.         But many critics said the pictures spoke eloquently for themselves.         ''Inge Morath possesses the priceless quality of making the world look as though it had been discovered only this morning and she was present with her lens to record its bright freshness,'' Harrison E. Salisbury wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the couple's book ''In Russia'' (Viking, 1969).         In the later phases of her long career, Ms. Morath produced books with her husband: he provided words and she the pictures. Beyond their respective artistic talents, the books were enhanced by his easy access to top figures in culture and other fields and her great facility with languages. For example, she spent years learning Chinese before the couple tackled China.         In an essay in The New York Times concerning their book ''In the Country'' (Viking, 1977), Mr. Miller suggested such collaborations allowed the two to play with notions of time. ''As always, the camera sees the past -- all it can see -- and here it speaks of a symmetry of action and thought and a revolution based on empirical common sense, when in truth these people watch the television news for the event on Wall Street, in Washington or Korea that will affect the price of fertilizer and crops,'' he wrote. ''The surreal emerges from the fragility of what camera and mind can grasp as real.''         Inge MÃ¶rath (with umlaut over the o) was born on May 27, 1923, in Graz, Austria. (She lost the umlaut somewhere in her international career.) Her parents, both scientists, were well off and brought her up in their liberal Protestant tradition. They moved frequently, and were living in Berlin at the outbreak of World War II.         She was drafted to work in an airplane factory with Ukrainian prisoners of war after she declined to be a Nazi supporter. The factory was regularly bombed; after one bombing, she remembered running through the streets of the devastated city holding a bouquet of lilacs above her head. In an interview with Joyce Wadler that appeared in The New York Times on March 18, 1998, she recalled walking through the countryside and witnessing the horror of war.         ''Everyone was dead or half dead,'' she said. ''I walked by dead horses, by women with dead babies in their arms. I can't photograph war for this reason.''         After the war, she used the language expertise she had honed at the University of Berlin to translate for occupying Americans, and then to work as Austrian editor of an American government-controlled magazine. She began to write articles to accompany the photographs of Ernst Haas, and was invited to Paris by Robert Capa with Mr. Haas to serve as an editor of the just-founded Magnum agency.         She began photographing in London in 1951, and assisted Henri Cartier-Bresson as a researcher in 1953 and 1954. In 1955, after working two years as a photographer, she became a member of Magnum, which functions as a cooperative.         Her many foreign assignments included a trip to Iran for Holiday magazine in 1956; there she wore the traditional chador and traveled alone most of the time.         In the late 1950's she saved Audie Murphy, the actor and war hero, from drowning when he was in Mexico making a movie ''The Unforgiven.'' Ms. Morath jumped into a cold mountain lake in her underwear, swam a half-mile and dragged Mr. Murphy back by her bra strap -- at least in her telling.         Other notable assignments included shooting the stills in London for John Huston's film ''Moulin Rouge'' (1952), in which she had to make do with three rolls of color film because it was so scarce at the time. She developed a lifelong friendship with Mr. Huston, something she often did with her subjects. ''Photography is essentially a personal matter, a search for inner truth,'' she said.         In 1960, she was photographing the filming of ''The Misfits'' in Reno, Nev. One of the stars was Marilyn Monroe, who was accompanied by her husband at that time, Mr. Miller. She took a famous image of the two together: Mr. Miller, with his cigarette, Monroe leaning out the window with her back turned.         But she said that it was difficult to get them close enough together to photograph. The marriage soon broke up; Ms. Morath married Mr. Miller in 1962, and they had one child, Rebecca, who lives in Manhattan. Rebecca has one son.         Ms. Morath -- who practiced yoga, swam daily and was a vegetarian -- continued to photograph until two weeks ago. Elliott Erwitt, a veteran photographer for Magnum, remembered her as a wonderful hostess. ''It was kind of a permanent salon that she managed beautifully,'' he said. ''She was at ease in any situation.''       
         Julia Phillips, the Hollywood producer who turned her rage at the stars and power brokers into the best-selling chronicle ''You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again,'' died Tuesday at her apartment in West Hollywood. She was 57.         The cause was cancer, her daughter, Kate Phillips, said.         Julia Phillips was a producer of classics including ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' The 1973 film ''The Sting,'' which she produced with her husband at the time, Michael Phillips, and Tony Bill, won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. She was the first woman to produce a film that won the best-picture Oscar.         But Ms. Phillips's film career was dwarfed by her angry 1991 book about Hollywood and what Ms. Phillips viewed as the mendacity, selfishness, greed and hypocrisy of the town. She skewered numerous famous people, including Steven Spielberg, David Geffen, Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn. One producer described the book as ''the longest suicide note in history.''         But Ms. Phillips was far more brutal about herself than about any of the people she scorned. She detailed her descent into drugs, which almost killed her. She wrote that on Oscar night for ''The Sting'' in 1974, she took ''a diet pill, a small amount of coke, two joints, six halves of Valium, which make three, and a glass and a half of wine.'' The index listing of her name at the end of her book seemed to sum up her personal life: ''depressions of . . . drug wanderings of . . . pregnancies of . . . loneliness of . . . suicidal behavior of . . .''         As Ms. Phillips said in an interview several days before she died: ''I knew that if this book was going to be commercially viable, I would have to spill my guts. I knew I would have to be as honest as possible about myself as I was about all the others.''         To critics who termed the book cruel, she replied: ''We all have our standards. People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. I felt no constraints.'' She added, ''Nothing I did in my book is as mean as any of the people I wrote about.''         Ms. Phillips was feisty, funny and blunt, and never stopped loving the movies. In the days before she died, she sat in her apartment overlooking Los Angeles and talked about them; she asked friends to bring her a tape of ''Ocean's Eleven'' because she adored George Clooney.         ''I couldn't have made it today in the movies,'' she said at one point. ''In the 70's people were making some great films. Look what they're making now.''         In the last decade, Ms. Phillips struggled in vain to write another best seller. In 1995 she wrote ''Driving Under the Affluence,'' a sometimes surreal personal examination of her problems with the Internal Revenue Service, the 1992 Los Angeles riots and 1994 earthquake, the impact of AIDS and the death of her father. In 2000 she helped Matt Drudge, the internet commentator, write his book ''Drudge Manifesto.''         In recent years, Ms. Phillips, who was constantly battling financial problems, said she had considered trying to return to the movies. But her few meetings with younger executives left her despondent. ''Did I really want to be patronized once more as a woman?'' she said recently. ''Did I really want to be told what a major motion picture was?''         Ms. Phillips was born in New York City on April 7, 1944. Her father, Adolph Miller, was a chemical engineer. Her mother, Tanya, was, in Ms. Phillips's words, a difficult and depressive woman who drove her daughter to intellectual pursuits.         Ms. Phillips grew up in Brooklyn; Great Neck, N.Y.; and Milwaukee and attended Mount Holyoke, where she won awards for creative writing.         She married Michael Phillips, a Dartmouth graduate, shortly after their graduations. Mr. Phillips became an investment banker and producer. They were divorced months after ''The Sting'' won its Oscars.         Ms. Phillips worked at Ladies' Home Journal and McCall's and then became a story editor in the New York offices of Paramount Pictures. Her career started moving quickly when she was hired to find material for Barbra Streisand, among other jobs. Ms. Phillips helped get the rights to ''Yentl'' years before it was made.         In her mid-20's Ms. Phillips and her husband met the actor-producer Tony Bill, and the three optioned ''The Sting'' and ''Steelyard Blues,'' which became a film starring Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland and was made with the support of Richard Zanuck and David Brown.         The Phillipses moved to Los Angeles and soon became the nucleus of a group of young, dynamic filmmakers who were, essentially, taking over Hollywood in the 1970's, a time when the studio system was crumbling. Their friends included Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, John Milius, Paul Schrader and others. It was also a time when drugs proliferated in Hollywood.         The high point of her career was Oscar night in 1974. Upon being handed the Academy Award for best picture by Elizabeth Taylor, Ms. Phillips said, ''You can't imagine what a trip it is for a nice Jewish girl from Great Neck to win an Academy Award and meet Elizabeth Taylor in the same night.''         The breakup of her marriage, drugs and a series of sour relationships with men, along with being elbowed out of the power loop in the making of ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' pushed her over the edge. At one point, after a 30-day rehabilitation stay at the Mayo Clinic, Ms. Phillips said she had spent more than $120,000 on cocaine. By the early 1980's, Ms. Phillips said, she had turned her back on drugs with the help of various therapies.         Ms. Phillips recalled that she began writing her book because she was running out of money and felt a deep grievance against many in Hollywood. The book took several years to write and 14 months for Random House lawyers to clear.         Its publication turned her into an outcast among many of the Hollywood elite.         ''At first it bothered me because I really didn't expect that kind of reaction,'' she said. ''I thought people had a sense of humor. I really did.         ''Understand, I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother,'' she said. ''I was a pariah because I lit them with a harsh fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are.''         The book was criticized because Ms. Phillips recalled conversations from years before without the benefit of notes; she replied that she had a photographic memory. A harsher criticism was that the book discussed physical flaws of numerous people. Ms. Phillips said later that she had only one regret: referring to one woman as ''a city of flesh.''         In later years, Ms. Phillips said, she sometimes went to restaurants and accidentally met some of the people she had written about. She said they were polite, even friendly.         Ms. Phillips is survived by her daughter, of Los Angeles; her brother, Matthew Miller of Weston, Conn.; and her son-in-law, Modi Wiczyk of Los Angeles.         Her first book led Morton's, a popular movie industry hangout, to tell Ms. Phillips that she was unwelcome. But the restaurant soon rescinded its ban. Shortly before she died, Ms. Phillips recalled with a laugh that she had her daughter's 1999 wedding-rehearsal dinner at -- where else? -- Morton's. ''They had no problem taking my money,'' she said. ''That's Hollywood.''       
         Pauline TrigÃ¨re, the Paris-born designer who was not only her own best model but also an elegant and chic symbol of the American fashion industry for more than half a century, died at her home on the East Side of Manhattan last night, said her daughter-in-law Melanie Radley. She was 93.         ''Fashion is what people tell you to wear,'' she often said. ''Style is what comes from your own inner thing.'' She herself was an exemplar of style, and was described by her peers as ''a truly intellectual designer'' and ''a creator of timeless fashion'' in ready-to-wear clothes.         Her 50th anniversary in fashion, a milestone reached by no other designer in this country, was celebrated in 1992 at a benefit fashion show and dinner at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan. It was attended by 600 of the most influential names in design, manufacturing and retailing, as well as by scores of social and theater personalities who were both clients and friends. The following year, at a ceremony at Lincoln Center, Miss TrigÃ¨re received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.         She was noted not only for her designing skills, but also for her tailoring and such touches as constructing dresses with no obvious seams.         She did not sketch her designs: in the tradition of Lanvin and Chanel, she cut and draped from bolts of fabric. Her clothes were worn by such women as Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Beverly Sills, Evelyn Lauder, Rita Gam and Dina Merrill.         Miss TrigÃ¨re wore only her own designs, and she generally punctuated them with several of her trademark turtle pins. She was known both for her meticulous grooming and for a charm that surmounted her blunt, sometimes impolitic comments, spoken in a Gallic accent she never lost.         On occasion a prima donna, a description she never challenged (she once told an assistant ''There is room for only one prima donna around here, and that's me''), she was often impatient. But her displays of temper were brief. She admitted that she was outspoken to a fault, but seemed to revel in that image. A woman meeting her at a social event once gushed, ''Oh, Miss TrigÃ¨re, I have a dress of yours that I've worn for 25 years.'' The designer fixed her with an icy glance and said, ''Just what am I to do with that piece of information?''         Once, when she was approached by two retailers while dining in a restaurant after one of her shows, she asked them, ''Did you come to copy or to buy?''         She was also a woman of strong beliefs. In 1961, she became the first name designer to use an African- American model. She rarely hesitated to offer an opinion and had no reservations about discussing her life and background -- with one exception. She steadfastly refused to reveal her age and sloughed off questions on the subject with ''I'm past 75, I still walk, and I don't dye my hair blond and I don't touch it up.'' For years, a silver streak intersected her simple hair style, but gradually she allowed the streak to evolve into a blend of salt sprinkled with pepper.         She finally revealed her age in 1998 when she held a 90th-birthday party for herself with 200 guests at La Grenouille restaurant in Manhattan. (During the festivities she announced that her age on the invitation had been printed upside down).         Unlike almost all other name designers, who stage their shows without commentary and emerge only at the finale to the sound of applause, Miss TrigÃ¨re usually stood on the stage during her presentations, eyes partly obscured by tinted glasses, and talked about each design as it appeared. She interspersed information about fabric and style with somewhat Rabelaisian humor. Typical of her remarks was one she made at the appearance of a dress with a particularly revealing dÃ©colletage. ''You can see the boobs better,'' she said. During a personal appearance, she was asked what she really wanted to be. ''A courtesan,'' she replied.         Miss TrigÃ¨re was born in 1908 in the Pigalle district of Paris to Russian-Jewish parents. Her mother was a dressmaker and her father a tailor who had made military uniforms for Russian aristocrats. She grew up behind the shop in Paris and picked up pins for a few centimes a week. She remembered designing her first dress in her early teens, although, she said, she never particularly wanted or intended to be in the fashion business. As a young woman, she preferred taking part in amateur theatrical productions and even thought of becoming a surgeon, an ambition nipped by her father before it was even a bud.         She married Lazar Radley, a Russian immigrant and a tailor, because, she said, ''I was young, my mother worried about me, he wanted to marry me and so I did.'' She had two sons before her husband, increasingly concerned about the rise of Hitler, decided to leave France. The Radleys left Paris in 1937 and were bound for Chile with what was to be a brief stopover in New York. But, she recalled, ''New York captured my heart,'' and the family settled in Manhattan.         Within a short time, the Radleys opened a small tailoring business with Miss TrigÃ¨re's brother, Robert.         Five years later, in 1942, Mr. Radley walked out on the marriage, leaving his wife to bring up the two children. Some years later, he wrote to ask for a divorce. Miss TrigÃ¨re signed the papers and never heard from him again. She did not remarry, but she had several of what she termed ''longstanding friendships.''         ''Don't say 'beaux' -- I hate the word 'beau,' '' she always exclaimed when the subject came up.         She is survived by her two sons, Jean-Pierre Radley and Philippe Radley and a granddaughter, Karen, all of Manhattan.         Although the original business ended when Mr. Radley left, the following year, Miss TrigÃ¨re and her brother were back with a collection of 11 styles. Within three years, her name was a recognized one in fashion. In the ensuing decades, she received, in addition to three Coty Awards and inclusion in the Coty Hall of Fame, major fashion awards from Neiman Marcus and Filene's, the National Cotton Award and both the silver and the vermeil medals of the City of Paris.         In addition to creating women's fashions, at various times Miss TrigÃ¨re also designed scarves, jewelry and men's ties. She also developed her own perfume, called TrigÃ¨re.         Although new and younger designers gradually replaced her at the top of the fashion hierarchy, and a number of stores that had been important customers went out of business, Miss TrigÃ¨re continued to design collections and to take part in fashion press weeks until 1994. She closed her ready-to-wear business at that time, partly because several of her principal accounts went into bankruptcy, owing her money. She moved out of her prestigious Seventh Avenue showrooms and took a small space elsewhere in the fashion district, forming a company called P. T. Concepts to market her scarves and jewelry. It was during this period that she underwent several eye and throat operations. She gave up even her smaller space in 2000.         Despite her sophistication, she never lost a sense of delight and wonder at the friendships she enjoyed with many of the illustrious names in the fashion, arts, business and political worlds. She entertained frequently, both in her Manhattan apartment and at her country house, called La Tortue (the Turtle), in South Salem, N.Y. She was known as an excellent cook, and in both homes the atmosphere was informal but carefully orchestrated. She was one of the first hostesses to set a formal table but to have guests follow her into the kitchen to pick up their second courses buffet style.         Once she bought her country house, she spent several years tripling its size. ''I'm engaged, married and completely devoted to this house,'' she once said. She was equally passionate about the grounds, and was a dedicated and knowledgeable gardener.         She was dedicated, also, to her adopted country.         ''People always say to me, 'Aren't you French?' and I say, 'No, I am American,' '' she said. ''I found in this country everything I wanted. This country made me Pauline TrigÃ¨re.''         Shortly after her 90th birthday, she told friends that she had left instructions that she wanted to be cremated wearing her trademark bright red lipstick. ''What does it matter?'' one friend asked. ''Who will know whether or not you have lipstick on?''         ''I'll know,'' she said.         Miss TrigÃ¨re's family said there would be a viewing tonight at the Riverside Memorial Chapel on the Upper West Side.       
         Pauline TrigÃ¨re, the Paris-born designer who was not only her own best model but also an elegant and chic symbol of the American fashion industry for more than half a century, died at her home on the East Side of Manhattan on Wednesday night, said her daughter-in-law Melanie Radley.

         Theresa Bernstein, who as a member of the Ash Can School of realistic painting was both hailed and flailed for ''painting like a man'' in the 1910's and then continued to generate vibrant canvases for eight more decades, died in Manhattan on Tuesday. She was generally believed to be 111 and lived in Manhattan and Gloucester, Mass.         She died at Mount Sinai Hospital, Suzanne Laurier, a friend for 23 years, said. Ms. Laurier said she had reason to believe Ms. Bernstein may have been as much as five years older, a view others echo.         Ms. Bernstein, who has no survivors, was never particularly helpful on the subject.         ''I'm old enough to keep it to myself,'' she said in an interview with The Boston Globe in 1998.         Her paintings now sell for $100,000  in galleries. She originally gained recognition as one of the first women to paint in the Realist style, favoring the informal composition and contemporary subject matter typical of the movement. She hardly advertised her sex: she signed her gritty paintings of urban scenes with her last name or ''T. Bernstein.''         Indeed, at the beginning of her career, the important thing to some seemed to be that she had somehow transcended being a woman.         ''It is with a man's vision that this artist looks at her subjects -- in the streets, the elevated trains, at the beaches, in the parks, the lobbies of theaters, in seaport places or in a church,'' Frederick James Gregg wrote in The New York Herald in a review of her first solo show in 1919.         ''Then having found what she wants, it is with a man's vigor that she gets it down to stay,'' he continued.         Writing in the American Art Review in April 2001, Patricia M. Burnham countered that Ms. Bernstein, for all her so-called ''masculine'' vigor, showed a decidedly feminine sensibility.         ''She saw as a woman, perceived the city and its hustle and bustle very much from a woman's point of view,'' she wrote. ''As a result, she incorporated into her art types and activities ignored by her male counterparts: women readers using the New York Public Library, traveling unchaperoned on the el, making hats, creating art in the company of other women, applying for jobs.''         Others insist that her work, as particularly evidenced by her forceful brush strokes, spoke for itself.         ''She was just a great painter, period,'' said Jan Ramirez, director of the New-York Historical Society's museum.         When Ms. Ramirez organized an exhibition of Ms. Bernstein's work in 1991, in her previous job as a curator at the Museum of the City of New York, it was Ms. Bernstein's first museum exhibition since 1948. There have since been museum exhibitions in Philadelphia, Boston and Stamford, Conn., and three one-person shows at Joan Whalen Fine Art in Manhattan.         Her paintings are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, the Chicago Art Institute, the New York Public Library and the Brooklyn Museum. She has had more than 40 solo exhibitions.         Ms. Bernstein admitted to being born on March 1, 1890, according to several published accounts. But Ms. Laurier, who knew Ms. Bernstein's husband of 62 years, the painter and etcher William Meyerowitz, said he told her and others that his wife was two years older than he was; if so, she would have turned 116 in two weeks.         Records of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women indicate, however, that Ms. Bernstein enrolled in 1907 at age 17, making her 111 at her death.         Her father was a textile manufacturer and her mother an accomplished pianist. As a girl, she made several trips to Europe with her mother and was impressed by Expressionist painters like Edvard Munch. After attending the Philadelphia art school, now the Moore College of Art and Design, she moved to New York and joined the Art Students League, where she studied portrait painting with William Merritt Chase.         She met Mr. Meyerowitz when he noticed one of her paintings at a show and dropped by to ask her for a donation to a charity that gave artworks to the poor.         ''Oh, I thought you were an older man,'' Mr. Meyerowitz said to Ms. Bernstein, who was then probably 29. She gave him several paintings, and their courtship started. Shortly after they were married, she had a baby girl named Isadora, who died two months later.         The two often painted side by side, but Mr. Meyerowitz was much more publicly prominent. Three years after his death, she revealed hundreds of her own paintings.         When she visited the Museum of the City of New York in the late 1980's to discuss a possible exhibition of her husband's work, curators decided to exhibit her work instead.         ''All told, his subject matter is not in any way revolutionary,'' Ms. Ramirez said. ''She was far more the iconoclast of the two.''         She loved to paint groups of people. Her studies of suffrage parades in 1912 led to a series of works from 1916 to 1919 that documented the patriotic displays of World War I. She became close to members of The Eight, as the Ashcan School was also called, and her urban landscapes reflected this influence.         She was also associated with the Philadelphia 10, a group of women who had studied art in Philadelphia.         Her early reputation was suggested by a review in The New York Times on March 13, 1927, comparing the emotions evoked by her art to ''this little cavorting fling that reminds one of colts in pasture.''         By the 1930's, she did not follow the art world toward greater abstraction, though her husband did. Even as her palate exploded with inspired colors -- salmon skies and chartreuse cheeks -- her mission became one of breaking down the barrier between high art and everyday people.         ''In some ways, Bernstein is a Thornton Wilder of the canvas, '' Ms. Burnham wrote, offering ''consoling and nostalgic images to viewers of the 21st century.''         Her determination was legendary. When she broke her right hand, she painted with her left. When she could no longer hold a brush, she painted by squirting paint from tubes.         And she never lost her eye for a touching scene. On a Valentine's Day several years ago, Ms. Laurier pushed her wheelchair past a store where a couple were kissing in the window as part of a promotion.         ''Get my sketch pad,'' Ms. Bernstein commanded.       
         Ani Pachen, celebrated as the warrior nun who led her Tibetan clan in armed rebellion against the Chinese invaders until she was captured and spent 21 years as a prisoner, died on Feb. 2 in her home in exile in Dharmsala, India. She was 68 or 69.         John Hocevar, executive director of Students for a Free Tibet, said she became ill with what were thought to be stomach problems, and her heart failed. He explained that she, like many Tibetans of her generation, did not know her specific birthday. She was born in 1933.         She was given the name Pachen Dolma at birth, but became known as Ani Pachen after becoming a Buddhist nun.         Her name translates roughly as Nun Big Courage.         Its aptness was suggested by her leading 600 resistance fighters on horseback against the tanks of the invading Chinese Communists,  prompting some admirers to caller her Tibet's Joan of Arc. In prison she withstood being beaten and hung by her wrists for a week and spending a year in leg irons.         ''I felt terrible for those who imprisoned me,'' she said, and also expressed sorrow for the captors who tortured her, saying she held the Buddhist belief that their cruelties resulted from karma from their past lives.         Pachen Dolma was the only child of a local chieftain from Gonjo in the province of Kham in eastern Tibet. She grew up surrounded by lamas and a loving family, said William Edelglass, a professor of philosophy who specializes on Tibet at Emory University. She learned to ride and shoot, even as she was drawn toward a spiritual life.         At the age of 17, she overheard talk of plans for an arranged marriage to the chieftain of another clan. She fled to a distant monastery and became a Buddhist nun. When her family relented on the marriage plans, she returned home and divided her time between learning from her father how to be a chieftain and religious studies.         The Chinese, who had invaded in 1950, were desecrating monasteries and killing Tibetans as they steadily advanced toward Kham. In 1958, Ani Pachen sat at her father's side in the war councils as the clan decided to fight back.         Later that year, her father fell ill and died. She reluctantly decided her Buddhist pacifism must give way to warfare as the only way to save the religion in Tibet.         When Gonjo was overrun, she fled to the hills with her family and led the fighting. Her troops ambushed Chinese convoys and destroyed their camps, but were gradually defeated. In 1960, she was captured while trying to flee on foot over the Himalayas with her mother, aunt and aged grandmother. She was 25 when she began her 21-year imprisonment.         ''When they arrested me they bound my hands and feet and hung me upside down and interrogated me,'' she said in a speech reported in the Buddhist magazine Shambhala Sun. ''They beat me continuously. I would pass out and they would throw water on me and beat me some more. They shackled me for a year. They put me in a hole in the ground and forced me to live in my own feces.''         She told her story in an autobiography, ''Sorrow Mountain: The Remarkable Story of a Tibetan Warrior Nun,'' written with Adelaide Donnelly (Doubleday, 2000). Richard Gere, the actor and a Buddhist, helped get the book printed and wrote a preface.         ''Rarely has the injustice of Chinese occupation been so movingly, or graphically exposed,'' said a review in The Sunday Times of London.         Ani Pachen told how she was so hungry that she would rejoice when she found a worm in the soil. She said her Buddhist faith kept her alive: for instance, she was determined to complete 100,000 ritual prostrations during nine months of solitary confinement.         Ani Pachen was released from prison in January 1981. Instead of returning home, she remained in Lhasa and took part in several large demonstrations. Tipped off in 1988 that she was at risk for rearrest, she fled for the border. She settled in Dharmsala, joining other supporters of the exiled Dalai Lama, whom she had long dreamed of meeting. Her mother, aunt and grandmother had died. She left no survivors.         Ani Pachen traveled the world to speak for the Tibetan cause. For all her apparent equanimity, she acknowledged resentment over losing her youth in prison.         ''I have not reached enlightenment -- the absence of negative feelings,'' she wrote. ''I want to have full compassion, but I spent half my life in prison and I still have some anger.''       
         Eda J. LeShan, a psychologist and family counselor who brought psychoanalytic insights and common sense to two dozen books meant to guide people through life's challenges, died on March 2 at her home in Riverdale, the Bronx. She was 79.         The cause was kidney failure, said a nephew, Bruce LeShan.         Ms. LeShan was known for the motherly warmth she brought to books like ''The Conspiracy Against Childhood'' (Atheneum, 1967), her best-known work on raising children; her radio commentaries on CBS; and her show on PBS, ''How Do Your Children Grow?''         Her message to harried parents was to ease off on the pressure, and sometimes allow children to just daydream. She thought that the discussion of love was central to sex education, and that spanking could only make the child feel as bad as the angry parent.         She said every parent should have a sampler on the wall that says, ''I'm only human.'' Raising a child, she said, is like gardening, because each flower develops differently.         A reviewer in Publishers Weekly in 1978 wrote, ''Adults and young people have benefited from LeShan's fluent, sympathetic writing in books addressed to those in trouble.''         Eda Joan Grossman was born in Manhattan on June 6, 1922. Her mother, Jean Schick Grossman, was a parent educator, and her father, Max Grossman, was a lawyer and president of the Ethical Culture Society of New York.         She graduated from the Fieldston School in Riverdale, and received a degree in early childhood education from Teachers College at Columbia University. She earned a master's degree in child psychology from Clark University in Worcester, Mass.         Her life amounted to personal testimony to her message that people could continue to grow throughout their lives.         She wrote her first book when she was 43, began to appear regularly on a television show when she was 46 and got her own program on educational television when she was 48.         In addition to her books, which have been translated into nine languages, and her television and radio shows, she wrote a regular column for Newsday for years and was a contributing editor of Parents magazine. Her articles appeared in many magazines, including The New York Times Magazine in the 1960's. For nine years, she wrote the ''Talking It Over'' column for Woman's Day.         As she aged, she wrote more about older people. Her books include ''The Wonderful Crisis of Middle Age: Some Personal Reflections'' (McKay, 1973), ''Oh, to Be Fifty Again!'' (Random House, 1986) and ''Grandparents: A Special Kind of Love'' (Macmillan, 1984).         ''I used to be a child psychologist and I love children and I kind of miss that part of my life,'' she said in an interview on ''CBS This Morning'' in 1990. ''But I try to write the same way when I'm writing for older people, where I share my vulnerabilities and my aches and pains and my mood swings and so forth.''         She wrote a play in her 70's. It was called ''The Lobster Reef,'' in reference to the vulnerability lobsters experience when they shed their shells and are completely naked until they grow a new one. It told the story of a woman battling to rid herself of literal and figurative cancers.         When the one-woman play opened in 1995 on Ms. LeShan's 73rd birthday, Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The Times that it was ''a striking creation'' that brought to life four generations. He wrote that it would be interesting to see what she could do if she put more than one character on stage.         She is survived by her husband, Lawrence LeShan, and their daughter, Wendy, who also lives in Riverdale.       
         Dorothy DeLay, one of the world's most famous teachers of the violin and a mentor to two generations of players ranging from Itzhak Perlman to Midori and Sarah Chang, died on Sunday. She was 84 and lived in Upper Nyack, N.Y.         Miss DeLay, as her students continued to call her even after they became star performers, began her teaching career almost as an afterthought in 1947, when she was a student of Ivan Galamian at the Juilliard School. Accepting a handful of invitations for part-time teaching and assistantships at the Henry Street Settlement, the Juilliard School and Sarah Lawrence College led her to realize that she enjoyed teaching more than she enjoyed performing.         For more than 20 years she worked largely in Galamian's shadow, but in the 1970's she became a sought-after teacher in her own right, and became the first woman -- and the first American-born violnist -- to be regarded as a master violin teacher in the tradition of Galamian and Leopold Auer.         The list of students who became famous soon after leaving her studio quickly blossomed starting in the 1970's. In addition to Mr. Perlman, Midori and Ms. Chang, they include Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, Nigel Kennedy, Gil Shaham, Shlomo Mintz and Cho-Liang Lin. Also among her pupils are members and often founders of some of the world's great chamber groups, among them the Juilliard, the Tokyo, the Cleveland, the Vermeer, the Takacs and the Ying Quartets. Others like Joseph Swenson and Peter Oundjian became conductors and many became concertmasters and section players in orchestras around the world as well as members of conservatory faculties. At the Juilliard School, the faculty includes 14 of her former students.         Miss DeLay was as well known for her easygoing, direct manner and her homey advice as she was for the demanding five-hour practice regimen she recommended in which full hours were devoted to technical basics, etudes, repertory pieces, concertos and works by Bach but also in which 10-minute breaks between hours were allowed. Instead of imposing her views about the great violin repertory on her pupils, she encouraged them to discuss their own interpretive ideas. If they appeared to be on the wrong path, she would gently steer them right. Some of her former students described her work in Zen-like terms.         ''I think the greatest things about Dorothy DeLay,'' Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg said in a 1992 interview, ''is that she has the ability to look at a young student or an old student and pretty much size up their character and the way that they think -- their personality, basically -- and how in a short period of time what's the best door to use to get them into here. And that's her method -- that fact that there is really no method.''         Yet Miss DeLay's easygoing manner was not to be taken entirely at face value. Having molded dozens of top-flight soloists, she also became an important power broker in the music business. Conductors and managers trusted her advice.         Dorothy DeLay was born on March 31, 1917, in Medicine Lodge, Kan. Her parents were both musicians and teachers. She later described the household as strict and religious and said that her mother briefly toured the country with Carry Nation, campaigning against alcohol. Miss DeLay began playing the violin when she was 4 and gave a recital at her church when she was 5. When she was 16, she enrolled at the Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio, where she studied the violin with Raymond Cerf, a student of the Belgian virtuoso and composer EugÃ¨ne Ysaye.         After a year Miss DeLay transferred to Michigan State University, after her parents decided that they did not want her to study solely music. But the violin remained her focus, and after her graduation in 1937, when she was 20, she moved to New York and enrolled at the Juilliard School to continue her studies with Louis Persinger, Hans Letz and Felix Salmond. As a student, Miss DeLay supported herself by working as a baby sitter and playing the violin in restaurants, at weddings and in Broadway theater orchestras. But she also began performing as a recitalist and in a chamber ensemble, the Stuyvesant Trio, which included her sister Nellis, a cellist, and Helen Brainard, a pianist; and she toured Latin America as a member of Leopold Stokowski's All-American Youth Orchestra.         During a cross-country train journey at the end of the All-American Youth Orchestra tour in 1940, Miss DeLay met Edward Newhouse, a novelist and short story writer for The New Yorker. They were married early in 1941 after a courtship of four months. Mr. Newhouse survives Miss DeLay, as do their son, Jeffrey Newhouse, of Bronxville, and their daughter, Alison Dinsmore, of Boston, as well as four grandchildren.         Miss DeLay continued touring as a soloist and with the Stuyvesant Trio after her marriage, but by the mid-1940's she decided that she did not like performing. She briefly considered studying medicine but decided instead to return to the Juilliard School in 1946 for more violin studies. Her teacher was Galamian; two years later she became his assistant, both at Juilliard and at the summer camp he had established in 1944, Meadowmount.         It was Galamian's devotion to teaching that inspired Miss DeLay to give it a try. She maintained her association with the Juilliard School for the rest of her life and taught at Sarah Lawrence College from 1947 to 1987. Her other teaching associations included Meadowmount, Aspen, the University of Cincinnati, the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts, the New England Conservatory, and the Royal College of Music in London.         By the late 1960's Miss DeLay's relationship with Galamian became strained, partly because of growing differences in their teaching methods and philosophies. But there were personal tensions as well, and their relationship ruptured entirely in 1970 when Miss DeLay telephoned Galamian to say that she would teach the following summer at Aspen instead of at his Meadowmount school. Galamian never spoke with Miss DeLay again, and when his demand that the Juilliard School fire her was not met, he told students who were working with both of them that they had to make a choice. Among those who chose Miss DeLay was Mr. Perlman.         ''With Galamian there was almost no room for give and take because he had a particular system that he applied to everybody,'' Mr. Perlman told Barbara Lourie Sand, the author of ''Teaching Genius: Dorothy DeLay and the Making of a Musician,'' a book about Miss DeLay, published in 2000. ''Miss DeLay was much more flexible, was much more into the person, and into their background, into what makes them tick. I would come and play for her, and if something was not quite right, it wasn't like she was going to kill me.         ''That's where we come to the differences between the two. She would ask questions about what you thought of particular phrases -- where the top of the phrase was, and so on. We would have a very friendly, interesting discussion about 'Why do you think it should sound like this?' and 'What do you think of that?' I was not quite used to this way of approaching things.''         With Miss DeLay's growing fame in the 1980's and 90's came detractors, including former students who complained that she was frequently late to lessons or that her essentially anti-authoritarian mode of teaching was actually lax and uninvolved. Still, by the late 1980's, her studio had become a soloist factory of sorts: a concertgoer reading her name in the program biography of a young performer could be assured of a high level of playing and often a particular kind of sound -- lush and beautifully burnished with a big but not overwhelming vibrato.         In addition to many honorary degrees, Miss DeLay received the National Medal of Arts in 1994, the National Music Council's American Eagle Award in 1995, the Sanford Medal from Yale University in 1997 and the Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Japanese Government in 1998.       
         Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, the enduringly popular grande dame of the British royal family and the country's most beloved symbol of courage and self-sacrifice during World War II, died in her sleep this afternoon at the Royal Lodge at Windsor Palace, a spokesman for her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, announced. She was 101.         In a life longer than the 20th century, the queen mother presided over a period of turbulence and change in Britain, helping to sustain the monarchy through the most serious crises to befall it in modern times.         In 1936, when her painfully diffident husband was crowned King George VI after the abdication of his older brother, she became the strength behind the throne, helping transform him from a stammering, insecure second son into a loved and respected monarch.         As queen during World War II, her decision to remain in London through the worst days of the blitz proved a rallying point for Britons desperate for the sort of leadership that only a monarch could provide. And when Buckingham Palace was bombed, she forever endeared herself to the nation by declaring herself in solidarity with the working-class people of London's bomb-ravaged East End.         ''I am almost glad we have been bombed,'' she said, in what became one of the war's most memorable remarks. ''Now I feel I can look the East End in the face.''         Many years later, through the traumas of the divorce and then the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales, her granddaughter-in-law, the queen mother proved to be the royal family's most resiliently popular member, providing the country with a rock-steady reason for remaining a monarchy. News of her death today dealt a blow to Britons accustomed to her enduring presence. [Page 16.]         When King George died in 1952, she was thrust at the age of 51 into what would be the longest role of her life: that of the queen mother, necessarily taking a back seat to her daughter, Queen Elizabeth. But in the eyes of a country that never lost its abiding affection for its good-natured ''Queen Mum,'' it was a role she fulfilled with grace, carrying out a grueling schedule of public engagements well into her 90's and never losing her common touch, which included a healthy appetite for a glass or two of gin and a love of horse racing and trout fishing.         ''She is the nation's favorite great-grandmother, seemingly known intimately to all of us for years,'' The Times of London declared in 1985, on the occasion of the queen mother's 85th birthday (she celebrated it by flying on the Concorde). ''She has helped make the royal family more secure in the nation's affections than it has been at any other time in history.''         Ben Pimlott, the historian and royal biographer, wrote in 1997 that the queen mother was ''the last survivor of the tiny club of center-stage actors of the Second World War.'' He continued: ''She has also shown a chameleon-like ability to adapt to shifting conditions, something her deeply conservative nature makes the more remarkable. Unlike most public figures, she does not date. She has never made an intellectual remark in her life. Her knack has been to look for the best in people and offer a kind of looking glass to the virtues they would like to have.''         Father Was an Eccentric         Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was born in London on Aug. 4, 1900, in the waning days of the reign of Queen Victoria, a golden time for the British monarchy and its empire. She was the fourth daughter and ninth child of Lord Glamis, a Scottish nobleman whose family occupied Glamis Castle in Scotland, said to be the place where Macbeth murdered Duncan in Shakespeare's play. When his father died four years later, Lord Glamis inherited a considerable fortune and an even more impressive title, becoming the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon and Baron Glamis.         Lord Strathmore was a bona fide aristocratic eccentric. He had a deep mistrust of eggs (''Poison, my dear, poison,'' he would intone ominously at the breakfast table) and a habit of dragging dead branches from his woods in the middle of the night. Dressed in an old raincoat tied with string, he would then split them into logs for the fire.         Raised partly at Glamis and partly in the fashionable Knightsbridge section of London, the young Lady Elizabeth was by all accounts sunny almost to a fault. Her favorite hobby, she once wrote in an autograph album, was ''making friends.''         Indifferently educated by governesses, Elizabeth spent much of her youth doing what young aristocratic women generally did at the time: learning arts like household management and enjoying herself. The real world intruded during World War I, though, when her brothers went off to fight and Glamis was turned for four years into a convalescent home for soldiers. Wanting to protect her mother from bad news, Elizabeth made sure to waylay the mailman every morning so that she could read the mail first. In fact, there was bad news: one of Elizabeth's brothers was killed, sending Lady Strathmore into a depression from which she never really recovered.         When the war was over, Elizabeth's social life, essentially an extended search for a husband in the guise of a series of amusing diversions, began in earnest. Her biographers tend to agree that she was a great success as a debutante, flirting wildly and constantly fending off a large coterie of broken-hearted suitors, one of whom reportedly -- and unromantically -- serenaded her by cracking his hunting whip under her bedroom window at night.         Elizabeth and Bertie         Although history is hazy on facts, several biographers say there was one suitor whom Elizabeth was genuinely in love with: Maj. James Stuart, the equerry to Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George, the Duke of York and King George V's second son. But if there was a romance there, it never went anywhere. Albert began courting Elizabeth himself, and Major Stuart ended up being summarily shipped off to work on an oil rig in Oklahoma. The day before Elizabeth's wedding, he announced his own engagement to one of her friends.         The romance between Elizabeth and Bertie, as the prince was known, apparently did not begin promisingly. Bullied by his parents and overshadowed by his handsome and charming older brother, David, the Prince of Wales, Bertie suffered from delicate health, crippling shyness, an array of nervous tics, a terrible stutter, an unpredictable temper, a tendency to melancholy and what today would be described as a serious case of low self-esteem. When he asked his parents' permission to pursue Elizabeth, his father murmured, ''You'll be a lucky fellow if she accepts you.''         Elizabeth did resist Bertie's attentions for several years, finally accepting his proposal in 1923 and thus agreeing to become the first commoner (anyone below the rank of peer or peeress) to marry so close to the throne since the 17th century. It was when her engagement was announced that Lady Elizabeth had her first and only on-the-record conversation with a reporter. The interview was harmless enough -- ''I play golf, badly, and I am fond of lawn tennis,'' she confided -- but she was roundly rebuked by the king, and never gave another interview.         The wedding was a national extravaganza, but afterward Elizabeth, now the Duchess of York, settled in relatively modest circumstances, at least by royal standards. Though the house she shared with Bertie at 145 Piccadilly, London, had 25 bedrooms and 21 servants, it was hardly a palace, and it opened onto a communal garden at the back. They had two children, Elizabeth, known as Lilibet, and Margaret Rose, and the Duchess settled into a pleasant life of regal domesticity, saying her main duty was ''bringing up her children.''         Another duty was bucking up the flagging spirits of her husband, who hated the spotlight but who was required to make many public appearances, particularly as his father's health waned and his older brother proved more interested in a racy social life than in boring regal duties. But while in many ways the personalities of the Yorks could not have been more different -- she was ebullient where he was glum, relaxed where he was awkward, garrulous where he was laconic -- they were surprisingly well suited.         Among other things, Elizabeth forced Bertie to seek treatment for what was delicately referred to as his ''affliction,'' and the two visited a Harley Street doctor nearly every day for some two and a half months, as Bertie learned to keep his stutter in check. The marriage proved to be just what the future king needed, Bertie's official biographer, Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, would later write. ''It brought him much for which he had long craved in deprivation -- love, understanding, sympathy, support,'' he said. ''All these things were now his in generous abundance, and his whole conspectus of life changed accordingly.''         Edward and Mrs. Simpson         The coziness of their early years was abruptly shattered in 1936, when King Edward VIII, as Bertie's older brother styled himself on ascending the throne, announced that he had fallen inconveniently in love with the very married Wallis Simpson, an American whose earlier divorce from her first husband had already ruled her out as a possible royal bride.         Not even the exhortations of his most trusted advisers, or the frightened tears of his younger brother, would make Edward give up Mrs. Simpson, and on Dec. 10, 1936, he abdicated and left for France. Mrs. Simpson got a divorce in 1937, and the two eventually married, adopted a flotilla of small dogs, and spent the rest of their lives in glamorous if bitter exile as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.         The terrified Bertie was left behind to comfort a shocked nation and to try to rise to the occasion. ''Dickie, this is absolutely terrible,'' he told his friend and cousin Lord Mountbatten. ''I'm quite unprepared for it. David has been trained for this all his life. I've never even seen a state paper.'' It was clear, even then, how much he depended on Elizabeth. ''With my wife and helpmeet by my side, I take up the heavy burden which lies before me,'' he said on his first day as king.         Elizabeth may have seemed complaisant and sweet, but she had a ''steel hand within a velvet glove,'' in the words of Lord Halifax, the foreign secretary, and she never forgave David or Wallis Simpson for throwing her husband to the wolves. ''She can forgive any act but treachery, and then she is implacable as any Scot,'' wrote Dorothy Laird, one of Elizabeth's biographers. ''The wound goes very deep.'' Most of her anger, it seems, was directed against the duchess.         Bertie himself was so unnerved that he never mentioned Wallis's name, referring to her in his diary as ''Mrs. S.,'' but the queen certainly had a hand in ensuring that she and her brother-in-law had as rough a time as possible. On the eve of their wedding and in a move that foreshadowed the battle over a post-divorce title for Diana, the Princess of Wales, more than 50 years later, the couple were informed that while the duke would continue to be styled ''royal highness,'' the duchess would not. The wedding was a tiny, fraught affair, with only 12 guests, none from David's family.         Acutely sensitive to what they saw as the duke's efforts to set up an unofficial rival court, the king and queen continually thwarted David's efforts to return home with Wallis. It was not until 30 years later, with Bertie long dead, that Elizabeth was to come face to face again with her hated sister-in-law, whom she always called in private ''the woman who killed my husband.'' (Wallis was not particularly fond of her, either, referring to her as ''Cookie'' in a disparaging reference to her plumpness.)         The crisis having been weathered, the new king and queen set out to remove some of the stuffiness from royal life, dispensing, for instance, with the custom of requiring the king's daughters to curtsy to him. But they would soon find other matters preoccupying them, as the country became consumed with the specter of impending war. The king tried valiantly, if ineffectually, to do his part for diplomacy, preparing a personal letter to Hitler in 1938 that appealed to him ''as one ex-serviceman to another'' and begged him to spare the world from another war. (In the end, the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, sternly if gently forbade the King to send the letter.)         The King and the President         Early in 1939, Elizabeth and Bertie traveled to Hyde Park, N.Y., to visit Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, the president and first lady of the United States. The trip, in which they had their first taste of hot dogs, cemented a friendship that was to prove helpful in obtaining American support for the war effort later. In her memoirs, Mrs. Roosevelt described the easy banter between the king and the president.         ''My mother does not approve of cocktails and thinks you should have a cup of tea,'' Roosevelt said. ''Neither does my mother,'' the king replied. Then they both had cocktails.         War broke out in August, when Hitler invaded Poland, and Elizabeth was formally advised by the British cabinet to take her daughters to Canada until the danger was past. She refused to go, stoutly declaring that ''the princesses would never leave without me, and I wouldn't leave without the king, and the king will never leave.'' Instead, she remained in London, enthusiastically taking target practice at the palace with a revolver that was a gift from the new prime minister, Winston Churchill.         The royal family's role in wartime was a largely ceremonial one -- visiting Red Cross centers, civil defense installations, air-raid shelters, hospitals and munition factories; comforting the wounded, and boosting the morale of soldier and civilian alike --but the importance of such ceremony at such a time cannot be overstated.         ''Your majesty, don't you know what you mean to all of us in this country?'' the minister of food at the time, Lord Woolton, once said to Elizabeth. ''It isn't only your high position that matters; it is the fact that the vast majority of people think of you as a person who would speak the kindly word, and, if it fell within your power, would take the cup of hot soup to the needy person.''         Though the king made secret visits to the troops and Elizabeth made a point of visiting places that had been bombed, invariably wearing a smart dress and pearls, they were relatively unaffected personally until Sept. 13, 1940. That day, as the royal couple sat in one of their living rooms at Buckingham Palace, the palace was struck by half a dozen German bombs, which damaged its courtyard and destroyed its chapel. Although they were able to take refuge in an unusually upscale bomb shelter, prepared by the queen with handsome furniture and a supply of fashion magazines, it was then that the queen made her enduring remark about being able ''to look the East End in the eye.''         In a biography of Elizabeth, the royal writer Anthony Holden called it ''a phrase which will reverberate through the history of the British monarchy's relations with its people.'' He continued, ''Never before, or indeed since, had such a strength of fellow-feeling been so genuine and so widely shared.''         A Spartan Windsor Castle         The queen also made it clear that she was determined to adhere to strict rules of wartime economy. Although the royal family's life was naturally easier than that of most of her countrymen, it was still rigorously ascetic. Windsor Castle, where Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were to spend the next five years, had no heat except for the occasional space heater, and just one bare bulb for each room.         When Mrs. Roosevelt visited Buckingham Palace in 1942, she found a bathtub painted with a black line above which water was not supposed to rise; food that was close to inedible (and severely rationed) and rooms that were so cold that the women wore fur coats and blankets indoors.         Not even Churchill escaped. Accustomed to eating meager sandwiches served by the queen during his weekly luncheon meetings with the king, he found on one occasion that the food was even more horrific than usual. ''I don't know what is in these sandwiches,'' the king told the prime minister. ''Sawdust, I suppose.''         The king's always fragile health was not improved by the stresses of the war or by his lifelong smoking habit, and after victory was declared in 1945, he began the long, slow decline that would result in his death, from lung cancer, in 1952. With the death of her husband, Elizabeth had to face the fact that she was no longer on center stage, would have to leave Buckingham Palace, and would, if protocol was strictly followed, have to curtsy to her own daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Riven with grief, she wrote to President Eisenhower that ''one cannot imagine life without him, but one must carry on as he would have wished.''         In the past, widowed mothers of monarchs were known as queen dowagers, but Elizabeth rejected that title in favor of the more impressive one she held to her death: Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. As queen mother, she lost neither her formidability nor her ability to influence. The new queen was just 25 when she ascended the throne, and relied heavily on the advice of her mother. The operators at Clarence House, which became the queen mother's official residence, soon became used to putting through her daughter's daily telephone call: ''Your majesty?'' they would say, ''I have her majesty on the line, your majesty.''         Another Divorce Crisis         Soon afterward, another crisis befell the monarchy when Princess Margaret, the queen mother's younger daughter, fell in love with a divorced man, Peter Townsend, a hero of the Battle of Britain. It is unclear what role her mother played in the queen's decision to inform Margaret that she would have to give up her royal status and leave the country if she married Mr. Townsend, but the lessons of Edward's abdication were surely not lost to her now. The princess gave up her beau, married the photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones five years later, and ended up divorcing him 15 years after that. Margaret died on Feb. 9, predeceasing her mother by less than two months.         Bolstered by a large staff, a number of houses at her disposal, and an allowance of more than $1 million a year from Parliament, the queen mother kept up a busy schedule that began to ease up only when she was in her 80's. She served as either president or patron of 312 British organizations, ranging, as one biographer put it, ''from the Royal Agricultural Society to the Dachshund Club.'' As a link to the past, a symbol of continuity, and, to many, a potent reminder of Britain's finest hour, the she remained a familiar figure even in her late 90's, in her cheerful, brightly colored dresses, large flowery hats and ready smile.         Her health problems over the years always became a cause for concern in a country that simply did not want her to die. She had two hip-replacement operations in her late 90's, which invariably ended with her hobbling slowly out of the hospital while crowds of well-wishers cheered. What the public did not learn, until it was finally reported by the news media much later, was that she underwent a colostomy in 1966 and had to wear a bag to collect her wastes for the rest of her life.         In recent years, there were niggling criticisms of the queen mother: that she was a bon vivant who spent far beyond her means; that she kept too many houses and employed too many servants and generally thought too much of her own comfort. But such sniping was relatively muted.         She remained popular because, in a very different and much more real way than Diana had been, she was a monarch who never lost the common touch. Nor did she lose her rather sly, flirtatious smile, her beguiling manner (''I work awfully hard, but Mummy has all the charm,'' her daughter Elizabeth once said) or her easy way with the public.         Reveling in meeting and chatting to new people (''If we do not pass on, I shall soon pass out,'' her husband once said as Elizabeth persisted in chatting at a public appearance), she was also eternally tactful and diplomatic. At a luncheon on a trip to South Africa, she once listened patiently as an irate Afrikaaner mayor complained about the indignities his countrymen had suffered at the hands of the English. ''Oh, I do understand so well,'' Elizabeth responded. ''That's just how we feel about them in Scotland.''         And once, after touring a garden in London, she stayed on for tea. ''I hear you like gin?'' her hostess blurted out, instantly afraid of appearing tactless. But the queen mother thought it delightful.         ''I hadn't realized I enjoyed that reputation,'' she replied. ''But as I do, perhaps you could make it a large one.''         Correction:  April 1, 2002, Monday  An obituary of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother yesterday misstated the name of the royal estate where she died. It is Windsor Castle, not Windsor Palace.         Correction:  April 3, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on Sunday misstated the date of Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, which prompted the cabinet to suggest that she take her daughters to Canada. It was Sept. 1, not in August.       
         Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, who emerged as a popular, prolific writer of keenly observed nonfiction with a 1978 book about the dozen years she spent as a Jehovah's Witness, died on Wednesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 67 and lived in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn.         The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said her daughter, Anna Harrison. She once wrote that for years she smoked six packs of cigarettes a day.         The turning point in her life and career was her decision, at 22, to leave the Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade a college education. What followed was a successful self-education and a blossoming into a multifaceted writer of literate travel books, many essays and reviews, and a novel.         With ''Visions of Glory: A History and a Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Simon & Schuster), she became nationally known; her later work, mostly nonfiction, usually received excellent reviews.         In The New York Times Book Review, Vivian Gornick said ''Visions of Glory'' was ''quite well written, contains a mass of absorbing information, and the personality of its author is extremely appealing.''         Ms. Harrison was converted to the Jehovah's Witnesses faith by her mother when she was 9; she went door to door carrying its message. At 19, she went to live and work at its world headquarters, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society in Brooklyn Heights.         After three years there, she renounced the faith and left.         ''Visions of Glory'' mixes her autobiography with detailed historical research. She portrays the religion as racist, sexist and totalitarian, but also details members' kindness to one another, their care for the elderly and their courage in the face of persecution.         Barbara Grizzuti was born in Jamaica, Queens, on Sept. 14, 1934. She grew up in various Brooklyn neighborhoods, mainly Bensonhurst. Her father, a printer, and her brother, Richard, did not become Jehovah's Witnesses, creating a deep fault line in the household. She wrote of an extremely disorganized family, and of a father who sexually abused her and once tried to kill her.         As a young teenager, Barbara already knew she wanted to be a writer. When asked in an interview in ''Contemporary Authors'' how she could reconcile this ambition with the tenets of the Jehovah's Witnesses, she suggested that the religion's images of the watery creation of the world and its imminent bloody destruction stimulated her imagination.         ''I think the two things were going on simultaneously: the religion encouraged something it was bound to squash,'' she said.         In her autobiography, ''An Accidental Autobiography'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1996), she wrote, ''I read Sartre in my late teens and made the mistake of taking him seriously.''         After leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses, she moved to the East Village and worked as a secretary at a publishing house and at the American Committee on Africa. There she met W. Dale Harrison, whom she married. He took a job with CARE, and they lived in Libya, India and Guatemala.         They returned to Brooklyn with their two children, and she wrote that she thought of herself as ''one of those furtive, silly housewives with a novel under her apron.''         Her first book, ''Unlearning the Lie: Sexism in School'' (Liveright, 1969), grew out of the children's experiences with efforts to quell sexism at what was then the Woodward Park School in Brooklyn.         The Harrisons divorced in 1968 after eight years of marriage.         Ms. Harrison was an early writer for Ms. Magazine. Often described as a gifted interviewer, she contributed to many other national magazines and newspapers. She was noted for her humor and her strong opinions; she once called the highly regarded novelist Joan Didion a ''neurasthenic Cher.''         Her other books included ''Italian Days'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1989), an impressionistic and literary travel book about Italy that won the American Book Award, and a novel, ''Foreign Bodies'' (Doubleday, 1984).         Ms. Harrison is survived by her daughter, who lives in Bethlehem, Conn., and her son, Josh Harrison of Manhattan.         Her daughter said her mother returned to the religion of her early childhood, Roman Catholicism, in her 40's, partly as a result of interviewing Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement and partly because she hoped to meet in heaven the high school English teacher who had first appreciated her writing.       
         Ruth Handler, creator of the Barbie doll, one of the world's best-selling toys and one that became an icon of American popular culture, an artistic muse and a lightning rod of feminist politics, died on Saturday at a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 85.         Mrs. Handler experienced complications after having colon surgery several months ago, said her husband, Elliot.         In 1959 when she invented Barbie, a busty figure with platinum-blond hair and piercing blue eyes, Mrs. Handler created the country's first mass-marketed adult-looking doll for girls -- and an image that would later be attacked by feminists as a symbol of objectification and repression. Critics said the doll gave girls misguided goals, whether for their careers or for their own physical development.         Mrs. Handler, though, seemed unmoved, her husband said. ''It really didn't bother her,'' he said. ''She thought they were wrong.''         Mrs. Handler named the doll after her daughter. Barbie's male counterpart, Ken, named after Mrs. Handler's son, soon followed. More than one billion Barbies have been sold in 150 countries.         Barbie was a particularly pioneering creation because in 1959 innocent, cherubic baby dolls dominated the toy market. And Barbie's fly-off-the-shelf popularity transformed the sleepy company that sold the doll, Mattel Inc., into a postwar success story.         Mrs. Handler was a founder of Mattel and helped run the company for 30 years, until she and her husband, then co-chairmen, resigned in 1975 amid a scandal.         ''Every little girl needed a doll through which to project herself into her dream of her future,'' Mrs. Handler said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. ''If she was going to do role playing of what she would be like when she was 16 or 17, it was a little stupid to play with a doll that had a flat chest. So I gave it beautiful breasts.''         Barbie was conceived as a teenage fashion model, and her first outfits were named for her various activities, according to M. G. Lord, author of ''Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll.'' Early outfits included ''Friday Night Date'' and ''Sorority Meeting.''         And Barbie kept pace with the times. During Camelot, she sported a Jacqueline Kennedy hairdo. During the civil rights movement, Mattel created Barbie's first black friend, ''Colored Francie.''         But not until the 1970's, as the criticism from feminists materialized, did her career choices -- and her outfits -- begin to change to include a doctor, astronaut and veterinarian, among others.         A chief objection of feminists, including the National Organization for Women, was that Barbie's figure created unrealistic expectations for young girls that could lead to low self-esteem. People often joked that Barbie's measurements were not humanly possible. But in fact it was determined that if the 11 1/2-inch doll were 5-foot-6, her measurements would be 39-21-33. One academic expert calculated that a woman's chances of having Barbie's figure were less than 1 in 100,000.         In her 1994 autobiography, ''Dream Doll: The Ruth Handler Story,'' Mrs. Handler wrote: ''My whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little girl could be anything she wanted to be. Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices.''         In 1978 Mrs. Handler and several other former officers of Mattel were indicted on charges of fraud and false reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. She pleaded no contest to the charges, which investigators said resulted from attempts to influence stock prices, and was fined and sentenced to community service.         Mrs. Handler, though, had already embarked on a second career, starting a company that made prosthetic breasts for cancer survivors. In talking about her two careers, Mrs. Handler was known to say, ''I've lived my life from breast to breast.''         She was found to have breast cancer in 1970 and had her left breast removed. She said it was impossible to find an acceptable replacement breast. ''Until now,'' she said in 1977, ''every breast that was sold was used interchangeably for the right or the left side. There has never been a shoemaker who made one shoe and forced you to put both your right and your left foot in it.''         After developing a line of artificial breasts made of foam and silicon that she called ''Nearly Me,'' she became a well-traveled advocate for early detection of breast cancer, at a time when there was little public discussion of the disease. Mrs. Handler, who once described herself as a ''marketing genius,'' was often known during those years to open her blouse at interviews and ask a reporter or photographer to feel her breasts to determine which was real.         She ran the breast prosthesis company, Ruthton Corporation, for 15 years, fitting women, including Betty Ford, for the artificial breasts herself, before selling it to a division of Kimberly-Clark, her husband said. But she never made much of a profit.         ''She was working on that from the heart,'' Mr. Handler said.         The youngest of 10 children of Polish immigrants, Ruth Mosko was the daughter of a blacksmith who had settled in Denver. She left Denver for Hollywood at 19 and stayed, marrying her high school boyfriend, Mr. Handler, who became a specialist in designing plastic products.         The two, along with a short-term partner, founded Mattel in 1945. Inspired by her daughter's fascination with paper dolls that looked like teenagers or adults and came with multiple outfits and accessories, Mrs. Handler decided to produce a doll that she described as looking more or less like a real teenager.         The doll she created resembled a sex toy called Lilli, which Mrs. Handler had seen on a trip to Germany. After she battled years of prudish resistance to the Barbie concept among the male executives at Mattel, the doll was finally cleared for production. And in 1959, wearing a zebra-striped maillot and tall stiletto heels, Barbie made her debut at the American Toy Fair in New York.         Long After Mrs. Handler left Mattel and turned away from toys, Barbie remained wildly popular, not only as a toy, but as a touchstone of American culture. Barbie, sometimes wearing outfits and hairdos that might send shudders up Mrs. Handler's spine, has been the subject of art exhibitions, an Andy Warhol painting, a television documentary, books and Web sites, including Barbie.com and AdiosBarbie.com, a site dedicated to improving women's body images.         Mrs. Handler's son, Ken, died of a brain tumor in 1994. She is survived by her husband of 63 years; a daughter, Barbara Segal of Los Angeles; a brother, Aaron Mosko of Denver; five grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.       
         Indra Devi, the daughter of European nobility who introduced the ancient discipline of yoga to the Kremlin leadership, Hollywood stars like Gloria Swanson and even students in India, died on Thursday in Buenos Aires. She was 102.         In Buenos Aires, where she had lived for several years, she formed a yoga foundation that was named after her.         Known to her followers as Mataji, which means mother, she was a student of Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, the legendary guru who gained worldwide attention for stopping his heartbeat for two minutes. At a time when yoga was almost an exclusively masculine pursuit, she was his first female student.         Like two of his other students, B.K.S. Ayengar and K. Pattabhi Jois, both men, she took his essential teachings and built a style of yoga accessible to Westerners. It was characterized by gentleness.         ''She herself became a kind of seminal figure,'' said Phil Catalto, a senior editor of Yoga Journal. ''She was an ambassador of yoga.''         She was born Eugenie Peterson in Riga, Latvia, on May 12, 1899. Her father was a Swedish bank director, and her mother was a Russian noblewoman. She attended drama school in Moscow as a girl, and escaped to Berlin with her mother when the Communists came to power in 1917.         In Berlin, she became an actress and dancer. Her fascination with India began at 15, when she read a book by the poet Rabindranath Tagore, then some books on yoga. In 1927, she sailed for India.         Under the stage name Indra Devi, she became a rising star in Indian films. In 1930, she married Jan Strakaty, commercial attachÃ© to the Czechoslovak Consulate in Bombay. Through him, she met the Maharaja and Maharini of Mysore, who maintained a yoga school in their palace where Sri Krishnamacharya taught.         She asked the master for a lesson. He refused, on the grounds that she was a Westerner and a woman. But she persuaded the royal couple to prevail upon the guru, and he reluctantly consented, said Fernando Pages Ruiz, a freelance writer who interviewed her.         Rather than the cursory lessons he had at first intended, Sri Krishnamacharya taught her for a year. When he learned that her husband was to be transferred to China, he trained her to be a yoga teacher.         In Shanghai, she taught what was thought to be the first yoga class in modern China, Mr. Ruiz said. Her husband, she said in a 1996 interview in Yoga Journal, was ''dead set against'' her yoga courses. It was also the time of the Japanese occupation.         For a time she held five classes of 25 students a day in the bedroom of Madame Chiang Kaishek, wife of the nationalist leader and a new yoga enthusiast.         After the war, she returned to India and wrote her first book, believed to be the first book on yoga written by a Westerner to be published in India. She also became known as the first Westerner to teach yoga there.         Her husband, meanwhile, had been ordered back to Czechoslovakia, where he died in 1946.         She returned to Shanghai to recover their belongings and was unsure whether to go to India or the United States. She bought tickets for both destinations and resolved to take whichever ship sailed first. America won.         She found her way to Hollywood, arriving in January 1947. She discovered ready students among movie stars, who found yoga's breathing and relaxation techniques useful to their work. Her students included Miss Swanson, to whom she dedicated one of her 12 books, Robert Ryan, Greta Garbo, Jennifer Jones and the violinist Yehudi Menuhin.         She taught yoga for at Elizabeth Arden's spas in Maine and Arizona, but refused to join the staff.         In 1953, she married Dr. Siegrid Knauer, who preferred preventive medicine to antibiotics. After becoming an American citizen, she legally changed her name to Indra Devi.         Dr. Knauer bought her a 24-room estate in Tecate, Mexico, at which to give training courses for yoga teachers. He died in 1977.         In 1960, India's ambassador to Moscow arranged for her to meet the top Soviet leaders, including Aleksei Kosygin, the premier, Andrei Gromyko, the foreign minister, and Anastas Mikoyan, chairman of the Supreme Soviet. After she spoke to them of the benefits of yoga, it was legalized in Russia.         In 1966, she became captivated by the teachings of the guru Satya Sai Baba. This resulted in a new form of yoga that she called Sai Yoga.         She traveled and taught around the world. In 1982, she visited Argentina, where her popularity snowballed after a single television appearance. She formed a foundation to spread her yoga methods. At the time of her death, it operated six studios.         ''She was like a national treasure,'' Mr. Ruiz said. ''It wasn't just yoga, she was known by the population at large.''         She had no children by either marriage. A woman at her foundation who identified herself only as Anna said that she had an adopted daughter named Rosita.       
         Betty Shapian, a veteran book publicist on the West Coast, died last Monday at a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said her friend and colleague, Tom Brocato.         In an industry that is based almost entirely in New York City, Ms. Shapian's work promoting books in Southern California made her a pioneer.         ''It seems so obvious now, but back in the 70's most New Yorkers who controlled book promotion thought the West Coast was like Antarctica,'' said Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House Inc.         Working for Doubleday and later as an independent publicist, Ms. Shapian organized author tours in the region and promoted new books to the regional and national media. One of her innovations was arranging interviews with major authors in broadcast studios, which saved the expense of travel and allowed dozens of interviews to take place in just a few hours.         Ms. Shapian was born in Ridgefield, N.J., and began her career at Doubleday in New York. She worked in the publicity department there, and one of her first assignments was working with President Dwight D. Eisenhower on his memoirs. She was also an assistant to Nelson Doubleday, the company's president, for eight years.         In 1967 she was sent to run the company's Los Angeles office, then a small regional bureau, and in 1973 she started her own firm, Shapian and Associates.         She worked with scores of writers over the years but forged particularly close bonds with Erma Bombeck, Ray Bradbury and Robert B. Parker, who like many major writers would insist on working with Ms. Shapian.         She is survived by her companion, Drew Bond of Los Angeles; and three sisters, Pearl and Rose Shapian of Ridgefield and Victoria Leggio of Cliffside Park, N.J.       
         Nancy White, the white-gloved editor of Harper's Bazaar during the 1960's, when it captured the spirit of the decade with evocative photographs of models in bikinis, boots and big watches, not to mention spacesuits, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Miss White edited Harper's from 1958 to 1971, at a time when there were only two major women's fashion magazines in America. The other, Vogue, was headed by Diana Vreeland, a far more visible personality.         Her magazine reflected the cultural upheavals of the 1960's, as did she, up to a point: through her three marriages, she insisted on being called Miss White, reflecting the stylishly independent image she strove to project.         ''There were not a lot of female businesspeople then,'' said Katharine Delahaye Paine, her daughter. ''She felt it was important to create the right image.''         When she assumed the top editorial job at Harper's Bazaar in 1958, Miss White jotted down the words she hoped would describe her magazine. As given in the book ''Harper's Bazaar: 100 Years of the American Female'' (Random House, 1967), they were: ''authority, awareness, wit, spirit, surprise, curiosity, intelligence, timing, food for thought, vitality, balance and youth.''         She emphasized photographs -- many by Richard Avedon and Hiro -- that told the story of a new era. They varied from a model posed in front of a missile at Cape Canaveral, to an ethereal picture of a woman in a gown floating in a glass ball, to a model in a shimmering body stocking. Suzy Parker posed in one of the first fashion layouts featuring the bikini.         ''She was one of the grandes dames of her era,'' the designer John Weitz said yesterday. ''She brought taste, charm and a sense of proportion to the game.''         Nancy White was born in Brooklyn on July 25, 1916. Her father was in publishing and became general manager of Hearst magazines.         She attended the Madeira School in Greenway, Va., where she and Katharine Graham, who was to become publisher of The Washington Post, became lifelong friends.         She left Madeira to work during the Depression, her daughter said. At 15, she worked as an errand girl with a magazine, according to an interview with her in The New York Mirror in 1957. (She did not name the magazine.)         She returned to the boarding school, and after graduation became an editorial assistant, or ''glorified errand girl,'' in her words, with the magazine Pictorial Review. Her next job, which lasted 16 years, was with Good Housekeeping magazine, where she started as an assistant in the fashion department and left as fashion editor.         She joined Harper's as an assistant editor in 1957 and was appointed editor at the beginning of 1958. She was chosen by the previous editor, Carmel Snow, who happened to be her aunt. Diana Vreeland had been another candidate for the top job; she promptly quit. In 1962, Mrs. Vreeland joined Vogue, becoming a legend in the fashion world, and not incidentally Miss White's principal competitor.         Under Miss White, Harper's was aimed at stylish women in Des Moines and Omaha as well as in New York and San Francisco. In one issue, 14 pages by Hiro showed models' bodies seeming to disintegrate beneath colorful prints. Yet in the same issue, there was page after black-and-white page of elegantly understated suits and coats.         Her comments on pantsuits in a 1964 interview in The New York Times reflected the balance she sought between modernity and moderation. Although she would not wear one to the office herself, she said, pantsuits would be all right for her staff members if they wore ''perfect accessories.''         Miss White resigned in 1971 after James W. Brady, formerly publisher of Women's Wear Daily, was appointed publisher and editorial director of Harper's. Mr. Brady said it was Hearst's decision for him to modernize the magazine.         ''In all candor, I don't think Nancy White was as significant as Vreeland,'' said Mr. Brady, the author and columnist, who succeeded Miss White as editor of Harper's. ''She always seemed to be wearing white gloves with her hat firmly in place.''         After her resignation, Miss White advised Bergdorf Goodman on fashion for two years and devoted much of the rest of her life to charities, including Lighthouse for the Blind and the public television station WNET.         She was first married to Clarence Dauphinot, founder of Deltec International, then to Ralph D. Paine Jr., publisher of Fortune magazine, and then George K. Thompson, her high school sweetheart. The first two marriages ended in divorce, and Mr. Thompson died in 1996.         She is survived by two daughters, Ms. Paine of Durham, N.H., and Gillette Piper of Coral Gables, Fla.; a stepdaughter, Mimi Thompson of Manhattan; a sister, Carmel Eitt of King George, Va.; a brother, John Michael White of Delray Beach, Fla.; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         In an interview with The New York Times Magazine in 1972, Miss White said she did not own a little black dress. But she had a color scheme for each of her four homes.         ''In Manhattan, I'm sort of white and beige,'' she said. ''In Connecticut, I'm yellow and orange and bright green. In New Hampshire, I'm red and white and navy. In Vermont, I'm beige and red.''       
         Shirley Hayes, who waged a long battle -- called quixotic by some, psychotic by others -- that eventually succeeded in banning cars from Washington Square Park in Manhattan, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 89.         She marshaled children in strollers, including her own four sons, to press the case that Greenwich Village's only significant park had no business being a bus turnaround, much less being cut in half by a four-lane road.         She collected 16,000 signatures and the endorsements of politicians, newspapers, 12 parent-teacher associations and the Lions Club. When others sought some middle ground, say a smaller road, Mrs. Hayes spurned deal making.         ''When Shirley refused to compromise, I told her she was turning into a crackpot,'' said Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York, in an interview with McCall's magazine in 1967. At the time he was a lawyer living in the Village.         ''I thought it was unreasonable to expect the city to cut a major artery and detour traffic through narrow streets,'' Mr. Koch said, ''but she proved her goal was not unrealistic.''         The long-running drama included some legendary New Yorkers: Robert Moses, the powerful official who demanded the biggest road possible, was her arch enemy. Eleanor Roosevelt, the former first lady who had once lived on Washington Square, was her illustrious supporter. Carmine DeSapio, the leader of Tammany Hall, was the Ã©minence grise who at the final moment gave the quiet nod to her position.         ''This was where the tide turned against the indiscriminate taking of parkland for automotive purposes,'' said Henry J. Stern, the former city parks commissioner, who last year put up a sign in Washington Square honoring the event.         Mrs. Hayes was born Shirley Zak on June 15, 1912, in Chicago. She attended the University of Wisconsin and studied painting at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and acting at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She moved to New York in 1932 to pursue a career in acting. In 1936, she appeared in Leslie Howard's ''Hamlet,'' which was making Broadway history by competing with Sir John Gielgud's ''Hamlet.'' She played a lady in waiting and met her husband, James, during the production; he played a pallbearer.         They had four sons: Christopher, who lives in Manhattan and Los Angeles, and his twin, Kerry, who lives in Toronto, Timothy, of Manhattan and East Hampton, and Dennis, of Rio de Janeiro and Manhattan. In addition to her sons, she is survived by four grandchildren.         Mrs. Hayes, who was often busy entertaining clients for her husband, who had gone into advertising, also became involved in other neighborhood causes, like fighting the large apartment houses that Robert Moses eventually built south of Washington Square. Because she frequently took her sons to Washington Square Park, she leapt into the fight in 1952, when Mr. Moses proposed building a 48-foot roadway through it. The road -- which would have linked Fifth Avenue on the north side of the park to West Broadway on the south -- would have wiped out some playgrounds. ''A few women got together to say no, no, no,'' Mrs. Hayes said in an interview with The Villager, a neighborhood paper, last fall.         The debate took many turns; one big struggle was over what to do with the buses that already used the park as a turnaround. Eventually politicians came up with the idea of using a smaller road as a compromise. The original proposal for a below-the-ground road was changed to ground level. But Mrs. Hayes had decided she would accept nothing less than no road through the park, and no vehicles of any kind in it, including the buses.         ''She took the extreme position,'' said Anthony Dapolito, owner of Vesuvio Bakery and long a leader in Greenwich Village politics. ''She and the mothers kept insisting and wouldn't give up.''         On April 9, 1959, the city's Board of Estimate, the body that then governed the city's spending and land use, voted to oust cars entirely, shortly after Mr. DeSapio, always attuned to opinion in the Village, had passed the word that he wanted them out.         In her 1961 book, ''The Life and Death of Great American Cities,'' Jane Jacobs noted the courage of the position taken by Mrs. Hayes and her allies: ''They advocated eliminating the existing road, that is, closing the park to all automobile traffic -- but at the same time, not widening the perimeter roads either. In short, they proposed closing off a roadbed without compensating for it.''         Ms. Jacobs wrote that traffic did not become unmanageable, and that more of the low-scale profile of Greenwich Village was preserved. Others suggested that the defeat of the road represented the first nail in the coffin of Mr. Moses's plan for a Lower Manhattan expressway. The park road would have fed into the Moses freeway, which he planned to link the bridges and tunnels to Brooklyn and New Jersey.         Mrs. Hayes was divorced in 1965 and went to work as a classical radio disc jockey on WNYC's ''While the City Sleeps'' and other programs. She also worked with Mayor John V. Lindsay, for whom she campaigned, on making the city friendlier to movie companies. She was a charter member of the National Organization for Women.         Correction:  May 15, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary on Saturday about Shirley Hayes, who successfully fought a road through Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, reversed two words in the title of a book by the urban planning critic Jane Jacobs, which praised her. It is ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' not ''Life and Death.''       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early Sunday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for the dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote of the events in Warsaw. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism there and all over the European Continent.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink and outsmoke it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published and syndicated by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and later became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent as well.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Affairs. She was also given honorary doctorates by the University of California at Los Angeles, Columbia, Princeton, Mount Holyoke, Bucknell, Muhlenberg and Manhattan Marymount.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles. She earned a bachelor of arts degree three years later, in 1941, graduating summa cum laude and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board of directors, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancÃ©e jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a 1992 book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead, Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union. ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, ''It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         June Jordan, who came of age as a poet when the voices of black female writers were just beginning to be heard, died on June 14 at her home in Berkeley, Calif.         She was 65. The cause was breast cancer, which she fought for a decade, said Adrienne Torff, a friend.         Like the careers of Audre Lord and Alice Walker, Ms. Jordan's was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. Her poetry was imbued with advocacy for the poor, for women and the disenfranchised.         In an interview yesterday, Ms. Walker, a close friend, called the small, elegant but tough Ms. Jordan, ''unwillingly nonviolent.'' In ''Poem About Police Violence,'' she wrote about the so-called accidental death of a black man in police custody: ''Tell me something/ what you think would happen if/ everytime they kill a black boy/ then we kill a cop/ everytime they kill a black man/ then we kill a cop/ you think the accident rate would lower/ subsequently?''         Still, Ms. Jordan could be a poet of great delicacy, as in ''On a New Year's Eve,'' in which she describes watching a lover sleep: ''and/ as I watch your arm/ your/ brown arm/ just/ before it moves/ I know/ all things are dear/ that disappear/ all things are dear/ that disappear.''         She was the author or editor of 28 books, essays and novels for children and the libretto for the 1995 opera by John Adams ''I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.''         She was also a teacher. At the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a professor of African-American Studies, she founded Poetry for the People, which trains undergraduates to take poetry to community groups as a form of political empowerment.         Ms. Jordan was born in Harlem, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Granville Ivanhoe Jordan, a postal clerk, and Mildred, a nurse. Ms. Jordan's mother was deeply depressed and eventually committed suicide.         Her father had wanted a boy and referred to her as ''he.'' In ''Soldier: A Poet's Childhood'' (Basic Civitas Books, 1999) she described being brutally beaten by him: ''Like a growling beast, the roll-away mahogany doors rumble open, and the light snaps on and a fist smashes into the side of my head and I am screaming awake: 'Daddy! What did I do?!' '' Yet her father helped forge her identity as a writer, she said, giving her books by Paul Lawrence Dunbar and forcing her to memorize Shakespeare.         In a radio interview two years ago, Ms. Jordan appeared to have come to terms with her father. She said: ''He didn't know what to do to try to provide against the failure of his only child in this new land. I think that probably contributed to the violence of his frustration. But that he loved me and thought me capable of anything and everything there was never any doubt.''         After the family moved to Brooklyn, Ms. Jordan became the only black student at Midwood High School. Later, she won a scholarship to the Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts, now the coeducational Northfield-Mount Hermon School.         After Northfield she attended Barnard College in New York City where she met Michael Meyer, a white student. The couple married and had a son, Christopher, who lives in Montana.         In her book of essays, ''Civil Wars'' (Scribner's, 1996), Ms. Jordan wrote of the difficulties of an interracial marriage. In 1966 the couple divorced. She raised her son largely on her own, struggling to eke out a living as a freelance journalist. She was a researcher and writer for Mobilization for Youth in New York, and in 1967 she got a teaching job at City College. Two years later she published a children's book, ''Who Look at Me?''         To the end, she remained involved in politics. In September Basic Civitas books is scheduled to publish ''Some of Us Did Not Die,'' which contains essays on Israel, Islam and O. J. Simpson. The book's title is from a poem she read last year in a speech at Barnard. She spoke of her battle with breast cancer and about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which she said proved the need for a secular democracy that protects the rights of ''male/ female/Jew/ Gentile/ Muslim.''         She read from a poem in which she imagined her dying body and a predatory hawk gliding overhead: ''He makes that dive/ to savage/ me/ and inches/ from the blood flood lusty/ beak/ I roll away/ I speak/ I laugh out loud/ Not yet/ big bird of prey/ not yet.''         Correction:  June 20, 2002, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about the poet June Jordan misspelled the middle name of an author whose books she credited with having helped forge her identity as a writer. He was Paul Laurence Dunbar, not Lawrence.         Correction:  June 27, 2002, Thursday  An obituary of the poet June Jordan on June 18 misspelled the surname of a poet whose career, like Ms. Jordan's, was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. She was Audre Lorde, not Lord.       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''         She advised millions of readers on problems ranging from acne to alcoholism to AIDS, often in spirited competition with her identical twin sister, who wrote the advice column Dear Abby.         At the time of Mrs. Lederer's death, her column was carried in more than 1,200 newspapers around the world, with a readership of 90 million, according to Creators Syndicate, her distributor. A 1978 World Almanac survey named her the most influential woman in the United States.         ''I would rather have my column on a thousand refrigerator doors than win a Pulitzer,'' she once said.         A petite, elegant woman who favored high heels and silk, Mrs. Lederer had delicate features and a voice of pure ground glass.         An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail. The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers. Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancÃ©'s father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.         But even then, Mrs. Lederer discussed more controversial issues. During her first year she responded to a letter about homosexuality, taboo advice-column fare in the 1950's. The paper in St. Joseph, Mich., refused to print the column; the publisher told her he planned to run an announcement on Page 1 that the column would not be appearing that day because the subject matter was unfit for a family newspaper.         ''I called the publisher up and said, 'This is a human problem, and that is what I do,' '' she told The New Yorker in a 1995 interview. The publisher held firm.         ''I said: 'Fine. Then everyone in St. Joe is going to buy The Detroit Free Press to see what you won't print.' I called The Free Press and told them to get ready for a lot of extra sales.         ''From then on, boy,'' she added, ''that St. Joe paper printed every damn word I wrote.''         Early in her newfound career, Mrs. Lederer often phoned her twin sister, Pauline Phillips, for help with her replies. Mrs. Phillips, who lived in California, proved so good at coming up with pithy one-liners that within a few months she began writing her own advice column in The San Francisco Chronicle under the name Abigail Van Buren. As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m.         She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of goodwill to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         Fans and Powerful Enemies         After the column on her divorce, she received more than 35,000 letters of encouragement from readers, had the linings removed from her fur coats, and kept on going.         ''A divorce,'' she once said, ''is nothing compared with the problems I see in my everyday mail.''         Although those problems would progress from Saturday-night dating woes to late-20th-century ills like domestic violence and crack, Mrs. Lederer was sometimes astonished to discover the everyday things that could inflame the passions of her readers.         She once threw her column open to a discussion of whether toilet paper should be hung with the free end coming over or under the roll; 15,000 letters later, Mrs. Lederer (herself in the ''under'' camp) had to call a moratorium on further debate.         Occasionally Mrs. Lederer's work was the source of public embarrassment. In 1982, she admitted to having recycled 15-year-old letters for use in a number of current columns. In 1993 she was discovered to have embellished a letter about fraudulent charities by adding condemnatory remarks of her own.         And a 1995 interview with The New Yorker in which she called Pope John Paul II ''a Polack'' drew widespread criticism.         She apologized for the incidents in print, resolving to do her customary penance, ''40 lashes with a wet noodle.''         And while her column made Mrs. Lederer powerful friends, from prominent educators and executives to presidents, it also brought her bitter enemies.         Among her detractors were the National Rifle Association, which opposed her advocacy of gun control; groups opposing abortion, which deplored her abortion-rights position; and animal-rights organizations, angered by her support for the use of animals in medical research.         ''Those three groups really despise me, and I'm very proud of it,'' she said in 1993.         All in all, she said, being Ann Landers proved far more involving -- and more gratifying -- than she could ever have anticipated when she brought home her first stack of letters in 1955.         ''I cannot imagine a career that could be more rewarding,'' Mrs. Lederer said in a 1990 interview. ''There is enormous satisfaction in knowing that I've been able to touch the lives of millions of people. Where does anybody get a job like this?''         Mrs. Lederer, who owned the rights to the Ann Landers name, often said she did not expect anyone to replace her after her death. There would be no newspaper contest, no tales of disputed walnuts. ''There will never be another Ann Landers,'' she told The New Yorker. ''When I go, the column goes with me.''       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''         She advised millions of readers on problems as varied as acne, alcoholism and AIDS, often in spirited competition with her identical twin sister, who wrote the advice column Dear Abby.         At the time of Mrs. Lederer's death, her column was carried in more than 1,200 newspapers around the world, with a readership of 90 million, according to Creators Syndicate, her distributor. A 1978 World Almanac survey named her the most influential woman in the United States.         ''I would rather have my column on a thousand refrigerator doors than win a Pulitzer,'' she once said.         A petite, elegant woman who favored high heels and silk, Mrs. Lederer had delicate features and a voice of pure ground glass.         An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail.         The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers.         Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancÃ©'s father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.

         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early yesterday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for her dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy, in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism all over Europe.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and also became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Affairs.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles, where she earned a bachelor of arts summa cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancÃ©e jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House, 1992).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union.         ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, 'It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died last night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel TormÃ© seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike.         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and concert stages singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. ''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano,'' and ''This Old House.'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window,'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.         She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy, which she witnessed first hand; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family.         And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         In 1946, Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys all around the country speculated was was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947, she was gaining notice. In 1948, Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band, but Rosemary stayed with him another year before she left as well, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs For Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it but He insisted. The recording became a runaway best seller and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano'' that also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She married Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and made more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         But in the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle, and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This For Remembrance.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968, she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, She was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         In the 1990's, she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her children: the actor Miguel Ferrer; Maria, a designer; Gabriel, a painter married to Debby Boone; Monsita Teresa; Rafael, a voice-over actor, and her husband, Dante DiPaolo, a dancer. Other survivors include a nephew, George Clooney, the actor.       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died Saturday night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel TormÃ© seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike. In the words of the director Mike Nichols, ''She sings like Spencer Tracy acts.''         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and on concert stages, largely with small groups, singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. Rather than acting out the romantic dramas of well-known song lyrics, she projects an understanding that is almost maternal in its blend of wisdom and empathy.''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' which became a huge hit record, and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano'' and ''This Old House,'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear long after she was pursuing a less-flamboyant repertory.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page, never to Rosemary Clooney. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said about her earlier recording career.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded pensive ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.

And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         She was nominated for an Emmy award for an appearance on ''E.R.,'' the series that featured her nephew George Clooney, and this year she was given a lifetime achievement Grammy award a month after she was hospitalized for lung cancer surgery.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness. One of the Clooney children, Andy, drowned as a boy swimming in the Ohio River. But the others survived and remained close. They included Betty, who sang professionally for a while with Rosemary; and Nick, who became a television performer. Another sibling, Gail, did not venture into show business.         When Rosemary was 10 and in the fourth grade, she made her acting debut in a school production of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' in which she played the witch. That same year her paternal grandmother died, sending her father into an intensified period of drinking. Rosemary and her siblings were sent to live with her mother's family, the Guilfoyles. After Rosemary completed the sixth grade her grandmother took her to Ironton, Ohio, east of Maysville. Two years later, they moved to Cincinnati.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them, and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         Grandmother Guilfoyle , who sewed as well as she could cook, made them dresses, and one of their uncles, George Guilfoyle, accompanied them on the band bus to make certain that they were not led astray by any of Mr. Pastor's musicians.         In 1946 Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys speculated was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947 she was gaining notice. Downbeat magazine said she had ''an extraordinarily good voice, perhaps the nearest thing to Ella Fitzgerald we've ever heard.'' In 1948 Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band. Rosemary stayed another year before she left, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording, no matter how many copies it sold.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs for Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television, including the Ed Sullivan show.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' The song was based on something old and Armenian, updated by the novelist William Saroyan and Ross Bagdasarian, who later changed his name to David Seville and created the Chipmunks. From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it, but he insisted, hinting broadly that if she refused, her career at Columbia might come to an end. The recording became a runaway best seller, and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano,'' which also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton,'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.

Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She fell in love with Dante DiPaolo, a dancer at Paramount studios, but jilted him to marry Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and to make more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         In the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle that went nowhere (he was married and the father of six children) and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic, and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This for Remembrance.'' ''The records I did then sound like they were made underwater. I misbehaved with everyone, onstage and off.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968 she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles by Sirhan Sirhan. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles.

She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         Unexpectedly she ran into Mr. DiPaolo, who moved in with her and became her road manager, and in 1996 she married him in the church in Maysville where she had been baptized.         In the 1990's she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label, and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her husband, Mr. DiPaolo; three sons, the actor Miguel Ferrer; Gabriel Ferrer, a painter and Episcopal priest married to Debby Boone; and the voice-over actor Rafael Ferrer; two daughters, Maria Murdoch, a designer; and Monsita Teresa Botwick; 10 grandchildren, her brother, Nick Clooney, and her sister, Gail Clooney Darley.         When she was in her 60's, Ms. Clooney said, ''If you hang around long enough, you get a lot of good stuff.'' Most of the time, she added, her life was pretty good.       
         Lorna J. Marshall, a college English instructor turned homemaker who in her 50's began a new life as an anthropologist studying the Bushmen of Africa, died on July 8 at her home in Peterborough, N.H. She was 103.         She had lived with her daughter, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, since 1996, Ms. Thomas said. She previously lived in the same house in Cambridge, Mass., since the late 1920's.         Mrs. Marshall's anthropological career began when her husband, Laurence K. Marshall, a founder and president of the Raytheon Corporation, retired in 1950 with the thought that it was time to get reacquainted with his family.         ''Where is the remotest place we can go and be a family again?'' Mr. Marshall asked, said Irven DeVore, the More research professor of anthropology at Harvard.         The Kalahari Desert was the answer he found. He decided he would take his family to live among the legendary Bushmen.         ''They became a sort of Swiss Family Robinson of the Kalahari,'' Dr. DeVore said.         The family's accomplishments made it more than that. Mr. Marshall helped the Bushmen start a fine-wool industry. The Marshalls' son, John, began his career as a leading maker of ethnographic documentary films. Ms. Thomas, who would go on to write best sellers like ''The Hidden Life of Dogs,'' wrote a well-received book on the Bushmen, ''The Harmless People'' (Knopf, 1958).         Meanwhile, Mrs. Marshall began the painstaking process of documenting the culture and behavior of the Bushmen, sometimes called !Kung. (The ''!'' represents a clicking sound in their language). She was the first of dozens of scholars who have made the Bushmen one of the world's most studied populations of traditional hunter-gatherers.         ''To say she started it is not a mistake,'' Dr. DeVore said. ''By standards of ethnography, she did as well or better than any monograph I know, and she was there early.''         Over the next two decades, the Marshall family made eight trips to the Kalahari, a desert the size of Spain in what is now Namibia, Botswana and the Republic of South Africa, staying for as long as a year and a half at a time. Then the family would return to Cambridge, where Mrs. Marshall would employ the best graduate students to organize her voluminous notes, which resulted in two books and many articles.         An honor she particularly valued was having a !Kung baby girl named after her. The child was called Norna, because the Bushmen, for all their ability to make unusual vocal sounds, cannot pronounce the letter L.         Lorna Jean McLean was born in Morenci, a mining town in the Arizona Territory, on Sept. 14, 1898. Her father, Gordon McLean, a mining engineer, died when she was 7. Her mother, the former Bessie Holmes, remarried and moved with her daughter to Riverside, Calif., and then Los Angeles.         Miss McLean graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in English. She then gave up the beginning of a career in ballet to travel around the world with her mother, who had been widowed again. They traveled throughout the Middle East and Asia. In China, they met an instructor at Mount Holyoke College who offered Miss McLean a job teaching English.         She accepted, but soon met Mr. Marshall in Nova Scotia, where both had relatives. They married and moved to Cambridge.         At the Cambridge Community Center, she organized women to salvage tungsten wire from radio tubes that Raytheon could re-use in making electronic devices. The salvage operation employed black and white women, unusual at the time, and permitted women to work flexible hours, which was also unusual.         Mr. Marshall said he wanted to do something with his family when he retired, and its members were interested in anthropology. So he asked his wife to take some courses at Harvard, which she did from time to time among trips to Africa.         The family was at first apprehensive about tales of poison darts and trance dances, but found the Bushmen polite and kind. The Marshall family lived in tents, even as temperatures ranged from freezing to 125 degrees.         Mrs. Marshall published her first book, ''!Kung of Nyae Nyae,'' in 1975 (Harvard University Press), and her second, ''Nyae Nyae !Kung Belief and Rites,'' three years ago (Peabody Museum Press).         She is survived by her daughter, her son, who lives in Belmont, Mass., three grandchildren and three great-granddaughters.         She is remembered by others. A year or so after her 100th birthday party, the child of a Bushman she had known as a child came to visit her.       
         Emily Genauer, an art critic who championed 20th-century painting and sculpture over the course of a four-decade newspaper career and won a Pulitzer Prize for criticism, died on Friday after a long illness. She was 91.         Starting out as the critic for The New York World in the 1930's, Ms. Genauer made it her mission to introduce modern artists like Marc Chagall and Diego Rivera to a newspaper audience. She also staunchly defended art's independence from politics. In 1949, she left The New York World-Telegram after an argument with its owner, Roy W. Howard, who thought she was paying too much attention to artists he considered ''Communists and left-wingers,'' like Pablo Picasso.         Ms. Genauer's columns for The New York Herald Tribune, where she was chief art critic from 1949 to 1966, were also watched closely by artists. In 1992 she recalled how the painter Clyfford Still, about whom she had written unfavorably, sent her a pair of rubber baby pants with a card. The card read: ''Hoping this will aid in concealing your Sunday affliction. With the compliments of Clyfford Still.''         She tried to promote lesser-known artists. While visiting the East Side town house of John Hay Whitney, the owner of The Herald Tribune, she urged him to purchase more 20th-century art. She took him to a communal studio-gallery of avant-garde artists on the Bowery, directly opposite that neighborhood's leading flophouse. After getting out of his limousine and hesitantly stepping around some drunks, he bought a number of paintings.         The author of numerous books, Ms. Genauer was also a member of the National Council on the Humanities from 1966 to 1970.         Emily Genauer was born July 19, 1911, in Staten Island, where her father owned several delicatessens and was an amateur sculptor. She attended Hunter College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and began writing for The New York World in 1929. She always retained her maiden name as a byline, though after marrying Frederick Gash she took his last name in her private life.         The World paid her by the word, allowing her to make as much as $92 per week, she recalled in 1992. Then she got a call from an editor who told her she was to be paid a salary. ''Aren't you happy?'' the editor asked. ''You're now on staff. Your fee will be $35 a week.''         After The World went out of business and was merged with The New York Telegram, she continued to write for the paper until 1949. That year, United States Representative George A. Dondero issued a warning about Communist sympathies seeping into American life, and mentioned art criticism as a danger zone, citing Ms. Genauer by name, she recalled in a 1992 speech.         ''My brother telephoned me afterwards and said, 'When did you go Communist?' '' she said.         Mr. Howard, her editor, told her she could no longer write about Picasso. She promptly announced her resignation, and then used Mr. Howard's phone to call the editor of The Herald Tribune, who promptly offered her the job as art critic.         In 1966, The Herald Tribune merged with two other newspapers to become The New York World Journal Tribune, and she became its art critic until its demise in 1967. She then wrote a weekly column for the Newsday Syndicate until the mid-1970's. In 1974 she won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished art criticism.         Ms. Genauer is survived by a sister, Blanche Wahl of Baltimore; a daughter, Constance Gash Roche, of New York City; and two grandchildren.         ''I could do it for 60 years because I'd rather look at art than anything else,'' Ms. Genauer said of art criticism in 1992, ''because I love the art world and because every day was different than every other.''

After The World went out of business and was merged with The New York Telegram, she continued to write for the paper until 1949. That year, United States Representative George A. Dondero issued a warning about Communist sympathies seeping into American life and mentioned art criticism as a danger zone, citing Ms. Genauer by name, she recalled in a 1992 speech.         ''My brother telephoned me afterwards and said, 'When did you go Communist?' '' she said.         Mr. Howard, her editor, told her she could no longer write about Picasso. She promptly announced her resignation, and then used Mr. Howard's phone to call the editor of The Herald Tribune, who promptly offered her the job as art critic.         In 1966, The Herald Tribune merged with two other newspapers to become The New York World Journal Tribune, and she became its art critic until its demise in 1967. She then wrote a weekly column for the Newsday Syndicate until the mid-1970's. In 1974 she won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished art criticism.         Ms. Genauer is survived by a sister, Blanche Wahl of Baltimore; a daughter, Constance Gash Roche, of New York; and two grandchildren.         ''I could do it for 60 years because I'd rather look at art than anything else,'' Ms. Genauer said of art criticism in 1992, ''because I love the art world and because every day was different than every other.''       
         Daphne Bayne Hellman, the jazz harpist who performed around the world and for three decades at the Village Gate but who had a special affection for playing on subway platforms, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Manhattan. She was 86.         Ms. Hellman, who had played on the streets of Paris at a music fair as recently as June, was recuperating from injuries suffered in a fall last month near her town house on East 61st Street, her family said.         In a wildly peripatetic musical career that began in the 1940's at Town Hall -- where Time magazine called her ''as curvesome as a treble clef'' -- her professional choices were generally as eccentric as those she made in the rest of her life.         She saw nothing particularly unusual, she said, about plucking her harp on the street in front of the Hotel Pierre, where she came out to society in 1933, at a supper dance in the roof garden.         She did not seem to care what people thought when, after years of playing well-to-do places for well-to-do crowds, she also took the stage at clubs like CBGB, on the Bowery, accompanied by the kitchen-drawer percussion of a man called Mr. Spoons, otherwise known as Joseph Jones Jr., whom Ms. Hellman put up in her town house after his third wife left him.         She played the Beatles or Roger Miller or bluegrass warhorses like ''Foggy Mountain Breakdown'' with as much appreciation as she played Bach and Debussy, Gershwin and Kern.         Although she was an heiress with substantial means -- ''My mother had mucho money,'' she said in one interview -- she liked to count the money she earned when she began playing in the subway in the 1980's, sometimes carrying coins to a delicatessen near her house to trade them for bills.         ''She was just the antisnob, that's what she was,'' said Art D'Lugoff, who owned the Village Gate, where Ms. Hellman and her trio, Hellman's Angels, played every Tuesday for 30 years when she was in town. It was one of the longest nightclub runs in the city's history.         ''She had money and she knew a lot of people and she got along with everybody,'' said Mr. D'Lugoff, whose club closed in 1994. ''She opened up a new world for me, and I opened up a world for her.''         Ms. Hellman was sometimes compared to Katharine Hepburn, not only because of her high cheekbones and patrician good looks, but also because she lived a life of elegant rebellion, even before she first touched a harp at the age of 12.         Born Daphne Van Beuren Bayne, the granddaughter of the founder of the Seaboard National Bank, she recalled in a 1990 profile in The New Yorker that as a child she liked to keep bats and armadillos as pets. ''They are much maligned and misunderstood,'' she said of bats.         As a young woman, she first tried acting, training in New York and London and landing a walk-on part in a Broadway production of ''Hamlet.'' She also modeled for Man Ray and Harper's Bazaar. But after her marriage to her first husband, Harry Bull, the editor of Town & Country magazine, and the birth of their son, Sandy, she began to take the harp more seriously.         Over the strong objections of her father, she had her jazz debut at a cabaret called Le Ruban Bleu, at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue. Over the next few years, she played at a string of clubs that sound like a roll call from another musical era: the Hotel New Yorker, with Ving Merlin and his All-Girl Band; Upstairs at the Downstairs, with Blossom Dearie and Imogene Coca; Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe; the Versailles; Le Perroquet.         Once, at Le Ruban Bleu, according to the New Yorker profile, a young Billie Holiday, quite drunk, angrily refused to share the club's only dressing room with Ms. Hellman, who played there twice a year.         But most of Ms. Hellman's relationships with famous people were much more congenial and enduring. Her cluttered East Side town house, usually full of boarders, birds, dogs and litters of gerbils, served as the base for a kind of floating salon. And she was its musical Zelig, whose close friends included, besides Mr. Spoons, the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the artist Saul Steinberg and the writer Norman Mailer.         In the 1940's, she had briefly supplied a beautiful face and high-society name to gossip columns when her marriage to Mr. Bull fell apart and she had an affair with Geoffrey T. Hellman, a writer for The New Yorker. She married him in Reno in 1941, hours after her divorce from Mr. Bull. (Her son, Sandy Bull, a noted guitarist, died last year; she is survived by a daughter, Daisy Paradis, and a son, Digger St. John.)         Mr. Hellman left her for another woman, and in 1961, she married Hsio-Wen Shih, a Chinese-American architect and writer, who left their home one day in 1965 and disappeared, breaking her heart, friends said.         ''It was like he went out for a pack of cigarettes and just didn't come back,'' said Lyn Christie, the bassist in Ms. Hellman's trio, who played with her for decades, everywhere from the subway to Sri Lanka, Madagascar, Bombay and Hong Kong.         ''It felt sort of like the trips we made to China were an attempt to try to find out about him,'' Mr. Christie said. ''But we never did come across him.''         Ms. Hellman's daughter, Daisy Paradis, said that her mother, who sometimes smoked a pack of Salems a day, had slowed down only slightly over the last few years. She had not played the subway for quite a while, mostly because it had become harder to find someone to help her lug her 85-pound harp down to the platform. But she played in Hong Kong and Sri Lanka this year and was appearing at the Firebird Cafe in Midtown at the time of her fall.         ''She was an incredibly intrepid woman,'' said Mr. Christie, who recalled that in Hong Kong she tried to ride on horseback into Communist China. ''She loved to do whatever she knew you weren't supposed to do.''       
         Diane J. Lipton, who fought for the rights of her disabled daughter and went on to become a lawyer and prominent advocate for children with disabilities, died on Aug. 8 at her home in Richmond, Calif. She was 57.         The cause was a rare form of lung cancer, her husband, James Armstrong, said.         Her daughter Chloe had cerebral palsy and developmental delays. In 1979, when Chloe was 7, the Richmond Unified School District reduced her occupational training sessions to one a week from three. Ms. Lipton and other parents demanded that the school district restore the sessions and change its complaint procedures.         By the time the battle ended in 1987, Ms. Lipton had won what she and other advocates considered a major civil rights battle. The district had closed its four schools for pupils with disabilities and integrated them into regular schools.         Her winning tactic had been persuading federal officials in Washington to temporarily cut off money for the education of disabled children in all California schools until the Richmond situation was remedied.         The result was a new state policy to end the segregation of disabled children. Ms. Lipton took the issue a step further in 1990 when she and other advocates for the disabled took the Sacramento school district to court to demand the mixing of disabled children into regular classrooms.         In 1994, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco decided the case in Ms. Lipton's favor and defined standards for judging whether school districts were complying with the 1975 federal law requiring that disabled students be educated to the maximum extent possible and with other children as much as possible.         Diane Julie Zelman was born on June 13, 1945, in Forest Hills, Queens, where she grew up. She graduated from the University of California with an English major and experience in many campus demonstrations. She married Lennie Lipton, a campus activist and co-writer of the song ''Puff the Magic Dragon.''         In 1972, Chloe was born, the only one of triplets to survive. Ms. Lipton became friendly with parents of other disabled children, and Chloe at 3 began to attend a school for orthopedically handicapped children. In 1974, Ms. Lipton began a master's-degree course in rehabilitation counseling at San Francisco State University, graduating in 1976.         She divorced around 1979. Within two years, she had become a parent advocate with the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund and was organizing a statewide campaign to integrate the Richmond schools, traveling to Washington to press for the cutoff in money. At night, she earned a law degree at Golden Gate University.         In 1980, she married Mr. Armstrong, whom she had met at a union meeting for rehabilitation workers.         Her passion in the initial battle was fueled by a chain-link fence that separated Chloe's special education school from what was considered a conventional school. The only time the students were allowed to mingle was on Halloween, when they were in costume. Ms. Lipton thought this indicated that school officials regarded disabled students as freaks, Arlene Mayerson, a lawyer for the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, said.         Ms. Lipton is survived by her husband; Chloe, who, with some help, lives on her own in Emeryville, Calif.; and a daughter from her second marriage, Daria Armstrong.       
         Doris Wishman, a prolific independent director of truly tasteless movies -- from nudist camp romps to the cult classic ''Bad Girls Go to Hell'' -- died on Aug. 10 in Miami. She lived in Coral Gables, Fla.         She never revealed her age, but her passport carried a date of birth of April 23, 1920, making her 82, said Michael Bowen, who is writing her biography. He said family members believe she was around 90.         Miss Wishman has been called the female Ed Wood, the legendary director of ''B'' movies. She wrote, produced, cast, directed and edited around 30 films, including several she made under pseudonyms. She rarely spent more than $70,000 on a picture, usually beginning by begging her sister Pearl Kushner, who also lives in Coral Gables and is her only immediate survivor, for startup money.         Joe Bob Briggs, the drive-in movie critic, called her ''the greatest female exploitation director in history.''         She often said she did not like her movies, but she clearly enjoyed making them. The title of Mr. Bowen's biography is ''It's Better Than Sex,'' a phrase she often applied to filmmaking. Her work, which had faded from view in the 1980's, made a resurgence after being featured at the Harvard University Film Archive in 1994.         She was born in Manhattan, and her mother died when she was a young child. Her father, who sold hay and grain, and his six children then moved to Westchester County. Miss Wishman took some courses at Hunter College and studied acting.         She took a job as a secretary and movie booker in a relative's film distribution business. She married an advertising executive, Jack Abrahms, and moved to Florida; he died a few years later.         In her grief she wanted work that would occupy all of her waking time. She decided she could produce independent films as well as distribute them, and hit upon the idea of making films about nudist camps. Recent court rulings had removed them from censorship.         She made a total of eight, including ''Blaze Starr Goes Nudist,'' the only feature film starring the burlesque queen (as herself).         ''Nude on the Moon,'' in which astronauts are greeted by naked women with pipe-cleaner antennas poking out of their bouffant hairdos, was banned in New York State. The censor board at the time allowed only films about nudist colonies, turning aside her argument that it was about a nudist camp on the moon.         In her next phase, she made sexual melodramas in which women were depicted as tragic heroines being exploited by men. There was nudity and plenty of violence against women but no explicit sex. In the grainy black-and-white pictures, which included titles like ''A Taste of Flesh,'' she defined a quirky personal style: bizarre cutaways to ashtrays, lamps and squirrels; suggestive lesbian subplots and gratuitous nudity and violence.         By the early 1970's, court decisions allowed and audiences demanded more explicit pornographic films. She made several, but left the room when sex scenes were being shot.         ''She was actually rather sexually naÃ¯ve,'' Mr. Bowen said. ''She personally thought someone's hand caressing your face was more erotic than sex itself.''         Her big successes in the 1970's were two films starring Chesty Morgan, named for her commanding physical endowments. The movies had scant sex and very little nudity.         Miss Wishman wanted to make ''slasher'' films like ''Friday the 13th,'' but she lacked the money and technical skills. But in 1989, ''A Night to Dismember'' was finally released.         She had moved back to New York after the death of her husband and married again in 1966, a man she referred to only as Lou in interviews. The marriage ended in divorce in the mid-1970's.         She moved back to Florida in the late 1980's and was working in a lingerie store when interest in her work, which was readily available on video, began its resurgence. Her last movie, ''Each Time I Kill,'' will probably be released later this year, Mr. Bowen said.         He said that despite the raciness of her films she herself claimed little sexual experience.         ''I've had two husbands and a lover, and that's my quota,'' she said.       
         Mollie Wilmot, the socialite with the oversize white sunglasses who rose to celebrity in 1984 when a tanker ran aground at her Palm Beach, Fla., mansion, died on Sept. 17 at her apartment in Manhattan.         She was always reluctant to give her age, and ages from 73 to 78 have been reported. The Times Union of Albany, which regularly noted her attendance -- and choice of jewels -- at horse races in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., said longtime friends estimated that she was in her early 80's.         Paul Wilmot, a former husband, guessed 73 was closer. At least that is what she told him.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         Mrs. Wilmot had no children, and her sole immediate survivor is her sister, Francice Bushkin, of Santa Barbara, Calif.         Mrs. Wilmot rose to prominence the day after Thanksgiving in 1984, when a maid awakened her. Madame had callers to her one-acre oceanfront estate, next door to the estate of Rose Kennedy on North Ocean Boulevard Drive.         ''I thought it was the man who was coming to photograph my home for Town and Country,'' she said in an interview in The New York Times.         Instead, in a town that reveres privacy, it was visitors who arrived unannounced -- something frequent visitors like the Duke and Duchess of Windsor just would not do.         ''Let's have coffee first,'' Mrs. Wilmot said with a sigh.         She finally padded out to the patio in her dressing gown to find a 197-foot Venezuelan freighter pounding her seawall into concrete chips. A freak tropical storm had driven the ship, a rust bucket named the Mercedes, hard against her wall.         She overcame her dread of escaping Venezuelan rats and served finger sandwiches, caviar and coffee to the crew of 10, and martinis to the journalists who showed up.         She also fed the ship's cat, which the crew later gave to her. The cat, by then known as Mollie Mercedes, was passed on to her neighbors, the Pulitzer family, who sent it to the beauty parlor for a thorough fluffing and then outfitted it in velvet collars decorated with gold.         Such trappings were typical of the Palm Beach way of life that Mrs. Wilmot had known since she bought her mansion in the early 1960's. She brought her touch to the house, covering the walls of the grand drawing room with leopard-print fabric and laying the skins of lions and zebras on the gleaming floors. She displayed oceans of flowers, always white. Her own elegant, sometimes ostentatious, costumes also had a decidedly personal signature, particularly those sunglasses.         Soon after her purchase, Mrs. Wilmot was forced to put up with Secret Service agents who overran her property to protect her neighbor, President John F. Kennedy. The agents were less of a bother than a large boat in the backyard. But still.         Mollie Netcher was born in Chicago. She was named after her grandmother, who began as a clerk and underwear buyer in the family store and became known as ''the merchant princess of State Street.'' Her parents, Charles and Gladys, inherited the business, the Boston Store.         Mrs. Wilmot graduated from the Foxcroft School. She was married to and divorced from Eddie Bragno, a wine merchant who is now dead; Albert Bostwick, of the polo family; and Mr. Wilmot, a fashion publicity agent.         She exuberantly moved from charities, particularly ones related to dancing and horses, to art auctions. Her philanthropy included the New York City Ballet, the National Museum of Racing, the National Museum of Dance and equine research at the Veterinary College of Cornell University.         Her most dramatic moment occurred when the ramshackle freighter visited her. Helicopters carrying cameramen buzzed overhead for months, after it turned out that the ship's owner was bankrupt and it was stuck.         Palm Beach residents became nightly visitors, sipping cocktails and offering tongue-in-cheek suggestions on what Mrs. Wilmot might do about her problem. A bar had Mollie Wilmot look-alike contests, and many customers wore blond wigs and large white-framed sunglasses. Mrs. Wilmot judged.         After she had waited more than a month for the Mercedes to be removed, which turned out to be just a third of its stay, Mrs. Wilmot was convinced of one thing.         ''There's a strong possibility,'' she said, ''that if the boat had washed up on the Kennedy property, it would be gone already.''         If it all sounded like a movie, that is exactly what the Walt Disney Company thought. For 10 years, it tried to make a film, ''Palm Beached,'' that was supposed to star Melanie Griffith or Bette Midler. It languished in development and died.         Mrs. Wilmot came out strongly against having Ms. Midler portray her. The actress had just appeared in ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills.''         ''Disney wants to be flamboyant, to turn Palm Beach into a Beverly Hills,'' Mrs. Wilmot said. ''And I don't think that's fair.''       
         Representative Patsy T. Mink, a liberal Democrat from Hawaii who was likely to be elected to a 13th term in November, died Saturday at the Straub Clinic and Hospital in Honolulu. She was 74.         The cause was viral pneumonia brought on by chickenpox, said Andy Winer, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Hawaii.         As a member of Congress from 1965 until 1977, and again from 1990 until her death, Ms. Mink was a champion of women's rights, education, civil rights and labor unions.         One of her primary legislative achievements came in 1972, when she was one of the sponsors of Title IX of the federal Education Amendments, which mandates equal financing for women's athletics and academics at institutions receiving federal money.         ''It's rare as a legislator that you fight for legislation you believe in and stay around or live long enough to see it come to fruition,'' Ms. Mink said in 1995, in a meeting with some of the nation's top female basketball players.         Ms. Mink was known as articulate and strong-willed, and willing to fight for causes large and small.         In 1967, she and two other congresswomen tried to get into the House gym, after hearing about a form letter inviting members to use what was at the time an exclusively male preserve. They were turned away by the gym's director, who news reports said was ''horrified'' by their transgression.         Several years later, she took on Dr. Edgar F. Berman, a member of the Democratic Party's committee on national priorities, who claimed that women's ''raging hormonal imbalance'' made them unfit for executive positions in business and politics. Dr. Berman eventually resigned from the committee.         Ms. Mink, however, stopped short of associating herself with the women's liberation movement.         ''Just because I'm interested in women doesn't mean I'm for women's liberation,'' she told The New York Times in 1970. ''I support all groups when what they do coincides with what I believe in.''         Patsy Takemoto was born in Paia, a sugar plantation town on the island of Maui, on Dec. 6, 1927. As a senior at Maui High School she was elected student body president, and by the time she graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1948, her interests had shifted from medicine to the humanities.         In 1951, she graduated from the University of Chicago Law School. That same year, she married John F. Mink, a doctoral student in geology. The couple moved to Honolulu, where Ms. Mink opened a law office and became the first Japanese-American woman licensed to practice law in Hawaii, Mr. Winer said.         In 1956, Ms. Mink was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Legislature. In 1958, she was elected to the Hawaii Senate.         In her first period in Congress, Ms. Mink was an early critic of the Vietnam War, prompting some opponents to call her Patsy Pink.         In 1972 she and Representative Bella S. Abzug of New York traveled to Paris, where they met with North Vietnamese officials to discuss the prospects for peace.         In 1967, in a speech before the House of Representatives, Ms. Mink argued against harsh punishments for people who burned the American flag.         ''America is not a country which needs to punish its dissenters to preserve its honor,'' she said. ''America is not a country which needs to demand conformity of all its people, for its strength lies in all our diversities converging in one common belief, that of the importance of freedom as the essence of our country.''         In 1976, after 12 years in Congress, Ms. Mink sought a seat in the United States Senate. She lost the Democratic primary to Spark M. Matsunaga. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed her assistant secretary of state for oceans and international, environmental and scientific affairs.         Ms. Mink returned to Congress in 1990 after winning a special election for the seat vacated by Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat, who was appointed to the Senate after Mr. Matsunaga's death. She discovered that many of her fellow Democrats had shifted toward more centrist positions.         ''She saw it as an opportunity to teach lessons,'' said Representative Neil Abercrombie, Democrat of Hawaii. ''She never thought for a moment of not working with people who didn't agree with her ideologically.''         In her final term, Ms. Mink raised questions about the creation of the Homeland Security Department, saying she feared that the new legislation could be used to undermine civil rights.         ''She had already been through that as a Japanese-American, seeing people put into detention camps on the basis of what they supposedly were as opposed to what they had actually done,'' Mr. Abercrombie said.         Ms. Mink is survived by her husband; their daughter, Gwendolyn; and a brother, Eugene Takemoto.       
         Kim Hunter, whose eclectic 60-year career included an Oscar, two Emmy nominations and a Broadway triumph with her portrayal of Stella in the legendary 1947 debut of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' died on Wednesday at her New York apartment. She was 79.         A founding member of the Actors Studio whose screen career was temporarily derailed by the Hollywood blacklists of the 1950's, Ms. Hunter was recently hospitalized for a fall and had been in declining health. She died of a heart attack in her apartment above the Cherry Lane Theater in the West Village, said her daughter, Kathryn Emmett.         Ms. Hunter caught the acting bug in elementary school and was never a snob about the roles she chose, mixing highly demanding parts with smaller ones in B-movies, long stints in regional theater, television guest appearance and even a running role on an ABC soap opera, ''The Edge of Night,'' in 1979 and 1980.         But without doubt the roles for which she is most remembered are Stella Kowalski, Marlon Brando's passionate and beleaguered wife in the stage and film versions of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire,'' and Dr. Zira, the coquettish simian with a fondness for Charlton Heston in the 1968 film ''Planet of the Apes.''         The role of Stella also won her an Academy Award for best supporting actress when the director Elia Kazan adapted his Broadway production to the screen. The scenes of an anguished Stanley Kowalski (Mr. Brando), disheveled and grimy, screaming up to his wife -- ''Stella!'' -- in the backyard of their seedy New Orleans home, and of Ms. Hunter's sexually charged descent on a winding staircase into his arms, have become iconic cinematic moments.         Feisty, occasionally profane, Ms. Hunter frequently told interviewers that she had no use for the trappings of Hollywood stardom that had always eluded her.         ''The work itself has been my life,'' she said in 1999. ''I was never in this for jazzy stardom, and as far as that's concerned, I've never had it. Doesn't matter to me.''         Ms. Hunter was born in Detroit, and her father died four years later. Her mother and stepfather moved the family to Miami Beach when she was 10, and there she developed a taste for the theater.         ''I was lonely growing up,'' she said. ''My only brother was nine years older and had little time for me. So I picked friends out of books and played let's-pretend games, acting out their characters before a mirror.''         Before long she had an acting coach and made her stage debut at 17 in the title role of ''Penny Wise'' at the Miami Women's Club. Later she took roles with stock companies around the country. At the Pasadena Playhouse in California, in ''Arsenic and Old Lace,'' she was spotted by a talent scout and signed to a contract with the producer David O. Selznick.         For her 1943 screen debut, Selznick loaned her to the horror-film producer Val Lewton, for whom she played a young woman battling devil worshipers in ''The Seventh Victim.''         Shortly afterward, Ms. Hunter took a supporting role in the Ginger Rogers film ''Tender Comrade,'' about young women living communally during World War II, a film that struck some as pro-Soviet. It was cited, years later, as a reason that her name appeared in ''Red Channels,'' a 1950's pamphlet naming suspected Communist sympathizers.         Ms. Hunter, a liberal Democrat, had been a vocal supporter of civil rights, though she never belonged to the Communist Party. She said she traced her problems with the blacklist to a world peace symposium that she helped sponsor in 1949. No one ever announced that she was on a blacklist, she said.         ''Gradually it became sort of clear,'' she said. ''I think CBS was first. I was on the blacklist at CBS. No more CBS television. Then I think ABC dropped out and then, finally, it was NBC. And then by that time, I won my Oscar for the movie of 'Streetcar,' but I could not work in films. The last film I made was in 1951.''         Her hiatus from the screen lasted until 1956, when she appeared opposite Bette Davis in ''Storm Center,'' about book-burning. ''I thought, uh-oh, here we go again,'' she said. But her political problems did not reignite.         Ms. Hunter was one of the few forgiving voices when many in Hollywood rebelled against awarding Mr. Kazan a special Oscar in 1999. He had never apologized for naming names to Congressional investigators during the blacklist days.         ''The whole business is dumb,'' she told one interviewer. ''Artistic achievement and the mistake someone made years ago don't belong together.''         The ''Streetcar'' role came about because Selznick's wife Irene remembered the actress when it came time to cast the role of Stella. The play opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in New York, but rehearsals were held on the roof of the New Amsterdam Theater.         ''Tennessee sat way in the back and when he had a thought about something, he'd write a note and come down to where we were working, reach over and tuck the note into Kazan's coat pocket,'' Ms. Hunter said.         Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson praised the entire cast. ''All act not only with color and style, but with insight,'' he wrote.         Ms. Hunter's 1944 marriage to William Baldwin ended in divorce in 1946. The couple had one child, Kathryn, now of Stamford, Conn., who took the name of Ms. Hunter's second husband, Robert Emmett. Emmett, also an actor, died in 2000. The couple had a son, Sean Robert, also of Stamford, and Ms. Hunter is survived by six grandchildren.         As for her other most celebrated role, Ms. Hunter said ''Planet of the Apes'' was a project she respected. ''I thought it was a damned interesting script and a challenge for all of us,'' she said.         She spent hours at the Bronx Zoo, she said, studying primate behavior. But the project turned out to be more of a challenge than she had anticipated, largely because of the cumbersome makeup. ''The only part of me uncovered was my eyeballs,'' she said. ''I had to breathe through my upper lip. It was wild.''         Ms. Hunter also appeared opposite Humphrey Bogart in the 1952 drama ''Deadline USA,'' and drew critical praise in ''Lilith'' (1964) and ''The Swimmer'' (1968), among other roles. More recently, she had a small role in ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (1997).         ''Acting is my life,'' she said in 1994. ''It doesn't get easier. It gets harder. I find it more challenging as I do it and realize how much more has to go into it. But I thank God I am in a profession where there is no retirement age.''       
         Elizabeth Coblentz, an Amish homemaker who wrote a syndicated cooking column by hand beneath a kerosene lantern, a kitchen chronicle that touched on everything from the merits of Belgian horses to coping with grief, died on Tuesday in Blue Springs, Mo. She was 66.         The cause was an aneurysm, said Kevin Williams, her editor at Oasis Newsfeatures, which distributed her column to 105 newspapers, with more than two million readers.         A member of the strict Old Order Amish, who avoid most modern conveniences, she lived on a farm near Geneva, Ind., without running water, electricity, plumbing or a telephone. She traveled primarily by horse-drawn buggy, sewed her family's clothes and canned fruits and vegetables. She answered questions many readers had never thought to ask, including how to cook a meal for 76 children.         She mailed in her weekly columns, but Mr. Williams sometimes did not have time to mail his editing questions, so he would wire daisies with a card enclosed. One asked: ''How much sugar in that cream pie recipe?'' Mr. Williams had prepaid Express Mail envelopes at her home in which she could reply.         Mrs. Coblentz's columns seemed to be ripped from the pages of a 19th-century church bulletin, with their descriptions of quilting bees, children's funerals, sleigh rides and walking barefoot in warm spring soil. She told of baking 70 pies and 14 plates of ''nothings,'' a traditional Amish pastry, for her daughter's wedding.         In one column -- she called them letters -- she described a day that began at 4 a.m. with cooking breakfast of fried potatoes, eggs and bacon. The 11 a.m. entry: ''Went in to get dinner, as I've got menfolk working hard, hauling loads and loads of manure with the manure spreader that is driven by a team of horses.''         Her religious faith was a constant theme. But food, of the most comfortable kind, was her main topic, from Aunt Hilty's cinnamon rolls to putting up pumpkin pickles to churning a double batch of hot pepper butter. Among her recipes were those for sauerkraut bread, watermelon preserves and dandelion jelly.         The overall effect of her columns was an insight into the way of life and fundamental values of the Amish.         ''You would not notice much difference in our life now from when I was a girl or my mother was a girl,'' Mrs. Coblentz said in an Associated Press interview in 2000.         Elizabeth Coblentz was born in Berne, Ind., on July 18, 1936. She had six sisters and one brother and grew up on a farm. She left school after ninth grade, in accordance with Amish custom. She worked in a sugar factory, cleaned houses and married young. Starting in 1952, she wrote community news for a nationally distributed Amish newspaper.         Mr. Williams discovered her in 1991, after having done a research paper on the Amish as a college freshman. After having the idea of an Amish cooking column, he ran into Mrs. Coblentz by chance.         The first newspaper to take the column was The Quincy Herald-Whig of Quincy, Ill. It now appears in papers from Newton, N.J., to Indianapolis to Tacoma. But Mrs. Coblentz's picture does not appear with it. Following Amish tradition rooted in biblical passages that decry ''graven images,'' she refused to be photographed, appear on television or allow her voice to be taped.         But she had nothing against personal appearances and was on a publicity tour to promote her new book when she died. The book, ''The Amish Cook: Recipes and Recollections From an Old Order Amish Family,'' is to be published in November by Ten Speed Press of Berkeley, Calif. Her earlier work, ''The Best of the Amish Cook,'' a collection of her newspaper columns, was published by Oasis in two volumes.         On her tour, she traveled with Mr. Williams by car, as the Amish faith permits people to use technology as long as it does not intrude on their lives, he said. Owning an auto was out of the question for Mrs. Coblentz, Mr. Williams said, because it would have brought the whole world within her reach. Riding with someone is a compromise most Amish are willing to make, he said.         Her husband, Benjamin, a carpenter, died in 2000, throwing her into a depression that Mr. Williams said he believes led to her death. More than 3,000 readers sent cards and 5,000 sent e-mail messages to the syndicate that distributed her column.         She is survived by her daughters, Leah Shetler, Verena and Susan Coblentz, Elizabeth Wengerd, Lovina Eicher and Emma Schwartz, all of Geneva; her sons, Amos of Berne and Albert of Geneva; her sisters, Leah Girod of Berne, Lovina Swartzentruber of LaGrange, Ind., Emma Schwartz of Berne and Salome Hilty and Barbara Schwartz, both of Geneva; her brother, Chris A. Graber of Bryant, Ind.; and 35 grandchildren.         Many of her readers seemed to feel close to her. In a letter before Mrs. Coblentz's death, Betty Watters of Independence, Mo., wrote, ''Your letters remind me of my mother -- her chickens, gardens, canning, cleaning, working every day in fields by Dad's side and clean-smelling laundry whipping and snapping in the fresh air and sunshine.''

         Aileen Riggin Soule, a diver and swimmer who at age 14 became the youngest American Olympic gold medalist and later became the oldest living American female gold medalist, died Thursday in a nursing home in Honolulu. She was 96.         At the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, Riggin won the first gold medal awarded in women's springboard diving and became, at 4 feet 7 inches and 65 pounds, the smallest American Olympic champion. In the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, she became the only woman to win medals in swimming and diving in the same Olympics, taking the silver medal in springboard diving and the bronze medal in the 100-meter backstroke.         In 1974, in one of the many articles she wrote on her career, she said:         ''My most unforgettable experience would have to be as the youngest member of the first American women's Olympic swimming and diving team in 1920. I was a very small 14-year-old. Until two months before the tryouts, we had no idea of the dives required, and some were entirely new. Lacking precedent, we learned as we went along, yet practice was uncertain as the boards were not standardized.         ''When the book of rules arrived, it was in French and sent us to the dictionary to discover what a 'coup de pied Ã  la lune' was. It turned out to be a gainer [a dive now known as a reverse]. There were also 12 dives instead of the usual 10, two of which to be drawn from a hat just before the contest.''         Last-minute preparation was the story of her career. She was born May 2, 1906, in Newport, R.I., and reared in New York City. Her father was a Navy paymaster, and she traveled extensively with her parents.         She learned to swim at age 6, in Manila Bay. In 1918, she came down with influenza during the epidemic that swept the United States during World War I. On her doctor's recommendation that she swim for her health, she joined the celebrated Women's Swimming Association team in New York.         In 1919, when she took up diving, there were no indoor pools with diving boards available to women. Many people thought women should not dive at all because it would injure their health.         The only place to practice in the metropolitan New York area was a tidal pool on Long Island, an hour from the city. When the tide rose, the board was about 10 feet above the surface, about the height of a 3-meter springboard. When the tide was out, the drop was 14 feet, so the divers tried to time their practices for high tide in warm weather on weekends.         Even with those poor training conditions, Riggin finished second in the United States Olympic trials behind Helen Wainwright, who was also 14. But until the day before the boat sailed for Antwerp, they were not sure they would be able to compete in the Olympics because many officials did not want women, much less two 14-year-olds. But because Riggin and Wainwright had also made the Olympic team as swimmers, they went.         For 13 days, they sailed on a battered military transport ship, where training was a nightmare. Riggin recalled: ''I remember the javelin throwers could tie a rope around their javelin, throw them out to sea and pull them back. The shooters used clay pigeons until they ran out. After a while, the sea gulls were looking pretty good.''         In a tiny canvas tank filled with seawater, the swimmers, one at a time, swam 5 to 10 minutes, held in place by a belt around the waist. Divers could not train at all.''         In Antwerp, a city still recovering from World War I, the swimmers and divers competed in a moat-like canal. Ethelda Bleibtrey, the American who won gold medals in all three women's races, told King Albert I of Belgium, ''I swam in mud, not water.''         The diving board was a plank with no spring, and, Riggin said, ''the water was black and icy cold.'' Without a coach there, the American women swept the medals, with Wainwright winning the silver and Thelma Payne the bronze. After that, American women won every gold medal in Olympic springboard diving until 1960.         In 1924, Riggin was an Olympian again, joining American teammates like Johnny Weissmuller, who later gained fame playing Tarzan, and a Yale rower named Benjamin Spock.         ''Being 18 and being in Paris was wonderful,'' she said. ''The sun was shining, we read Hemingway and we were just carried away.''         She was in the first underwater swimming film in 1922 and the first slow-motion swimming and diving films in 1923. She turned professional in 1925, giving diving exhibitions and swimming demonstrations in England and Wales.         In 1926, she played three weeks at the Hippodrome in New York, diving into a glass tank, into six feet of water. After her former swimming teammate Gertrude Ederle became the first woman to swim the English Channel, Riggin and Ederle toured for six months. In 1937, at the Cleveland Exposition, Riggin helped organize and star in the first Billy Rose Aquacade.         She toured the world, appeared in movies and wrote a sports column for The New York Evening Post and articles for national magazines. In 1967, she was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. She never stopped swimming or lecturing or writing about it, and at 85 she broke six world records for her age group in the world masters championships.         She and her husband, Howard Soule, who died several years ago, moved to Hawaii in 1957 and lived in a Diamond Head apartment in Honolulu. Even into her 90's, she swam three miles a week in the ocean.         She is survived by a daughter, Yvonne May of Zurich; a stepdaughter, Patti Anderson of Honolulu; and two stepsons, Bruce Soule of Newport Beach, Calif., and Wallace Soule of Bakersfield, Calif.         In 1996, when asked if she had any goals in addition to attending the Atlanta Olympics, she replied: ''Yes. I'd like to continue -- life in general, that is.''       
         Harriet Doerr, who at 73 published her first novel, unveiling an exquisite gift to marshal clear, sparse prose to evoke, in her phrase, memories ''like a gentle knife stuck into your heart,'' died on Sunday at her home in Pasadena, Calif. She was 92.         She had been in declining health since she suffered a broken hip in a fall last month, said her daughter, Martha Doerr Toppin. In recent years, glaucoma and frailty kept her from writing, even at her methodical pace of a sentence or so an hour.         Ms. Doerr's gleaming literary reputation rested on three slender books, perhaps 600 pages in all.         Her first book, ''Stones for Ibarra'' (Viking, 1984), which won the American Book Award for first fiction, was called ''a perfect book'' by the writer Alice Adams, and her next novel and a book of short stories elicited similar praise.         Her style roamed the geography of Mexico, memory and mood in a manner that the critic Anatole Broyard in The New York Times said carried ''echoes of Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez, Katherine Anne Porter and even Graham Greene.'' Her gift for phrasing was suggested by her description of the Mexican village as ''no more than a shard chipped from the rock face of eternity.'' Elsewhere she called it ''a town of a hundred burros.''         Her critics generally agreed that she improved with age, and emphasized that her works would have been remarkable for a writer of any age.         In reviewing her second novel, ''Consider This, SeÃ±ora'' (Harcourt, 1993), published in 1993, when she was 83, the critic Margo Jefferson wrote in The Times, ''Everything is richer, as when an actress takes a role you saw her play a decade ago, and lets you read that decade in her face, her voice and her body.''         Harriet Green Huntington was born in Pasadena on April 8, 1910, the third of six children and two step-children. Her grandfather was Henry Edwards Huntington, and she played with her siblings at his San Marino estate, which is now the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens. She grew up with nannies and servants, as well as more intangible blessings: her family loved reading and lively discussions, her daughter said.         Ms. Doerr was asked to read several of her poems at high school graduation, but would not allow the school to reproduce them because she thought they were awful. When she was 16, she met Albert Doerr, an engineering student at Stanford University who took her to a prize fight on their first date. She was horrified, not least because of the droplets of blood that had spattered on her dress.         She went east to Smith College in 1927 with her train compartment filled with roses from Mr. Doerr. She did not like the cold of Massachusetts and felt homesick and ''half in love.'' By the summer of 1928, she left Smith and transferred to Stanford. where Mr. Doerr was finishing his degree. They married in 1930, and she left college.         They had two children; the first, a son, Michael, died of cancer in 1995. Ms. Toppin, the second child and Ms. Doerr's only survivor, lives in Oakland.         In World War II, while her husband served in the Navy, she and he signed petitions protesting the relocation of Japanese-Americans to internment camps.         The family went to Mexico in the late 1950's. There Mr. Doerr oversaw the revival of his family's mining business. Much of the emotional quality of that experience is contained in Ms. Doerr's first novel, including the male protagonist's struggle with leukemia. Mr. Doerr died of leukemia in 1972.         Her son teased Ms. Doerr into returning to college in 1975. She first took some classes at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., and then enrolled full time at Stanford, majoring in history. She was accepted into the university's prestigious creative-writing program. Other students resented her presence, until she read her first piece aloud.         Ms. Doerr won the $2,500 Transatlantic Review-Henfield Foundation Award in 1982, based on three stories she had published in small literary magazines. Senior editors at Viking Penguin suggested her stories could be combined into a novel. She and a professor shuffled them on her living room floor until a larger narrative fell into place.         Her next novel, ''Consider This, SeÃ±ora,'' was also set in Mexico and was seen by some critics as imitative. But Laura Cumming, writing in The Guardian of London, said it was ''full of enchanted fables.''         ''The Tiger in the Grass'' (Viking, 1995) was a collection of essays, many about Mexico. But words of searing pain reflected a more immediate concern: her son was then dying of cancer, and Ms. Doerr used italicized passages to tell his story. In one, she remembered that his first word was ''car'' and that the doctor had just forbidden him to drive.         ''Now his car is parked outside his house and is visible from several windows,'' she wrote. ''I have forgotten the details of Chinese water torture we used to hear of, but it must be something like this.''         Ms. Doerr believed in no religion, but often took solace in each person's ability to create memories that live on. In ''Consider This, SeÃ±ora,'' the character Ursula Bowles, a widow who enters the story at age 79 and exits at 83, witnesses life's evanescence.         ''She could see that an individual life is, in the end, nothing more than a stirring of air, a shifting of light,'' Ms. Doerr wrote. ''No one of us, finally, can be more than that. Even Einstein. Even Brahms.         ''Then the widow slept.''       
         Florence Stephenson Mahoney, an unwavering advocate for national health research and programs, died on Nov. 29 at her home in Washington. She was 103.         Working with the philanthropist Mary Woodard Lasker, Mrs. Mahoney was instrumental in the growth of the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services through which the federal government finances medical research.         Starting as the one-room Laboratory of Hygiene on Staten Island in 1887, the agency, now comprising 27 institutes and centers for specific topics, is housed on a 300-acre campus in Bethesda, Md. Its budget for 2002 is $23.4 billion.         After World War II, Mrs. Mahoney and Mrs. Lasker lobbied to enlarge the agency, then a single institute. ''It is hard to realize today that government-subsidized research in the 1940's, when Florence Mahoney started her efforts, actually was controversial,'' said Judith Robinson, author of ''Noble Conspirator: Florence S. Mahoney and the Rise of the National Institutes of Health'' (The Francis Press, 2001).         With charm and persistence, Mrs. Mahoney and Mrs. Lasker pressed powerful politicians to support research on health issues.         ''When I wanted to get things done, I started at the top,'' Mrs. Mahoney told Ms. Robinson.         And the top often meant the president, whether it was Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson or Jimmy Carter.         Jack Valenti, a friend of Mrs. Mahoney, was a special assistant to the president in the Johnson administration.         ''When I would tell him that Mary Lasker and Florence Mahoney wanted to see him, the president would groan,'' Mr. Valenti said. ''He'd say, 'Oh, my God, these two women are going to bankrupt this country.' And they usually got what they wanted out of him.''         Eventually, the women focused on specific areas, with Mrs. Mahoney taking a special interest in aging and mental health.         In the 1960's Mrs. Mahoney began urging lawmakers to create an Institute on Aging at the N.I.H. She said the institute should concentrate on improving the quality of the lives of older Americans, not just their longevity.         In 1972, Mrs. Mahoney persuaded Senator Thomas F. Eagleton and Representative Paul G. Rogers to sponsor a bill creating such an institute. It passed, but President Richard M. Nixon would not sign it.         The next year, the bill was reintroduced, and Mr. Nixon, embroiled in the Watergate scandal, again would not sign the measure. But Mrs. Mahoney kept up her efforts.         In the spring of 1974, the bill was passed a third time, and on May 31, 1974, Mr. Nixon signed it, just months before he resigned under the threat of impeachment.         ''There would not be an Institute on Aging without Florence Mahoney,'' Mr. Eagleton said. ''She was the creator and instigator of it. I was simply her messenger.''         Florence Amelia Sheets was born on a farm near Muncie, Ind., on April 20, 1899, the eldest of three daughters born to Abraham L. and Julia T. Stephenson Sheets. She later adopted her mother's maiden name as part of hers.         Ms. Robinson wrote that Mrs. Mahoney remembered feeling a sense of social responsibility for the first time at age 10 when she was riding in a friend's pony cart.         ''There was an orphans' home nearby, which we passed once,'' Ms. Robinson quoted Mrs. Mahoney as saying. ''We didn't know what it was, so one time we thought we'd stop and find out. We went in, and I'll never forget it; I can still see it. Everything was gray. Even the children were all gray. It was all so depressing. That was my first feeling of social conscience.''         After graduating from Muncie High School in 1917, she enrolled in the Battle Creek Normal School of Physical Education in Michigan, where she studied anatomy and kinesiology. She taught physical education in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and studied dance in New York with an Italian ballet master whose students included Fred Astaire. She also took medical courses.         On Oct. 13, 1926, she married Daniel J. Mahoney, a Cox newspaper executive who became publisher of The Miami Daily News. They had two sons and divorced in 1950.         Mrs. Mahoney moved to Washington, turning her Georgetown house into a sort of salon, where politicians and scientists discussed issues over dinner.         Dr. Robert N. Butler, the first director of the National Institute on Aging, said that the dining room table was on the small side and that he believed it was by design, to encourage robust discussion.         Mrs. Mahoney's house had another claim to fame. Mr. Valenti, now the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said ''The Exorcist'' was filmed there.         Mrs. Mahoney is survived by a son, J. Michael Mahoney of Larkspur, Calif., and grandchildren.       
         Dolly Dawn, a big-band vocalist whose honey-sweet voice each noon, six days a week, bounced invitingly across America in the late 1930's and early 40's, died last Wednesday at a nursing home in Englewood, N.J. She was 86.         Her death was announced this week by her family.         She was one of the first vocalists to become the sole focus of a band, at a time when bands and musicians were still the main draw. Ella Fitzgerald called Miss Dawn an influence on her own singing. Joe Franklin, the New York radio and television personality, said in an interview that when Walter Winchell coined the term ''canary'' for female singers, he was referring to her.         She sang first with George Hall and His Orchestra, and then with a group carved out of the band called ''Dolly Dawn and Her Dawn Patrol.'' Later, she played clubs, dance halls and street fairs, among other engagements, all over the United States.         But Miss Dawn dropped out of the limelight and became known mainly to the cult following that saw her in scattered club appearances in the 1970's and 80's, and responded to the release of a two-disk album of her records with George Hall on the RCA Bluebird label in 1976.         There was another revival of interest in her after Sony's reissue of some of her hits, most recently a collection called ''You're a Sweetheart'' in 2001. Paper dolls of her are sold on eBay.         She received almost no royalties for her reissued recordings, obtained only minimal Social Security and suffered in recent years from diabetes and kidney failure, Peter Sando, her nephew, said. She had lived in a transient hotel in Manhattan before being given an apartment and other assistance by the Actors' Fund, also in Manhattan. She moved to the Actors' Fund Nursing Home and Assisted Living Care Facility in Englewood earlier this year.         Theresa Maria Stabile was born on Feb. 3, 1916, in Newark and grew up in Montclair, N.J. Both her parents were Italian immigrants and her father ran a restaurant, among other jobs. Her cousin was the bandleader Dick Stabile. At 14, she won an amateur contest that Hall held in Newark. He shook her hand, but had forgotten her a year or two later when she showed up at the Taft Hotel in Manhattan, where his band regularly played. With the regular female vocalist about to leave, Ms. Dawn auditioned and got the job. She was known at the time as Billie Starr. Mr. Hall and Harriet Mencken, a writer on The New York Journal-American, came up with Dolly Dawn.         ''She's as fresh as the dawn and as dimpled as a doll,'' the newspaperwoman said, according to an article in Radio Guide in 1937. Miss Dawn never stopped hating the name, which she thought made her sound like a stripper.         After six months of musical training, she began singing with Hall's band in July 1935, which every day but Sunday was broadcast nationally on CBS radio from the Taft Hotel at noon. The show's tagline: ''Dance With Romance.'' Her relationship with Hall and his wife was so close that they formally adopted her when she was 19. In a ceremony on July 4, 1941, he turned his band over to her and became her manager.         She returned the loyalty. Tommy Dorsey asked her to sing with his band, but she turned him down, said Ronald Knoth, a social worker who helped her during her later years.         A popular part of the band's performance had become her appearing with just seven musicians in a group she named Dawn Patrol, after a newspaper column Ed Sullivan wrote called ''Along the Dawn Patrol.'' Sullivan, a friend, gave her permission.         Ms. Dawn never married, saying that her music was her husband and children. She is survived by her sister, Ida Sando, of Spring Lake, N.J.
