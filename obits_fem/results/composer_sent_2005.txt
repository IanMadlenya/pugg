The song's haunting melody, which Ms. Velázquez also wrote, is based on the aria ''Quejas, o la Maja y el Ruiseñor'' (''Plaints, or the Maiden and the Nightingale''), from the 1916 opera ''Goyescas,'' by the Spanish composer Enrique Granados.

        Mary Kim Joh, a composer and medical researcher, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan, said her son, Insoo Joh.
Her only survivor is her daughter, a musician, singer and composer who plays keyboard in the group the Psychedelic Furs.
The death was announced by the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization in Manhattan.A pianist and composer, Ms. Rittmann was first hired by Lincoln Kirstein in 1937, played piano for George Balanchine's American Ballet Caravan -- a forerunner of the New York City Ballet -- and was a concert pianist for the choreographer Agnes de Mille.
It was her forte to take a composer's theme or melody and mold it into ballet or the incidental music woven in for dramatic effect.
She started piano lessons at 6, graduated from the Conservatory in Cologne and had made a name for herself as anavant-garde composer by the time she arrived in New York in 1937.
Her father, Milton Ager, was a successful Tin Pan Alley composer whose tunes included ''Ain't She Sweet'' and ''Happy Days Are Here Again,'' which became a Democratic Party anthem.
So was the American pianist Richard Buhlig, who introduced her to the composer Henry Cowell and the music of other contemporary composers.
In addition to Mr. Wolff, her students included the composer Lucia Dlugoszewskiwho moved to New York to study Bach with her in 1948 and ended up meeting the choreographer Erick Hawkins, who had a studio next door.
Teaching at the Tel Aviv Seminary for Music Teachers in 1948 and 1949, she joined forces with the Israeli composer Ovadia Tuvia and the Yemenite young people who sang in his chorales.
But in 1934, when she was 13, she became a student of Abram Chasins, the pianist, composer, writer and broadcaster.
