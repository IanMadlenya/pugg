Elizabeth Kray, a friend and patron of poets for more than 30 years, died of cancer Saturday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.         ''With her unique mixture of idealism and common sense,'' said the poet Stanley Kunitz, ''she was the moving spirit behind most of the programs and activities that have made New York the poetry capital of the United States and an international poetry center.''         As executive director of the Academy of American Poets, a position she held from 1963 to 1981, Miss Kray originated in 1966 the Poets-in-the-Schools program, bringing many important poets to schools in New York City, Detroit and Pittsburgh.         She also established literary-historical walking tours under the auspices of the academy in Greenwich Village, Central Park, Harlem, SoHo and elsewhere. In the early 1970's, New York City donated the services of a Staten Island ferry so that patrons of a Walt Whitman walking tour could travel from lower Manhattan to Brooklyn as New Yorkers had traveled in Whitman's day. A Founder of Poets House         After retiring from the academy, Miss Kray, together with Mr. Kunitz, founded Poets House, a meeting place for poets. Many of the books in its library were donated by poets, and Miss Kray donated her entire library, including many rare and inscribed editions.         Miss Kray, who was born Aug. 17, 1916, in Cleveland, graduated from the University of Washington in 1938. After working as a teacher and a resettlement worker for displaced persons, in 1954 she became director of the Poetry Center, YM-YWHA, now known as the 92d Street Y. There she developed tours for poets, obtained a grant from the Bollingen Foundation to commission poets to translate foreign language poetry and arranged the first reading tours of a number of foreign poets. While running the Y's program, Miss Kray also acted as a personal agent for W. H. Auden, E. E. Cummings, Marianne Moore, Edith Sitwell and Stephen Spender.         Miss Kray is the author of ''Four Literary-Historical Walking Tours'' and ''Chelsea 1904-1913: John Sloan's Neighborhood and Neighbors.''         She is survived by her husband, Vladimir Ussachevsky, also of Manhattan, who is now composer in residence at the University of Utah, and a brother, Richard Kray, of Grosse Pointe, Mich. Funeral services will be held at 11 A.M. tomorrow at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street.

Carter, a musician, composer and Princeton organist and choir master at the turn of the century. She also was a granddaughter of Robert Hoe, an inventor and, in the latter 19th century and early 20th century, head of R. Hoe & Company, the manufacturer of printing presses.         Mrs. Fahy was a trained nurse and did volunteer work for the Y.W.C.A. and Interfaith Neighbors, among others, until retiring about eight years ago. Her husband, Charles H.

Dana Suesse, a composer and songwriter whose hits included ''You Ought to Be in Pictures,'' died of a stroke last Friday in New York City. She was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Suesse, who also wrote ''Whistling in the Dark,'' ''My Silent Love'' and ''Blue Moonlight,'' achieved widespread fame in 1932 when the orchestra leader Paul Whiteman commissioned her to write a jazz concerto for piano and orchestra. The work, ''Concerto in Three Rhythms,'' was such a success that the next year, another Whiteman commission, ''Symphonic Waltzes,'' followed.         Miss Suesse, who was born in Shreveport, La., in 1911, came to New York in 1931 with her mother, an opera singer, and began working as a songwriter; her first hit was ''Have You Forgotten?'' in 1931. Her best-known song, ''You Ought to Be in Pictures,'' written in 1934 with Edward Heyman, has remained Hollywood's anthem for 52 years.         In 1936 she wrote the score for Billy Rose's ''Casa Manana'' revue, and later collaborated with him on his ''Aquacade'' revue at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Miss Suesse also worked with the lyricists Harold Adamson, E. Y. Harburg, Irving Kahl and Leo Robin.         In the late 1940's, Miss Suesse studied composition with Nadia Boulanger. She was also a pianist, and appeared as soloist in many of her own works.         Miss Suesse is survived by her stepson, Charles DeLincks.

Marie Kryl, a concert pianist who appeared with the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis Symphony Orchestras, died Sunday in Orlando, Fla. She was 90 years old.         Miss Kryl was born in Philadelphia on July 4, 1897, but lived most of her early life in Chicago, where she studied with the well-known pianist and teacher Rudolph Ganz.         Her father, Bohumir Kryl, a bank president, art collector, composer and bandmaster, so wanted his daughters, Marie and Josephine, to become musicians that, in 1921, he promised them each $100,000 if they would not marry before reaching age 30. They both agreed.         But neither daughter lived up to her vow. Josephine, a violinist of note, married the composer Paul Taylor White before turning 30. Marie forfeited her fortune when, in 1926, she became engaged to a Greek Count, Spiro Hadji-Kyriacos. A year later, however, the engagement was broken, and in 1932, she married Michel Gusikoff, a composer and a former assistant conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony.
