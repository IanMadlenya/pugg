         Rosalie Gwathmey, a photographer who was noted for the warmth and artful simplicity of her pictures of black Southern communities, and who threw away all her negatives in 1955 after donating most of her prints to the New York Public Library, died on Monday at her home in Amagansett, N.Y., said her son, the architect Charles Gwathmey. She was 92.         A textile designer throughout the 1960's and 70's, Mrs. Gwathmey seldom looked back on her photographic past, which was in turn largely forgotten by the photographic world. That changed in 1994. A solo exhibition of her images from the 40's, at Glenn Horowitz Bookseller in East Hampton, N.Y., suddenly revived interest in her work.         Like the photographer Doris Ulmann, who found grace and simple beauty in a South Carolina black community in the 20's and early 30's, Mrs. Gwathmey focused on black life in her hometown, Charlotte, N.C., and in Rocky Mount, N.C. Unlike Ulmann, whose pictures of mostly poor blacks have a gentle, dignified grandeur, Mrs. Gwathmey's more sharply focused images are grittier, reflecting a quirkier mind and eye.         In the foreground of a picture from the 40's a woman sits calmly in a chair on the porch of her modest house, a crowded clothesline stretching from a nearby post. Behind her, though, bulldozers are busily clearing the ground for a highway.         In another photograph a barefoot sharecropper stands at a doorway, his steady gaze on the photographer, his checked shirt and patched trousers somehow all of a piece with the bold wood planks on an exterior wall festooned with garlands of peppers.         In 1946 Mrs. Gwathmey's work was in a New Photographers group show at the Museum of Modern Art. Edward Steichen included one of her images in the Family of Man exhibition in 1955, the year that Mrs. Gwathmey's photographic career abruptly ended.         Since the early 40's she had been involved with the Photo League in Manhattan, whose members included Paul Strand, Berenice Abbott, Dorothea Lange and W. Eugene Smith. But when the league was attacked as subversive during the McCarthy era, its membership evaporated and the league disbanded in 1951. Tired of keeping her work in the closet, Mrs. Gwathmey simply walked away from photography, she said in an interview for the Glenn Horowitz exhibition catalog.         Rosalie Hook was born on Sept. 15, 1908, in Charlotte. Intending to be a portrait painter, she studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, where she met Robert Gwathmey, who would become known for his social realist paintings. They married in 1935.         After their son, Charles, was born in 1938 and they were living in Pittsburgh, Mrs. Gwathmey took up photography. ''I was crazy about the way the city looked,'' she said. She studied there with the photographer Luke Swank.         At the Photo League she studied with Paul Strand. ''Paul was a perfectionist,'' she recalled in the same catalog interview. ''He taught his students to save only their perfect prints, to mat them beautifully and to frame them beautifully.'' Her reaction was, ''I began to feel it was too precious.''         A few years before her 1994 exhibition, she recalled, she had written to the New York Public Library, saying that she would like to have some of her pictures back. ''I had a chance to sell some and I could use the money.'' The library gave her 15 duplicates. She signed them and gave them to the buyer. Several transactions later, the pictures ended up in the possession of Mr. Horowitz.         Mrs. Gwathmey, whose husband died in 1988, is survived by her son and two grandchildren.         She said she saw her photography as a ''documentary thing,'' and not as an art form. In fact, the humanism in her work went with an artist's eye for composition and form. ''We all know,'' she said, ''that if the language isn't eloquent, no one bothers to finish the story.''       
         Dare Wright, a photographer and children's book author whose best-known work is ''The Lonely Doll,'' died on Jan. 25. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Wright's story about Edith, the lonely doll befriended by a pair of teddy bears, was first published in 1957 by Doubleday and illustrated with Ms. Wright's photographs of her own doll.         Ms. Wright wrote eight more books about Edith and the bears.         The first book never lost favor, especially with young girls, and in 1998 Houghton Mifflin reissued it.         Born in Thornhill, Canada, Ms. Wright was the daughter of Ivan Leonard Wright, a theater critic for The Toronto Globe, and Edith Stevenson Wright, a portrait painter.         She graduated from the Laurel School in Cleveland in 1933 and moved to New York, where she worked briefly as an actress and model before a successful career as a photographer.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Maria-Gaetana Matisse, widow of the art dealer Pierre Matisse and a driving force behind the foundation that donated his vast personal archive to the Pierpont Morgan Library, died on April 7 in Manhattan. She was 58.         The cause was kidney failure, said a spokeswoman for the Pierre and Maria-Gaetana Matisse Foundation.         Mrs. Matisse, who was known as Tana, was born in Vienna in 1943. Her father, Karl von Spreti, was a founding member of the Christian Democratic party in Germany after World War II. In 1956 he was appointed ambassador to Luxembourg, and in the 1960's assumed diplomatic assignments in Cuba and Jordan, and Mrs. Matisse spent parts of her childhood in each of those countries.         In 1967, after studying languages in Germany, Mrs. Matisse moved to London and then to New York. After working for several years in the art world, she took a job at the gallery owned by Pierre Matisse, a son of the artist Henri Matisse and a leading international dealer in modern art. In 1974 she and Mr. Matisse, then in his 70's and a widower, married. They divided their time for the next 15 years between New York, Paris and the south of France.         After Mr. Matisse's death and the closing of the gallery in 1989, she and his three children by his first marriage established the Pierre Matisse Foundation. In 1998 the organization gave Mr. Matisse's archive, which included extensive correspondence with Giacometti, Miro, Dubuffet and Henri Matisse, to the Morgan Library, where a portion of it is to be exhibited in March 2002.         In 1999 Mrs. Matisse established the Pierre and Maria-Gaetana Matisse Foundation, which is preparing a catalogue raisonne of the painter Yves Tanguy.         Mrs. Matisse made frequent loans to exhibitions from the collection of modern art she inherited from her husband. She participated in the activities of several museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Morgan Library, where she was a member of the director's round table and the visiting committee of the department of drawings and prints.         She is survived by two brothers, Arardo Graf von Spreti and Alessandro Graf von Spreti, both of Munich.       
         Rosemary Verey, the tough, artistic English gardener who brought the art of clipped boxwoods, laburnum walks and ornamental vegetable gardening to America, died in Chelsea Memorial Hospital in London on May 31. She was 82.         ''She was a marvelous lecturer and she knew so much,'' said Gregory Long, the president of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. He first heard her speak about her famous garden at Barnsley House, a 17th-century rectory in the Cotswolds of England, about 20 years ago at the Horticultural Alliance of the Hamptons.         The four-acre garden was her working laboratory, where she domesticated elements from legendary gardens, like the yellow-flowering laburnum arch at the National Trust's Bodnant Garden, in North Wales, or the ornamental potager, or vegetable garden, at the Chateau de Villandry, in the Loire Valley in France, and made them seem possible for the home gardener.         Mr. Long remembers staring longingly at the slides of the neo-Classical temple that Mrs. Verey's husband, David Verey, an architectural historian, had dismantled in an English park and rebuilt himself, stone by stone.         ''It was a really good lesson in garden-building,'' Mr. Long said. ''None of this redwood pergola stuff from catalogues.''         Years later, when he became the president of the New York Botanical Garden, he would ask her to design an ornamental vegetable garden for the Bronx, complete with cold frames for extending the seasons and herbs that are used by gardeners from other cultures. She was working on the design with the sculptor Simon Verity the week that she died of pneumonia, possibly contracted while flying to Cincinnati and on to Kentucky to work on gardens there.         She was mentor to many American garden leaders like Marco Polo Stufano, who transformed Wave Hill, the public garden in the Riverdale section of the Bronx; Robert Dash, the painter who created the Madoo Conservancy, on the East End of Long Island, and Mr. Long.         Ms. Verey wrote more than a dozen garden books including ''The Classic Garden'' and ''The Garden in Winter,'' which were seminal works for Americans interested in design and sophisticated use of plants, with color and texture year-round.         In her later years, she designed gardens for British celebrities like Prince Charles and Elton John. But her favorite people were gardeners. She often gave them cuttings and seeds from plants she herself had clipped or gathered from such legendary gardens as Gethsemane, outside the city of Jerusalem, or Monet's garden at Giverny.         For more than 20 years she redesigned the grounds around Barnsley House, which is near Cirencester, in Gloucestershire, first with her laburnum arch, which dangles chains of gold flowers over purple alliums in May. Her husband laid the path beneath, a mosaic of colorful stone and pebbles collected from the Pembrokeshire beaches.         ''She had an impeccable eye for color, an ability to embroider gold against purple,'' said Mr. Dash, whose gardens at Madoo, in Sagaponack, N.Y., are widely considered an American work of art. ''She took that grim forbidding aristocratic face off English gardening, and with her charm and her writings, gave it a friendly, domesticated face.''         Mr. Dash and Ms. Verey would occasionally lecture together, playfully arguing over whose garden was more original and just who stole from whom. Did Ms. Verey really swipe her famous laburnum arch from Bodnant?         ''Of course!'' Mr. Dash said, laughing. ''But my laburnum arch bears no resemblance to hers. It's a question of following your own light.''         She studied mathematics and economics at University College in London, but left before earning her degree to marry Mr. Verey in 1939, and proceeded to raise four children, like a proper English gentlewoman of her day. She was an accomplished horsewoman, until she fell in a hunting accident.         ''A horse rolled over on her,'' Mr. Dash said. ''So her husband gave her a book on mandrakes that piqued her interest.'' And a temple just to get her started.         A scholar and perfectionist, she began to read widely, collecting rare first editions usually seen only in the British Museum or the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library. Her redesign project began in 1950, and the grounds opened to the public in 1970. By the time her husband died in 1984, she had started a new career, and a garden that would eventually attract 30,000 visitors a year.         She lectured widely in the United States, where she made five or six trips a year to cities like New York, Seattle, Atlanta or Chicago, or to Indiana and Kentucky. ''Flower shows in winter and the garden clubs in spring and summer,'' Mr. Long said. ''We began to see a lot of laburnum arches in the Hamptons.''         She took many young gardeners under her wing, drilling them in the Latin names of plants, and shooing them off for the day to plunge into the great gardens of England.         ''She would get very cross with us if we didn't speak to the head gardener,'' recalled Mr. Stufano, who with his companion, John Nally, spent many days in the gardens at Barnsley. ''Her garden was a very personal garden. She was always trying new things. It had the feeling of someone who loved plants and she was out in it constantly. She was a wonderful cook and one of my fond memories is being sent out to the garden for a few marrows, or zucchinis, for dinner.''         Long before Mr. Long became president of the New York Botanical Garden, he made a gardener's pilgrimage to Barnsley, to learn some secrets for his place upstate. He had been happily wandering about in the rain, poking about as gardeners do, when he saw her looking out the window.         ''She was so imposing in those days, I was a bit intimidated by her,'' he said. ''I almost wished that she not come out. She showed me Phlomis fruticosa, which is a silver-leafed thing with yellow flowers in the fall. I tried to grow it at home and couldn't.''         Then she locked the gate and invited him in for drinks. Years later, at his own garden upstate, she sat on his compost pile and showed him how to dry the bulbs he had carelessly thrown away. They bloomed the next year.         Her influence was not restricted to naïve Americans. David Wheeler, the editor of Hortus, a garden quarterly in England, who has built, with the artist Simon Dorell, a garden on the edge of Wales, was also nurtured by Ms. Verey, who opened up her library, garden and larder to him.         She was a great networker, or Miss Fix-It, as Mr. Wheeler put it. When he admitted that he would like to meet Prince Charles, she simply rang him up. ''Be here at 5,'' she said.'' ''We're expected at Highgrove at 6.''         Her vegetable garden, a tapestry of ever-changing cabbages, lettuces, strawberries, hop vines and espaliered fruit trees, ''has become a cliché copied around the world,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''But she made us look at growing vegetables in these times of peace and well-being. We were no longer digging for victory and growing rows of vegetables. We could do this decoratively.''         She also reinvented the formal garden, he said, with little parterres of clipped boxwood. ''Those had been part of the English garden since Elizabethan times,'' he said, ''but it had all but washed away with modernism and the 20th century.''         In 1999, Ms. Verey received a special award from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society for her work with English gardens, and the same year, was given the Royal Horticultural Society's most distinguished award, the Victoria Medal of Honor.         She leaves two sons and two daughters. Over the last two years, her son Charles has overseen the gardens, which are still open to the public. ''But the eye is gone,'' Mr. Dash said. ''The artist is gone.''       
         Maria Chabot, who in the 1930's began the popular Indian markets on the Plaza in Santa Fe, N.M., and later became a close associate of the painter Georgia O'Keeffe, died on Monday in an Albuquerque hospital. She was 87.         Her goal was to be a writer, but her varied life included long periods  as a rancher, as well as acting as general contractor for the house O'Keeffe built on a hilltop in Abiquiu, N.M., which in 1998 was designated a national monument. She took the well-known picture of O'Keeffe on the back of a motorcycle titled ''Women Who Rode Away.''         The Saturday markets for Indian crafts eventually became a daily event, and today they draw more than two million people a year, spending millions on pottery, jewelry and other items made by Indians. But when the markets began in the Depression, the Indians were lucky to get a few dollars for pieces that now reside in museums.         The Indians lacked cars and pickup trucks to get to the market, so one of Ms. Chabot's first initiatives was to rent school buses, she said in an interview with The Santa Fe New Mexican in 1996. After the first Indian market, eight of the vendors told her they were using their earnings to install running water in their homes.         Ms. Chabot began the markets in her capacity as executive secretary of the New Mexico Association of Indian Affairs, an advocacy group, with the goal of bringing broader awareness of the artfulness of Indian crafts. At first, the endeavor faced  intense opposition from local businesses.         Later, she helped Indians market their works more broadly by working for the Federal Indian Arts and Crafts Board, setting up cooperative marketing enterprises on reservations throughout the West.         She noticed that many people felt good about paying higher prices for Indian arts. ''Maybe it's guilt for what we did to them,'' she said in an  interview with CNN in 1994.         Ms. Chabot's paternal grandfather was the English ambassador to Mexico in the Mexican Revolution in 1910. His family, including Ms. Chabot's father, fled Mexico City, traveling by horse-drawn wagon. The family settled in San Antonio, where she was born in September 1913.         After graduating from high school at 15, she took a job as a copywriter. She then visited Mexico City to study Spanish and archaeology, making friends there with some New Mexicans. She moved to Santa Fe in 1931 at 18, according to John S. Hart, a neighbor and friend.         In her 20's, she made her way to the East Coast, took a freighter to Europe and spent two years traveling and working in France. She studied art and picked grapes in the vineyards of Provence.         After returning to Santa Fe, she took a job with the federal Works Progress Administration, the Depression-era project to find work for artists and writers. The agency provided her with a Model T Ford and a Brownie camera. Her assignment was to photograph and document Native American and Spanish Colonial arts and crafts.         She met Mary Cabot Wheelwright, the well-known collector of Indian artifacts, when she photographed Ms. Wheelwright's extensive collection. Ms. Wheelwright's collection of Navajo art is now housed in the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in Santa Fe.         For 20 years, Ms. Chabot managed Ms. Wheelwright's ranch at Alcalde, N.M. She hired the labor, supervised the cattle herd and oversaw the care of 1,500 fruit trees. She was president of the local irrigation association, an unheard-of post for a woman at the time, and adjudicated heated disputes over irrigation ditches.         Ms. Wheelwright eventually deeded the ranch to Ms. Chabot, who sold it in the 1960's to move to Albuquerque to care for her elderly mother.         In 1936, Ms. Chabot was named head of the Indian advocacy group. Her idea for the weekly fairs stemmed from visits to Mexico, where she saw that the Indians seemed better off than those north of the border. ''The difference was New Mexico's American Indians did not have a market for their goods and the Indians in Mexico did,'' she said in an interview with The New Mexican in 1996.         Part of her job was visiting pueblos, Indian villages, to encourage women, especially potters, to participate. One was Maria Martinez, the legendary potter of the San Idelfonso pueblo.         After her work with the Indians, Ms. Chabot was introduced to Georgia O'Keeffe by Ms. Wheelwright, beginning a friendship that endured until O'Keeffe's death in 1986.         She spent summers from 1941 through 1944 at O'Keeffe's house on the Ghost Ranch, 125 miles north of Albuquerque. Though her goal was to write, she spent most of her time managing activities at the ranch.         She often accompanied O'Keeffe on the camping trips throughout northern New Mexico on which the artist created many of her paintings. Among them is one called ''Maria Goes to a Party.''         In 1946, Ms. Chabot agreed to manage the rebuilding of an adobe hacienda on a hilltop in Abiquiu, 48 miles northwest of Santa Fe. She supervised the building crew and participated in design decisions for what became O'Keeffe's winter home.         ''I had never found anything as romantic as this beat-up building, a ruin really,'' Ms. Chabot said in an interview with The Albuquerque Journal in 1999 when the house was dedicated as a national landmark. ''It took six months just to get the pigs out of the house.''         She was married for six months in 1961 to Dana K. Bailey, a radio astronomer for the Los Alamos National Laboratory. ''We were much better as friends than as husband and wife,'' she told Mr. Hart, her neighbor.         She has no immediate survivors. A book of the hundreds of letters exchanged between her and O'Keeffe, with commentary, will be published posthumously, Mr. Hart said.         He said that Ms. Chabot was often astounded about the mistaken judgments of outsiders. One author said about how much the two women enjoyed riding horses. Ms. Chabot told her friend that she had never seen  O'Keeffe on a horse.         In 1996, when she was named a ''Living Treasure'' of Santa Fe, Ms. Chabot was asked about her wide experiences. ''You just live your life,'' she said, ''you don't try to do anything.''       
         Grace Borgenicht Brandt, a longtime New York art dealer, died Thursday in Manhattan. She was 86  and had homes in Manhattan and Watermill, N.Y.         Ms. Borgenicht was a tall woman whose carriage and general equanimity were almost queenly. She saw herself as both a friend and protector of artists, and with her third husband, the painter Will Brandt, whom she married in 1960, she oversaw a busy social scene in both her Manhattan and Long Island homes.         She began her gallery in the early 1950's as one of a handful of New York art dealers to represent living American artists when most American collectors were buying European art. Although she would eventually show several European artists, she remained most strongly identified with a stylistically varied group of American artists, most of whom she represented for several decades, most prominently Milton Avery, but also Ilya Bolotowsky, Jimmy Ernst, Wolf Kahn, Gabor Peterdi, Leonard Baskin, Edward Corbett and Ralston Crawford.         Ms. Borgenicht was born Grace Lubell in New York City on Jan. 25 1915, and attended the Calhoun School. She became interested in art at an early age and enrolled in the New College at Columbia University, where the experimental program enabled her to study in Paris, in the studio of the painter André L'Hote, in 1934. Returning to New York, she studied printmaking at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 and earned a master's degree in art education from Columbia. In 1938 she married Jack Borgenicht, a dress manufacturer. The marriage ended in divorce, as did a subsequent one to Norman Sachs Jr.         She entered the New York art world as a painter, with her first solo show at the Laurel Gallery on East 57th Street in 1947. She soon became a key backer of its owner, Chris Ritter, helping to publish a series of print portfolios, starting with one of five etchings by Avery. In 1950 Ritter decided to close Laurel, and the artists Ernst and Peterdi, whom he also represented, urged Ms. Borgenicht to open a gallery on her own. The Grace Borgenicht Gallery opened on 57th Street in May 1951, with a show of Ernst's work.         Ms. Borgenicht held her first Avery exhibition the following October, represented the artist until his death in 1965 and then represented his estate until 1995, when she closed her gallery. She devoted more than 30 exhibitions to his work. During the early 1950's she also represented Gertrude Greene, José de Rivera, Adja Yunkers, James Brooks and Roy Gussow. In 1956, she moved to 1018 Madison Avenue and in 1981 to 724 Fifth Avenue. She continued to paint into the 1950's, was included in the 1954 Whitney Annual and had a solo show at the Martha Jackson Gallery in 1955.         In late 1954, she began an association with Margarete Schultz, the widow of the publisher and dealer Karl Heinz Schultz. Ms. Schultz organized an impressive series of exhibitions of works by the German Expressionists as well as Max Ernst, Wols and Jean Arp. Through her, the gallery represented the estate of Max Beckmann during the 1980's and early 1990's, organizing seven shows in 12 years.         During the 1980's and 90's, the Borgenicht Gallery gave first solo shows to young artists like Mark Tansey, Michael Zwack, Mark Innerst and Jane Rosen; began to represent Janet Fish; and held several shows of the work of Stuart Davis and Charles Biederman, American artists from earlier generations.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Borgenicht is survived by her sister, Shirley Black Cash of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Westport, Conn.; three daughters from her first marriage, Jan Schwartz of Los Gatos, Calif., Berta B. Kerr of Wilmington, Del., and Lois Borgenicht of Baltimore; a stepdaughter, Isabella Brandt Johansen of New York City; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Fanny Brennan, an American painter of small, meticulously executed surrealist still lifes, who spent her childhood in the legendary circle of artists and writers gathered around Sara and Gerald Murphy in Paris, died on July 22 at a hospital in Manhattan. She was 80.         Ms. Brennan was born in 1921 in Paris, where her parents, Richard and Alice Lee Myers, were well-known figures in the city's expatriate art community. The Murphys were close family friends. Educated in Europe and the United States, she enrolled in art school in Paris in 1938, met Tristan Tzara, had her portrait drawn by Giacometti and taught Picasso how to play Chinese checkers at the Cafe Flore.         When war broke out, she left for New York, where she worked for Harpers Bazaar and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1944, she was hired by the Office of War Information to work in Europe. She married the chief of its graphics and exhibitions division, Francis Brennan, in 1946.         Even as a student, Ms. Brennan worked on an unusually small scale. Most of her paintings were three or four inches in diameter. As a young artist in Manhattan, she found that the bathroom of her apartment was the ideal size for a studio. She stopped painting nearly 20 years after her children were born, but began again in 1970 with playful, ingeniously composed images, which often combined domestic objects -- needles, buttons, books -- with panoramic landscapes.         In 1941, she was included in two shows at the Wakefield Bookshop gallery in Manhattan, run by Betty Parsons. Beginning in 1973, she had three solo exhibitions with Parsons, then several with Coe Kerr Gallery. Her work is represented by Salander-O'Reilly Gallery. In 1990, a book of her work, ''Skyshades,'' appeared with an introduction by Calvin Tomkins.         Ms. Brennan is survived by two sons, Richard Lee Brennan of Manhattan and Christopher Herrick Brennan of Feasterville, Pa., and a sister, Lee M. Wrenn of Orcas Island, Wash.       
         Elaine Dannheisser, a longtime collector of contemporary art who gave most of her collection to the Museum of Modern Art, died on Sunday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton.         Her death was announced by a spokeswoman for the Modern, who said that she had died in her sleep.         During the 1980's in particular, Mrs. Dannheisser was a fixture on the international art circuit who rarely missed an exhibition, art fair or auction. She was famous for her malapropisms, consistently referring to the Reina Sofia, a prominent museum of modern art in Madrid, as the Sophia Loren and once telling a friend that she did not approve of ''unanimous sex.''         Mrs. Dannheisser considered her holdings ''a living collection'' and continually sold off and bought new works, often after pursuing them a great while. Although her taste tended to follow existing trends, she became increasingly drawn to what she called ''tough'' art as her self-education as a collector continued.         Elaine Fansling was born in Brooklyn in 1923. Her father was a florist, and her mother was a painter who frequently took her daughter to museums. She studied painting at the Art Students League, began working as an illustrator and continued to paint until her interest in collecting took over.         In 1953, she married Werner Dannheisser, a refugee from Nazi Germany and an owner of a successful engraving company who dabbled in collecting. With her drive and his money, the couple progressed from modern to contemporary, buying works by Picasso, Leger and Rouault, and then Dubuffet, Rothko, Rauschenberg and Agnes Martin. She often said she wished she could have lived in Paris when Gertrude Stein did, but gradually realized that she could be equally involved with the art of her own time.         Mr. Dannheisser sold his business in 1981, just as the East Village art scene was taking off and contemporary-art collecting became a very competitive sport. Mrs. Dannheisser bought a building on Duane Street in TriBeCa for the display of the collection and, with an allowance from her husband, began actively purchasing works by neo-Expressionist and graffiti artists.         In the mid-1980's, she decided these works were not demanding enough. She sold many of them and, with the profits, became one of the first collectors to buy the work of emerging artists like Robert Gober, Jeff Koons and Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and, later, Matthew Barney. The collection became international in scope and more Minimalist, Conceptualist and installationist in orientation, with most artists represented by at least two, and sometimes as many as 10, works.         Unlike many collectors of contemporary art, she did not seek out friendships with artists, saying that knowing them could cloud her judgment. One of her few artist friends was Jim Hodges, who worked as caretaker and preparator at her Duane Street building in return for free studio space in the building's basement.         Mrs. Dannheisser's involvement with museums also had phases. She served on the boards of the New Museum of Contemporary Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum before settling on the Modern.         She joined the Modern's painting and sculpture committee in 1990. In 1996 she became a trustee at the Modern and also gave the museum 75 works by 28 artists, one of the largest gifts in its history. Among other things, it included works by Mr. Gober, Mr. Koons and Gonzalez-Torres as well as Bruce Nauman, Sigmar Polke, Richard Serra, Cindy Sherman, Thomas Struth and Joseph Beuys.         In the 1990's, Mrs. Dannheisser's collection had quite a bit of competition from her avid interest in bridge, but she continued to buy, and to sell, art until her death.         Her husband died in 1992, and there are no immediate survivors. A spokeswoman for the Museum of Modern Art said yesterday that Mrs. Dannheisser bequeathed additional works by Willem de Kooning, Richard Prince, Cady Noland and Ashley Bickerton to the Modern, along with a cash gift of $2 million. All her other assets will go to establishing the Elaine Dannheisser Foundation.         Correction:  November 9, 2001, Friday  An obituary of the art collector Elaine Dannheisser on Oct. 30 misstated her maiden name. It was Hanfling, not Fansling.       
         Jacqueline Hudson, a landscape painter, graphic artist and benefactor of the arts, died Wednesday at her home in Damariscotta, Me. She was 91.         Ms. Hudson was born in Cambridge, Mass., a daughter of the artist Eric Hudson. She grew up in Manhattan and Monhegan Island, Me., surrounded by her father's artist friends, including George Bellows, Robert Henri, Edward Hopper and Rockwell Kent. They often painted on Monhegan, where the Hudson family had its summer home.         After studying at the School of the National Academy and the Art Students League in New York, Ms. Hudson exhibited her work at the American Watercolor Society and the National Arts Club in New York, the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Me., the Portland Museum of Art and other museums and galleries throughout the United States.         She was known primarily for her paintings and lithographs of the Maine coast and, especially, of Monhegan, where she spent almost all of her 91 summers. Through the years, she amassed a vast collection of paintings by Bellows, Henri, her father and others, which she gave to the Monhegan Museum as a memorial to her family.         An exhibition of her work is scheduled to open as planned at the Round Top Center of the Arts in Damariscotta on Thursday.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Dorothy Dunnett, a Scottish historical novelist whose weighty works about Renaissance life attracted swarms of devoted fans in the United States, died on Friday in Edinburgh. She was 78.         Her best-known works, ''The Lymond Chronicles'' in six books and ''The House of Niccolò'' in eight, have inspired conventions, fan magazines, among them a quarterly called Kisses and Marzipan, and several Internet forums packed with lively speculation ranging from points of history to the pedigrees of her characters and the subtly wrought links between the heroes of the two series.         Mrs. Dunnett, more properly Dorothy, Lady Dunnett, tempted her fans with buried clues and red herrings that keep them reading and rereading the books.         Anne Malcolm, writing in the The New York Times Book Review last year, said the chronicles, although not widely known nearly 40 years after the first volume appeared, ''are almost certainly destined to be counted among the classics of popular fiction.''         ''Identifying just what it is that sets them apart from other works of historical romance is difficult,'' Ms. Malcolm wrote, although she cited a ''painter's eye for gorgeous detail'' and a ''vocabulary that sometimes outstrips the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.''         Ms. Malcolm described the protagonist of the first series, the fictional Francis Crawford of Lymond, a 16th-century Scot, as the perfect romantic hero, ''impossibly charming, elegant and accomplished; a brilliant swordsman; an inspired leader of men'' who was ''also highhanded, cynical and dangerous'' and not above employing a bit of violence when it suits his often veiled purposes.         For the uninitiated, the uncomprehending or those whose linguistic spectrum spans fewer than half a dozen languages, there is a guide to the minutiae of Mrs. Dunnett's work, ''The Dorothy Dunnett Companion'' by Elspeth Morrison, (Vintage Books, 2001), from which the reader can learn the common punishment for adultery (removal of the nose, by biting or other means) or a simple formula for hair dye involving leeches marinated in vinegar.         The companion offers a glimpse of the laborious process of writing the many-layered historical novels, which delve into the art, culture, manners and science of the times. Although Mrs. Dunnett said the novels drew on her own background in music, art and sailing, they also involved a great deal of travel in search of authentic detail as well as dizzying amounts of library research.         Until shortly before her death she was helping Ms. Morrison complete a second companion volume.         Mrs. Dunnett was born Dorothy Halliday on Aug. 25, 1923, in Dunfermline, Scotland. She grew up largely in Edinburgh and was at school at the same time as Muriel Spark at James Gillespie's School for Girls, the model for the academy in Ms. Spark's ''Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.''         She said it had never been her intention to become a writer of fiction. She studied music and art and took a job in Britain's Ministry of Information.         In 1946 she married her boss, Alastair Dunnett, and the couple moved to Glasgow, where Mrs. Dunnett was employed by the Board of Trade and continued her studies in singing and painting.         She had become a professional portrait painter when her husband, a banker, author, journalist and eventually an oil company executive, suggested she write a novel. He said: ''Make it a series. They're popular at the moment,'' she wrote. ''So (always cooperative) I did.''         Her first novel was rejected by five publishers in Britain, leading her husband to suggest she seek publication in the United States. ''They like long books in America,'' she quoted him as saying. The book was accepted with the proviso that it be cut, and ''The Game of Kings,'' the opening book of ''The Lymond Chronicles,'' was published by Putnam in 1961.         The other books in the Lymond series are ''Queen's Play,'' 1964, ''The Disorderly Knights,'' 1966, ''Pawn in Frankincense,'' 1969, ''The Ringed Castle,'' 1971, and ''Checkmate,'' 1975.         An idea of the complexity of Mrs. Dunnett's books can be seen in the list of characters, which, in ''Niccolò Rising,'' 1986, the first book in that series, takes up four pages peppered with historical kings, their mistresses, Medicis and merchants as well as invented characters.         The Niccolò series, about Nicholas de Fleury of Burgundy, a merchant, also includes ''The Spring of the Ram,'' 1987, ''Race of Scorpions,'' 1989, ''Scales of Gold,'' 1991, ''The Unicorn Hunt,'' 1993, ''To Lie With Lions,'' 1995, ''Caprice and Rondo,'' 1997, and ''Gemini,'' 2000.         She was also the author of a historical novel about Macbeth, ''King Hereafter,'' published in 1982, and seven mystery novels featuring Johnson Johnson, an agent in the guise of a portrait-painting yachtsman. The Johnson Johnson books, some published under the name Dorothy Halliday and released under varying titles, were originally known as ''Dolly and the Singing Bird,'' 1968, ''Dolly and the Cookie Bird,'' 1970, ''Dolly and the Doctor Bird,'' 1971, ''Dolly and the Starry Bird,'' 1973, ''Dolly and the Nanny Bird.'' 1976, and ''Dolly and the Bird of Paradise.'' 1983.         She collaborated with her husband and David Paterson on a work of nonfiction, ''The Scottish Highlands,'' published in 1988.         Mrs. Dunnett's husband died in 1998. She is survived by her sons, Ninian and Mungo, and two grandchildren.       
         Pauline Campanelli, a painter whose super-realist still lifes were so popular that their sales were rivaled only by those of Andrew Wyeth among living artists, died on Nov. 29 at her home in Pohatcong Township, N.J., a few miles south of Phillipsburg. She was 58.         Her husband, Dan, also a painter, said she died of complications from childhood polio. She had been seriously ill for nearly three years.         Her work was seldom reviewed; and when it was, the reviews generally ran in obscure publications. It was absent from prestigious art museums and expensive galleries. But in the nation's kitchens, living rooms and dining rooms, her precise, loving depictions of household objects were commonplace.         Her work recalled the Shakers in its simplicity and spirituality. Her later paintings were characterized by stark white backgrounds.         Hundreds of thousands of her prints were sold through mail-order catalogs, furniture stores and galleries specializing in prints and posters. Sales of her most popular picture, ''Wild Rose Berries,'' have exceeded 600,000.         ''She outsells Picasso,'' said Julie Fleischmann, president of Shorewood Fine Art, a unit of the New York Graphic Society, which licenses art and sells prints by both the Campanellis and Picasso.         Mrs. Campanelli described herself ''not as an artist who paints but as a person who lives.'' Her paintings, she said, were not creations ''but communications of the essence of that experience.''         She lived with her husband in a stone farmhouse they restored; it is included in the National Register of Historic Places. And despite needing a wheelchair to get around, she pursued dozens of homespun crafts.         Each year she canned 400 jars of fruit from the 39 trees the couple had planted. A talented quilter, cross-stitcher and yarn spinner, she used antique spinning wheels to turn fleece from her four Dorset sheep into yarn that she colored with dyes made from her homegrown herbs. The primitive American antiques she collected were frequent subjects for her paintings.         ''These are not the nostalgic relics of a long forgotten past, but objects that Dan and I live with every day,'' she said.         Her sensibility was decidedly not that of a folk artist. ''Whether it's a swan decoy or a quilt or a chair, I'm just looking at abstract shapes: rectangles, triangles, S-shapes, tall things, round things,'' she said in an interview in the journal U.S. Art in 1989. ''I am very much influenced by Mondrian's compositions.''         Another influence on her art was her belief in paganism. She wrote books, some with her husband, about witchcraft and pagan rituals and tried to bring her appreciation of ancient, pre-Christian ways to her rustic life as well as to her art.         Her book ''Ancient Ways: Reclaiming Pagan Traditions'' (Llewellyn, 1991) told how pagan cultures celebrated holidays, and it sold more than 40,000 copies. The Halloween section not only gave advice on charms and spells, crystal balls and using a tambourine to contact spirits but also gave a recipe for pumpkin bread. The May Day section said washing one's face with morning dew on that holiday would preserve a youthful complexion.         Pauline Eblé was born in the Bronx on Jan. 25, 1943. She was stricken with polio at 3 and was in an iron lung for a year and in the hospital for another year and a half. She was tutored at home and at 13 was studying college textbooks.         She was fascinated with the way her father, Joseph, a professional photographer, could condense three-dimensional reality into two-dimensional images, but she was not initially interested in art. She wanted to be a naturalist and illustrate the species she hoped to discover.         After finishing high school in Ridgewood, N.J., she attended the Ridgewood School of Art. She began selling still lifes while in school.         In 1969 she married Mr. Campanelli. According to a biography posted on the Llewellyn Web site, they were already practicing witchcraft. They lived in a $60-a-month furnished room painted bubble-gum pink and made a bare living, $2,000 the first year, from teaching and sidewalk art shows. Through competitions, bigger art shows and interest from galleries in the area, they gradually got their heads above water.         She earned a reputation for oil paintings of homey objects, and he drew attention for his watercolors of old mills and other historic scenes. In 1976 they bought a stone house built in 1835, naming it and the three surrounding acres Flying Witch Farm. Because they could not get a mortgage and had no savings, they had to restore the sagging, abandoned structure themselves.         He used antique tools because the house had no electricity to plug in power tools. She climbed down from her wheelchair and refinished the floors on her hands and knees.         They filled their new home with antiques like Cromwell chairs from the 1660's and a William and Mary side table from around 1690. Mrs. Campanelli copied a needlepoint design for the Cromwell chairs from museum slides.         Mr. Campanelli built a garage for the three Model A's he restored and a building to house his wife's ''natural history museum,'' which included at least 10,000 seashells. They pressed grapes in an 1860 fruit press and made 100 gallons of wine a year. They occasionally held what they called Colonial days for their friends, entertaining with a quilting bee, a black-powder shoot, a tomahawk throw and Colonial food.         Mrs. Campanelli, who is survived by her husband and father, painted standing on crutches in an 8-by-10-foot studio that used to be a bedroom. The light streamed through a rippled north window, the sort of light she thought Rembrandt liked.         She worked very slowly, averaging about six paintings a year. She meticulously showed each thread in a ball of yarn. She painted any flowers last, in order not to be hurried.         The Campanellis had long thought that a ghost inhabited Flying Witch Farm: that of Mary Insley Hunt, a member of the family that long owned the place.         ''I think Pauline's going to be the next one,'' her husband suggested. ''She wanted to be.''       
         Naomi Schor, a literary critic and theorist who combined psychoanalytic theory, avant-garde philosophy and feminism to come up with quirky, often startling insights into 19th-century French authors including Flaubert and Zola, died on Dec. 2 at a New Haven hospital. She was 58 and lived in Hamden, Conn.         The cause was a brain hemorrhage, said her sister, Mira Schor.         Dr. Schor, the Benjamin F. Barge professor of French at Yale University, brought French psychoanalytic and deconstructive theory to French studies in the United States, said Joan W. Scott, a professor of social science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.         As one example of how this worked, she cited Dr. Schor's essay on fetishism in the novels of George Sand, the cigar-smoking, cross-dressing novelist who was the most widely celebrated female writer in France in the 1800's. Dr. Schor found many ways that women in Sand's novels used fetishes, which are usually considered a male preoccupation.         Dr. Schor also used unconventional approaches to discover atypical ways in which the female body was represented in 19th-century French literature. She argued that when Zola depicted the uncontrollable passions of crowds, he used feminine means to express them.         Dr. Schor, who once wrote that she hoped to become ''an intellectual bad girl,'' delighted in controversy. For example, in an article published last January in GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, she explored the notion of male lesbianism, suggesting ways that Flaubert and other male authors seemed to speak from a lesbian perspective.         In her book ''Reading in Detail: Aesthetics and the Feminine'' (Methuen, 1987), she argued that men, in taking the universal view, have historically tended to de-emphasize the importance of details. She suggested that details were considered ornamental or mundane, and as such, were deemed women's stuff.         But at the same time, theorists like Jacques Derrida, the French philosopher whom Dr. Schor knew and interpreted in her writings, were coming to consider traditional visions of universal truth irrelevant. To them, the truth was in the meaning of details.         ''Does the triumph of detail signify a triumph of the feminine with which it has long been linked?'' she asked. ''Or has the detail achieved new prestige by being taken over by the masculine, triumphing at the very moment when it ceases to be associated with the feminine?''         She relentlessly challenged conventional understanding in her teaching and writing as well as in a feminist journal she helped found in 1989 at the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women at Brown University. Even the name of the journal -- ''differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies'' -- reflects her idiosyncratic outlook. She suggested putting the ''s'' in italics to make people think. (The lowercase ''d'' was chosen by graphic designers.)         ''She had this amazing way of making the familiar look unfamiliar,'' said Elizabeth Weed, the other founding editor.         Dr. Schor was born on Oct. 10, 1943, in Manhattan. Her father, Ilya, was a painter, goldsmith and artist of Judaica. Her mother, Resia, was also an artist. They had fled from Poland to Paris to escape the Nazis, eventually reaching New York, by way of Lisbon, on Dec. 3, 1941.         Her parents moved in a cosmopolitan circle of intellectuals and artists in New York and spoke French, which was Dr. Schor's first language, at home.         Her public school teachers told her parents they doubted she would be able to read, a problem solved when her parents bought her eyeglasses. They placed her at the Lycée Français, where she remained through high school.         Her sister said she devoured books and seldom went outdoors, leading neighbors to think that the family had only one daughter. Already, she was aspiring to lead a life of the mind. She wrote in an essay for The Los Angeles Times in 1986 that this was not easy.         ''For a girl it was an act of courage, not to say folly,'' she wrote. ''It meant certain unpopularity, even ostracism.''         She graduated from Barnard College, where she majored in English, and received her doctorate in French at Yale, where her first published articles were written not only on French but also in French.         ''I knew that my advantage really lay in French,'' she said. ''When I went to graduate school, it never occurred to me to do anything else.''         Her literary and philosophical interests always seemed to be slightly ahead of the newest academic currents, said Sharon Marcus, an English professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a former student of Dr. Schor's.         ''She was always interested in charting the territory that was just a little more complicated than what everyone else was saying,'' Dr. Marcus said.         Her 5 books and more than 50 academic articles made her the sort of star that prestigious universities compete to recruit. She taught at Brown, Duke and Harvard.         In 1999 she joined the faculty at Yale, where her husband, Howard Bloch, teaches in the French department. In addition to her husband and sister, she is survived by her mother, who lives in Manhattan.         Dr. Schor once said she had love affairs with intellectual ''ism's,'' including fetishism, realism, idealism, universalism and feminism, her favorite.         She organized a symposium titled ''Man and Beast,'' which was to have taken place the weekend after she died. Scholars from many disciplines had planned to examine similarities and differences between humans and animals, perhaps under the rubric of speciesism.       
         Mercedes Matter, a painter, teacher and the chief founder of the New York Studio School in Greenwich Village, died on Tuesday. She was 87  and lived in East Hampton on Long Island.         Mrs. Matter was born Mercedes Carles in New York in 1913. Her father, the American modernist Arthur B. Carles, had studied with Matisse. Her mother, Mercedes de Cordoba, was a model for Edward Steichen. Ms. Matter grew up in Philadelphia, New York and Europe.         She began painting under her father's supervision at age 6, and studied art at Bennett College in Millbrook, N.Y., and then in New York City with Maurice Sterne, Alexander Archipenko and Hans Hofmann.         In the late 1930's, she was an original member of the American Abstract Artists organization and worked for the federal Works Progress Administration, assisting Fernand Léger on his mural for the French Line passenger ship company. Léger introduced her to Herbert Matter, the Swiss graphic designer and photographer, whom she married in 1939.         The Matters were active in the emerging New York art scene and also traveled frequently to Europe. Their closest friends included Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, Franz Kline, Philip Guston, Alexander Calder and Willem de Kooning. They were also close to Alberto Giacometti, who was an important artistic role model for Mrs. Matter and a frequent photographic subject for her husband.         Beginning in 1953, Mrs. Matter taught at the Philadelphia College of Art (now University of the Arts), Pratt Institute and New York University. Based on her teaching experiences she wrote an article for Art News in 1963 titled ''What's Wrong with U.S. Art Schools?'' In it, she lamented the phasing out of the extended studio classes required to initiate ''that painfully slow education of the senses,'' which she considered an artist's life work.         The article prompted a group of Pratt students to ask her to form a school based on her ideas, which led, in 1964, to the founding of the New York Studio School. Originally in a loft on Broadway, the school gained almost immediate support from the Kaplan Fund, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Ford Foundation. It granted no degrees, had only studio classes and emphasized drawing from life. Its teachers, chosen by the students, included the artists Guston, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Charles Cajori, Louis Finkelstein and Sidney Geist; the art historian Meyer Schapiro; and the composer Morton Feldman.         The Matters lived on Macdougal Alley, where Mr. Matter had a studio in one of the eight small buildings that had housed what is now the Whitney Museum of American Art. It was his idea that the buildings would make a perfect home for the Studio School, which bought them from the Whitney family in 1967.         Mrs. Matter practiced as she preached, spending months, and sometimes years, working on drawings and paintings that usually began as still lifes and evolved into near-abstractions animated by thatched lines that attested to her her devotion to the work of Giacometti and Cézanne.         In addition to her art and teaching, she wrote articles on artists, including Hofmann, Kline and Giacometti. She wrote the text for a book of her husband's photographs of Giacometti, published in 1987, four years after his death.         Mrs. Matter had her first solo show in New York at the Tanager Gallery in 1956. Her most recent was a double bill of drawings, shown in the Studio School's gallery, and paintings, at Salander O'Reilly Galleries. She taught at the school until last year.         She is survived by her son, Alexander, and a grandson, Jordan Matter, both of New York.
