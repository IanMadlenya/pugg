        Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         The star's death was announced by Paul Mills, a longtime friend and film producer, who said she had been ill for some time, particularly with respiratory problems, and had a stroke more than three years ago.         The actress had lived quietly in London for more than 30 year after being hounded for decades by photographers and reporters who publicized her marriages to Mickey Rooney, the band leader Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra and her flamboyant escapades with matadors, international playboys and writers.         Working on Her Memoirs         Miss Gardner, who had been completing her memoirs, said in a recent interview, ''If you don't tell your side, the self-appointed biographers step in, adding to the abysmal lies.''         The actress, whose green eyes, chestnut hair, high cheekbones and sensual lips made her eminently photogenic, was known for femme fatale portrayals.         She brought a tigresslike seductiveness and a husky-voiced irreverence to roles as worldly, devil-may-care women, becoming adept at playing exotic vamps and free-spirited protagonists, as in films of such Ernest Hemingway stories as ''The Killers'' (1946), ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' (1952) and ''The Sun Also Rises'' (1957). In the loosely autobiographical ''Barefoot Contessa'' (1954), she played a fiery dancer who becomes a movie star.         Praise for Later Roles         She portrayed torch singers in ''The Hucksters'' (1947) and ''Show Boat'' (1951); an irrepressible playgirl in ''Mogambo'' (a 1953 role for which she won an Academy Award nomination); a tormented Anglo-Indian in ''Bhowani Junction'' (1956); a thoughtful cosmopolitan in ''On the Beach'' (1959), and a blowsy innkeeper in the film of Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' (1964).         Although she was mainly decorative in most of her early roles and many reviewers said her acting range was narrow, she won wide praise for many later performances. Nonetheless, she consistently denigrated her talent, remarking to a 1985 interviewer: ''Listen, honey, I was never really an actress. None of us kids who came from M-G-M were. We were just good to look at.''         Poverty in Childhood         Ava Lavinia Gardner was born on Dec. 24, 1922, in Grabton, a poor community outside Smithfield, N.C., to Jonas Bailey Gardner, a tobacco and cotton farmer, and Mary Elizabeth Gardner. Her father died when she was 16, and her mother then managed a boardinghouse.         Her childhood was marked by poverty and a wardrobe so meager it prompted ridicule from schoolmates. She took commercial courses in high school, and an older brother paid her tuition so she could continue secretarial studies for a year at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson, N.C.         At 18, she visited her eldest sister, Beatrice, in New York City, on a journey that transformed her life. Her brother-in-law, Larry Tarr, a commercial photographer, took a portfolio of pictures of her and sent them to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She was given a screen test in New York that was made without sound because of her heavy Southern drawl. The 1941 test won her a seven-year M-G-M contract and intensive diction lessons as well as a starlet's standard classes in acting, calisthenics, makeup and fashion.         Her next five years were notable for tiny roles in a score of mostly forgettable movies, a blizzard of publicity pictures - and two brief marriages, to Mickey Rooney and Artie Shaw. Each marriage ended in separation after less than a year and finally in divorce.         The 69-year-old Mr. Rooney, upon learning of her death, said yesterday, ''My heart is broken with the loss of my first love.''         Stardom at 24         Miss Gardner later attributed the brevity of the first marriage to the couple's youth and to other people's domination of their lives. A press agent invariably accompanied them, even on their honeymoon. Of the second marriage, Miss Gardner said, Mr. Shaw insisted she read scores of books and insulted her intelligence in public.         Despite the personal setbacks, Miss Gardner won stardom at the age of 24 as a gun moll who betrays her lover (Burt Lancaster in his film debut) in ''The Killers.'' Other early starring roles were in a musical, ''One Touch of Venus'' (1948); a melodrama, ''The Great Sinner'' (1949), and a fantasy, ''Pandora and the Flying Dutchman'' (1951).         Miss Gardner's third marriage, to Frank Sinatra in 1951, was one of the most publicized Hollywood unions of the time. The couple had bitter public quarrels and separated in 1953 but tried a series of brief cross-country, trans-Atlantic reconciliations. They were finally divorced in 1957.         In a 1986 book, ''His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra,'' Kitty Kelley attributed the following quotation to the actress:         ''You start with love, or what you think is love, and then comes the work. I guess you have to be mature and grown up to know how to work at it. But I was the youngest of seven kids and was always treated like the baby, and I liked it and played the baby. Now I'm having a helluva time growing up.''         On TV as Nero's Mother         In 1958 Miss Gardner left M-G-M and became an independent actress, earning up to $400,000 a movie, most of them made in Europe. Her films included ''55 Days at Peking'' (1963), ''Seven Days in May'' (1964), ''Mayerling'' (1969), ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean'' (1972), ''The Blue Bird'' (1976) and a handful of disaster epics.         She did not appear on television until 1985, portraying Agrippina, Nero's scheming mother, in ''A.D.,'' a lavish mini-series about the first Christian century, and reviewers hailed her as still very much a star. Asked about her reluctance to accept television roles, she replied: ''Television is a lovely thing for people of my age to watch, but it's for young people to make. The kids were very nice to me.''         In the 1950's, the actress was deeply in love with Spain, bullfighting and, reportedly, a succession of bullfighters.         Her celebrated candor made her friends and enemies. When she arrived in Australia to make ''On the Beach,'' she enraged many people by remarking, ''I'm here to make a film about the end of the world, and this sure is the place for it.''         Sympathetic interviewers described her as an outgoing, earthy woman who had a lively sense of humor, particularly about herself, and deep family loyalty. Looking ahead to retirement, Miss Gardner once remarked: ''When I'm old and gray, I want to have a house by the sea. And paint. With a lot of wonderful chums, good music and booze around. And a damn good kitchen to cook in.''         Survivors include two sisters, Beatrice, of Hollywood, and Myra, of Smithfield, N.C., and nieces and nephews.         At her wish, she is to be buried beside her parents in North Carolina.         From a Moll to Guinevere         Ava Gardner appeared in about 60 movies, starting in 1942 and ending in 1981. These were the films for which she was most noted:         The Killers         The Hucksters         One Touch of Venus         Show Boat         Pandora and the Flying Dutchman         The Snows of Kilimanjaro         Mogambo         Knights of the Round Table         The Barefoot Contessa         Bhowani Junction         The Sun Also Rises         The Naked Maja         On the Beach         The Night of the Iguana         The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean         The Cassandra Crossing         The Kidnapping of the President

Peggy van Praagh, an English dancer, ballet mistress and teacher, died in Melbourne, Australia, on Jan. 15. She was 79 years old and had been in poor health for several years.         Miss van Praagh, who was born in London, trained in ballet, mime and modern dance with Margaret Craske, Lydia Sokolova, Vera Volkova and Agnes de Mille, among others. As a soloist with the Ballet Rambert from 1933 to 1938 and a principal dancer with Antony Tudor's London Ballet in 1938, she created important roles in some of Mr. Tudor's signature works, including Episode in His Past in ''Lilac Garden'' and the Russian Ballerina in ''Gala Performance.''         Miss van Praagh inaugurated the popular wartime Lunch-Hour Ballet in London in 1940. She joined the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet the following year, and was appointed ballet mistress of the junior company, the Sadler's Wells Theater Ballet, in 1946, serving as its assistant director from 1951 to 1955. She also was ballet producer for British Broadcasting Corporation Television from 1949 to 1955.         Invited to take over the artistic direction of the Borovansky Ballet in Australia, she made a curtain speech urging national support for Australian ballet and was asked to head the newly reorganized Australian Ballet, which she directed from 1962 to 1974.         Miss van Praagh was the author of ''How I Became a Dancer'' and, with Peter Brinson, of the influential book ''The Art of Choreography'' (1963). She was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1966 and a Dame of the British Empire in 1970.

Ellen Neuwald Sherman, a literary agent, died of lung cancer Tuesday at her home in Laguna Hills, Calif. She was 74 years old.         Mrs. Sherman, who was known professionally as Ellen Neuwald, was born in Berlin and came to the United States in 1939. She worked in Hollywood as a social secretary to Irene Selznick, George Cukor, Ingrid Bergman and others.         In the 1950's, she assisted the Broadway producer Saint-Subber before becoming an agent specializing in handling young writers and directors.         She is survived by a daughter, Ruth Falcon, of Topanga, Calif.

        Victoria Crandall, a theatrical producer who for three decades staged Broadway musicals for summer audiences in Maine, died Sunday at a hospital in New York. She was 81 years old.         Victoria Crandall, a theatrical producer who for three decades staged Broadway musicals for summer audiences in Maine, died Sunday at a hospital in New York. She was 81 years old.         Miss Crandall, a resident of Wiscasset, Me., had been in New York to cast roles for the Maine State Music Theater's coming season.         Miss Crandall, a former concert pianist, in 1959 founded the Brunswick Summer Playhouse, which later became the Brunswick Music Theater. The name was changed again two years ago to the Maine State Music Theater, with Miss Crandall serving as executive director and artistic director.         The theater, on the Bowdoin College campus, rejected packaged shows in favor of originally designed productions. Over the last three decades, Miss Crandall staged 186 productions with audiences totaling more than 1.5 million people.         Born in Cleveland to Swedish immigrants, Miss Crandall was a graduate of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. She went on to become a rehearsal pianist, working with performers like Ethel Merman and Jimmy Durante and with composers and lyricists like Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Dorothy James Roberts, a writer best known for her retelling of ancient Arthurian, Irish and Icelandic myths in historical romances, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 96 and lived in Palo Alto.         Dorothy James Roberts, a writer best known for her retelling of ancient Arthurian, Irish and Icelandic myths in historical romances, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 96 and lived in Palo Alto.         Miss Roberts, the daughter of a West Virginia oil producer, was the author of 14 books, the most popular of which was ''The Enchanted Cup,'' based on Malory's version of the legend of Tristan and Isolde. It was a Book of the Month Club selection in 1953.         Among her books acclaimed by critics was ''Fire in the Ice,'' based on the Icelandic Njal's Saga and described by Orville Prescott in The New York Times in 1961 as ''somber and splendid.'' The reviewer wrote that Miss Roberts ''imposed order on the disorderly mass of saga material'' by telling the legend from the point of view of one key character, Hallgerda Hoskuldsdottir, and eliminating ''many irrelevant scenes, superflouous characters and tiresome genealogical pedigrees.''         Among her other works were ''Launcelot, My Brother,'' ''A Durable Fire,'' ''Kinsmen of the Grail,'' ''With Night We Banish Sorrow,'' ''A Man of Malice Landing,'' ''Return of the Stranger,'' and ''Mountain Journey,'' all published before her retirement in 1964.         Miss Roberts is survived by a twin sister, Anna Craine of Denver, and a nephew, Jim Craine of Sacramento, Calif.       
        Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         In a career that spanned nearly 50 years, Miss Vaughan influenced countless other singers - including Phoebe Snow, Anita Baker, Sade and Rickie Lee Jones - and made hits of such songs as ''It's Magic,'' ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' and ''Broken-Hearted Melody.'' Her ornate renditions of ''Misty'' and ''Send In the Clowns'' were invariable show-stoppers at jazz festivals in recent years, including the JVC Jazz Festival in New York, at which she appeared almost yearly.         Her voice remained remarkably unravaged by time; in her mid-60's, a period when most singers' vocal powers have sharply diminished, she was still close to her peak. Though her speaking voice deepened and darkened in later years, her singing retained a youthful suppleness and remarkably luscious timbre, and she could still project delicate but ringingly high coloratura passages.         Where more idiosyncratic jazz artists like Billie Holiday excelled at interpretation, Miss Vaughan was a contralto who gloried in displaying the distinctive instrumental qualities of a voice that had a comfortable three-octave range and was marked by a voluptuous, heavy vibrato. Known for her dazzling vocal leaps and swoops, she was equally adept at be-bop improvisation and singing theater songs with a symphony orchestra. Among the singers of her generation, only Ella Fitzgerald enjoyed comparable stature.         ''She had the single best vocal instrument of any singer working in the popular field,'' the singer Mel Torme said yesterday. ''So much so that I used to call her the diva. At one point, I asked her why she had never opted for an operatic career. She got kind of huffy, and said, 'Do you mean jazz isn't legit?' She was very defensive about being a jazz singer. Where someone like Benny Goodman was able to split his musical image and record Mozart concerts, she wanted to perform precisely where she was.''         Appropriate Nicknames         Throughout her career, Miss Vaughan was affectionately known as Sassy or the Divine Sarah. The first nickname reflected her sense of humor and the mischievous sexiness that often inflected her singing and stage patter. The second, appropriated from the legendary actress Sarah Bernhardt, acknowledged her phenomenonally versatile voice. Foremost among the singers Miss Vaughan admired was the soprano Leontyne Price, to whom she bore more than a passing vocal resemblance.         John S. Wilson, in a New York Times review of a Vaughan performance in 1957, credited the singer with ''what may well be the finest voice ever applied to jazz.''         When Miss Vaughan appeared at Avery Fisher Hall in 1974 as part of the Newport Jazz Festival, Mr. Wilson commented on the ''soaring highs and incredibly full lows'' she displayed in her opening numbers and summed up the conclusion of her concert as ''totally virtuosic.''         Sarah Lois Vaughan was born in Newark, on March 27, 1924. Her father was a carpenter and amateur guitarist and her mother a laundress and church vocalist. She studied the piano from the age of 7 and later took up the organ, and at age 12 she became the organist at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Newark, where she was also a soloist in the choir.         Career Began on a Dare         She also enjoyed performing popular tunes at parties, and when friends urged her to enter an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater in New York, she took the dare and won first prize in October 1942, singing ''Body and Soul.'' The singer Billy Eckstine heard her perform, and six months after winning the contest she was hired at his recommendation as a second pianist and singer with Earl (Fatha) Hines's big band, in which Mr. Eckstine was a vocalist and Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were instrumentalists.         The following year, when Mr. Eckstine formed his own band - which featured Mr. Parker, Mr. Gillespie, Art Blakey and Miles Davis, among other jazz greats - Miss Vaughan went along, and remained with him for a year. After a two-month stint in John Kirby's jazz group in the winter of 1945-46, she began a solo career. Her early solo recordings - on which she performed songs like ''Lover Man'' in full-blown be-bop style, accompanied by Mr. Parker and Mr. Gillespie -helped establish her reputation as a jazz singer.         First Husband Was Her Manager         During an extended engagement at Cafe Society Downtown in New York City, Miss Vaughan met George Treadwell, a trumpet player, whom she married. He became her manager, and under his guidance she made the transition from jazz cult figure to popular singing star.         She had her first hit in late 1947 with ''Tenderly,'' for the small Musicraft label. The following year, her version of ''It's Magic,'' a song from the movie ''Romance on the High Seas,'' established her as a full-fledged pop star. In 1949, she signed a five-year contract with Columbia Records, where she remained until 1954, recording mostly popular songs backed by studio orchestras. Out of more than a dozen hits she had on Columbia, the most successful was ''These Things I Offer You,'' in 1951. Although most of her Columbia hits were disposable pop confections, she also recorded many lasting standards. Columbia recently reissued a collection of 28 songs she recorded between 1949 and 1953.         When Miss Vaughan moved to the Mercury label in 1954, she was given the freedom to pursue a dual career as both a popular and jazz singer. For EmArcy, Mercury's jazz subsidiary, she recorded with Clifford Brown, Cannonball Adderley and members of Count Basie's Orchestra, among other jazz artists. On the parent label, she also scored a steady succession of hits for the rest of the decade.         Songs of Seduction         Two of her biggest successes, ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' (1954) and ''Whatever Lola Wants'' (1955), from the Broadway musical ''Damn Yankees,'' were songs of seduction in which her almost overripe timbre gave an extra edge of sensuality to come-hither messages. Her two other biggest hits were the title song of the Broadway show ''Mr. Wonderful'' (1956) and ''Broken-Hearted Melody'' (1959), a ballad with a light rock-and-roll beat. Her complete output for Mercury -263 cuts - was recently reissued.         After 1959, Miss Vaughan would never have any commercially significant pop hits. But over the next 30 years, her reputation as consummate vocal artist soared steadily, thanks to her appearances in nightclubs, at jazz festivals and increasingly with symphony orchestras in the United States and abroad.         During the 1960's, she recorded briefly with Roulette, then again with Mercury and Columbia, and in the 70's and early 80's she made albums for Mainstream and Pablo. It was for Pablo, run by the jazz producer Norman Granz, that she recorded the most critically acclaimed album of her career, ''How Long Has This Been Going On?'' in which she sang with a group that included Oscar Peterson, Joe Pass, Louie Bellson and Ray Brown.         The singer's later recordings ranged from an album of Beatles tunes to a collection of Brazilian pop songs. On CBS's classical crossover recording of ''South Pacific,'' she sang the role of Bloody Mary, and on Quincy Jones's all-star pop-jazz album, ''Back on the Block,'' she and Ella Fitzgerald sang together on a version of Josef Zawinul's ''Birdland.'' In 1982 she won a Grammy for best jazz vocal performance, for her ''Gershwin Live!'' recording on CBS.         Two Perennial Offerings         Though Miss Vaughan's repertory during her 1980's appearances at the JVC Festival varied from year to year, two songs she would always perform were ''Misty,'' which she had first recorded in 1957 with Mr. Jones, and ''Send In the Clowns,'' which became her musical signature during the last decade of her life.         Living up to her Sassy sobriquet, the singer liked to perform ''Misty'' as a duet with herself, singing the first half in her regular voice, than dipping to the bottom of her contralto to do an amusing imitation of a seductive male lounge singer. ''Send In the Clowns,'' the song that usually closed her shows, became her ultimate vocal showpiece, a three-octave tour de force of semi-improvisational pyrotechnics in which the jazz, pop and operatic sides of her musical personality came together and found complete expression. The performances invariably won standing ovations.         Mr. Jones, who first worked with Miss Vaughan in Paris in 1957 when they recorded the original vocal rendition of ''Misty,'' had recently signed her to record a Brazilian fusion album on his label, Qwest. ''Sarah was the most musical singer America has ever known,'' Mr. Jones said yesterday.         Miss Vaughan's marriage to Mr. Treadwell ended in divorce, as did her marriages to Clyde Atkins, a professional football player; Marshall Fisher, a Las Vegas restaurateur, and Waymon Reed, a trumpet player.         She is survived by her mother, Ada, and a daughter, Deborah Vaughan, who uses the first name Paris for her acting career. Both live in Los Angeles.         Miss Vaughan's body will be flown to Newark for a funeral service on Saturday at Mount Zion Baptist Church.

        Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Lady Keith, known to her friends as Slim, had just completed her memoirs, ''Memories of a Rich and Imperfect Life,'' which is to be published later this year by Simon & Schuster.         Known for her wit and charm, she was a sought-after guest, a close friend of Ernest Hemingway, the Selznicks and much of Hollywood and New York society. Truman Capote, who called her ''Big Mama,'' was one of her closest friends until he wrote ''Answered Prayers,'' an article that caricatured New York society. After the article was published in Esquire she never spoke to Mr. Capote again.         In her later years her circle of friends included Mike Nichols and Jerome Robbins.         Married Hawks and Hayward         A native of Salinas, Calif., she acquired her title from her third husband, Lord Kenneth Keith, a British merchant banker, whom she married in 1962.         She was Mary Raye Gross at her birth on July 15, 1916, but her mother changed her name to Nancy. She grew up to be the kind of beauty that was sought after in Hollywood, although she never appeared in films. In her early 20's she became a regular guest at San Simeon, the Hearst estate, and in 1941 Gary Cooper gave her away when she married Howard Hawks, the director and producer. Their daughter, Kitty Hawks, survives her.         In 1946, 150 fashion editors and stylists named ''Slim'' Hawks the best-dressed woman of the year. The runner-up was the Duchess of Windsor. At the time, Mrs. Hawks was quoted as saying, ''I have a tall, skinny frame that clothes look well on. Seriously, just say that I'm a great believer in simplicity in clothes.''         In her Hollywood years she was credited with discovering and promoting such stars as Lauren Bacall, Joanne Dru and Ella Raines, all of whom resembled her somewhat in their casual, long-limbed type of good looks.         Two days after she and Mr. Hawks were divorced in 1949, she married Leland Hayward, the movie and theatrical producer, at the Manhasset, L.I., estate of William S. Paley. She and Mr. Hayward divorced in 1959 and three years later she married Kenneth Keith. They were divorced in 1972. ''I was married to each for about 10 years,'' she said at the time. ''I guess that's about all I can hack.''         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Theodora Andersen, of Burlingame, Calif., and four stepchildren, Alastaire Keith and Camilla Mackesson, the children of Lord Keith, and William Hayward and Brooke Hayward Duchin.       
        Mary Lea Johnson Richards, a founder and partner of the Producer Circle, a New York film and theatrical production company, died yesterday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh, where she had a liver transplant two weeks ago. She was 63 years old and had homes in New York, Southampton, L.I., and Boca Raton,         Mary Lea Johnson Richards, a founder and partner of the Producer Circle, a New York film and theatrical production company, died yesterday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh, where she had a liver transplant two weeks ago. She was 63 years old and had homes in New York, Southampton, L.I., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Since it was formed in 1976, the Producer Circle - founded by Mrs. Richards with her husband, Martin Richards, Robert Fryer and James Cresson - won 22 Tony Awards. It produced such Broadway shows as ''On the Twentieth Century,'' ''Sweeney Todd,'' ''La Cage aux Folles,'' ''Crimes of the Heart,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize, and ''Grand Hotel.'' Its Off Broadway productions included ''March of the Falsettos'' and ''Mayor.'' Among the company's films were ''The Boys From Brazil,'' ''The Shining'' and ''Fort Apache, the Bronx.''         Mrs. Richards was born on Aug. 20, 1926, in New Brunswick, N.J. She was the oldest daughter of J. Seward Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune, and his first wife, Ruth Dill Johnson. She was a graduate of the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Murder Plot Charged         Mrs. Richards's first marriage, to William Ryan, a farmer and a newspaper editor, ended in divorce. She made headlines in 1976 when she charged that her second husband, Dr. Victor D'Arc, a New York psychiatrist, had hired men to have her murdered. The Bronx District Attorney's office opened an investigation in the case, but no charges were ever brought. The couple was divorced in 1978.         Five years later, after the death of her father, Mrs. Richards and her brothers and sisters went to Surrogates Court in Manhattan to challenge his last will, which disinherited five of his six children and left the vast bulk of his $350 million estate to his third wife, Barbara Piasecka Johnson of Princeton. N.J. The case, the largest inheritance contest in the history of New York, went through 14 weeks of trial in 1986 before it was settled out of court, with the children dividing up about 12 percent of the total.         In addition to her husband, Martin Richards of New York, Mrs. Richards is survived by two brothers, J. Seward Johnson Jr. of Princeton, and James L. Johnson of Pottersville, N.J.; three sisters, Diana Firestone of Waterford, Va., Elaine Wold of Boca Raton and Jennifer Duke of Jacksonville, Fla.; five sons, Eric Ryan of New York; Seward, Hillary and Quentin Ryan of Hilton Head, S.C., and Roderick Ryan, of Andover, N.J.; one daughter, Alice Ryan Marriott, also of Hilton Head; and 10 grandchildren.

In addition to her son David, she is survived by her son Jeremy, of Philadelphia; a brother, Clair Maxwell of Orlando, Fla.; a sister, Hope Tate, of Oxford, Mich., and two grandsons.       
         Claudia Stern, a writer and editor, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of congestive heart failure, a family spokesman said.         Ms. Stern was a story editor and assistant producer for Edgar Sherrick and Sue Pollack, Manhattan film and television producers, from 1978 to 1980.         She collaborated with Charlotte Ford on "Modern Manners," published in 1980 by Simon & Shuster. She also worked with Ms. Ford and her sister Anne on "How to Love the Car in Your Life" (Ford Motor Company, 1972).         She is survived by her mother, Elsie Stern of Manhattan; a daughter, Abigail Rebecca Sims, also of Manhattan; and a brother, John Stern of Cape Neddick, Me.         Her companion was Bennett Byron Sims.       
         Eve Arden, the caustic comedienne featured in dozens of films as a heroine's wry and wisecracking best friend, a warmhearted but sassy schoolteacher or secretary, died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The actress said she was born on April 30, 1912, but Ron Lisell, a spokesman for the family, said she was 83. Her death was caused by heart disease, Mr. Lisell said.         Miss Arden made her Broadway debut in the "Ziegfeld Follies" of 1934, but although she often appeared in plays in New York and on the road, she was chiefly a Hollywood actress. She was best known as the sardonic but likable English teacher in the radio and television series "Our Miss Brooks," which ran from 1948 until 1957. The series earned her an Emmy award as best actress for 1953.         The tall and languid Miss Brooks, noted for her exquisite comic timing and a knack for making the most of a throwaway line, received featured billing in more than 100 movies, including "Stage Door," "The Marx Brothers at the Circus," "No, No, Nanette," "Bedtime Story," "Cover Girl," "Anatomy of a Murder" and "The Dark at the Top of the Stairs." In 1945 she received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her performance in "Mildred Pierce."         The actress, whose original name was Eunice Quedens, was born in Mill Valley, Calif., near San Francisco. She was reared by her divorced mother and an aunt. Both encouraged her to act in school plays. At 16, she said, "I was dumped by my mother and aunt at the Henry Duffy office in San Francisco and told to get a job acting, which I did."         She joined the Duffy stock company, which performed in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and she later switched to the Bandbox Repertory Theater, which toured the "citrus circuit" in Southern California.         Miss Arden was a seasoned 21-year-old actress when she got a job in "Low and Behold," a forerunner of the "New Faces" revues produced by Leonard Sillman. The producer Lee Shubert saw a performance at the Pasadena Playhouse and offered Miss Arden a part as a showgirl in the 1934 "Ziegfeld Follies" on Broadway. And he told her to shed her real name.         Eunice Quedens did so by studying the labels of cosmetic jars on her dressing table and, she said, "stole my first name from Evening in Paris and the second from Elizabeth Arden."         Eve Arden won her first theatrical accolade in 1935 when she was featured with Jimmy Savo in "Parade."The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: "Count on the credit side Eve Arden's lorgnette humor which turns a song entitled 'Send for the Militia' into highly amusing satire." That and other reviews helped to win Miss Arden a featured role in the 1936 "Ziegfeld Follies." As Fannie Brice's understudy, she starred in several performances. Success, With the Help of a Cat         Miss Arden made her film debut in a 1937 grade-B melodrama called "Oh, Doctor," in which she disastrously played a gun moll. But her big break came that same year when the director Gregory La Cava cast her in what was to have been a small role in "Stage Door," starring Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers.         The actress built up her supposedly minor role with the aid of a slothful cat named Henry, which hung around the set. Having noticed that the sluggish Henry hardly ever moved, Miss Arden called Mr. La Cava's attention to the fact that the cat liked to sleep draped over her shoulders. The director was amused, and he included many shots of Miss Arden wearing the live cat as a fur piece. She was long remembered as the "girl with the cat."         In three years Miss Arden appeared in more than 20 films, becoming typecast in roles characterized by brittle, caustic humor. Trying to get away from that stereotype, she returned to Broadway and won praise for her featured roles in the Kern-Hammerstein musical "Very Warm for May" in 1939, the revue "Two for the Show" in 1940 and Cole Porter's "Let's Face It" in 1941, in which she appeared with Danny Kaye.         Miss Arden nearly stole the 1944 war movie "The Doughgirls" from three stars by enlivening her role as a tough-talking Russian guerrilla, punctuating her flines in ractured English lines with funny and risque gestures with her sniper's rifle.         Other featured roles followed, most of them putting Miss Arden back in what she considered the rut of the coldly tart-tongued and vitriolic cynic. It mattered not, she said, that audiences always responded to her with laughter; she did not like seeing herself in those roles, which were carried over into radio shows in which she starred with Jack Haley and Jack Carson.         "I just don't like that dame," she said in 1952. "She is hard-boiled, unsentimental and not me."         With "Our Miss Brooks," Miss Arden was able to alter her image, keeping the snappy, sardonic lines but giving the schoolteacher character a warmly affectionate and self-deprecating side.         That television series went off the air in 1957, and Miss Arden appeared in only an occasional film until 1967, when she began a two-season run co- starring with the comedienne Kaye Ballard in the NBC television show "The Mothers-in-Law." She also appeared as a school principal in the films "Grease" in 1978 and "Grease II" in 1982, and in "Under the Rainbow" in 1981.         Miss Arden's second husband, Brooks West, an actor, died in 1984.         Survivors include two daughters, Liza and Constance, and two sons, Douglas and Duncan.         Correction:  November 17, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Tuesday about the actress Eve Arden misstated the date of her film debut. It was in 1929, when she appeared under her original name, Eunice Quedens, in "The Song of Love"; it was not in 1937.       
         Lisa Kirk, a cabaret performer who won Broadway acclaim in the late 1940's singing "The Gentleman Is a Dope" in the musical "Allegro" and "Always True to You (In My Fashion)" in "Kiss Me, Kate," died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 62 years old and had homes in New York City and Malibu, Calif.         Miss Kirk died of lung cancer, said her husband, the lyricist and producer Robert Wells. He said she had known of her illness for only two weeks, after seeing doctors because of a slight cough and mild fatigue. "She had never been ill in her life," he said. "She didn't drink, and she didn't smoke. It's unbelievable."         In the late 1960's, Miss Kirk was injured in an autombile accident that threatened to end her career. But she started "training like a fighter," she recalled later. When she appeared in 1972 at the St. Regis Sheraton Hotel in New York City, John S. Wilson of The New York Times wrote that "she is dancing and singing as though nothing had ever happened." Inspired by Cole Porter         Miss Kirk said at the time: "I kept thinking of Cole Porter, who had both legs crushed in a riding accident 10 years before he wrote 'Kiss Me, Kate.' It was seeing his determination to get better that made me work so hard."         When Miss Kirk performed at Rainbow and Stars last year, Mr. Wilson praised her "warm, easy projection" and said, "Her long career has given her polish, presence and a solid foundation of songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein, Cole Porter and Jerry Herman with which she is associated."         Brought up in Roscoe, Pa., Miss Kirk studied at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. She appeared in New York nightclubs and on Broadway in "Good Night Ladies." But it was Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Allegro" that brought her fame in 1947. Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate" the following year cemented her reputation.         Brooks Atkinson of The Times wrote, "Having startled the town last season by singing 'The Gentleman Is a Dope' as though she meant it, Miss Kirk is captivating it this year as a fully accredited hoyden with a sense of humor."         "Given a sardonic song like 'Always True to You (In My Fashion),' " he wrote, "she can translate it into pert and gleaming buffoonery."         Miss Kirk told an interviewer in 1956 that she had not realized at first that she had comic gifts. "I had the vague idea of becoming a new Helen Morgan," she recalled. "With that in mind, I practiced a song before a mirror and framed it in what I considered appropriate gestures. When I did it for a director and some backers of a show, those men fell off their seats laughing. I could see that the laugh wasn't ridicule. They were amused."         In 1964 she returned to Broadway, stepping into Meredith Willson's musical "Here's Love." In 1974 she appeared in "Mack and Mabel," a Broadway show with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman. She was in a 1984 revival of Noel Coward's "Design for Living" at the Circle in the Square theater and appeared in London last summer in Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant."         She is survived by her husband.         A funeral service is planned for Friday at 11:15 A.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, Madison Avenue and 81st Street.       
         Mary Martin, America's favorite leading lady of musical comedy, as Ens. Nellie Forbush in "South Pacific," Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" or the title role in "Peter Pan," died Saturday afternoon at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 76 years old.         She died of cancer, said Richard Grant, who handles publicity for the actress's son, Larry Hagman. Miss Martin, who had been hospitalized recently at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, returned home last Tuesday.         More than any of her peers, she was what she played and she incarnated the songs that she sang. Miss Martin was "a cockeyed optimist" and she was also the eternal child imagined by James M. Barrie. Approaching 70, she was still saying, "I can't help thinking I'm 19." On stage, at least figuratively, she never stopped flying. Echoes of Poetry         In reviewing her performance in "South Pacific," Kenneth Tynan said that she reminded him of something Aldous Huxley wrote about the minor Caroline poets: "They spoke in their natural voices and it was poetry." While Ethel Merman was an entire brass section and Carol Channing was a parade, Miss Martin remained natural and exactingly true to life -- and it was poetry.         Her voice was never the strongest instrument. She was not beautiful (though she could be radiant). Through determination, pluck, charm, self-mocking humor and a profound sense of self, everything converged to create an exhilarating theater artist.         For 50 years Miss Martin projected the vitality of someone who loved her work and knew precisely how to make other people share in her happiness. As Elia Kazan, who directed her in her first Broadway starring role in "One Touch of Venus," said in his autobiography, she was "full of the love of being loved." Specialized in Long Runs         Although she made a number of films, she was devoted to the theater. She starred in relatively few Broadway shows, but the work was valuable; one could regard the actress herself as being the heyday of the Broadway musical.         She specialized in long runs and was known for not missing performances. In his autobiography, Richard Rodgers called her "an extraordinary trouper," adding, "In all the years I've known her, I have never seen her give a performance that was anything less than the best that was in her." She did have, he said, one unusual trait: "She cannot utter even the mildest form of profanity." The "strongest expression" he ever heard her use was "He's a son-of-a-bear."         If there had been a darker side to Miss Martin, she certainly kept it hidden from her public, which never failed to think of her as joyful. In her private life, she endured tragedies (including her husband's death) and on stage was prone to suffer accidents, but she never let anything interfere with the sheer delight of her performance.  A Thousand Shampoos         Repeatedly she set herself challenges, many of them physical. It was at her suggestion that Nellie Forbush literally washed that man "right out-a my hair," which meant that she shampooed her hair on stage for 1,000 performances. Originally she had planned to sing another song in "South Pacific" while cartwheeling across the stage -- until she cartwheeled right into the orchestra pit. It was also her idea to sing a song standing on her head in "Jennie," one of her less successful musicals. In rehearsal at the age of 63 in the Aleksei Arbuzov play "Do You Turn Somersaults?," she turned somersaults on stage until she fell from a revolving platform and was grounded by her doctors.         In her autobiography, "My Heart Belongs," she declared that of all her characters Peter Pan was indisputably her favorite, for a very simple reason: "Everyone else loves Peter so." She added, "Neverland is the way I would like real life to be: timeless, free, mischievous, filled with gaiety, tenderness and magic."         The key to her first Broadway success, in 1938 in the Cole Porter musical, "Leave It to Me," was her innate ability to combine innocence and insouciance. In that show she sang "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," a vintage Porter song in which almost every word has a double meaning. She played against the lines, which made them even funnier, and she did a striptease as if she was hanging up the laundry. It was often said about that song that Miss Martin did not know what she was singing until Sophie Tucker, who was also in the cast, explained the worldly, witty lyrics to her. The actress was never to lose that inbred sense of ingenuousness.  An Early Flight, A Crash Landing         From the first, Mary Virginia Martin was self-propelled. She was born in Weatherford, Tex., on Dec. 1, 1913 (although some reports placed the date one year later), the younger daughter of Preston Martin, a lawyer, and Juanita Presley Martin, a violin teacher. As one of a trio of little girls dressed as bellhops, she sang on a bandstand outside her father's courtroom. When she was 5, she sang "When Apples Grow on the Lilac Trees" at a fireman's ball. Once she tried to fly -- from the roof of a garage, without the mechanical assistance she would have later as Peter Pan -- and broke her collarbone.         Frequently she sang in churches and at clubs, and learned about show business by watching movies and imitating singers and dancers. As a young woman, she appeared with her best friend, Bessie Mae Sue Ella Yaeger, in amateur theatricals and later wondered why she had become a star and Bessie Mae had not. She decided it was because "I react to an audience.         "Give me 4 people and I'm         on         . Give me 400 and I'm a hundred times more on."         As a tribute to Bessie Mae -- and for good luck -- she worked her friend's name into many of her scripts, on stage and in films.         In her book Miss Martin recalled that Weatherford was famous for its watermelons. Long after she became a star, a sign was erected on the courthouse lawn: "Weatherford, Texas, home of watermelons and Mary Martin." Her observation: "I never got top billing in my hometown."         Nevertheless she had, she was convinced, a very happy childhood. Her parents sent her to Ward Belmont, a finishing school in Nashville. At 16, she married Benjamin Hagman, a Weatherford accountant and later a lawyer. They had one child, Larry Martin Hagman, who -- as the world knows -- became famous as J. R. on television's "Dallas."  Dancing Her Way To Hollywood         The actress's first marriage lasted only a few years, and the teen-age bride brought up her son as if he were her younger brother. Miss Martin was soon caught up in her career. At 18, she opened the Mary Hagman School of Dance in Weatherford, then went to Hollywood to study dancing and to search for a way to enter the movies. For several years she went back and forth between the two states and between teaching and performing.         The dancing school flourished (until it was destroyed by fire) while her performing career took several divergent paths. In Texas she sang on radio; in California she sang and danced in nightclubs. One evening she performed in a Sunday night talent show at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Singing "The Weekend of a Private Secretary" and an operatic number entitled "Il Bacio" in her own syncopated version, she created a sensation. To her astonishment, people stood on chairs and tables and shouted bravo. Jack Benny, who was in the audience, later told her that it was one of the most exciting moments he could remember. "In 10 minutes," she said, "my life had changed."         Another member of the audience was Lawrence Schwab, a producer who took charge of her career. In answer to the frequent question, what causes a big break, she said: "Work. Work and work and work; be ready when the break comes." As she wrote in her autobiography, "All my life I have felt guilty if I didn't use any talent I have as fully as I could."         Under Mr. Schwab's aegis, she came to New York and auditioned to fill a suddenly vacant supporting role in the forthcoming Broadway musical "Leave It to Me." The unknown actress strode into a suite in the Ritz Towers and announced that she was going to sing four songs, adding, "If I can't sing all four, I'd rather not sing." As she recalled in her book, "A man reclining on a couch said, very mildly, 'Carry on, on all fours.' " She later discovered that the philosophical man on the couch was Cole Porter, the composer of the show. Bella Spewack, co-author of the book with her husband, Sam Spewack, asked Miss Martin if she had ever been on the New York stage. She admitted that she had not, and when Mrs. Spewack asked her why she thought she could do it, she answered boldly, "Try me."         In the audition, she was called upon to read her character's dialogue. She shouted the first line, "I'd like to renew my subscription" (meaning she would like to continue having a love affair). Her straightforward, self-confident delivery brought down the house. Should she get the part, Mr. Spewack told her, she should never change the reading of the line. Throughout her career her art was founded on such intuition.  A First Casting Much Against Type         She so captivated Porter and his collaborators that she was signed, despite the fact -- or rather because of the fact -- that she was cast against type: the innocent country girl playing a kept woman, and singing a striptease showstopper, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy." Fifty years later, in 1988, as a great-grandmother, she was still singing "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," at a celebration honoring Cole Porter. In May 1990 she was scheduled to sing the song again at the 75th anniversary celebration of the Shubert Theater in New Haven, but canceled her appearance because of illness.         Her overnight success on Broadway on Nov. 9, 1938 put her on the cover of Life magazine and drew the attention of Hollywood. Under contract to Paramount, she appeared in a series of forgettable roles in forgettable films, including "The Great Victor Herbert," "Rhythm on the River," "Love Thy Neighbor," "New York Town," "Birth of the Blues," "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," "Happy Go Lucky" and "True to Life."         There was one positive result of her Hollywood experience. She met and married Richard Halliday, a story editor at Paramount. He also became her producer and closest professional adviser and the father of their daughter, Heller Halliday. If she had remained in Hollywood, she might have disappeared into the studio system, but wisdom prevailed and she returned to New York, where she became a Broadway star and remained one for the next four decades.         Her first starring role was in "One Touch of Venus," written by Kurt Weill, Ogden Nash and S. J. Perelman. To combat his wife's hesitancy about playing the title goddess, a role originally conceived for Marlene Dietrich, Mr. Halliday took her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and showed her the many interpretations of Venus in painting and sculpture. As the "Venus of Ozone Heights," who comes to life and steps down from her pedestal, she had her customary winsomeness, singing her signature song, "That's Him," simply sitting in a chair facing the audience.  The Bumpy Road To 'South Pacific'         After "One Touch of Venus," she starred in the musical "Lute Song" and in London in Noel Coward's "Pacific 1860" and toured for a year in Irving Berlin's "Annie Get Your Gun." Though Ethel Merman had played the title character, Annie Oakley, in the original production, the role -- along with the song, "Doin' What Comes Naturally" -- seemed made to measure for Miss Martin. As always, she was undeterred by the fact that she was succeeding another star (which she also did later when she took Carol Channing's "Hello, Dolly!" on tour of military bases in Vietnam).         In 1948, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d offered her the central role in "South Pacific." She was hesitant for two reasons. Disliking hospitals, she was not anxious to play the role of a nurse, and she felt insecure because her leading man would be an opera star, Ezio Pinza. When it was decided that the two would not be asked to sing a duet, she accepted the offer. Nellie Forbush, singing "Cockeyed Optimist," "Honey Bun," "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out-a My Hair" and, especially, "I'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy," became one of her greatest successes.         "South Pacific" was followed in 1954 by "Peter Pan" (her daughter was also in the cast) which she performed on Broadway and on television, live and then on tape, complete with her celebrated aerial ballet. The Broadway production ran for only 152 performances. It was largely through the taped television version (which was recently released on videocassette) that she became so identified with the role.         "Peter Pan" was an exact meeting of actress and character. As Miss Martin said, "I cannot even remember a day when I didn't want to be Peter." For years she had dreams of flying, all of which stopped just before the first television presentation of the show. Trying to explain the end of those dreams, she said, "Perhaps it was because I had experienced at last the joy of really flying." She could become almost mystical whenever she spoke about the experience, as in her statement: "I discovered I was happier in the air than on the ground. I probably always will be."  Another Character, Another Classic         In 1959, Rodgers and Hammerstein went to her again to ask her to play Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music." Though her own background could not have been more dissimilar from that of her real-life model, she -- and the audience -- felt the kinship. As she said, "We both have the same drive, utter determination." During her two years in the role, she missed only one performance.         Of her three Broadway triumphs only "Peter Pan" was to be recorded for posterity -- in the television version.In the case of both "South Pacific" and "The Sound of Music," other actresses played her role on screen (Mitzi Gaynor was Nellie and Julie Andrews was Maria von Trapp.) This meant that, except for her television appearances, especially one dynamic evening teamed with Ethel Merman, her most noteworthy performances existed only on the stage and on records.         As one sign of her own fallibility she often pointed to the fact that while accepting "South Pacific," "Peter Pan" and "The Sound of Music," she turned down the chance to be in "Oklahoma!", "Kiss Me Kate" and "My Fair Lady."         Among her other Broadway shows were the two-character musical "I Do I Do" and "Jennie." Occasionally she acted in dramas -- in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth," which she and Helen Hayes took on tour, and in "Do You Turn Somersaults?"         She and her husband owned a ranch in Brazil, Nossa Fazenda (Our Farm), next to a home owned by her friend Janet Gaynor. The Hallidays used the ranch as a vacation retreat. After her husband died in 1973, Miss Martin worked less but never fully retired. In 1981 she was a host on "Over Easy," a public television series about aging. In 1982 she was in a taxicab accident in San Francisco that took the life of her close friend Ben Washer and severely injured Miss Martin, Miss Gaynor and Miss Gaynor's husband, Paul Gregory. In 1986, fully recovered, she returned to the theater in a dramatic role, co-starring with Carol Channing in James Kirkwood's "Legends." Each portrayed an aging actress. "Legends" toured but never came to New York.         In 1989, Miss Martin returned to New York for a tribute to the television work of Richard Rodgers and to see "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," which reprised "I'm Flying" from "Peter Pan." Several months later, the 1960 television version of "Peter Pan" was shown again, with great success. Later, an illness precipitated her withdrawal from "Grovers Corners," Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's musical version of "Our Town," in which she was scheduled to play the Stage Manager. In 1989 she received a Kennedy Center Award, given annually at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Famous First Line One More Time         Some years ago she participated in a birthday tribute to Richard Rodgers at the Imperial Theater, where, decades before, she had made her Broadway debut in "Leave It to Me." For days, she worried about what she would say. When the time came, in characteristic fashion, she improvised. She walked on stage and said as loudly as she could, "I would like to renew my subscription." When she wrote about this moment in her autobiography, she commented, "That's what I would like to say, now and forever, to all audiences everywhere." Mary Martin's lifetime renewal was gratefully accepted.         Miss Martin is survived by her son, her daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York at a later date.       
         Valerie French, who began her career as a much-publicized starlet for Columbia Pictures and became a screen, stage and television actress who specialized in playing a diverse collection of English characters, died Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 59 years old.         She died of leukemia, said a friend, Tom Seligson, a television producer.         Miss French was born in London and spent her early childhood in Spain, returning to England to attend Malvern Girls' College in Worcestershire and then join the BBC drama department.         After several years in television production, she joined the Theater Royal Repertory Company in Windsor, where she played small parts.         After a screen test and a role in the film "The Constant Husband" in 1955, she went to Hollywood and became a contract actress with Columbia Pictures. She starred opposite Glenn Ford and Rod Steiger in "Jubal" (1956) and with Lee J. Cobb in "The Garment Jungle" (1957).         A Minor Sensation         On Broadway she acted in "Inadmissible Evidence" (1965) and "Help Stamp Out Marriage!" (1966). In "The Mother Lover," at the Booth Theater in 1969, she caused something of a sensation by appearing onstage nude with her back to the audience.         Miss French starred Off Broadway in Harold Pinter's "Tea Party" and "The Basement" in 1968, in a 1980 revival of Noel Coward's "Fallen Angels," and as the mother, Helen, in a production of "A Taste of Honey" in 1981.         Her television credits include roles in "Have Gun, Will Travel," "The Prisoner," "The Nurses," "Edge of Night" and "Brighter Day."         Miss French was twice married and twice divorced. In a 1981 interview she said that she and her second husband, the actor Thayer David, had been planning to remarry when he died in 1978.         There are no immediate survivors, Mr. Seligson said.       
         Joan Bennett, an actress who matured from a winsome blonde ingenue in movies of the 1930's to a sensuous brunette femme fatale in film noir classics of the 1940's, died Friday evening at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, said her daughter, Shelley Wanger.         Miss Bennett got her basic training playing opposite such major stars as Ronald Colman in "Bulldog Drummond" (her first important role, at the age of 19 in 1929), George Arliss in "Disraeli" (1929) and John Barrymore in "Moby Dick" (1930).         She portrayed a personable waitress trading wisecracks with Spencer Tracy in "Me and My Gal" (1932), a pert sister competing with Katharine Hepburn in "Little Women" (1933) and a psychiatrist's young wife slipping into insanity in "Private Worlds" (1935).         The leading mentor of Miss Bennett's career was a celebrated producer, Walter Wange. In 1938, two years before they were married, he made "Algiers," a major hit that introduced Hedy Lamarr to American audiences. Miss Lamarr's dark Viennese beauty captivated audiences around the country. Capitalizing on the sudden vogue, Mr. Wanger had Miss Bennett become a brunette for a scenic melodrama called "Trade Winds," and she began an entirely new career.         A Change of Personality         Combined with her sultry eyes and husky voice, the new look gave her an earthier, more arresting personality. She won praise in two 1940 melodramas -- "The House Across the Bay" and "The Man I Married" -- and came into her own in three film noir thrillers directed by Fritz Lang: as a Cockney prostitute in "Man Hunt" (1941), a mysterious model in "The Woman in the Window" (1944) and a vulgar blackmailer in "Scarlet Street" (1946).         She also won praise as a shrewish, cuckolding wife in Zoltan Korda's "Macomber Affair" (1947), as a deceitful wife in Jean Renoir's "Woman on the Beach" (1947) and as a tormented blackmail victim in Max Ophuls's "Reckless Moment" (1949).         Then, easily shifting images again, she was an elegant, witty and nurturing mother in two classic film comedies directed by Vincente Minnelli: "Father of the Bride" (1950) and "Father's Little Dividend" (1951), co-starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.         Later in 1951, Miss Bennett was a principal in a major Hollywood scandal. Mr. Wanger shot and wounded her longtime agent, Jennings Lang, in a Los Angeles parking lot, accusing him of being a home wrecker. Miss Bennett later attributed her husband's outburst to desperation over large financial losses.         To avoid further notoriety, Mr. Wanger pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and served 100 days at a minimum-security prison farm. Mr. Lang soon recovered, but Miss Bennett's film career did not. Before the shooting, she had starred in more than 60 movies. After it, at the age of 41, she was offered only a handful of roles.         Bad Timing         In a 1981 interview, she contrasted the judgmental 1950's with the sensation-crazed 70's and 80's. "It would never happen that way today," she said, laughing. "If it happened today, I'd be a sensation. I'd be wanted by all studios for all pictures."         The Wangers divorced in 1965, after 25 years of marriage.         As movie offers dwindled, Miss Bennett turned to the stage and made successful national tours in such plays as "Susan and God," "Bell, Book and Candle," "Once More With Feeling," "The Pleasure of His Company" and "Never Too Late."         She also lent her presence and prestige to television's top gothic soap opera, "Dark Shadows," which ran from 1966 to 1971 and attracted a major cult following. The series, which also dealt with a guilt-ridden vampire (Jonathan Frid), has been frequently rebroadcast.         Associates invariably applauded Miss Bennett for professionalism and dedication. In her 1970 autobiography, "The Bennett Playbill," written with Lois Kibbee, she said her experience with "Dark Shadows," in which she played the mistress of a haunted mansion, had given her new regard for daytime television performers.         Miss Bennett was celebrated for not taking herself too seriously. In 1986, she remarked, "I don't think much of most of the films I made, but being a movie star was something I liked very much."         Theatrical Lineage         Joan Bennett was born on Feb. 27, 1910, in Palisades, N.J. Her parents were Richard Bennett, a flamboyant matinee idol, and Adrienne Morrison, an actress whose lineage went back five generations to strolling players in 18th-century England. The couple's elder daughters, Constance and Barbara, also became actresses.         Miss Bennett attended St. Margaret's, a boarding school in Waterbury, Conn., and L'Hermitage, a finishing school in Versailles, France. At the age of 16, she married John Marion Fox, whom she later described as a playboy and drunkard. At 17, she had a daughter, Diana, and at 18, she divorced Mr. Fox.         That same year, her father got her the ingenue role in a Broadway melodrama, "Jarnegan," in which he starred as a lecherous, brawling movie director. She received good notices, and after a five-month run, he helped her get her first movie contract. She soon succeeded in "Bulldog Drummond" and over the next decade starred in 33 films. Her major early setback was a final-round loss of the role of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh.         About Hollywood in the 1930's, Miss Bennett recalled: "The industry held a combination of nuts, talents, charlatans and geniuses, all of whom were learning, bumbling and creating with fury and innocence. The colorful types had a passionate love for the business, not just for the money. Today, it seems to me, it's strictly a big business, based on dollars and cents."         Miss Bennett is survived by her fourth husband, David Wilde, a former critic and publisher whom she married in 1973; four daughters, Diana Anderson of Los Angeles and Melinda Bena of Chappaqua, N.Y., from her second marriage to Gene Markey, a film writer-producer whom she married in 1932 and divorced in 1937, and Stephanie Guest and Shelley Wanger, both of Manhattan, from her marriage to Mr. Wanger, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Sonya Selby-Wright, an associate producer of special programs for "Good Morning America," died on Wednesday in her home in Point Pleasant, N.J. She was 54 years old.         She died of a pulmonary embolism, said her husband, Julian Mueller.         Born in London, Ms. Selby-Wright moved to the United States in 1963. She was an associate producer of "The Mike Douglas Show" before taking over special programs at "Good Morning America" in 1977.         A profile in Cook's magazine last year credited Ms. Selby-Wright with single-handedly coaching chefs for television appearances and with perfecting the presentation of food on television. She worked with culinary figures including Julia Child, Wolfgang Puck and Lorenzo De Medici. "Her talents for creating a kitchen drama in three and a half minutes were awesome," Mrs. Child said yesterday. "I am indeed indebted to her."         In addition to her husband, Ms. Selby-Wright is survived by her mother, Mary Chamberlain, and a sister, Claire Wright, both of England.         A funeral service is to be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at the Point Pleasant Baptist Church.         Correction:  December 24, 1990, Monday         An obituary on Friday about Sonya Selby-Wright, a television producer, misidentified her residence. It was Point Pleasant, Pa., not New Jersey.
