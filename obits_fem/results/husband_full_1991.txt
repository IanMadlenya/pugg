         Eleanor Schley Todd, a former Republican National Committeewoman, died on Monday at her home in Oldwick, N.J. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Todd died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her daughter, Christine Todd Whitman of Far Hills, N.J., said.         In 1956, Mrs. Todd was elected vice chairman of the Republican National Committee. From 1956 to 1966, she was a Republican National Committeewoman from New Jersey. From 1946 to 1952, she was president of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women.         She attended every Republican national convention as a delegate, alternate or convention manager from 1940 to 1976, and was a member of the board of governors of the Women's National Republican Club.         She was also active in civic affairs. In 1983, Gov. Thomas H. Kean appointed her to the New Jersey Board of Higher Education, where she served until 1988. She was a member of the Regional Planning Association and of the Hunterdon County Parks Commission.         In 1957 she was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a post she held until 1967. During World War II, she was chairman of the New Jersey Red Cross Canteen.         Mrs. Todd was born in Monmouth Beach, N.J., and was educated at the Chapin School, the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., Barnard and Sarah Lawrence Colleges and at Columbia University, from which she graduated in 1967.         She was a past chairman of the board of the Far Hills Country Day School and of the Foxcroft School. She was also a member of the Council of Independent Schools.         Her daughter, Mrs. Whitman, was narrowly defeated by the Democratic incumbent from New Jersey, Bill Bradley, in her recent campaign for the United States Senate.         Mrs. Todd's husband, Webster Bray Todd, a former state Republican state chairman in New Jersey, died in 1989.         Besides Mrs. Whitman, Mrs. Todd is survived by another daughter, Kate Beach of Washington; a son, Webster B. Todd Jr. of Pray, Mont.; a brother, Reeve Schley Jr. of Whitehouse, N.J., and eight grandchildren.       
         Jean Camper Cahn, a lawyer who helped establish Federal financing of legal services to the poor and was a co-founder of the now-defunct Antioch School of Law in Washington, died on Wednesday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 55 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband and law associate, Edgar S. Cahn.         Mrs. Cahn spent most of her career pursuing legal and social causes in Washington, where the Cahns lived for two decades until they moved to Florida in 1984.         In one of her latest cases, argued in a Federal District Court in Florida, a decision handed down a week before her death upheld her contention that money distributed under the Older Americans Act must be aimed at benefiting those in greatest need. A Family of Activists         Mrs. Cahn was born into a family of social activists. Her father, Dr. John E. T. Camper, a physician in Baltimore, was a founder of the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in that city, where she was born and reared.Regular visitors to the home included Thurgood Marshall, who was to become the first black Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and the singer Paul Robeson, who was her godfather.         While at Swarthmore College she met Mr. Cahn, a fellow student whose ancestors had been rabbis and lawyers for seven generations. The couple married in 1957 when she graduated and he was in graduate study of English at Yale.         Mrs. Cahn converted to Judaism and, at her husband's urging, applied for and won a scholarship to Yale Law School. Their elder son, Jonathan, was born on the day of her first examinations at law school, and their younger son, Reuben, was born a year later, while they were living and studying at Cambridge in England on a Fulbright fellowship.         Returning to New Haven, Mrs. Cahn served as associate general counsel for the New Haven Redevelopment Agency and in the country's first neighborhood legal services program, the Dixwell offices of Community Progress Inc., financed by the Ford Foundation. Joined War on Poverty         In 1964, during their final year in New Haven, the Cahns jointly wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal proposing a national system of legal services to the poor as part of what was to become the Johnson Administration's War on Poverty.         They moved to Washington that year, he to enter private law practice and she to take a post in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Mrs. Cahn was the first director of the National Legal Services Program in the O.E.O. and later founded the Urban Law Institute at George Washington University.         Mrs. Cahn attracted national notice in 1967 and 1968 as a lawyer for Adam Clayton Powell, a popular Harlem Congressman who was battling in court to reverse his 1967 expulsion from the House of Representatives for misuse of public funds and other transgressions. (The Congressman sat out the 90th Congress and subsequently won a special election and joined the 91st Congress in 1969. His expulsion was later found illegal by the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Powell died in 1972.)         In 1971 the Cahns co-founded the Antioch School of Law, which placed emphasis on serving the poor and trained prospective lawyers in social activism. Eight years later, Antioch College in Ohio, with which the school was initially affiliated, dismissed the Cahns as co-deans. The law school eventually became autonomous and, largely because of severe financial problems, it closed in 1988.         Mrs. Cahn continued to teach and to practice law. In 1984 she was a distinguished visiting professor at Middlebury College in Vermont, and in 1986 she was a distinguished visiting scholar at the London School of Economics. From 1986 until her death she was counsel to the Miami law firm of Fernandez-Caubi, Fernandez, Cancio & Allen.         In addition to Mr. Cahn, she is survived by their sons, Jonathan, a member of the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, and Reuben, a public defender in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; her mother, Florine Camper of Baltimore; two brothers, Nixon and John Camper, and three sisters, Elizabeth Jones, Mary Lou Redd and Ella Johns, all of Baltimore.       
         Ada Moore, a singer and actress who performed on Broadway and in jazz clubs across the nation, died on Sunday at the Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 64 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of cancer, her husband, Paul J. Ash, said.         Miss Moore, who was born in Chicago, attended the University of California at Los Angeles, and began her singing career in that city. In 1954, she created the role of Gladiola in the Truman Capote and Harold Arlen musical "House of Flowers."         She sang at many jazz and supper clubs, including the Village Vanguard, the Hungry I in San Francisco and Mister Kelly's in Chicago, and at such theaters as the Apollo in New York, the Howard in Washington and the Royal in Baltimore.         In the 1970's, Miss Moore wrote prose and poetry and published a newsletter, The American Negro Woman. In an article about Bessie Smith, Dinah Washington and Billie Holiday, Miss Moore wrote: "They were not just blues singers, they were innovators who took experience directly from the harsh and dynamic areas of life, refined it and gave it the form and beauty that moved us so much."         Her only survivor is her husband, who is executive vice president of the Sam Ash Music Corporation.         Correction:  January 11, 1991, Friday         An obituary in some copies yesterday about Ada Moore, a singer and actress, misstated her relationship to Paul J. Ash. He is her former husband, not her husband. A corrected obituary appears today on page B7.

         Antoinette Rampinelli Sole, an interior designer, died on Saturday at a convalescent center in Holmdel, N.J. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said her sister-in-law Irene Ramp of Matawan, N.J.         Mrs. Sole was in business with her late husband, George J. Sole, an architect who designed the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Family in Manhattan. In their work, he did the overall designs and she carried out the interior plans for office buildings, churches and private homes. Mr. Sole died in 1973. Mrs. Sole retired in the mid-1970's.         She is survived by three brothers, Joseph Ramp of Matawan, Roy Rampinelli of Brooklyn and John Ramp of Coram, L.I.       
         Janet Woodbury Adams, an authority on decorative screens, died Sunday at Hazelfield, the family farm in Jefferson County, W. Va. She was 60 years old.         Mrs. Adams died of cancer, said her husband, Wiliam Howard Adams, a lawyer and historian.         She was the author of "Decorative Folding Screens: 400 Years in the Western World" (1982; Viking) and curator of "The Folding Image," an exhibition sponsored by Yale University Art Gallery that opened in 1984 at the National Gallery of Art.         She was born in Kansas City, Mo., and graduated from Smith College in 1951.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Sarah W. Adams, a historic preservation specialist of Ithaca, N.Y., and Mary Chatham, an artist of Manhattan, and a son, William S., a lawyer, also of Manhattan.       
         Bertha A. Normano, a teacher of Russian at Middlebury College before her retirement in 1968, died Sunday at the Porter Medical Center in Middlebury, Vt. She was 104 years old and lived in Middlebury.         Mrs. Normano was born in Ekaterinoslav, now Dnepropetrovsk, in Russia. She left Russia in 1919 and lived in Berlin and Paris before coming to the United States in 1931.         She worked at the Latin American Economic Institute and the Institute of Asian Economics in New York before teaching Russian, first at the Asian Institute and then at City College and at Hunter College. In 1951, she became executive secretary of the Middlebury College Russian School, and from 1956 until her retirement she taught Russian there.         Her husband, John F. Normano, died in 1945. There are no survivors.       
         Dorothy Rosenman, an authority on housing and a lifelong advocate of low-cost housing, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.         She began her public-housing activites in the 1920's when she was asked by Ira Robbins, chairman of the housing committee of the United Neighborhood Houses, which represented all the settlement housing in New York City, to help amend the old tenement laws.         Throughout her career, she worked to make the public and legislators aware of the need for community improvement and planning.  Housing for War Workers         In 1933, Mrs. Rosenman became chairwoman of the investment housingcommittee of the Citizens Housing Council of New York and, on its formation in 1941, she was named chairwoman of the National Committee on Housing, where she championed emergency housing for war workers. She spent the early part of World War II in Washington, urging the War Department to release critical materials for emergency housing.         In addition to many magazine articles, she was the author of "A Million Homes a Year," (Harcourt Brace, 1945) and, with her husband, Samuel I. Rosenman, an adviser to Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, she wrote "Some Giants and a Pygmy in the White House," (Harper & Row, 1976). Mr. Rosenman died in 1973.         She was born Dorothy Ruben in Manhattan and graduated from the Montessori Training School in 1918, supplementing her education with studies at Columbia University.         Mrs. Rosenman is survived by two sons, James Rowen and Robert Rosenman, both of Manhattan; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Leona Baumgartner Langmuir, a public health official who was New York City's Commissioner of Health from 1954 to 1962 and later was an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, died on Tuesday in Chilmark, Mass. She was 88 years old and lived Chilmark.         She died of polycythemia, a blood ailment, said her husband, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir.         Dr. Baumgartner, as she was known during her career, joined the Department of Health in 1937 and rose to become its first female commissioner. Characteristically, she shrugged off the distinction, as she did again in 1962 when President John F. Kennedy appointed her to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at A.I.D., making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States Government at the time.         In 1966 Dr. Baumgartner was named visiting professor of social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, a post she held until she retired in 1972. Family Planning Advocate         In her career at the Health Department, Dr. Baumgartner was a strong proponent of improving public-health education and of modernizing government programs, particularly in family planning and in maternal and children's health.         In the national and international health arena, while serving with the Agency for International Development, she established a Research Advisory Council to improve standards of professional quality in grants for health and welfare programs around the globe. She was credited with persuading President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse a policy that had prevented the agency from including birth control in its support of health programs in underdeveloped countries.         Dr. Baumgartner was born in Chicago and raised in Lawrence, Kan., where her father taught zoology at the University of Kansas. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the university and was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Munich before winning a Sterling Fellowship to study at Yale, where she took a Ph.D. in immunology and went on to receive an M.D. from the Yale Medical School.         After internship and residency at New York Hospital she spent a year with the United States Public Health Service before joining the New York City Health Department, where she started as an instructor and served as director of the Bureau of Child Hygiene on her way to the department's top position. Safeguarding Public Health         She left for 18 months in the late 1940's to become associate chief of the United States Children's Bureau, returning to the Health Department in 1950 as assistant commissioner. In 1953 she left again to become executive director of the nonprofit New York Foundation but returned a year later when Mayor Robert F. Wagner promised her a free hand as commissioner.         A woman of seemingly boundless energy, Dr. Baumgartner raced about the city on inspection tours and spoke out on sanitary failures of restaurant kitchens, day nurseries and anywhere else she felt the public health could be safeguarded. For several years she gave a health-education message to a nationwide television audience on a morning program hosted by Arlene Francis.         In contrast to most large cities, as many as 35 percent of the babies born in New York were seen in the city's well-baby and immunization clinics under her direction. Her management of emergency maternity and infant-care clinics for dependents of military personnel in World War II was recognized as innovative.         After the war she undertook a thorough revision of the city's sanitary code and expanded a public health laboratory that had already won acclaim in the field. In 1958 she established a Public Health Research Institute in New York with an annual budget of more than $7 million from municipal money to perform basic and applied research on a wide range of health problems.         Dr. Baumgartner was an early advocate of the Salk vaccine to immunize the public against polio, and one of her last achievements as health commissioner was to win a political battle to fluoridate the city's water supply to prevent tooth decay.         Among the honors Dr. Baumgartner received were the Sedgwick Medal and the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association and the Public Welfare Award of the National Academy of Sciences.         Dr. Baumgartner's first husband, Nathaniel M. Elias, a chemical engineeer, died in 1964. In 1970 she married Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, who survives.       
         Frances Arick Kolb, an education consultant who worked to shape public school curriculums that would encourage achievement by girls and minorities, died last Saturday at Marlborough Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 53 years old and lived in Marlborough.         Dr. Kolb died of breast cancer, said Max McConkey, director of The Network Inc., of Andover, Mass.         She had been associated with The Network, a nonprofit research and training organization since 1980. She was also associate director of the New England Center for Equity Assistance, a federally supported program to provide help to schools dealing with desegregation.         An advocate of textbooks reflecting the contributions of women and minorities, she was the producer of a video directed toward people of Hispanic descent, "Breaking Through -- Portraits of Winners." She also wrote several books including "Portraits of Our Mothers; Using Oral History in the Classroom" (The Network Inc., 1983).         She was a founder and former board member of the Pittsburgh chapter of the National Organization for Women.         Dr. Kolb was born in Worcester, Mass., and graduated in 1958 from Washington University in St. Louis. In 1972 she earned a Ph.D. in American history there.         She is survived by her husband, Alfred, professor of the humanities at Quinsigamond Community College in Worcester; her mother, Beth Arick of Brookline, Mass.; a daughter, Sharon Cohen, also of Brookline, and a brother, Martin R. Arick of Newton, Mass.       
         Marie Provaznik, a leader of the nationalist Sokol gymnastics movement in Czechoslovakia who defected to the United States after directing the Czechoslovak women's contingent at the 1948 Olympic Games in London, died on Jan. 11 at St. Clair's Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y. She was 100 years old, and her family said she suffered a stroke two weeks earlier.         As the leader of 500,000 women in the Czechoslovak Sokol organizations after World War II, Mrs. Provaznik was regarded in her homeland as a national heroine.         Sokol, the Czech word for falcon, symbolizing freedom, was established in 1863 to combine athletics suggestive of an army in training with national democractic resistance. Allowed to Keep Position         At the time of her defection in 1948, the year a Communist Government took over her country, Mrs. Provaznik was president of the women's divisions of both the Czechoslovak gymnastics organization and the International Gymnastics Federation in Geneva.         She was also such a popular figure that when the nation's Sokol leaders were arrested after the Communist takeover Mrs. Provaznik was allowed to retain her position.         Indeed, even after she announced that she would not return to Czechoslovakia after the 1948 Summer Games because "it is the only way to be a free agent," a spokesman for the Czechoslovak Embassy in London praised her as a "fine instructor" and an "outstanding athlete," and declared that she was going to the United States "with the blessing and knowledge of Prague."  Taught in New Jersey         In the United States, Mrs. Provaznik, who became an American citizen in 1954, taught physical education at Panzer College in New Jersey, and was active in Sokols established in New York and elsewhere.         Mrs. Provaznik, whose husband, Frantisek, died in 1948, is survived by a daughter, Dr. Alena Polesny, of Altamont, N.Y.; three grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Jeanne A. Henabery, a public relations specialist in the beauty and fashion field, died on Wednesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, her husband, Robert, said.         Mrs. Henabery was president of Jeanne Henabery Associates, a public relations firm she started in 1970, and was also affiliated with her husband in his broadcast consulting company, Bob Henabery Associates.         She attended Bryant and Simmons College and also took courses at the School of Visual Arts, the Fashion Institute, Baruch College and the Herbert Berghof Studio. She began her career in the public relations department of the General Electric Company in Pittsfield, Mass., and was later with public-relations concerns in Detroit and in New York City.       
         Henrietta Isaacson Bicks, a retired lawyer, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         Mrs. Bicks died in her sleep, said her son David, of Manhattan.         Mrs. Bicks was a partner for more than 20 years in the Manhattan law firm of Campbell & Boland, where she specialized in hotel law. The firm no longer exists.         She was a native New Yorker and graduated from New York University Law School in 1924.         Her husband, Judge Alexander Bicks of Federal District Court in Manhattan, died in 1963.         Besides David, a senior partner in the New York law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae, Mrs. Bicks is survived by another son, Robert, a senior partner in the New York law firm of Breed, Abbott & Morgan, and eight grandchildren.       
         Marie Therese Gehin, a professor of French at Manhattanville College for 30 years, died on Saturday at the Holmdel Convalescent Center in New Jersey. She was 90 years old and lived in Marlboro Township, N.J.         She died of a heart attack, a funeral home representative said.         Ms. Gehin was born in Belfort, France, and educated in Europe. She taught at Manhattanville from 1940 to 1970. She also taught at the Alliance Francaise in Manhattan, Georgetown University, City College of New York and at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Greenwich, Conn. Ms. Gehin also wrote for a newspaper syndicate in Paris.         Her husband, Yuri Kossoff, died in 1972. She is survived by several cousins.       
         Mary Goldburt Siegel, a lawyer who in the 1920's helped break down barriers against women in the legal profession, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94 years old.         She died of lymphoma, a family spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Siegel, a 1917 graduate of New York University Law School, passed the bar examination at a time when there were only a handful of women in the profession. In 1921, after leaving the profession for two years to have a baby, she began to search for a position as a law clerk. At the time, a year as a clerk was a requirement for being admitted to the bar. In a 1982 article written for The Women's Rights Law Reporter, she recalled that while such positions were readily available for men, there were practically none for women.         After a long search, a law school classmate finally hired her at no salary. A few months later, she took another position that paid her $4 a week to do some law research, but in which she primarily ran errands. The salary was $1 a week more than what she had earned operating a sewing machine in a garment center sweatshop when she came from Russia in 1911. Men in similar law clerk positions were being paid $15 to $25 a week.         She finished her apprenticeship at another law firm that gave her broader experience but paid her nothing.         Her first courtroom experience produced other traumas. "When my case was called and I walked over to the appropriate table, a bailiff rushed over to direct me to where he said I belonged -- the spectator's bench," she wrote.         A short while later, the judge presiding over the case asked to speak to the lawyers.         "As I walked toward him, I was reproached by the judge, who virtually sneered when he repeated that he wanted to confer with the legal representatives, not an office stenographer," she added.         Mrs. Siegel said that throughout her legal career she had to fight against the sexist attitudes of colleagues and clients, who usually expected her to work for a lower fee than her male counterparts. She had to prove herself constantly, she said, until the situation improved in the 1960's and 70's as more and more women became lawyers. She was in private practice when she retired about 10 years ago.         Mrs. Siegel was an assistant corporation counsel for New York City during the administration of Mayor John F. Hylan in the 1920's.         Her husband, Jacob, died in 1987. She is survived by a son, Eugene, a certified public accountant in New Rochelle, N.Y.; a daughter, Dr. Irene Thompson, professor emeritus at the University of Florida at Gainesville, and four grandchildren.       
         Jane Murchison Haber, a leader in volunteer activities in Dallas and later in Manhattan, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 years old.         She died in her sleep, a family spokeswoman said.         In Manhattan, where she had lived since the 1970's, Mrs. Haber was a director of the New York Infirmary and a trustee of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. In Dallas, she was a co-founder of the Auction for Cultural Arts and a former chairwoman of the annual Crystal Charity Ball.         She is survived by her husband, Leonard Haber, a New York architectural and industrial designer; three sons and a daughter from her marriage to the Texas businessman Clinton Murchison: Clint Murchison 3d, Burk Murchison and Robert Murchison, all of Dallas, and Coke Anne Saunders of Manhattan, and 11 grandchildren.       
         Gail Paradise Kelly, a professor of comparative education at the State University of New York at Buffalo, died on Friday at Buffalo General Hospital. She was 51 years old and lived in Buffalo.         She died of cancer, university officials said.         Dr. Kelly, who received a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was chairwoman of the Department of Educational Organization, Administration and Policy at the university's Graduate School of Education.         A professor of education at SUNY for 16 years, she was the author or editor of 13 books, including such standard texts as "New Approaches to Comparative Education," (University of Chicago Press, 1986) and "Comparative Education" (Macmillan Press, 1982). Her book "Vietnam to America" (Westview Press, 1977), was a serious look at the plight of Vietnamese refugees.         In the early 1960's, she was national secretary of the Student Peace Union, a group protesting the blockade of Cuba during the 1962 missile crisis.         She is survived by her husband, David Kelly, chairman of the history department at D'Youville College in Buffalo; two daughters, Jennifer, of Manhattan, and Elizabeth, of Buffalo; her father, Joseph Paradise of Rye, N.Y.; a sister, Judith Moskowitz of Manhattan, and a brother, Steven Paradise of Washington.       
         Lilian Bond, an English actress who appeared in more than two dozen Hollywood films in the 1930's, died on Friday at Convalescent Hospital in Reseda, Calif., where she lived. She was 83 years old.         She died of a heart attack, a family spokesman said.         Miss Bond's most celebrated role was in James Whale's 1932 horror comedy "The Old Dark House." She played a naive stranger in a sinister house presided over by a lecherous butler (Boris Karloff).         Her other films included "Just a Gigolo," "Fireman, Save My Child," "Beauty and the Boss," "Hot Saturday," "Pick Up," "When Strangers Marry," "Her Splendid Folly" and "The Bishop Misbehaves." She portrayed Lily Langtry in "The Westerner," starring Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan (as Judge Roy Bean) in 1940. She retired in 1955.         Miss Bond, a native of London, was a graduate of the Brompton Oratory School. As a teen-ager she appeared in pantomimes and revues in London. On Broadway, she starred in several 1920's editions of the "Ziegfeld Follies" and "Earl Carroll's Vanities."         Her third husband, Michael Fessier, a writer, died in 1988. She is survived by a niece, Pam Huffman of Reseda; a stepson, Michael Fessier Jr. of Santa Barbara, Calif., and a stepdaughter, Jo Kelly of Port Angeles, Wash.       
         Edith Bry, an artist who was best known for her work in fused glass, died on Jan. 19 at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         Miss Bry's glass pieces were installed at the Central Synagogue and the Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan, and at the Second Reformed Church in Tarrytown, N.Y. In a 75-year career that began in a New York batik studio when she was 15 years old, Miss Bry also produced oil paintings, enamels, mosaics, lithographs, woodcuts and silkscreen prints.         Miss Bry was born and brought up in St. Louis. She studied at the Art Students' League and with Guy Pene du Bois, and in the 1950's she worked with the painter Abraham Rattner.

In 1929 Miss Bry and her husband, Maurice Shevelson Benjamin, a founder of the brokerage firm Benjamin, Hill & Company, commissioned the noted architect Ely Jacques Kahn to design an Art Deco apartment for them in the Beresford building on Central Park West. The apartment, which became the subject of considerable attention in recent years when architectural magazines proclaimed it one of the city's most intact relics of the Art Deco period, includes woodcut panels Miss Bry executed with Kahn.         Mr. Benjamin died in 1984. Miss Bry is survived by her son, Dr. Bry Benjamin of Manhattan, two grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

She was the chairman of Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival from 1973 to 1987 and underwrote moving several of its productions from the Public Theater to Broadway, including "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "A Chorus Line."         Recalling her support for the arts and her interest in social justice, Mr. Papp said that despite her wealth, "there was nothing in her that suggested anyone was different from anyone else."

Mrs. Mertz, a longtime supporter of dance, was on the board of the Original Ballets Foundation, which operates the Feld Ballets/NY and the New Ballet School.

         Aryness Joy Wickens, an economist and statistician who played the crucial role in developing the Government's cost-of-living index, now the Consumer Price Index, died last Saturday at the Lakeland Health Care Center in Jackson, Miss. She was 90 years old and lived in Jackson.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Wickens retired from the Department of Labor in 1970 after a 42-year career in Fderal service that began when she joined the Federal Reserve Board as a research assistant in 1928 after having taught at Mount Holyoke College for four years.         In 1933 she served on a committee organized by the American Statistical Association to advise Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins on setting up the Bureau of Labor Statistics program. A few years later she directed the bureau's studies for the Temporary National Economic Committee's investigation of monopolistic practices in industry.         When the bureau was reorganized in 1940, Mrs. Wickens became chief of the branch studying prices and the cost of living. From 1946 to 1961 she was assistant and then deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics.         In 1952 she was president of the American Statistical Association. Eight years later, in recognition of her outstanding Government service, she was one of six recipients of the first Federal Women's Awards of the Civil Service Commission. Adviser at U.N.

         Katie Louchheim, a former State Department official and a former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who was a prominent figure in the social life of Washington for four decades, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Louchheim, who had been in failing health for the last few years, died of pneumonia, her family said.         Although she never held elective office, her influence in politics was considerable, beginning in 1934 when she arrived in Washington with her husband, Walter, a Manhattan investment counselor. He had been called on to help organize the Securities and Exchange Commission in the early days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.         Mrs. Louchheim was also a poet, and the Louchheims' house in Georgetown soon became a meeting place for people in politics and the arts. A vivacious woman of enormous energy, she plunged into Democratic Party affairs and worked her way up to become vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 1956 to 1960. Posts in United Nations         Along the way, she held various appointed government posts. In World War II she served in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation and helped form its United Nations counterpart, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, for which she went to Europe in 1945 to arrange press relations at camps for displaced people.         President John F. Kennedy gave her a post in the State Department, and within two years she was named Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, at that time the highest job in the department ever held by a woman.         She moved to other State Department posts through the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson and was United States Ambassador to the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization until 1969, when the Republicans took power under President Richard M. Nixon. Rejected Republican Roots         Mrs. Louchheim was born in Manhattan in 1903. Named Kathleen Scofield, she was known for most of her life as Katie. The daughter of a Manhattan stockbroker, she grew up in Republican surroundings; when she moved to Washington in Roosevelt's first term she was a prime example of what people called "a traitor to one's class."         She attended Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, Conn., and studied in Europe before marrying Mr. Louchheim in 1926.         She published a collection of poems, "With or Without Roses," in 1966. Her autobiography, "By the Political Sea," came out in 1970. She wrote "The Making of the New Deal -- The Insiders Speak," published by Harvard University Press in 1983.         After her husband died in 1973, Mrs. Louchheim moved back to Manhattan. In 1981 she married Donald S. Klopfer, a co-founder of the publishing concern Random House; he died in 1986.         She is survived by two daughters, Mary Evangelista of Manhattan and Judith Read of Darien, Conn.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Alice Vansteenberghe, a World War II Resistance hero and physician who testified against the Nazi Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie, has died, officials said Tuesday. She was 82 years old.         No cause of death was given.         At Mr. Barbie's war-crime trial in 1987, Dr. Vansteenberghe said that Mr. Barbie tortured her and broke her back after her arrest in 1944. Dr. Vansteenberghe, who died Saturday, was confined to a wheelchair.         Dr. Vansteenberghe said she recognized Mr. Barbie's irregularly shaped ear lobe, which she had memorized while he was torturing her.         She and her husband, Andre, were active in the underground group Straight-Shooters. Both remained in the Lyons area after the war and practiced medicine.         Her husband died last year.         Mr. Barbie headed the Gestapo section that captured Jean Moulin, leader of the Resistance. Mr. Moulin died under torture in 1943.         Mr. Barbie, who lived in Bolivia for many years after the war, was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity.

         Katinka Loeser, many of whose short stories were infused with what a critic described as "autobiographical sketches of warmth and charm," died Wednesday in Norwalk (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Westport.         She died of kidney failure, said her daughter, Jan DeVries.         Miss Loeser published three collections of stories, most of which first appeared in The New Yorker: "Tomorrow Will Be Monday: Stories of Parents and Children" (1964); "The Archers at Home" (1968), about a suburban couple afflicted with empty-nest syndrome, and "A Thousand Pardons" (1982), stories about a Westport couple who enjoy their lives and the changing seasons.         Miss Loeser was born in Ottumwa, Iowa, on July 2, 1913, and grew up in Chicago. She started writing poetry when she was 14. In 1943 she won the Young Poet's Prize of Poetry magazine, and her poems later appeared in The New Yorker. She was notified of the Young Poet's Prize in a telegram from the editor of Poetry, the humorist Peter DeVries, whom she married later that year.         In an interview in 1982, Miss Loeser maintained that it is more difficult to write short stories and poetry than novels. With a poem, she said, "You're thinking in abstract terms and trying to get a rhythm." In a novel, she added, "There is more leeway." But to be a successful writer of any kind, she added, "you have to be a decent reader from the time you're small."         At the University of Chicago, from which she graduated in 1936, Miss Loeser studied under the playwright Thornton Wilder, one of her favorite teachers. When she taught a writing class at the Westport Division of Continuing Education in the 1970's, she adopted the Wilder method of reading his students' stories out loud, anonymously, and having the other students critique them.         Miss Loeser is survived by her husband and three children: Jan DeVries of Media, Pa.; Peter Jon, of New York City, and Derek, of Santa Monica, Calif.

She died of cancer, her husband, the sculptor Tony Rosenthal, said.         Mrs. Rosenthal was president of the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic District, a preservationist group she helped found to monitor compliance after the district's 1981 designation by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission.         This month, she was to receive the Doris C. Freedman award from Mayor David N. Dinkins. The award is given each year to the person who has done the most for the arts in the city. In February, she received the Historic Districts Council's 1991 Landmarks Lion Award in recognition of her efforts for preservation.  Born in Warsaw         Mrs. Rosenthal, a small friendly woman noted for her cordiality in the thick of debate, nevertheless described herself as a "hellion" when it came to pursuing measures she believed in. She worked to defeat plans for the expansion of the Whitney and the Guggenheim museums, and more recently opposed a proposal to place newsstands on Fifth Avenue.         Over the last 18 years, she supported landmark designation for scores of buildings. She also played an important role in zoning that prohibited structures of more than six stories on the midblocks between avenues outside the Upper East Side Historic District.         Mrs. Rosenthal was born in Warsaw and grew up in Cannes, where she spent her childhood at a Catholic convent. At the end of World War II, she met her husband, then a lieutenant in the United States Army, while attending a sculpture course he was teaching at an Army school in Biarritz in France.         Her interest in preservation began in 1973 upon the couple's purchase of a house on East 73d Street in Manhattan, when she founded the 73d Street Block Association for the purpose of planting trees.         A funeral will be held on Thursday at 11 A.M. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, at 112th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.       
         Ruth Page, a pioneering American ballet dancer and one of the first ballet choreographers to employ American subject matter, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 92 years old.         She died of respiratory failure, said Andrew Mark Wentink, her biographer.         Miss Page, who arranged Rudolf Nureyev's New York debut by engaging him for one of the companies she directed, was involved with an almost bewildering array of activities. She performed with Anna Pavlova's classical ballet company, with Serge Diaghilev's avant-garde Ballets Russes and with German Expressionist modern dancers.         She appeared in opera houses around the world, danced at the coronation of Emperor Hirohito of Japan in 1928 and gave programs in the Soviet Union in 1930. But she remained proudly American, making Chicago the base of her activities and refusing to change her name at a time when many Americans adopted exotic stage names.  Wide Range as Choreographer         An eclectic choreographer, Miss Page is known for "Hear Ye, Hear Ye" (1934), a ballet about a murder trial to a commissioned score by Aaron Copland; "An American Pattern" (1937), a feminist protest against conformity; "Billy Sunday" (1948), a ballet derived from a fiery evangelist's sermons, and several ballets based on famous operas.         During the 30's, her partner was Bentley Stone, an American choreographer with whom she occasionally collaborated on works. Their most enduring achievement is "Frankie and Johnny," which was inspired by a bawdy old ballad about love and betrayal. Since its premiere in 1938, it has been successfully revived by many companies, including Dance Theater of Harlem. Reviewing a production by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1947, John Martin, who was then the dance critic of The New York Times, wrote, "It convinces you of its human truth even while you are chortling at its crude and uninhibited sentimentalities."         Miss Page was born in Indianapolis on March 22, 1899, the daughter of Dr. Lafayette Page, a brain surgeon, and Marian Heinly, a pianist. Her parents encouraged her desire to dance and sent her to study with local teachers. In 1914, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova was a guest at the Page house and was so impressed by Miss Page that she encouraged the teen-ager to make dancing her career. Miss Page appeared briefly with Pavlova's company that year.         Moving to Chicago, Miss Page studied with Adolph Bolm, a former member of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes who had settled in America and was staging productions both for Chicago companies and for his itinerant Ballet Intime. In 1919 Bolm choreographed "The Birthday of the Infanta" for Miss Page, one of the first 20th-century ballets with a score by an American composer (John Alden Carpenter) and scenery by an American designer (Robert Edmond Jones).  In a Stravinsky Premiere         Bolm and Miss Page again made history in 1928, when she portrayed Terpsichore in the world premiere of Stravinsky's "Apollo," choreographed by Bolm in Washington months before George Balanchine created his more familiar version of the ballet for Diaghilev.         Miss Page married Thomas Hart Fisher, a well-to-do Chicago lawyer, in 1925, and on her honeymoon in Europe danced with Diaghilev's company. While she was with the Ballets Russes, Balanchine choreographed two divertissements for her, "Etude" and "Polka Melancolique," which are believed to be his first works created for an American.         Always curious about dance forms, Miss Page studied with Mary Wigman, the great German Expressionist choreographer, in 1930. In 1933, she toured with another important German modern dancer, Harald Kreutzberg.         During the 1940's, she staged works in Chicago and for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She choreographed "Revanche," a ballet version of "Il Trovatore," for Les Ballets des Champs-Elysees in Paris in 1951, and "Vilia," an adaptation of "The Merry Widow," for the London Festival Ballet in 1953. Their success prompted her to found the Chicago Opera Ballet in 1956, a touring company that featured ballets inspired by operas and operettas. Yet it also presented internationally known stars in classial excerpts. It was with this troupe that Mr. Nureyev made his New York City debut in 1962. Later known as Ruth Page's International Ballet, it continued until 1970.  An Annual 'Nutcracker'         In Chicago in 1965, Miss Page staged a production of "The Nutcracker" that remains an annual event in that city. She frequently revived her works for regional companies and directed the Ruth Page Foundation School of the Dance, which will continue under the direction of Larry Long.         Miss Page's first husband, Mr. Fisher, died in 1969. She married the French artist and stage designer Andre Delfau in 1983. Miss Page was the author of "Page by Page" (1980) and "Class" (1984). She received the Dance Magazine Award in 1980 and the Illinois Gubernatorial Award in 1985, and held honorary degrees from Indiana University, De Paul University and Columbia College of Chicago.         She is survived by her husband and a brother, Dr. Irvine Page of Hyannis, Mass.       
         Sadie H. Zaidens, a dermatologist and psychiatrist, died on April 1 at St. Clare's Hospital and Medical Center. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.

She wrote articles on the psychosomatic aspects of dermatology.         She was a native of Manhattan and a graduate of George Washington University and the university's medical school. She studied and practiced with her husband, Morris A. Brand, the medical director of the Sidney Hillman Health Center, who died in 1968.

In 1942, she married Fred Berk, a dancer with whom she presented programs of Jewish dance. She began the first classes in Jewish folk dance at the 92d Street Y and with her husband created the Jewish Dance Repertory Group. They also conducted folk dance festivals for the Hebrew Arts Committee at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         Miss Delakova lived in Israel from 1953 to 1958 after her divorce from Mr. Berk. It was there, after studying with Moshe Feldenkreis, that she became interested in Eastern movement disciplines, such as Hatha Yoga, which she also taught.

She was 90 years old.         She died of cancer, a family spokesman, Frank Lieberman, said.         On "Gilligan's Island" Miss Schafer played the wife of Thurston Howell 3d, portrayed by the late Jim Backus. They were among the marooned charter boat passengers.         The comedy show originally ran on CBS from 1964 to 1967 and remains enormously popular in reruns.

Miss Schafer was born in Red Bank, N.J. She appeared in a number of Broadway productions from the 1920's though the 1950's, including Moss Hart's "Lady in the Dark" (1941), Peter Ustinov's "Romanoff and Juliet" (1957) and Dore Schary's "Highest Tree" (1959).

One was for Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn. Another was for the New York Botanical Garden that culminated in the restoration of its conservatory, renamed the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory for its donor, and the establishment of endowments for its maintenance.         Her last fund-raising campaign in the late 1970's resulted in the acquisition of the Mashomack forest preserve on Shelter Island by the Nature Conservancy, a national environmental organization.         Mrs. Bond was born in Bradford, Pa., graduated from Skidmore College and did graduate work in child psychology at Yale.         Her husband survives her.

         Ruth Shatz, a cattle breeder and civic leader, died on Sunday at her home in Coral Gables, Fla. She was 86 years old.         She died in her sleep, a family spokeswoman said.         Before moving to Florida in 1955, Mrs. Shatz and her late husband, Hyman, operated Phileidor Farms in Carmel, N.Y., where they bred prize Guernsey cows. Mrs. Shatz also served as vice president and director of the Mahopac Hospital, now known as the Putnam Hospital Center in Carmel, and was active in the Red Cross. After moving to Florida, she served as treasurer of the Palm Society, an international organization of horticulturists. She also translated several books into Braille.         She is survived by two daughters, Dorothy Lonergan of Miami, and Eileen Oseroff of Rochester, ; a son, Phillip, of Freedom Plains, N.Y.; eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Shirley Goodman, a driving force behind the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York for more than four decades, died on Sunday at her Manhattan apartment.         She was 75 years old and had had cancer for many years, a spokeswoman at the institute said.         "If there is a single person whose vision and guidance have been most influential in shaping F.I.T., that person is Shirley Goodman," Marvin Feldman, the president of the institute, said.         Ms. Goodman worked tirelessly for the institute, cajoling designers and editors into lecturing, talking manufacturers into opening their showrooms to students and persuading corporations to donate money.         At her death, she was the institute's executive vice president emeritus and executive director of the Educational Foundation for the Fashion Industries, a fund-raising and advisory group for the college, which has been a part of the State University of New York since 1951.         Since her arrival at the fashion institute in 1949, it has grown from two floors of borrowed space in a nearby high school to an eight-building complex on West 27th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Ms. Goodman is credited with leading the expansion from a small trade school to a specialized college offering 24 majors in fashion design, art, business and technology. The college's graduates include Calvin Klein, Norma Kamali, John Anthony and Stephen Burrows.  Building Named for Her         "I didn't start F.I.T., but I helped build it and broaden it," Ms. Goodman said in an interview in 1978. In recognition of her contributions, the college in 1975 dedicated one of its buildings as the Shirley Goodman Resource Center. It houses a library, galleries, a graduate center and a design laboratory with one of the country's largest collections of fashion costumes and textiles.         Throughout her career, Ms. Goodman worked in community and government organizations promoting the fashion industry. She was an honorary professor of the Bunka College of Fashion in Tokyo. She was also director of liaison for the fashion industries at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959 and 1967, executive director of Fashion Capital of the World Inc. from 1973 to 1974, and a trustee of the Coty Awards. In 1975, the Fifth Avenue Association named her Woman of the Year and in 1976, Business Week magazine listed her as one of the 100 top corporate women in the United States.         She joined the fashion institute in 1949 to help draft the legislation making the five-year-old college part of the State University system. She expected to stay there six months, she later said, but never left.         Born in Virginia and reared in North Carolina, Ms. Goodman always retained a trace of a gentle Southern accent that seemed to temper her toughness as a business woman and a fund-raiser. People in the fashion industry described her as "a dynamo" and "a woman of simple dignity and pride." Despite several bouts with cancer, she refused to retire, saying: "When you retire you get old and tired. You don't stay vital."         She is survived by her husband, Himan Brown, a radio and television producer; two sons from a previous marriage, Alan Fishman of New York and Barry Fishman of San Rafael, Calif., and a grandson. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held at 5 P.M. May 20 at the institute's Haft Auditorium.       
         Harriet Fleischl Pilpel, a lawyer and civil libertarian who was a prominent advocate of women's rights, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Pilpel died of a heart attack, her husband said.         Last Wednesday, she received an award from the New York Civil Liberties Foundation, one of many such awards she had received. At her death she was first vice chairwoman of the National Advisory Council of the American Civil Liberties Union.         Mrs. Pilpel, a frequent guest on the television program "Firing Line" with William F. Buckley Jr., was associated with the Manhattan law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which she joined in 1982.

In 1961, she argued successfully for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America against a suit asking the Supreme Court to rule on Connecticut laws that would have made it a crime to use birth-control devices or for doctors to advise their use. The Court declined 5 to 4 to rule on the laws.         In 1965, Mrs. Pilpel represented Dr. Benjamin Spock in a free-speech suit over whether advertising in his best-seller "Baby and Child Care," violated the public interest. The court ruled against Dr. Spock, who sought to block the ads.         She graduated from Vassar College in 1932 and received a master's degree from Columbia University Graduate School in 1933. She received a law degree from Columbia in 1936.         She is survived by her husband, Irvin B.

         Lisa Taylor, director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design from 1969 to 1987, died on Friday in a hospital in Nassau, the Bahamas, said David McFadden, the museum's curator of decorative arts. She was 58 years old and lived in Naples, Fla.         Mr. McFadden said she died of liver cancer.         The museum's current director, Dianne Pilgrim, said through a spokesman that Mrs. Taylor "had a passionate belief in the importance of design and brought that passion and excitement to the museum."         The museum, in the former Andrew Carnegie mansion at 2 East 91st Street, is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It closed in 1963 but reopened in 1976, after Mrs. Taylor played a major role in raising funds to install it in the renovated mansion.         Grace Glueck, The New York Times critic, wrote in 1976, "The museum's far-reaching collection covers 3,000 years of artistic production, but it is also very much in touch with contemporary concerns, such as urban planning and the environment." 'Wallpaper to Bird Cages'         What is now the Cooper-Hewitt Museum originated as a part of Cooper Union, which had housed it since 1897. In the 1960's, financial problems led Cooper Union to end its ties with the museum, which by then was what Paul Goldberger, The Times critic, called "one of the world's finest storehouses of objects of design and the decorative arts -- with everything from collections of wallpaper to bird cages."         In 1969, the secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, named her as head of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. In 1972 the Carnegie Corporation donated the mansion, and over the next four years Mrs. Taylor and her staff managed to obtain more than $6 million from private individuals, corporations and foundations.         It was Mrs. Taylor who had the idea for the annual Museum Mile open house and street fair involving museums along upper Fifth Avenue. It was first held in 1979, and 10 museums participated last year.         In 1976, Mrs. Taylor said, "I think we'll be a great success, because we have a superb collection and people are becoming more and more aware of how design relates to the quality of life. And besides, there's a feeling of love for us because we've made it." Edited Design Series         Mr. McFadden said Mrs. Taylor retired in 1987 for reasons of health and to work on the final volumes in a series of books she edited. The series, titled "Immovable Objects," comprises six books of essays by various authorities on the impact of design on daily life. The volumes have separate topics ranging from urban open spaces to the subways.         Mrs. Taylor was born on Jan. 8, 1933, in New York, the daughter of Theo von Bergen-Maier, an architect, and the former Martina Weincerl, a painter.         She studied at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington and at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities.         She was on the staff of the President's Fine Arts Commission in Washington from 1958 to 1962 and membership director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington from 1962 to 1966. She then joined the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, where she helped to devise a highly successful Smithsonian educational program before being named to head the Cooper Union Museum.         She was awarded honorary doctorates by the Parsons School of Design and Cooper Union.         She is survived by her second husband, Bertrand L. Taylor 3d, who is an investor; their daughter, Lauren, and their son, Lindsay, all of Naples, Fla.

Ms. Golden did oil paintings, woodcuts, stained-glass works and, in recent years, large drawings in colored pencil. Her artwork was exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the Vorpal Gallery in San Francisco and elsewhere around the country.         She was a skilled equestrian and did many drawings of horses, often in verdant Virginia landscapes.

         Tatiana du Plessix Liberman, the leading hat designer for Saks Fifth Avenue for 20 years, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan and Warren, Conn.         She died of congestive heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Liberman, whose original name was Tatiana Yacovleff, was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on May 7, 1906, into a professional family that found sanctuary in Paris after the Bolshevik Revolution. She studied painting and sculpture, but also learned millinery to earn a living.         She was married to a French diplomat, Bertrand de Plessix, from 1929 until 1940 when he was killed by the Germans in their conquest of France.         She fled to New York with their daughter in 1941 and began designing hats for Henri Bendel. Within a year, she joined Saks Fifth Avenue and became head of its custom hat salon, designing with the signature Tatiana du Plessix until its Salon Moderne closed in 1963.         The designs were often praised by fashion reporters as irresistible. In 1950, Virginia Pope of The New York Times hailed the milliner as "a perfectionist" in assembling both materials and colors and for artful originality in flattering women of many types. The 1951 collection, Miss Pope wrote, excells in "both wit and wisdom."         In 1942, the designer married Alexander Liberman, an artist and editorial director of Conde Nast Publications. Mr. Liberman was an adolescent friend and fellow Russian emigre in Paris.         They kept close ties with friends from the Paris days and later with prominent Soviet artists who settled in the West, including Joseph Brodsky and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The couple's homes were also gathering places for friends like Salvador Dali, John Gunther, Marlene Dietrich and Christian Dior.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Liberman is survived by a daughter, the writer Francine du Plessix Gray, of Warren, Conn., a sister, Lila Duchess of Caylus, France, and two grandsons.       
         Elinor Remick Warren, who composed more than 200 works for orchestra and voice, died at her home on Saturday. She was 91 years old.         Miss Warren was born in Los Angeles, attended Mills College, and studied with musicians in New York and Paris. Her first choral-orchestral work, "The Harp Weaver," was introduced at Carnegie Hall in 1936. Her "Legend of King Arthur" was first performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1940.         Miss Warren's husband, Z. Wayne Griffin, a film producer, died in 1981. She is survived by a daughter, two sons and five grandchildren.       
         Lucy Jane Ford Buhler, former president of the Women's Investment League, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.

Carville of Point Pleasant, N.J., and Mary Alice Jones-Ohlemann of Lake Oswego, Ore.; and eight grandchildren.       
         Kathryn Teaze, a Red Cross volunteer whose more than 70 years of service spanned two world wars, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Fairfield, Conn. She was 93 years old and lived in Weston, Conn.         She died of pneumonia, a family spokesman said.         Her mother started the Red Cross chapter in her hometown of Bloomfield, N.J. Mrs. Teaze's late husband, Moses, was president of the chapter and of the Westport-Weston chapter after the couple moved to Connecticut in 1950.         She joined the Red Cross at the age of 18, shortly after the start of World War I, and became captain of the motor corps for the chapter in Bloomfield.

         Nettie S. Horch, an arts patron and co-founder of the Master Institute of United Arts in New York City, died at the Humana-Biscayne Hospital in North Miami on Monday. She was 94 years old and lived in Hallandale, Fla.         She died of bronchitis, her daughter, Oriole Farb Feshbach, said.         The Master Institute, which began as a music school with a collection of Old Master art works, was founded by Mrs. Horch in 1922 with her husband, Louis. Its purpose was to help bring people together through the arts.         In 1928 the Horches incorporated quarters for the Institute in a 29-story residential skyscraper they built at Riverside Drive and 103d Street. Their aim was to provide an environment of art and culture for apartment dwellers, and they developed the concept that income from the apartments would support the art activities of the Institute. The building contained a 300-seat theater, a non-profit school of fine arts, studio apartments for musicians and dancers, and the Riverside Museum, a small, vanguard institution that became known for showing work that differed from the prevailing currents in the art world.  Equality in Acquisitions         Mrs. Horch became the director of the museum, which not only housed the couple's collection of Tibetan, American, and American Indian art, but mounted many early shows by artists who were later to become well-known, like Louise Nevelson. The museumdevoted a number of shows to the work of women, and under Mrs. Horch's direction, presented in 1939 the first exhibition by the Abstract American Artists, whose work ran against the social realist trend of the time. The museum also gave shows to the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. In 1940 it mounted one of the earliest exhibitions of work by Puerto Rican artists.         As fine arts chairman of the National Council of Women of the United States, from 1937 to 1954, Mrs. Horch was interested in fostering the work of women artists, and mounted a series of group shows devoted to women of various nationalities, among them Japanese, Canadian and Norwegian.         In 1971, after Mrs. Horch and her husband moved to Florida, the museum was closed, and its holdings became the Louis and Nettie Horch Collection at Brandeis University. Mr. Horch died in 1979.         Besides her daughter, who lives in Leonia, N.J. and Amherst, Mass., Mrs. Horch is survived by a brother, Nathan Stone of Lake Worth, Fla., four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

         Ana Cristina Bozzo, an art teacher at Hunter College High School who spent the last decade organizing the International Art Show for the End of World Hunger, died Monday at Doctors Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said Alexandra Poe, a board member of Artists to End Hunger Inc., the corporation that presented the show.         Working in her living room at night, on weekends and on vacations, Ms. Bozzo, who was born in Buenos Aires, assembled the show by asking noted artists to donate or lend works that represented their vision of a world without hunger.         She ended up with 46 pieces by artists including Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Louise Bourgeois, Marisol and Robert Rauschenberg. The exhibition toured 18 cities around the world, starting with a preview in Washington in 1986 and ending in March at El Museo del Barrio in New York City.         The show was not intended to raise money; its goal was to spread the message that the earth has abundant resources to feed everyone. But with Ms. Bozzo's encouragement, local organizations used the show as an opportunity to raise money and educate people about hunger. Ms. Bozzo also inspired students at Hunter to raise money for hunger relief.         Twenty of the works from the show are being auctioned by Sotheby's, and five are to be offered for private sale. Ms. Poe said they are expected to raise about $500,000. Proceeds will be given to the relief organizations God's Love We Deliver, City Harvest, Manos Unidas and Save the Children.         Ms. Bozzo is survived by her husband, Rogelio Chomnalez of Manhattan, and her parents, Manuel and Dora, and a brother, Carlos Antonio, all of Buenos Aires.

         Edwina Booth, an actress who made headlines in the 1930's when a mysterious illness ended her film career, died Saturday. She was 86 years old.         Miss Booth, whose death had been erroneously reported several times since she contracted an illness while filming "Trader Horn" in Africa, died in the Medallion Convalescent Hospital in Long Beach, her brother, Booth Woodruff, said.         "Her death has been wrongly reported so many times, including recently in the book 'The Making of the African Queen' by Katharine Hepburn," Mr. Woodruff said. "But this time she really did die."         Miss Booth appeared in the films "Manhattan Cocktail" in 1928, "Our Modern Maidens" in 1929, and serials like "The Vanishing Legion" and "The Last of the Mohicans." But it was her role in "Trader Horn" and her subsequent illness that made headlines. Silent Became a Talkie         The film, a melodrama about the so-called "white goddess" of an African tribe, began as a silent picture but ended as one of Hollywood's new "talkies." The cast and film crew had to mark time in Africa for several weeks waiting for the new sound equipment to arrive.         After release of the film in 1931, Miss Booth became ill and was confined to bed for more than five years. She sued Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for more than $1 million, claiming that the studio had failed to safeguard her health in Africa while the movie was being made. The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Miss Booth never made another movie.         Miss Booth's husband, Reinhold Fehlberg, died in 1984.         In addition to her brother, Miss Booth is survived by a sister, Betty Benson, and two stepdaughters, Judy Larson and Dixie Nelson.

Dame Peggy was in the Old Vic company in the early 1930's, frequently appearing with John Gielgud in the 1930's and 40's. She often performed in the West End of London in the 1950's and with the Royal Court, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1956 and in 1962 she became the first British actress to have a theater -- the Ashcroft, in her hometown, Croydon -- named after her in her lifetime.         When she was in her mid-70's Dame Peggy won her greatest international acclaim from roles involving two visits to India. She played a saintly, enigmatic Englishwoman in David Lean's film of E. M. Forster's novel "A Passage to India" and then was cast as a doubting former missionary in a television mini-series, "The Jewel in the Crown," based on Paul Scott's "Raj Quartet."         She won a 1984 Academy Award as best supporting actress for the film; the New York Film Critics Circle voted her best actress. The two performances brought her Britain's top film and television awards. She had previously won a string of awards as the finest actress on the British stage, and in April she won a special Laurence Olivier Award, London's major theatrical prize, for lifetime achievement in the theater. A Juliet to Remember         Dame Peggy was praised as a natural actress who projected an inner serenity and moral gravity. She illumined all of Shakespeare's young leading women and was hailed as the finest Juliet of her generation, artfully attuning her performances to Gielgud and Olivier versions of Romeo and Mercutio as the actors alternated in the roles throughout a season.         Detractors called some of her early performances too genteel and cool, too English bourgeois, but over the decades she displayed increasing versatility in plays by Shaw, Sheridan, Chekhov, Wilde and Ibsen. With uncommon ease she worked closely with new generations of theater people and in later years played Shakespearean matrons and roles created by Edward Albee, Marguerite Duras, Harold Pinter and Beckett.         Her talents included portraying the rejected, the lonely and the oppressed with unsentimental sympathy. As Winnie in Beckett's "Happy Days," she was required to spend the first half of the performance buried up to her waist, the second half to her neck. It's "the greatest part ever written," she said, "nearer to Everywoman than any other I can think of, and like climbing Everest to perform."         In approaching hundreds of roles, including 10 leads in a season at the Old Vic, she tirelessly sought psychological truths. "Acting," she said in 1985, "is a mysterious business, so complicated, so tender a subject, there are no rules, and I think one works instinctively."  'Shimmering Radiance'         Defining her art in "Peggy Ashcroft," a 1988 biography, the critic Michael Billington cited her ear for language, her emotional identification with characters and avoidance of vulgarity and affectation.         Sir John Gielgud spoke of the actress's "shimmering radiance and a kind of forthright, trusting quality." The director Peter Hall said she maintained in old age an "extraordinary immediacy and passionate naivete." Harold Pinter said, "This flame of life she possesses informs all she does."         Dame Peggy appeared in only a few movies. Her most memorable early one was a vignette in Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 thriller, "The 39 Steps," as a farmer's wife who bravely aids the hero (Robert Donat).         In making films she missed the theater's long, searching rehearsals. The problem with films, she said, "is that you have to imagine everything in sufficient detail before you begin."         "With the theater," she added, "there is time to try things out. With filming, it is hit or miss."         She said appearing in films was "instant acting" because a film actor might have to begin at the end of a scene or a movie and not be able to build a role. "Also, you're in the hands of a director and an editor who can cut and shape, and you have no idea how," she said. "And, of course, there's no sharing with an audience, no rapport."         Dame Peggy said she had no desire to retire. "Just a rest after the rather full years I had in India," she said in 1985. "Then I'll wait and see what television or film or the theater bring."         She cherished privacy and granted few interviews, once explaining gently, "I'm not interested in myself, very." But she was outspoken in protesting injustices and inhumaneness, at home or abroad. She criticized apartheid in South Africa and protested the sentencing of a Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovsky, and political arrests in Czechoslovakia.         Edith Margaret Emily Ashcroft was born on Dec. 22, 1907, in Croydon, a London suburb, to William Worsley Ashcroft, an estate appraiser, and the former Violetta Maud Bernheim. Her father was killed in World War I when she was 10 and her mother died when she was 18, leaving her elder brother, Edward, as her only close relative.         She studied at the Woodford School in Croydon and after discovering "it was very exciting to become someone else," she said, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Her varied roles included Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello in 1930, stardom as Juliet and Shakespeare's other golden girls, as she called them, and title roles in Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," John Drinkwater's "Mary Stuart" and Arthur Schnitzler's "Fraulein Elsa."         A 1989 biography of Paul Robeson by Martin Bauml Duberman revealed that Dame Peggy and the actor had had an affair during the run of "Othello," and quoted her as saying, "How could one not fall in love in such a situation with such a man?"         Later roles included an alcoholic mother in "Edward, My Son," in both London and New York; an unloved spinster in "The Heiress," leading parts in Brecht's "Good Woman of Setzuan," Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and "Rosmersholm" and the 10-hour tour de force as Margaret of Anjou in the Royal Shakespeare Company's "Wars of the Roses."         Dame Peggy was married and divorced three times. She is survived by two children, Nicholas, a director, and Eliza, by her third husband, Jeremy Hutchinson, a lawyer. Her previous husbands were Rupert Hart-Davis, a publisher, and Theodore Komisarjevsky, a director.       
         Concetta Cornacchia Roy, a former high school teacher and administrator in New York City who founded the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, died on Friday at the Long Island Jewish Hospital in Queens. She was 84 years old and lived in Queens Village.         She died of Hodgkin's disease, a spokesman for the family said.         Mrs. Roy began her career as a business teacher at Girls High in Brooklyn. In 1955, when she was a teacher at Flushing High School in Queens, she was elected president of the High School Teachers Association, where she sought to improve working condition for city high school teachers.         In 1964, she founded the Council of Supervisors and Administrators of the New York City public school system, a union group. She also founded the Retired School Supervisors and Administrators in 1971, the year she retired.         She is survived by her husband, Leo, a retired high school teacher, and a sister, Esther Giordiano of Floral Park, Queens.       
         Anne Roe Simpson, a clinical psychologist and educator, died last Wednesday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 87 years old.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         Dr. Roe, who used her maiden name, retired in 1984 as an adjunct professor of psychology at the University of Arizona. She joined the faculty in 1967, after having taught at Harvard University since 1959.         She received her Ph.D. in 1933 from Columbia University. Her research included the psychology of people of superior intellect, alcoholism and its effect on creative artists and creativity in scientists. She wrote more than 100 books and articles, including "The Making of a Scientist," published in 1952 by Dodd, Mead.         Her husband, George Gaylord Simpson, a scientist, died in 1984.         She is survived by three stepdaughters, Helen Vishniac, a professor at Oklahoma State University; Joan Burns, a writer, of Williamstown, Mass., and Elizabeth Wurr, a psychologist, of Woodside, Calif.; a brother, Robert of Alexandria, Va.; a sister, Pat Oldt of Little Switzerland, N.C.; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Jacqueline Murray, a lawyer who was active in community affairs in Rye, N.Y., died on Thursday at her home in Rye. She was 71 years old.         She died of heart failure, a funeral home representative said.         Mrs. Murray graduated from Columbia law School in 1943 and was associated with the law firm of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn for about six years before leaving to raise a family. She later worked with Meals on Wheels and was chairwoman of the Board of Zoning Appeals in Rye.         She is survived by her husband, Ralph; a daughter, Kathleen Wheatman of Fremont, Calif; three sons, David, of Rye, Philip, of Yonkers, and William, of Farmingdale, L.I., and six grandchildren.       
         Dorothy B. Strong, a lawyer who was admitted to the bar in the late 1920's, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         She died of heart failure, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Strong graduated from New York University Law School in 1927. She went into private practice in Manhattan and in 1945 she moved to Chicago, where she performed legal work for her husband, a banker.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Louis R. Burman of North Miami Beach, Fla.       
         Joan Caulfield, an actress who starred in films of the 1940's and in television situation comedies of the 1950's, died on Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.  She was 69 years old and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         She died of cancer, a hospital spokesman said.         Miss Caulfield was propelled to stardom by the films "Monsieur Beaucaire," in which she appeared with Bing Crosby, and "Blue Skies," with Bob Hope, both released in 1946, and by "Dear Ruth," appearing opposite William Holden, in 1947. On television she was a co-star of "My Favorite Husband," on CBS from 1953 to 1957, and "Sally" on NBC in the 1957-58 season.         Miss Caulfield, who was a native of West Orange, N.J., attended Columbia University and was a fashion model and a cover girl before she landed ingenue roles on Broadway in the early 1940's. Her first stage success was in the 1943 production of the comedy "Kiss and Tell," in which she appeared for 14 months. Paramount Pictures promptly offered her a contract and she began her Hollywood career with "Miss Suzie Slagle's," in 1946. Occasional Film Appearances         Her films made the most of her beauty, although she was determined to win a reputation as an actress and not, as she said, "just a decoration."         In 1950, Miss Caulfield married the film producer Frank Ross and subsequently appeared only occasionally in films. She and Mr. Ross were divorced in 1960. She later married Robert Peterson, a dentist, from whom she was also divorced.         She is survived by two sons, Caulfield Kevin Ross of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and John Caulfield Peterson of Sacramento, Calif.; two sisters, Mary Parker of Stuart, Fla., and Elizabeth Victor of Los Angeles, and a grandson.         Correction:  June 21, 1991, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Joan Caulfield, the actress, reversed the identities of the male stars in two films. Bing Crosby starred in "Blue Skies," Bob Hope in "Monsieur Beaucaire."       
         Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter who was married to the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure after suffering from lymphoma, a family spokesman said.         For the last 40 years, she had worked for charitable causes, including the Girl Scouts, the Endowment Fund of Mount Vernon and the Abigail Adams Smith Museum in Manhattan.         In 1946, she became a reporter at The Washington Times-Herald, now defunct. She wrote a sociey column, "Under My Hat," and later wrote a syndicated column, "From the Capital." She was also a commentator for the Columbia Broadcasting System.         She and William Randolph Hearst Jr., chairman of the Hearst Corporation, were married in 1948. Her first marriage, to Igor Cassini, the designer, ended in divorce.         Mrs. Hearst, who left the newspaper business in 1956, wrote "The Horses of San Simeon," (San Simeon Press, 1985), a book about breeding and raising horses.         She was a graduate of the College of Notre Dame of Maryland in Baltimore.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, William Randolph Hearst 3d, publisher of The San Francisco Examiner, and Austin, of Manhattan, vice president of Hearst Entertainment and Syndication, a division of the Hearst Corporation, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.         Correction:  June 25, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter whose husband is the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, misstated the occupation of her first husband, Igor Cassini. He was a newspaper columnist. (Oleg Cassini, the designer, is Igor Cassini's brother.)       
         Anna Paisner, a retired businesswoman who was active in charitable affairs, died on Wednesday at Parkway General Hospital in North Miami Beach. She was 91 years old and lived in North Miami Beach.         She died of congestive heart failure, a grandson, Daniel, said.         From 1943 to 1953, Mrs. Paisner was a partner in the Economy Trading Corporation, importers of canned fish in Manhattan. She was also a partner in the Modern Manufacturing Braid Company, novelty braid and fabric manufacturers in Manhattan from 1935 to 1972, when she retired.         Her husband, Benjamin Paisner, a Manhattan businessman, died in 1967.         She is survived by two sons, Gilbert, of Roslyn Heights, L.I., and Sidney, of Great Neck, L.I.; a sister, Bonnie Gottlieb of Equinonk, Pa.; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Sorel, a former fashion model, died Monday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Sorel died of complications from leukemia, said her daughter, Claudette.         In the 1920's and early 1930's, Mrs. Sorel was one of the most sought-after models in Paris, modeling for members of the haute couture like Jean Patou, Jacques Fath and Chanel. A native of Budapest, she came to the United States in the early 1940's and, with her husband, operated Sorel Belt Creations in Manhattan. The store was later sold. She also worked for Saks Fifth Avenue as an accessories designer for Sophie Gibel.         With her husband, Michel, who died in 1989, Mrs. Sorel operated the Shelton Apartments Inc., a real estate firm in Manhattan, from 1947 to her death.         She is survived by a daughter, Claudette, a concert pianist and a professor of music at the State University of New York at Fredonia, of Manhattan.       
         Candy Jernigan, a painter, sculptor and set designer, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She was 39 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of liver cancer, said a friend, Jed Wheeler.         Ms. Jernigan was known for witty, vivid collagist work that was as much social commentary as art. It incorporated maps, landscapes, rocks and found objects, and it often took the form of one-of-a-kind printed books that included short autobiographical writings. Her work has been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Albright-Knox Museum in Buffalo, the Bronx Museum and the Boston Children's Museum, as well as several galleries in New York City. Her theater work included sets for John Moran's multi-media opera "The Manson Family" and collaborations with XXY Dance/Music, a multi-media dance company.         Ms. Jernigan is survived by her husband, the composer Philip Glass, a stepdaughter, Juliet, and a stepson, Zachary, all of Manhattan; her mother, Pauline Bauer of Jupiter, Fla., and a sister, Audrey Hart of Key West, Fla.         A memorial service will be held at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street, on Friday at 1 P.M.       
         Jiang Qing, the widow of Mao and herself a leader of China during some of its most tumultuous years, has committed suicide, the Government announced tonight. She was 77 years old.         Ms. Jiang was serving a life prison sentence for her role as leader of the Gang of Four. That name was given to the group of radical Communist leaders whose closeness to the all-powerful Mao enabled them to speak in his name and carry out what they said were his policies during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.         Ms. Jiang killed herself in the early hours of May 14, the official New China News Agency reported. The three-paragraph dispatch did not say how she had committed suicide or why, and it was impossible to confirm the account. The agency said also Ms. Jiang had been receiving medical treatment outside prison since May 1984. Grew Up in Poverty         Raised in conditions so poor that hunger reportedly left her with lifelong stomach problems, Ms. Jiang grew up to become a beautiful actress, then used her marriage to Mao to reach the apex of power in China and help preside over the brutal persecution and chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She tried to build her own power base and exercised real control over much of Chinese culture, but in the end she owed her authority, and her ability to inspire fear, to her link with Mao. When he died in 1976, she and her allies in the Gang of Four were soon overthrown.         Few people have been so hated in modern Chinese history, and after her fall she became a symbol of the excesses and brutality of the Cultural Revolution. When her trial was televised each night at the end of 1980, most of the nation was delighted and riveted by the spectacle of Ms. Jiang in the dock. She refused to repent, and even taunted the court to chop off her head.         It was grand drama, for Ms. Jiang could be cruel, petty, ruthless and couragious. Above all, her ambition was dizzying.         "Sex is engaging in the first rounds," she once told an interviewer. "What sustains interest in the long run is political power."         The delay in announcing her death almost certainly was linked to the Government's concern about possible protests leading up to the second anniversary today of the army crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement. While it would be difficult to imagine university students taking to the streets to mourn her, the authorities apparently thought it best not to take any risks. Tiananmen Date Passes Quietly         In fact, the Tiananmen anniversary passed quietly today, and Ms. Jiang's death seems unlikely to have any major impact on the Chinese political scene. While there is some nostalgia for Mao, his widow was linked with just the kind of ideological extremism from which many Chinese are now trying to escape.         Ms. Jiang (her name is pronounced jyahng ching) came to symbolize the fanatical egalitarianism and passion for ideology of the Cultural Revolution years. Paradoxically, China has returned half a step in that direction in the last two years, and the present leadership is almost certainly far closer to her ideologically than to the growing number of young intellectuals who are waiting for a post-Communist period to dawn.         To many young Chinese, there is not much difference between Ms. Jiang and some of the neo-Maoist hard-liners who remain in power. Ms. Jiang was faulted for persecuting intellectuals, for insisting on an inane uniformity in the arts and for joining in the violent suppression of a democracy movement at Tiananmen Square -- an earlier one, in 1976. Those are precisely the complaints that young people have about some of today's leaders.         During the Cultural Revolution, Ms. Jiang oversaw mass rallies in which her enemies were humiliated and physically abused. She also is said to have sought out and killed those who spurned her in earlier years.         One of her grave miscalculations, in retrospect, was to make an enemy of Deng Xiaoping, now China's senior leader, and denounce him as an "international capitalist agent."         Ms. Jiang has been widely criticized for her ambition and for her efforts to exploit her relationship with Mao for personal gain. There is no doubt that the former actress offended other leaders, usually men, with her aggressiveness, and many accused her of using beauty and sex to win power.         Ms. Jiang caught Mao's eye in the caves at Yanan, the Red Army's hideaway in northern China during the civil war against the Nationalists, in 1938, and she scandalized top Communist officials when the couple apparently began living together before Mao got around to divorcing his previous wife, a respected revolutionary. Ms. Jiang was Mao's third wife, not counting a childhood betrothal that was never consummated.         Apparently because of indignation at the divorce of the second wife and a sense of impropriety that Ms. Jiang was just 24 years old while Mao was 45, party officials reportedly insisted that Mao could marry Ms. Jiang only if she never exercised any political power.         Mao kept that bargain for decades, even after the Communist victory of 1949 established him as the leader of the People's Republic of China. In the 1950's, Ms. Jiang held only minor posts in the cultural world, and there are some indications that the marriage was not going well. Ms. Jiang was in Moscow for health treatment, for example, when Mao made a state visit to the Soviet Union. But he did not visit her. Role in Cultural Revolution         In the 1960's, as Mao felt his influence waning and as he worried about the Communist Party becoming ossified and corrupted by years in power, he launched the Cultural Revolution. Ms. Jiang was involved in the planning of the Cultural Revolution and came to play an increasingly important role in that period.         As Deputy Director of the Cultural Revolution Group, Ms. Jiang appeared at rallies beginning in 1966 and praised the Red Guards, young followers of Mao who were dragging the country into chaos. Her status rose, and she became firmly linked to the faction that favored prolonged revolution and class struggle.         She served on the party Politburo, was in charge of literature and the arts and promoted "revolutionary operas" and other works intended to foster a suitable ideological outlook.         Mao died in September 1976, and within a month she and the other members of the Gang of Four -- Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan -- were toppled in a virtual coup d'etat. There was widespread rejoicing in the streets. Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Yao apparently remain in prison, or at least in some form of house arrest. Steadfast in Her Views         For all the accusations that she was a callow opportunist, Ms. Jiang was one of the few top Chinese leaders over the last few decades who stuck to her views even when they were unpopular. Even Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, revered by many Chinese, bent with the political winds, but after she was arrested and faced the possibility of a death sentence, Ms. Jiang did not renounce her fervent Maoism.         "I was Chairman Mao's dog," she said in her defense. "Whomever he told me to bite, I bit."         After a famous show trial that began in November 1980, Ms. Jiang was sentenced to death, with a two-year reprieve. This was commuted to life imprisonment, and the New China News Agency said in its dispatch today that she had been "out of custody and receiving medical treatment since May 1984."         Earlier this year, an official Chinese newspaper suggested in a rare report about Ms. Jiang that she was still adamantly opposed to the present Government policies. The newspaper, the Hainan Daily, wrote that she "twists her lips, snorts and even says some nonsense like 'This is not the Chairman's revolutionary line.' "         While it might seem strange that the Communist Party leadership could continue to hail Mao during the 1980's while excoriating and imprisoning his widow, the two were not close by the time Ms. Jiang achieved power. By the 1970's they lived apart, and a Chinese book published last year asserted that Ms. Jiang had to request permission from the party Central Committee's Work Office to see her husband. Interviews With U.S. Scholar         Some of the best insights into Ms. Jiang came from a remarkable series of interviews she gave in 1972 to an American scholar, Roxane Witke. Ms. Jiang apparently was attempting to bolster her stature with the interviews. Rivals denounced her for making unauthorized statements, and in the end the interviews hurt her badly.         Jiang Qing, named Li Jin at her birth in March 1914, told Ms. Witke that she had had a miserable childhood. Her mother was a concubine and her father a small-town landowner who beat mother and daughter until they fled home.         At age 14 she joined an underground theater troupe in Shandong Province. At age 16, bereft even of underwear, she went off to Beijing with a traveling theatrical group without consulting her mother. She said that she made contact with the Communists in Qingdao, a port city in Shandong, and that she joined the party in 1932.         In Shanghai, the most exciting city in China in those days, Ms. Jiang played bit parts in a variety of plays, and later films, as well as a few larger roles. One of her roles was that of Nora, the rebellious modern woman, in Henrik Ibsen's "Doll's House," which was then very much in fashion in China.         Actors were then scorned in China, but the theater was dominated by leftist politics and increased her political awareness. She also married or lived with at least two men in this period, and in later years she went to great effort to cover up her early romances and failures. She also sought during the Cultural Revolution to punish anyone who had looked down on her during her Shanghai days.         She asserted that she had been kidnapped by Nationalist agents and held for eight months; whether or not that was true, she did flee Shanghai for the Communist base at Yanan, where she met Mao.         After the triumph of the revolution in 1949, she, like other Communist leaders, developed a taste for luxury. Even during the Cultural Revolution, when she was hailing egalitarianism and posing for pictures doing agricultural labor, she enjoyed foreign films, gourmet meals and the use of a private airplane.         There were rumors in recent years that Ms. Jiang was suffering from throat cancer and that she was refusing to be treated, but it was unclear if this was life-threatening.         Her only known child was a daughter, Li Na, fathered by Mao. According to a Chinese account, Li Na visited Ms. Jiang regularly in Qincheng Prison in the early 1980's but refused to write to the authorities to request her release.         At her daughter's refusal, Ms. Jiang is said to have hurled a watermelon to the ground and protested: "Even you do not care for me. You are heartless."       
         Lorraine Walters Katz, a retired owner of a children's clothing store in Deal, N.J., died on Monday at Riverview Hospital in Red Bank, N.J. She was 66 years old and lived in Deal.         She died of lymphoma, her husband said.         From 1960 to 1980, she owned and operated Young World.         Mrs. Katz was born in Asbury Park, N.J., and was a graduate of the University of Miami. She was a member of the first women's advisory board for First Merchants Bank, now Midlantic National Bank, in Asbury Park in 1970.         She is survived by her husband, Stanley R. Katz, the mayor of Deal; four sons, Richard, of West Long Branch, N.J., Steven, of Livingston, N.J., Robert, of Minneapolis, and Jonathan, of Tucson, Ariz.; a sister, Helen Rosengarten of Monmouth Beach, N.J., and 10 grandchildren.       
         Sylvia F. Porter, the author and newspaper columnist who gained wide readership by making business and financial news easy for the general public to understand, died on Wednesday at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. She was 77 years old.         She died of complications from emphysema, her husband, James Fox, said.         Miss Porter, who wrote more than a score of books on investment, taxes and other economic subjects, also reached 40 million readers through her column on personal finance. It was syndicated by The Los Angeles Times and carried five days a week by 450 newspapers around the world.         From the mid-1930's, when her column began appearing regularly in The New York Post, Miss Porter specialized in reporting events of the financial and business worlds in terms that translated what she called their "bafflegab." Her arrival on the economic scene came at a propitious time: the public was slowly recovering from deep disillusionment with a Wall Street community that many blamed for plunging the country into the Great Depression.         In 1978 she moved her column from The Post to The Daily News, where it continued under the title "Your Money."  Molded by 1929 Market Crash         Miss Porter was born into a Russian-Jewish family in Patchogue, L.I., on June 18, 1913. Her father was a physician, and her mother became a successful milliner. She grew up in Brooklyn and was a freshman at Hunter College who intended to major in English literature and history when the stock market crashed in 1929.         Her mother had invested $30,000 in the bull market of the late 1920's and lost it all. The daughter rethought her career goals and plunged into the study of economics. She earned a Phi Beta Kappa key at Hunter and graduated magna cum laude in 1932, the same year that she and Reed F. Porter, a bank employee, were married.         She went to work for a small investment counseling firm in Wall Street and gained firsthand knowledge of the stock and bond markets, currency fluctuations, business cycles and other financial basics. She also took graduate courses at the New York University School of Business Administration.         She began writing in specialized financial journals, using the byline S. F. Porter to conceal the fact that she was a woman in a field then dominated by men. In 1934 she wrote a weekly column in The American Banker on United States Government securities and soon started her own information service on Government bonds. A Crusader Role Adopted         In 1935 Miss Porter began an occasional column in The New York Post on financial news. In a matter of months she was a regular writer on Wall Street for the paper, and in 1936 she was appointed financial editor. She wrote a daily column that was published under the title "S. F. Porter Says."         Miss Porter became a crusader against what she perceived as economic injustice. She bluntly criticized Government officials for their fiscal policies, at one point asking in an article in The American Banker whether the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., had been guily of "obstinacy, stupidity or sheer ill advice" in managing Government bonds.         Mr. Morgenthau, like many other figures in the economic world, was unaware that S. F. Porter was a woman. When he did find out, and when officials acknowledged that many of her barbs were justified, he sent her a bouquet of roses.         Other Washington figures were not so forgiving. When she attacked Senator Edwin Johnson of Colorado for his advocacy of silver, he called her "the biggest liar in the United States." Author of Many Books         In 1939 she wrote the first of her many successful books, "How to Make Money in Government Bonds." The book combined her inside knowledge with a popular style, making her information useful to professionals and at the same time accessible to the public.         In her second book, "If War Comes to the American Home," published in 1941 on the eve of America's entry into World War II, she drew on the experience of World War I to tell families how they might be affected in a war economy.         A reviewer in The New York Times summed up her approach this way: "Facts, figures, broad word-pictures and succinct arguments are all presented with conversational ease."         Although her books were published under her full name and she had been heard on radio, it was not until 1942 that The Post changed the title of her column to "Sylvia F. Porter." The newspaper's acknowledgement of her sex brought prominence on the lecture circuit and requests for articles from women's magazines and periodicals of general circulation.         Her column was syndicated, beginning in 1947, and she collaborated with the tax specialist J. K. Lasser on financial handbooks for taxpayers, as well as with other specialists on parallel projects in various economic fields.  Posthumous Book Planned         In 1975 she published "Sylvia Porter's Money Book: How to Earn It, Spend It, Save It, Invest It, Borrow It and Use It to Better Your Life." It sold more than a million copies. Her most recent book, "Sylvia Porter's Your Finances in the 1990's," appeared last year, and her last book, "Planning Your Retirement," is to be published in September.         Not all Miss Porter's ventures were successful. In 1984 she started a magazine, Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance, which rapidly became the third largest periodical in its field, behind Time Inc.'s Money and the Kiplinger organization's Changing Times. But the stock-market plunge in 1987 dealt her publication a lethal blow, and in 1989 its list of 400,000 subscribers was bought by Kiplinger.         Miss Porter's second husband, G. Sumner Collins, died in 1977. Besides Mr. Fox, a public-relations counsel, she is survived by a daughter, Chris Del Cuore of Norway, Me.; a stepson, Sumner Collins of Medical Lake, Wash.; a brother, Dr. John L. Feldman, a physician of Palos Verdes, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Anita Hart Balter, an artist and writer well known for her role in fostering the arts in the Hudson Valley, died on June 29 at her home in Garrison, N.Y.         Mrs. Balter, who was 57 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla., died of complications from breast cancer, a family spokesman said.         Her activities were directed at both art and broader community development. She was the founder and operator of Gallery Forecast, now defunct, in Peekskill, in which well-known sculptors chose emerging talent for exhibition to draw the attention of the many corporate headquarters in the region.         Mrs. Balter, who was born in Amsterdam and moved to the United States with her family just before World War II, was also on the board of the Garrison Art Center, where she established a Scholarship and Mentor Program in which artists worked with promising local pupils. In 1987 she was a founding board member of the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival.         She is survived by her husband, Lee; her mother, Jenny Hart; a brother, Herbert Hart of Monte Carlo, Monaco; and, by a former marriage, a daughter, Elise Hart of Berkeley, Calif., and two sons, Michael Sheffrin of Majorca, and Ivan Sheffrin of Washington, and a grandson.       
         Mildred Dunnock, the actress best known for her performances in stage and screen productions of "Death of a Salesman," died Friday evening at Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Oak Bluffs, Mass. She was 90 years old, said her daughter, Linda McGuire.         Her daughter said that Miss Dunnock died of old age. She lived in West Tisbury, Mass.         Miss Dunnock was nominated for Academy Awards for her film performances as Linda Loman, the salesman's wife, in "Death of a Salesman" (1951) and for her performance in Tennessee Williams's "Baby Doll" (1956).         She was small and slight with a thin, mobile mouth, and she excelled at playing the parts of mothers and eccentric ladies of various kinds. Her admirers praised her power to move audiences by making them care for the characters she portrayed.  Broadway's First Linda Loman         Miss Dunnock originated the Linda Loman role on the stage, appearing with Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman in the 1949 Broadway production of "Death of a Salesman," by Arthur Miller. She later played that part in the film, in regional productions and on television.         Appraising the film, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times that "as the long-suffering wife, Mildred Dunnock is simply superb, as she was on the stage" in her "portrayal of a woman who bears the agony of seeing her sons and husband turn out failures."         In an interview late in her career, Miss Dunnock observed: "I like to play parts that are not like myself. I'm not the least bit exciting. I'm an ordinary person in an ordinary life, but in my imagination there's no stopping me."         Among her other major portrayals were Lavinia in Lillian Hellman's "Another Part of the Forest," Big Mama in Tennessee Williams's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," and Miss Ronberry in "The Corn Is Green," a 1940 Emlyn Williams play starring Ethel Barrymore.  Many New Haven Productions         Miss Dunnock performed in numerous stage productions at the Long Wharf theater in New Haven over the decades, including the parts of Mrs. Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and the mother in Mr. Williams's "Glass Menagerie."         She taught in the late 1960's at the Yale Drama School. Over the years she also taught at Barnard College and at the Brearley School in Manhattan.         Mildred Dunnock was born in Baltimore Jan. 25, 1901, her daughter said. She earned an A.B. degree from Goucher College there and an M.A. from Columbia. She first appeared on Broadway in the early 1930's.         She became, as one New York Times writer, Warren Hoge, put it in 1976, "an institution among first-nighters, the creator of several major characters in American dramatic literature, a performer studied and revered by younger actors and actresses."         She is survived by her husband of almost 60 years, Keith Urmy, who is a retired executive of Chemical Bank in Manhattan; their daughter, Linda McGuire, an actress who teaches at the Educational Center for the Arts in New Haven; a granddaughter, Patricia McGuire, an actress who is a member of the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., and two grandsons.

         Bessie Goldman, co-founder of Farmland Dairies Inc. in Wallington, N.J., died yesterday at her home in Fairlawn, N.J. She was 95 years old.         She came to this country from Russia with her husband, Max, in 1915. The couple founded Fairlawn Dairies Inc., which in 1970 was renamed Farmland Dairies of Wallington and is one of the largest privately owned dairies in the country.         Starting with 20 cows milked by hand, the business grew to employ 350 people and include a fleet of 300 trucks, processing more than a million gallons of milk a week and selling the milk and other dairy products and juices to supermarkets and small stores from Maine to Virginia.         In 1987, after a five-year legal challenge by Farmland, a ruling by a Federal District Court judge opened the New York City market to the company, upsetting a 50-year domination by a powerful group of distributors.         Mrs. Goldman retired in 1955. Her husband died in 1962.         Mrs. Goldman is survived by a son, Jacob, of Glen Rock, N.J.; two daughters, Ethel Weiner of Elmwood Park, N.J., and Margaret Stager of Paterson, N.J.; 16 grandchildren, and 19 great-grandchildren.       
         Mimi Schnall, a Westchester County Democratic committeewoman, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 57 years old and lived in Greenburgh, N.Y.         Mrs. Schnall died of gall bladder cancer, her husband said.         She was elected first vice chairwoman of the Westchester Democratic Committee in 1986. She was also a former chairwoman of the Town of Greenburgh Democratic Committee for many years, a delegate to the 1980 Democratic National Convention in Manhattan and the Westchester County coordinator for Mario M. Cuomo's first campaign for governor.         Beginning in 1974, Mrs. Schnall was director of volunteers for the Westchester Lighthouse, a local subsidiary of the New York Lighthouse for the Blind, for 17 years.         She is survived by her husband, Albert, executive vice president of Complus Data Innovations Inc. in Hawthorne, N.Y.; a daughter, Lisa Schnall of Brooklyn; three sons, Michael, of White Plains, David, of Bedford, N.Y. and Peter, of Washington; a brother, Dr. Robert Ascheim of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
         Patricia Robbins Beatty, an award-winning author of 50 children's books, died on Tuesday at the Riverside (Calif.) Community Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in Riverside.         She died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Beatty's books were generally admired for their evocation of both the humor and the harsh realities of the American West in the 19th century. Her more recent novels, including "Charley Skedaddle" (1987), which won the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, dealt with the Civil War.         She was born in Portland, Ore., and spent much of her childhood in the Northwest, sometimes living on Indian reservations. She graduated from Reed College in Portland and became a children's librarian and a high school teacher of English and history.         She began to write when her children were small and drew on her knowledge of the Quileute Indians for her first book, "The Indian Canoe Maker," published in 1960 by Caxton Press. Eleven books that followed were written in collaboration with her first husband, Dr. John L. Beatty, a professor of history at the University of California at Riverside, who died in 1975.         In 1974, she received an award for a distinguished body of work from the Southern California Council on Children's Literature. In 1988, she established the John and Patricia Beatty Award through the California Library Association to encourage the writing of children's books about the culture and heritage of California.         A forthcoming book, "Jayhawker," the story of a young abolitionist during the Civil War, is to be published by Morrow Junior Books in October.         She is survived by her second husband, Dr. Carl Uhr, a professor of economics at the University of California at Riverside; a daughter, Alexandra Beatty, and two grandchildren.       
         Ruth Frankenthaler Feldon, the first woman to become a trustee of Congregation Emanu-El in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her daughter said.         Mrs. Feldon was named a trustee of Congregation Emanu-El in May 1957 and remained in the post until 1967.         She was born in Manhattan, the daughter of George Frankenthaler, a State Supreme Court justice, and Marion Hendricks Frankenthaler. She graduated from Vassar College in 1939.         Her first husband, Richard Lewisohn Jr., died in 1976, and her second husband, Richard Feldon, died in 1988.         She is survived by three children from her first marriage: a daughter, Aileen Godsick of Manhattan, and two sons, Richard Lewisohn 3d of Manhattan and Clifford Lewisohn of Teaneck, N.J.; a sister, Anne F. Kohn of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.       
         Katherine Byrne Mast, one of the first female sugar brokers in New York City, died on Wednesday in a nursing home in Devon, Pa. She was 84 years old and lived in Naples, Fla.         Mrs. Mast died of Parkinson's disease, said her nephew, John Ferguson of Greenwich, Conn.         During the early 1930's, she worked in the Manhattan office of W. H. Edgar and Son, sugar brokers of Detroit. She remained with the company until her marriage some 20 years later.         After her husband's death in 1964, she took over his business, Dutton, Mast & Company, a textile concern in Manhattan. The company was later sold.         From 1969 to 1986, when she retired, Mrs. Mast was president of Aug Millang, realtors in Manhasset, L.I.         She was a gradute of All Saints Academy in Harlem and of Trinity College in Washington.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Lee Remick, the elegant actress who illumined dozens of films and many stage and television plays, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 55 years old.         The actress died of cancer after fighting the disease for two years, a spokesman for the family said. In one of her last public appearances, a star was dedicated in her honor in April on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.         Ms. Remick, an uncommonly versatile performer, portrayed characters as disparate as a seductive cheerleader and a tormented alcoholic, along with such historical figures as Lady Randolph Churchill and Eleanor Roosevelt.         Once billed as "America's answer to Brigitte Bardot," she was as much admired for her acting abilities as for her bubbly attractiveness. Writing in The New York Times of her performance in the 1980 television movie "The Women's Room," John J. O'Connor said, "Lee Remick proves once again she is an uncommonly gifted actress whose somewhat fragile, almost stereotyped good looks tend to distract one from that fact."         Ms. Remick, who was born in Quincy, Mass., studied dance as a child and won her first acting job at age 16 with a summer-stock company on nearby Cape Cod. This led to a part in a short-lived Broadway comedy, "Be Your Age," in 1953, several more summer-theater appearances and a string of television roles on "Philco Playhouse," "Hallmark Hall of Fame," "Playhouse 90" and other programs in the mid-1950's. 'I Chucked School'         Later in her career, when asked about her decision to give up school in favor of acting, she said: "I'd cut classes to go to rehearsals, then stay up all night studying, but it wasn't working, and one day a very kind teacher advised me to choose one or the other. I guess the strain was showing. Anyway, it was an easily made decision. I chucked school, told my parents and then slept for 10 days."         After the director Elia Kazan cast Ms. Remick as a seductive cheerleader in his 1957 film, "A Face in the Crowd," she gave highly praised performances in Martin Ritt's "Long Hot Summer" (1958), Otto Preminger's "Anatomy of a Murder" (1959) and Mr. Kazan's "Wild River" (1960). Her portrait of a happily married housewife turned alcoholic in Blake Edwards's "Days of Wine and Roses" (1963) brought her an Academy Award nomination. Subsequent film roles included "Baby the Rain Must Fall" (1965), "Loot" (1972), "Sometimes a Great Notion" (1972) and "The Europeans" (1979).         She chose her roles with care. "After 'Anatomy,' in which I played a kind of tramp, for instance, I could have followed up with more of the same," she told an interviewer. "Reinforcing my 'image' by becoming a sex symbol would have been one way to be more strongly identified as a star, but I had no interest in doing that. I can't be something I'm not." On Broadway and Television         Ms. Remick's most successful Broadway performance was in Frederick Knott's 1966 thriller, "Wait Until Dark," about a blind woman at the mercy of three criminals. Her other stage credits included "Anyone Can Whistle," the 1964 musical by Arthur Laurents and Stephen Sondheim, and a Boston production of John Pielmeier's play "Agnes of God" in 1982.         Ms. Remick was a frequent star in television mini-series in the 1970's and 80's. She played the title role in "Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill" (1975) and also starred in "Ike" (1979), "Haywire" (1980), "Toughlove" (1985) and "Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder" (1987).         Reviewing Ms. Remick's performance in "Nutcracker," a 1987 NBC mini-series in which she played a woman who manipulates her son into committing murder, Mr. O'Connor wrote in The New York Times: "If she had been born with Bette Davis eyes or Katharine Hepburn cheekbones, she might long ago have been recognized as one of this country's most outstanding dramatic actresses."  Of Preparation and Humility         Ms. Remick was known to prepare intensively for her roles, attending meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous for her work in "Days of Wine and Roses" and spending a month of blindfolded mornings at New York's Lighthouse for the Blind before starring in "Wait Until Dark."         "I'm really a housewife who is incidentally an actress," Ms. Remick told an interviewer. On another occasion she said: "People tell me that I have a special quality in films, but if I do I take no intellectual credit for it. It's pure instinct. I think I've held on to certain qualities within myself which have been strong."         Ms. Remick's marriage to William A. Colleran, a producer and director, ended in divorce in 1969. Her survivors include her husband of 21 years, Kip Gowans, a producer; a daughter, Kate Colleran Sullivan; a son, Matthew Remick Colleran; two stepdaughters, Justine Gowans Solly and Nicola Gowans, and her mother, Pat Packard.         Correction:  July 29, 1991, Monday         An obituary on July 3 about the actress Lee Remick omitted one of her survivors. He is her brother Bruce Waldo Remick of Springfield, Va.       
         Barbara J. Eichner, director of the Family Life Center of the Hackensack Medical Center in New Jersey, died on Saturday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 52 years old and lived in Closter, N.J.         Mrs. Eichner died of breast cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Committed to helping the victims of child abuse and neglect throughout her career, she joined the center as director in 1988. From 1977 to 1988, she was director of the Family Center of the Passaic County Mental Health Center.         She was born in Brookline, Mass., and graduated from Barnard College in 1960. She received a master's degree from the Columbia School of Social Work in 1963.         Her husband, Alfred, died in 1988.         She is survived by two sons, Matthew, of Closter, and James, of Washington; her mother, Florence Aranov of Ridgewood, N.J., and a sister, Janet Bauer, of Ridgewood.       
         Armina Marshall, an actress, a playwright and a co-administrator of the Theater Guild whose career on Broadway spanned more than half a century, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her son, Philip Langner.         For nearly four decades beginning in the early 1920's, Miss Marshall, together with her husband, Lawrence Langner, and Theresa Helburn, co-founders of the Theater Guild, guided the subscription company through its glory years as one of the most successful producers of Broadway plays.         Miss Marshall and Mr. Langner, who had been married 37 years when he died in 1962, were the co-authors of seven plays, three of which made it to Broadway, including the 1933 hit "Pursuit of Happiness."         Miss Marshall, who was part American Indian, was born on the Cherokee Strip in what was then the Oklahoma Territory and spent her early school years in Pawnee, where her father was the sheriff. The family moved to the West Coast, and she attended the University of California at Los Angeles and taught school in Brawley, Calif., while playing small parts at local theaters.         She moved to New York to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and in 1922 was introduced to Mr. Langner, a patent lawyer.         Miss Marshall was accepted into the Theater Guild and acted in several plays in succeeding years. In 1925 she and Mr. Langner were married. With Miss Helburn, a drama critic and director, the Langners built the Theater Guild into a Broadway powerhouse that by the time of Miss Helburn's death in 1959 had produced 190 attractions in New York City, in nine other cities across the country and in London.         The guild brought dozens of memorable productions to Broadway. Perhaps the most celebrated was "Oklahoma!" in 1943. The show, which blended narrative and song with ballet, transformed American musical theater almost overnight.         Among the outstanding playwrights whose work the guild produced were George Bernard Shaw, Eugene O'Neill, S. N. Behrman, Robert Sherwood and Maxwell Anderson. Actors who were guild regulars ranged from James O'Neill, Eugene's father, to Eva Le Gallienne, Claudette Colbert, Humphrey Bogart, Judith Anderson, Shirley Booth and Judy Holliday. Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontanne acted together in 19 guild-produced plays, Mr. Lunt alone in 4 others and Miss Fontanne alone in 2.         Miss Marshall was the associate director of "Theater Guild of the Air" for its eight-year run on radio and of "The U.S. Steel Hour" for eight years on television.         Miss Marshall's theatrical interests extended well beyond the guild. In World War II she was a founder of the Stage Door Canteen in Washington. She was also a founder of the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn., and a director of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Fund, with which she was active until five years ago.         In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, Miss Marshall is survived by two granddaughters.         Correction:  July 23, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary headline yesterday about Armina Marshall, an actress and playwright, misstated her connection with the Theater Guild. She was a co-administrator, not a co- founder.       
         Bernice Jacobson, a retired consumer advocate who specialized in complaints about mail-order services, died on July 8 at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications after surgery, her family said.         Her first husband, Henry Zeeman, died in 1963 and her second husband, Morty Jacobson, died in 1969.         Surviving are a son, Roger Zeeman of Bridgewater, N.J.; a brother, Warren Hirsch of Weston, Conn., and a grandson.       
         Carol Rubinstein Schickel, a television producer and theatrical lighting designer, died on Saturday at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 51 years old.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Richard Schickel, the film critic. .         As a husband-and-wife team, Ms. Rubinstein and Mr. Schickel co-produced several television specials, including "Minnelli on Minnelli: Liza Remembers Vincente" for the Public Broadcasting Service and "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" for Turner Network Television. She also co-produced the filmed sequences for the last two Academy Award broadcasts.         Ms. Rubinstein was born in Troy, Ohio, and received a Master of Arts from the Yale Drama School. She was a lighting designer for several regional theaters, including the Williamstown (Mass.) Theater Festival and the Whole Theater Company of Montclair, N.J. Her Off Broadway credits include such shows as "Now Is the Time" and "The Last Sweet Days of Isaac." On Broadway she was the assistant lighting designer for "Jesus Christ, Superstar," "Pippin" and a 1982 revival of "Othello."         Her first marriage, to Arthur B. Rubinstein, a composer, ended in divorce.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her mother, Charlotte Foy, of Troy; a daughter, Alexandra Rubinstein, of Pasadena, Calif., and two step-daughters, Erika Schickel, of Los Angeles, and Jessica Schickel, of Northampton, Mass.       
         Clara Parker, who was the daughter of the founder of the Concord Resort Hotel in Kiamesha Lake, N.Y., and who took an active part in its development and interior design, died on Sunday at her home in Kiamesha Lake. She was 74 years old.         Mrs. Parker died of the effects of a stroke suffered a year ago, a family spokesman said.         Her husband, Raymond, is chairman of the resort in the Catskills, the nation's largest independently owned family resort hotel.         Mrs. Parker became interested in breeding and raising cattle in the 1930's after meeting Henry A. Wallace, then the Secretary of Agriculture. With Mr. Wallace's help, she experimented in genetics in the raising of the brown Swiss breed. She continued her efforts at the family's farm in Grahamsville, N.Y., and more recently at its 10,000-acre ranch at Rancho Arroyo Grande in California.         Mrs. Parker is survived by her husband, Raymond; a brother, Jules Winarick of Southampton, L.I.; three sons, Robert and James, of Kiamesha Lake, and George, of Tuxedo Park, N.Y.; two daughters, Naomi Friedman of Purchase, N.Y., and Laurie Parker of Kiamesha Lake; 10 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Sylvia Scribner, a psychologist on the faculty of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Scribner died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Dr. Scribner's research centered on cultural influences on learning and development. One of her best-known projects involved studying the literacy of the Vai people of western Liberia, who invented an original writing system. She detailed her research in a book, "The Psychology of Literacy," for which she received the Melville J. Herskovitz Award from the African Studies Association in 1982.         Before joining the faculty of the CUNY Graduate School in 1981, Dr. Scribner was a research scientist at the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington and, from 1978 to 1979, was associate director of the National Institute of Education. From 1970 to 1978 she was senior research associate at Rockefeller University.         She graduated from Smith College in 1944 and earned a Ph.D. from the New School for Social Research in 1970. She began her career as research director for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America in Newark.         Her husband, David Scribner, a lawyer, died in April.         She is survived by a son, Oliver, of Vancouver, B.C.; a daughter, Aggie Kapelman of Manhattan; three step-daughters, Toni Scribner of St. James, N.Y., Wendy Scribner of Manhattan and Nancy Jaslow of Abington, Pa., and two grandsons.       
         Elaine P. Halperin, a translator and editor, died on Sunday at her home in La Jolla, Calif. She was 81 years old.         She died of cancer, said her son, David.         Mrs. Halperin's first major work of translation was Francis Ambriere's "Long Holiday," a World War II prison camp memoir published in 1948. She translated several other works of fiction and nonfiction from French into English, including Michael Bernanos's 1968 novel, "The Other Side of the Mountain," which won her the Scott Moncrieff Award for distinguished translation. She also translated "Jean Monnet and the United States of Europe" (1969) and "The Duel: De Gaulle and Pompidou" (1972).         Mrs. Halperin's husband, S. William Halperin, died in 1979. In addition to her son David, a professor of literature at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she is survived by another son, John, Centennial Professor of English at Vanderbilt University.       
         Carol Laise, an American Ambassador who was the wife of an American Ambassador and the first woman to be an Assistant Secretary of State, died yesterday at her home in Dummerston, Vt. She was 73 years old.         Miss Laise died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         She was named Ambassador to Nepal by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966 and remained in the post until 1973. In January 1974 she married Ambassador at Large Ellsworth Bunker, a 79-year-old widower, in Katmandu, Nepal. She kept her maiden name professionally.         It was the first marriage between two American Ambassadors. Miss Laise was a close friend of Mr. Bunker's first wife, Harriet Allen Bunker, who died in 1964, and it was Miss Laise's first marriage.         For nearly six years after their marriage the couple saw each other only once a month when Ambassador Laise would take a plane provided by President Johnson and fly to Saigon, where Ambassador Bunker was trying to stabilize the situation in South Vietnam. Named Director General         In October 1973 she returned to Washington and was sworn in as Assistant Secretary of State in charge of the Bureau of Public Affairs, the first woman to hold so high a post in the department. Before her appointment as Ambassador to Nepal she had been director of the Office of South Asian Affairs,         In 1974 Miss Laise became director general of the Foreign Service, the highest nonpolitical job in the Foreign Service, a post she held until she retired in 1977.         Caroline Clendening Laise began her Government career in 1940 as an occupational coder for the Civil Service Commission. In 1946 she went to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and in 1948 joined the State Department.         From 1956 to 1961 she was an adviser to American delegates to various United Nations agencies and in 1962 was made deputy director of the Office of South Asian Affairs with responsibilty for diplomatic relations with Afghanistan, Ceylon, Nepal, India and Pakistan.         In comparing the economic problems of Nepal with those of India, she said in a 1966 interview with Ann Terry Pincus of The New York Post, "You could explain that Nepal is like Appalachia, and India has the problems of Harlem." An Adviser in New Delhi         When Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey went to India and Pakistan in 1965, Miss Laise went along as his adviser. In the 1962-63 Chinese invasion of India, Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith sent for Miss Laise for advice and she spent about a year in New Delhi.         She was a winner in 1965 of the annual Federal Women's Award for outstanding contributions by women in government service, and in 1973 she received the Career Service Award of the National Civil Service League.         Miss Laise, a native of Winchester, Va., was a graduate of American University and received an M.A. in political science from George Washington University.         Her husband, Ambassador Bunker, died in 1984.         She is survived by a brother, Frederick Laise of Santa Fe, N.M.; two stepsons, Samuel Bunker of Dummerston, Vt., and John Bunker of Wheatland, Wy.; and a stepdaughter, Ellen Bunker of Tucson, Ariz.       
         Florence Cohen, president emeritus of the Volunteers for Israel, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 70 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Cohen died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         She had been active with the Volunteers of Israel since its founding in 1982. The organization sends volunteers from the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America to Israel to work in a civilian capacity on military bases and in kibbutzes. It is an offshoot of an 1982 volunteer drive that was established to alleviate shortages created by the war in Lebanon.         Mrs. Cohen, a native of Ramsey, N.J., was a registered nurse who got her nursing degree in 1943. She left nursing to raise a family but returned to the profession in the early 1970's, most recently working at the now defunct Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jules Cohen, a New York cardiologist; two sons, David, of Los Angeles, and Michael, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a daughter, Linda, of Boston, and three grandchildren.

         Irina Nijinska, a dancer and teacher who spent much of her life in a one-woman crusade to preserve the choreography of her mother, Bronislava Nijinska, died on Tuesday at the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, Calif. She was 77 years old and lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif.         She died of cardiac arrest, her husband, Gibbs S. Raetz, said.         Miss Nijinska's career was devoted to the championing of a single choreographer. She believed, as did most dance historians, that her mother -- who first achieved acclaim with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the 1920's -- was among this century's greatest choreographers. And she traveled the world reviving the elder Nijinska's works with selfless devotion.         In New York she staged productions for the Feld Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem. She was also a familiar figure in companies as diverse as the Paris Opera Ballet, the Stuttgart Ballet, the National Ballet of Holland, Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, Tulsa Ballet Theater and the Dance Corps of the State University of New York at Purchase.         She most often revived two contrasting masterpieces by her mother: "Les Noces," a monumentally scaled depiction of a peasant wedding choreographed in 1923, and "Les Biches," a satire on the French Riviera "smart set" that received its premiere in 1924. In 1981, under Miss Nijinska's supervision, the Oakland Ballet became the first American company to perform "Les Noces." Four years later, the Feld Ballet danced it in New York and in 1989 it entered the repertories of the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem.  Collaborative Efforts         That year, the Harlem company offered an all-Bronislava Nijinska program of "Les Noces," "Les Biches" and "Rondo Capriccioso," which Irina Nijinska revived in association with the ballerina Rosella Hightower. In 1989, Irina Nijinska and Frank W. D. Ries, a dance historian, reconstructed another satire, "Le Train Bleu," for the Oakland Ballet.         Wherever she went, Irina Nijinska amazed people with her inexhaustible vitality. She was a warmhearted, gregarious woman, and dancers who began by respecting her as a mentor came to cherish her as a friend. Although acquainted since childhood with famous choreographers and artists, she remained modest in manner. Typically, when a reporter asked if she wished to be addressed as Madame Nijinska, she laughed and replied, "Call me Irina. In our family, there is only         one         Madame Nijinska."         It was a distinguished family. Her uncle was the legendary dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, and her father, Alexander Kotchetovsky,was also a dancer.         Miss Nijinska was born in St. Petersburg on Oct. 20, 1913, but received most of her training, from her mother and other teachers, in Paris. She made her debut with the Olga Spessivtzeva Ballet in 1930 and, adopting Nijinska as her professional surname, danced during the 30's with the ballet ensemble of the Opera Russe a Paris, the Ida Rubinstein Ballet, the Theatre de la Danse, Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes and the Polish Ballet. Was Her Mother's Assistant         After an automobile accident in 1936 that reduced her performing abilities, she served as her mother's rehearsal assistant, and from 1941 to 1950 taught in the school her mother had founded in Hollywood. Miss Nijinska married Mr. Raetz, an aeronautical engineer, in 1946, and for much of the 1950's and 60's devoted herself to her family. When Nicholas Singaevsky, her mother's second husband, died in 1968, she once more became her mother's assistant, and after her mother's death in 1972 she embarked upon her travels as a choreographic reconstructor.         In recent years, Miss Nijinska had sifted through her mother's notes to determine precisely how many works by Bronislava Nijinska were revivable. With the aid of Nina Youshkevitch, a New York teacher who had danced in ballets by Bronislava Nijinska in the 30's, she staged an excerpt from "Le Baiser de la Fee" last fall for a symposium sponsored by the Dance Critics Association and the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center. At the time of her death, she was hoping to revive "Bolero," "Chopin Concerto" and "Impressions de Music Hall."         Miss Nijinska and Jean Rawlinson translated and edited "Early Memories," the first volume of Bronislava Nijinska's autobiography, which was published in 1981. Miss Nijinska was in the process of editing a sequel.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Natalie Raetz of Long Beach, Calif., and a son, George Raetz of Denver.

         Jane Piper, a prominent Philadelphia painter, died on Thursday at her home in the Center City section of the city. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, a friend of the family said.         Ms. Piper's works were primarily still lifes and are in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the National Academy of Design.         In an article in Art in America magazine, the critic Walter Thompson described her paintings as "a panoply of forms in which the rhythms and interrupting accents have the intricacy of a complex musical score."         Ms. Piper briefly attended the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts and studied with Arthur B. Carles, a former student of Henri Matisse. At her death, she was still painting.         Ms. Piper is survived by her husband, E. Digby Baltzell, a professor emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and the man who coined the term WASP; two daughters, Eve Baltzell of Boston and Jan C. Baltzell of Philadelphia, and two sisters, Helen Piper Cresswell and Eleanor Piper De La Cour, both of Bryn Mawr, Pa.

         Dr. Frances G. Dell, a retired English professor at Pace University, died on Sunday in Beverly Hospital in Beverly, Mass. She was 69 years old and had lived in White Plains until a recent move to Wenham, Mass.         She died of congestive heart failure, a university spokesman said.         Dr. Dell taught at Pace's Westchester-Pleasantville campus for 27 years before retiring in 1990. She was professor emeritus of literature, communications and the performing arts, and she specialized in 19th-century literature, particularly the works of Thomas Hardy, James Fenimore Cooper and the Brontes.         A native of Queens, she graduated from Queens College and held master's degrees from Teachers College, Columbia University and Fordham University, where she also earned a Ph.D. in English.         She represented Pace at three Bronte conferences in England and conducted an international Bronte conference at Pace's Westchester campus in 1985.

         Ella Haith Weaver, who directed the Speech Therapy Training Program at Brooklyn College for 18 years and was the wife of Robert C. Weaver, a Cabinet member during the Johnson Administration, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old.         She died of emphysema, her husband said.

         Bena Frank Mayer, a painter best known for her portraits, died on Thursday at the St. Luke's division of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack, her lawyer, Martin Bressler, said.         Mrs. Mayer exhibited in many group shows with the National Association of Women Artists, winning several of its awards, and was a past president of the New York Society of Women Artists.         She was the widow of Ralph Mayer, also a painter and an expert in the field of artists' materials and techniques, who died in 1979. Twenty years earlier, with the support of the A.&P. heir Huntington Hartford, the couple had founded the nonprofit Artists Technical Research Institute, whose aim was to establish reliable scientific data on artists' materials. Mrs. Mayer also helped her husband research and edit several reference books he wrote for artists, including "The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques," first published in 1940 and now considered a classic in the field.         In 1990 she was instrumental in establishing the Ralph Mayer Learning Center, successor to the Artists Technical Research Institute, at the Yale University School of Art. The center supports research and writing on the use of materials and the study of artists' techniques. A show of Mrs. Mayer's landscapes and portraits was held at Yale in connection with the opening of the institute in September 1990.         Mrs. Mayer was born in Norfolk, Va., in 1898, spent her early years in Wyoming, and came to New York in 1914. She studied at the Cooper Union and the Arts Students League, and also privately with the painter Stuart Davis. She married Mr. Mayer in 1927.         There are no immediate survivors. A funeral service is to be held today at 9:30 A.M. at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street, Manhattan.       
         Joan D. Abrams, a former superintendent of schools in Red Bank, N.J., and a leader in the movement to open doors for women in school administration, died on Sunday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. She was 62 years old and lived in Short Hills, N.J.         Dr. Abrams died of breast cancer, her son, Linus, said.         As an educator, one of Dr. Abrams's concerns was advancing early detection of learning problems. In the Red Bank school system, where she was superintendent from 1974 to 1987, she began a systematic way for a teacher to determine how much a student had learned. She lectured nationally on this method, called mastery learning.         Before going to Red Bank, Dr. Abrams was superintendent of schools in Montvale, N.J. In New York City, where she began her career, she was principal of Public School 165, assistant principal of Public School 41 and a teacher at Public School 192.         Dr. Abrams received her Ph.D. in education administration from New York University in 1971. When she moved into administration, she was one of a few women in the nation in the top echelons of administration. To help change this, she founded the National Women's Caucus of the American Association of School Administrators.         Besides her son, Dr. Linus Abrams of Brookline, Mass., Dr. Abrams is survived by her husband, Nathan, and a daughter, Lydia, of New York City.       
         Ruth G. Schapiro, a nationally known tax lawyer and a partner in the New York firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 64 years old.         Donald Schapiro, her husband of 39 years, said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Schapiro, a native of Manhattan, was a 1947 graduate of Wellesley College and received a law degree from Columbia Law School, where she was notes editor of the Law Review. She went to work in 1951 at the firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison and joined the Proskauer firm in 1955.         President Carter appointed Mrs. Schapiro to the Tax Court Nominating Commission in 1978, and she served as a member of the panel until 1981. At the time of her death, she was chairwoman of the committee on personal income taxes of the New York City State Bar Association.         She was a past chairwoman of the state bar's tax section, as well as of its finance committee, and served on the executive committee of the state bar's House of Delegates. From 1984 to 1989, she also headed a special committee on women in the courts set up by the state bar.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Schapiro's survivors include a daughter, Jane G., also of Manhattan; a son, Robert A., of Columbia, Md., and a sister, Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of United States District Court in Manhattan.       
         Aline (Honi) Pollitzer Weiss, active for more than half a century with organizations concerned with the welfare of children, died on Sunday at her summer home in Stephentown, N.Y. She was 95 years old and lived in Medford, N.J.         She died in her sleep, her son-in-law, Judge Louis Pollak of Philadelphia, said.         For many years, Mrs. Weiss was chairwoman of the board of the Wiltwyck School for Boys. She was also on the board of the Northside Center for Child Development, Louise Wise Services and the Encampment for Citizenship, a youth leadership development group.         She came from a family with a tradition of social involvement. Her mother, Alice Kohn Pollitzer, one of nine women in Barnard College's first graduating class, founded the Encampment for Citizenship. Her sister, Margaret Pollitzer Hoben, helped found the Walden School.         When she was 70, Mrs. Weiss and her mother, on principle, challenged a Federal Government provision that required Medicare applicants to sign a loyalty oath. In 1967, while their challenge moved through the court system, the Justice Department conceded that the oath was unconstitutional.         Mrs. Weiss's husband, Louis, died in 1950. She is survived by two daughters, Elizbeth W. Goldwasser of Urbana, Ill., and Katherine W. Pollak of Philadelphia; a son, Dr. William P. Weiss of Chester, Vt., 18 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.

         Barbara Ewing Ylvisaker, a registered nurse who in the 1960's helped to create one of the nation's first federally financed neighborhood health centers, in Trenton, died Sunday at New England Baptist Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. She was 66 years old.         Her husband, Paul, said she died of cancer.

         Susan Price Carr, a lawyer with Time Warner Inc., died on Friday at Beth Israel Hospital North in Manhattan. She was 45 years old.         She died of breast cancer, family members said.         In the early 1970's, Ms. Carr was one of several female law students who filed sex discrimination claims against several large law firms. The suits were settled by the firms' adoption of procedures to assure equal opportunities in hiring for future generations of law students.         Ms. Carr had been litigation counsel for Warner Communications, now Time Warner, since 1981. She was a graduate of Vassar College and of Columbia Law School, and she had received a master's degree in political science from New York University.         Ms. Carr is survived by her husband, Anthony M. Radice; a daughter, Julia; her mother, Dorislee Kadis Carr, and a half-sister, Amy, all of New York City.       
         Marie Stevens Jacobs, a prominent sportswoman and skier in Lake Placid, N.Y., died on Sunday at her home in Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         Her family said she died after a long battle with cancer.         Mrs. Jacobs was born and raised in Etna, N.H., where her family lived for many generations.

Jacobs Jr., former chairman of Bache Group Inc., now known as Prudential Securities; a daughter, Nancy Jacobs Haneman of Rye, N.Y.; a son, Harry A. 3d of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.       
         Nell Donnelly Reed, a pioneer in women's ready-to-wear clothing in the 1920's and 1930's, died Sunday morning at her home in Kansas City, Mo. She was 102 years old.         In 1916, Mrs. Reed began making and selling ruffled dresses to replace the drab, cotton house dresses of the period. By the 1940's her clothing company was described as the largest of its kind in the world.         Mrs. Reed said her frilly designs under the Nelly Don label helped challenge conventional thinking of pre-World War I America that it was impossible to give style to clothing in the cheap price range. Her first dresses sold for $1, considerably more than the average price of 69 cents. Savvy in Business         Mrs. Reed was described by Fortune Magazine in 1935 as possibly the most successful businesswoman in the United States. She was considered one who was ahead of her time, being among the first business leaders in her city to offer paid group hospitalization for employees and an unlimited number of tuition-paid night courses and scholarships for their children at local colleges, according to The Kansas City Star.         Through her business, the Donnelly Garment Company, a $3.5 million business with 1,000 employees in 1935, she helped turn Kansas City into a thriving ready-to-wear manufacturing center. Her first husband, Paul Donnelly, a representative for a Kansas City shoe company, acted as the head of the garment company in its early days, but she assumed full control when they were divorced in 1932.         In 1931 Mrs. Reed was the subject of national headlines when she and her chauffeur were kidnapped at gunpoint outside her home and held for ransom. The $75,000 ransom went unpaid and the two were released unharmed 32 hours later. Two men received life terms for their part in the abduction.         The prosecutor in the kidnapping case was James A. Reed, a former United States Senator and former Mayor of Kansas City, whom she would later marry. Mr. Reed, who served three terms in the United States Senate, from 1911 to 1929, died in 1944.  Company Name Changed         The 12th of 13 children, Mrs. Reed was born Ellen Quinlan on March 6, 1889, and grew up in Parsons, Kan., where her family had moved from County Cork, Ireland. At age 16, she married Mr. Donnelly and moved with him to Kansas City.         She said she began adding frills to house dresses so she could "make women look pretty when they are washing dishes," she once said.         The rapid growth of her company in the 1930's brought efforts by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to organize her plant, but despite legal maneuvers that reached the United States Supreme Court, her company was still union free in 1948.         Mrs. Reed retired from her company in 1956 and it changed its name to Nelly Don Inc. The company went public in 1958, but eventually filed for bankruptcy.         After her retirement, Mrs. Reed continued her involvement in business and civic affairs in Kansas City, serving on the school board and boards of numerous social and cultural institutions, including the Kansas City Art Institute and the Midwest Research Institute.         She is survived by a son, David, and four grandchildren.       
         Patricia Dickenson Cline, an associate director of development for Princeton University, died on Sunday at her home in Princeton Township, N.J. She was 56 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Born in New York, Mrs. Cline received an master's degree in arts education at Rutgers University and studied modern dance at the Martha Graham studio. She became the first executive director of Creative Theater Unlimited in 1974 and held the position until 1977. At Princeton, she worked on several of the university's recent development projects.         Mrs. Cline is survived by her husband, Hugh F.; a daughter, Lynn Hunter Cline of Princeton, and a son, Hugh D., of Los Angeles.       
         Rita Greenland, an advertising executive active in Jewish organizations, died on Saturday at New York University Hospital. She was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan and Bedford Hills, N.Y.         The family said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Greenland, a graduate of Brooklyn College, was the senior vice president for human relations at Smith/Greenland Advertising Inc. in New York. Her associations included the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Cancer Society and the Library Volunteers of the Scarsdale P.T.A.         Mrs. Greenland is survived by her husband, Leo; two sons, Seth and Andrew; a sister, Yvette Rosenzweig, and a granddaughter, all of New York City.

         Shirley Steinman Katzenbach, a philanthropist and volunteer in several health and cultural institutions in New York City, died on Monday at St. Luke's Roosevelt Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan and Waccabuc in Westchester County.         She died of a stroke, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Katzenbach had been a trustee at St. Luke's and the New York Zoological Society, a board member of the Manhattan Mental Health Association and a member of the City Hospital Inspection Committee under Mayor John V. Lindsay.         She also worked as a volunteer in hospital emergency rooms and was for 15 years a docent at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, giving guided tours in its Costume Institute.         She was born in Lancaster, Pa., where her family owned the local newspaper company. She graduated from the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and the Kathrine Gibbs School of New York. Early in her career she was a newspaper reporter for the Lancaster New Era and later was a director of her family's company.         She is survived by her husband, L. Emery Katzenbach, the former chairman of White, Weld & Company, an investment banking firm; two daughters, Mrs. Pamela M. Thye of Wellesley Hills, Mass., and Caroline N. Sidnam of New York City; a son, Robert D. C. Meeker Jr. of Elizabethtown, N.C., and three grandchildren.       
         Catherine M. Prelinger, a Yale lecturer, author and historian, died on Saturday at the Yale Health Plan Care Center in New Haven. She was 66 years old and lived in Killingsworth, Conn.         Her family said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Prelinger was an associate editor of Yale's Papers of Benjamin Franklin project, which she joined in 1970. She also was a member of the advisory committee on women's programs at the Harvard Divinity School.         Long a prominent figure in the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians, Mrs. Prelinger served as its president from 1975 to 1977 and last year was a member of its nominating committee.         A native of New York City, Mrs. Prelinger was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Vassar College who earned her Ph.D. in history at Yale University in 1954.         She also contributed to scholarly journals both in this country and in Germany and had just completed the editing of a book, "Episcopal Woman," to be published next year by the Oxford University Press in New York.         Mrs. Prelinger is survived by her husband, Dr. Ernst Prelinger, a Yale University psychologist; two daughters, Dr. Katherine Holden of Sharon, Conn., and Edith Holden Roth of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; a stepson, Richard Prelinger of New York City; three stepdaughters, Elizabeth A. Prelinger of Washington, Polly Prelinger of San Francisco, and Jane Rothkopf of New York City; and six grandchildren.       
         Elaine Horwitch, who established the Elaine Horwitch Galleries for contemporary art in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Santa Fe, N.M., died on Saturday at her home in Santa Fe. She was 58 years old, and also had a home in Scottsdale.         She died of a heart attack, said Abby Braun, director of the Santa Fe gallery.         Mrs. Horwitch and her husband, Arnold, moved from Chicago to Scottsdale in 1955. She established her gallery there in 1973, and opened the one in Santa Fe three years later. At one time she also had galleries in Sedona, Ariz., and Palm Springs, Calif.         Surviving in addition to her husband are their five children, Mark, of San Francisco; Mindi and Wendy, of Los Angeles; Carrie, of Seattle, and Deena Semler of Portland, Ore., and a sister, Joan Siewert of Lake Forest, Ill.       
         Oona Chaplin, the daughter of one of the great tragic playwrights of the century, Eugene O'Neill, and wife of one of the screen's greatest comic geniuses, Charles Chaplin, died yesterday at the age of 66 in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland.         She died of cancer of the pancreas, said her lawyer, Herbert Jacoby of New York City.         Mrs. Chaplin, who became known as Lady Oona after her British-born husband was knighted in 1975, was an 18-year-old Brearley graduate and fledgling actress in 1943 when she became the fourth wife of the internationally beloved actor and director, who was then 54 years old. Their elopement so infuriated O'Neill, who was the same age as Chaplin, that he disinherited her.         The Chaplins, who had eight children, lived most of their married life in their 18th-century mansion overlooking Lake Geneva. After her husband's death in 1977, Mrs. Chaplin stayed on, becoming something of a recluse. Renounced Citizenship         Charles Chaplin, who grew up in the slums of London, championed leftist causes during the Cold War and was an ardent critic of the American Government.  In 1952 he went into self-imposed exile with his family. Two years later, it was learned that Mrs. Chaplin had renounced her American citzenship and become an English subject like her husband.         In 1967 Mrs. Chaplin returned to New York without fanfare to visit her mother, who was dying. Chaplin did not return to the United States until 1975, when he was received in triumph and given a special Oscar.         Throughout her life, Oona O'Neill Chaplin was a gracious, quiet presence overshadowed by her ebullient husband. Their home became a kind of intellectual watering hole; Pablo Casals, Nikita Khrushchev, Jawaharlal Nehru and Zhou Enlai were among those who visited the Chaplins in Switzerland.         As a young and somewhat sensitive society beauty, Oona O'Neill had her own following. When she visited the West Coast in her brief attempt to become an actress, she received long daily letters from an admirer named "Jerry" -- the author J. D. Salinger. 'Oriental Objectivity'         Her two best friends from Brearley also went to Hollywood and married famous older men. Carol Grace married the writer William Saroyan, and Gloria Vanderbilt married the conductor Leopold Stokowski. Gloria Vanderbilt once said of her fellow debutante that she possessed "a wonderful quality of oriental objectivity about life."         She met Chaplin through a Hollywood agent who recommended her for a part in a Chaplin movie. Chaplin later said he had considered her too inexperienced at first, but changed his mind when he heard that a studio had offered her a contract.         Mrs. Chaplin's parents had had a bitter divorce when she was 2, and she saw her father only infrequently as she grew up. She managed to survive her difficult childhood relatively unscathed, but her older brother, Shane, and a half-brother, Eugene O'Neill Jr., committed suicide.         Mrs. Chaplin always told friends and interviewers that she was content to remain a wife and mother, and always said she never noticed the difference between her age and her husband's. "He is my world," she said in 1960. "I've never seen or lived anything else."         She is survived by her children: Geraldine, the actress; Michael, Josephine, Victoria, Eugene, Jane, Annette-Emilie and James, and 17 grandchildren.         Correction:  October 1, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary on Saturday about Oona O'Neill Chaplin misstated her age in some copies. Mrs. Chaplin was 66 years old, not 70.       
         Virginia Hoff Greenburg, a pianist, music teacher and co-founder of the prestigious Hoff-Barthelson Music School in Scarsdale, N.Y., died on Friday at the Hospice of the Central Coast in Carmel, Calif. She was 91 years old.         She suffered a stroke at her home in Carmel on Sept. 14 and was in a coma until her death, family members said.         In 1944 she and the composer Joyce Barthelson founded the school with a few students in a private house in Scarsdale. Over the years it grew to occupy various annexes throughout the town. In 1972, it moved into its current home, the 36-room former Scarsdale Inn.         The school, which is for many a hub of Westchester musical life, now has 65 faculty members and 1,200 students and gives more than 200 concerts and recitals yearly, including those by the Philharmonia Virtuosi and the pianist Peter Serkin. It also has an extensive outreach program serving the elderly and the handicapped. Still Playing Near the End         Mrs. Greenburg was the director and driving force at the school for nearly 30 years before retiring in 1973, turning over its direction to Mary Helton, who had taught there since 1951.         Her first husband, Charles Hoff, died in 1949. In 1972, she married Reginald Greenburg. Soon after, they went to Carmel for a visit and soon moved there.         An accomplished pianist as well as teacher, she and Ms. Barthelson gave many two-piano recitals at the school and elsewhere. Even as her health began to fail in recent years, she kept playing. Shortly after her 90th birthday, she recorded herself performing Chopin Preludes and sent tapes to many relatives and friends.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Her sons, Hubert and Christopher, both died in 1974.         A memorial service at the school is being planned for next month.       
         Jane Dewey Ellsworth, founder of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation, died last Friday at her home in Westlake Village, Calif., near Los Angeles. She was 80 years old.         Her family said the cause of death was emphysema.         Mrs. Ellsworth, a native of Greenfield, Mass., studied speech and drama at Smith College and had a brief stage career in stock and in bit parts on Broadway. She was under contract to Paramount Studios for two years and, at the time, wrote some magazine fiction.         She was married for a time to Patric Farrell, who in the 1920's and 30's was director of the Irish Theater at Sheridan Square and an Irish arts museum in Manhattan. In 1938, after they had divorced, she married Whitney Ellsworth, writer and producer of the old "Superman" television series.         The Ellsworths were living in Greenwich, Conn., in the early 1950's when her 15-year-old daughter by her first marriage, Patricia, developed myasthenia gravis. Mrs. Ellsworth's concern with the nerve disorder, which is characterized by muscular weakness and fatigue, especially in the face and the neck, prompted her to form the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation. The foundation, organized in New York in 1952, now has headquarters in Chicago and has 53 chapters around the country.         Mrs. Ellsworth's daughter, a Barnard College graduate and former editor for the Encyclopedia Americana in New York, is now Patricia Wilson, a resident of Holland, Mich. Mrs. Ellsworth's first husband, Mr. Farrell, lives in Manhattan. There are no other immediate survivors.       
         Belinda Mason, a member of the National Commission on AIDS who pleaded with President Bush in a letter in August not to support proposed Federal policies that she said would further stigmatize AIDS sufferers, died this morning at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. She was 33 years old.         She died of AIDS-related pneumonia, a spokesman for the commission said.         Ms. Mason was infected with the virus that causes AIDS when she received a blood transfusion in 1987 while giving birth to her second child. Hospital workers had not tested the blood she received, but later found that it was contaminated with the AIDS virus.         Before she became infected, Ms. Mason worked as a reporter for two weekly newspapers, The Ohio County Times-News in Hartford, Ky., and later for The Appalachian News-Express in Pikeville, Ky. She also wrote short stories.         When she learned she was infected with AIDS, she became an advocate for better medical and social treatment of people with the AIDS virus. Ms. Mason founded Kentuckiana People With AIDS Coalition, the first Kentucky-based advocacy organization for those stricken with AIDS. 'An AIDS Poster Child'         She later became president of the National Association of People With AIDS and was appointed by President Bush to the National Commission on AIDS in 1990.         "I have become the disease," she said in an interview six weeks ago. "When people talk to me now, they see the disease first. Nobody talks to Belinda Mason the short-story writer anymore. My previous identity has dissolved. I've become an AIDS poster child."         In her letter to Mr. Bush on Aug. 2 she said she had no ill will toward health-care workers even though she contracted the disease through their lapses. She also said she opposed widespread compulsory testing of such workers. Nor, she wrote, did she want people with AIDS to be barred from entering the United States. Both proposals are being considered in Washington.         "Mr. President, doctors don't give people AIDS -- they care for people with it," she wrote. "The blanket screening of health-care workers will create the false illusion that people with AIDS are a threat to others."         Ms. Mason is survived by her husband, Stephen Carden, and their two children, Polly, 8, and Clayton, 4. She will be buried on their Kentucky farm.       
         Claire Zeisler, an artist and art collector who helped transform the two-dimensional craft of weaving into the three-dimensional medium called fiber art, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 88 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Joan Binkley of Lake Bluff, Ill.         Mrs. Zeisler, whose maiden name was Block, was born in Cincinnati on April 18, 1903, and showed a strong interest in art from childhood. In 1921 she married Harold Florsheim, an heir to the Florsheim Shoe Company, and moved to Chicago.         For a while, her interest in art was manifested in a collection that became well known for its broad range and exquisite taste. In the 1930's, she acquired paintings by European modernists including Picasso, Miro and Klee, as well as objects from many tribal cultures, among them African sculptures, tantric art, ancient Peruvian textiles and more than 300 American Indian baskets. Later, she added works by prominent postwar American artists, from Franz Kline and Robert Rauschenberg to Jenny Holzer.         In 1943 Mrs. Zeisler divorced her husband, and in 1946 she married Ernest Zeisler, a physician and author. In the 1940's she also went back to school, studying with the sculptor Alexander Archipenko and with Laszlo Moholy-Nagy at the Illinois Institute of Technology, often known as the American Bauhaus. But it was the instruction she received from a Chicago weaver named Bea Swartchild that channeled her abiding interest in textiles toward the craft of weaving. A Move Toward Complexity         At first she created functional loomed weavings, but by 1962, the year of her first solo exhibition, she had abandoned the loom to create three-dimensional free-form fiber sculptures of increasing scale and complexity. These works actively exploited the inherent qualities of weaving and thread, especially in their emphasis on knotting and wrapping and on free-falling unwoven strands of fiber, a device that the artist considered her trademark.         After a 1963 exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City that also included fiber works by Sheila Hicks and Lenore Tawney, Mrs. Zeisler came to be seen as an innovator in her field. From then on, she exhibited widely, in Europe and Japan as well as the United States, and many museums acquired examples of her work. In 1979 the Art Institute of Chicago organized a retrospective of her art; a smaller exhibition was mounted by the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1985.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two sons, Peter Florsheim of Sedona, Ariz., and Thomas Florsheim of Milwaukee; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Grace Zaring Stone, a novelist who also wrote under the pen name Ethel Vance, died on Sunday at the Mary Elizabeth Nursing Center in Mystic, Conn. She was 100 years old and had lived in Stonington, Conn.         Three of Mrs. Stone's novels were made into films: "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," in 1933, which starred Barbara Stanwyck and Nils Asther; "Escape" (1940,) with Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor and Conrad Veidt, and "Winter Meeting" (1948,) with Bette Davis.         "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," about a New England woman who arrives in China to marry a missionary but becomes a captive of a Chinese warlord, was the first movie to be shown at Radio City Music Hall.         "Escape," an anti-Nazi thriller, was written in 1939 under the pseudonym Ethel Vance. In 1942 the author said the pen name had been used to protect her daughter, Eleanor Perenyi, who was living in occupied Europe, and because Mrs. Stone's husband, Ellis, was the United States naval attache in Paris, where they were living.         The book became a best seller, and Mrs. Stone used the Vance name for some of her later books, including "Reprisal" (1942) and "Winter Meeting," (1946).         Mrs. Stone was the great-great-granddaughter of Robert Owen, the British social reformer and socialist who founded the cooperative colony of New Harmony in Indiana. Her mother died when she was born, and she spent most of her childhood "visiting around," she said.         "In all the houses of the Owen descendants there were many books being very thoroughly read and almost everyone kept diaries," she said. "Diary keeping, writing in general, was just something one did. Then I married into the Navy and of course that was very, very different. But when my husband was stationed at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, the place seemed to get me started."         She wrote an account of a hurricane, and the Atlantic Monthly bought it, and later bought a short story as well. Then "Bobbs-Merrill wrote to ask me if I had a novel in mind, by any chance," Mrs. Stone said, "and of course that was a most amazing question to me, because I'd had a novel in mind practically forever."         Mrs. Stone's first novel was "The Heaven and Earth of Dona Elena," published in 1929. Her other works included "The Cold Journey" (1934,) "The Secret Thread" (1949) and "Althea" (1962).         Surviving besides her daughter, a writer, of Stonington, are a grandson and a great-graddaughter.       
         Nancy Proskauer Dryfoos, a sculptor in stone and terra cotta whose work is in the permanent collections of many museums and universities, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.         She died of a heart attack after a long illness with lung cancer, said her husband, Donald.         Mrs. Dryfoos had more than a dozen one-woman shows in New York, Connecticut and Washington, and her work has been exhibited in group exhibitions at institutions including the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan, the Philadelphia Art Alliance, the Dallas Museum of Fine Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington.         Her work is in the permanent collections of Columbia University, Brandeis University, New York University, the Boca Raton Museum in Florida, Kean College in New Jersey, and other institutions.         Nancy Edith Proskauer was born on March 25, 1918, in New Rochelle, N.Y. She graduated from Drew Seminary and Sarah Lawrence College. She and Mr. Dryfoos were married in 1938.         Mrs. Dryfoos studied at the Columbia University School of Architecture with Oronzio Maldarelli, and privately with Jose de Creeft, as well as at the Art Students League in Manhattan.         She was a winner of many awards, including the Gold Medal of Honor from the Allied Artists of America, the Edel Award for Fine Arts, and the Naomi Lehman Memorial Award.         Mrs. Dryfoos served as a member, officer and board member on many artistic and charitable organizations. She was a fellow and former officer of the National Sculpture Society; a member of, and contest juror for, the Allied Artists of America, and director of the American Society of Contemporary Artists from 1970 to 1972, among many other professional affiliations. She was also on the Creative Arts Award Commission of Brandeis University.         She is survived only by her husband.       
         Ann C. Whitman, an influential figure in the White House as the personal secretary to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and later as chief of staff to Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, died Tuesday at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, Fla. She was 83 years old and lived in Clearwater.         Mrs. Whitman died of heart failure, friends said.         "There's no question she played a vital role in the Eisenhower Administration; he really depended on her tremendously," said Robert J. Donovan, author of "Confidential Secretary: Ann Whitman's 20 Years with Eisenhower and Rockefeller" (E. P. Dutton, 1988).         Mrs. Whitman routinely worked 12 hours a day, and often seven days a week. Among her chores was supervising the President's responses to correspondence, which reached hundreds of thousands of letters a year. Recruited in 1952         Mrs. Whitman, whose maiden name was Cook, was born in Perry, Ohio, and attended Antioch College. As part of its work-study program, she went to the Institute for Child Guidance in New York City, became a secretary there and never returned to college. Her next job, which she held for 16 years, was as a personal secretary to Adele Rosenwald Levy, whose father was a founder of Sears, Roebuck & Company.         In the early 1950's Mrs. Whitman worked for the Committee for a Free Europe, which ran Radio Free Europe. She was then recruited for the Eisenhower Presidential campaign in 1952, and worked for Eisenhower through both of his Administrations.         In 1961 she worked for George Hinman, a political adviser to Rockefeller when he was Governor of New York, and became the Governor's executive assistant in 1965. In 1974, when President Gerald R. Ford named Rockefeller as Vice President, she served as his chief of staff. She retired in 1977.         Mrs. Whitman married Clarence Willard Moore in 1933, but the marriage ended in divorce. In 1940 she married Edmund Whitman, her first husband's business colleague at the United Fruit Company. That marriage also ended in divorce, in 1961.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Dorothy Berliner Commins, a concert pianist and author, died on Monday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 102 years old.         Mrs. Commins was born in New York City and made her recital debut at Town Hall at the age of 12. She studied in New York and in Europe and had an active career for five decades. Her last concert was at Town Hall in the mid-1950's.         In 1927 she married Saxe Commins, who became editor in chief at Random House. He died in 1958. Mrs. Commins's books included a biography of her husband, "What Is an Editor?" (1978); "All About the Symphony Orchestra and What It Plays" (1961); "Lullabies of the World" (1967), and a compilation of letters exchanged by her husband and the playwright Eugene O'Neill.         She is survived by a son, Eugene, of Berkeley, Calif.; a daughter, Frances Commins Bennett of New Haven, five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Nedda Casson Anders, a publisher and writer who edited the first Weight Watchers cookbook, died on Wednesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 70 years old, her family said, and lived in Manhattan and Tamarac, Fla.         Her son, Richard, said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Anders, who was born in the Bronx and grew up in Brooklyn, first worked for M. Barrows publishing, where she wrote and edited books on cooking and crafts. In the mid-1950's she and her husband, George Anders, who died in 1987, began their own publishing company, Hearthside Press, which specialized in works on cooking, crafts and gardening.         Among the books she wrote were "Complete Cookbook for Infra-Red Broiler and Rotisserie," published by M. Barrows, and "Casserole Specialties" and "Chafing-Dish Specialties," both for Hearthside. Reviewers praised her recipes as clearly written and easy to follow.         But her biggest success was the editing of "The Weight Watchers Program Cookbook" by Jean Nidetch, which sold millions of copies.         In addition to her son, Richard, of Boston, she is survived by two sisters, Judy Halpern of Fresh Meadows, Queens, and Toby Halpern of Malverne, L.I.; a brother, Walter Casson of Rockville Centre, L.I.; and two grandchildren.       
         Veronica Perry, a Harlem teacher and the mother of Edmund Perry, the honor student fatally shot by a police officer on Morningside Drive on June 12, 1985, died on Oct. 4 at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 44 years old.         She died as a result of a heart condition, the funeral home said.         Mrs. Perry, a fifth-generation Harlem resident and a graduate of Bronx Community College and Fordham University, was a teacher for the Lenox Hill Association. She was a past president of Community School Board 3 and of the Parent-Teacher Association of Wadleigh Junior High School and was a member of the Sojourner Truth Democratic Club.         She is survived by her husband, Jonah Perry Sr.; her mother, Eva Rutledge; a son, Jonah Jr.; a daughter, Nicol, and several brothers and sisters.       
         Sylvia Fine Kaye, a producer, lyricist and composer, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old.         She died of emphysema, said her daughter, Dena Kaye of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaye, the widow of the actor Danny Kaye, wrote the music and lyrics for many of her husband's films, including "Up in Arms" (1944), "Wonder Man" (1945), "The Kid from Brooklyn" (1946), "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (1947), "The Inspector General" (1949) and "The Court Jester" (1956).         A native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College, where she studied music. After college, she helped put on skits at a summer camp in Pennsylvania, where her fellow entertainers included Imogene Coca, Max Liebman and Danny Kaye. There she began writing specialty material, including a Yiddish version of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado" for Mr. Kaye. In 1940, the sketches were produced on Broadway under the title "The Straw Hat Revue."         That year, she married Mr. Kaye, and the couple worked as a popular act at La Martinique, a Manhattan nightclub. Mrs. Kaye wrote the music and lyrics for her husband and accompanied him on piano. Wit and Patter         Mrs. Kaye was known for her complex, witty lyrics, and she was often described as a composer of patter songs, which turn on the rapid delivery of tricky lines. Most frequently cited are "Anatole of Paris," "The Lobby Number" and "Soliloquy for Three Heads," the last sung by three mirror images in "The Inspector General." But Mrs. Kaye disagreed with this characterization. "I wrote many songs for Danny that had patter sections in them," she once told an interviewer, "but only two pure patter songs." They were "Melody in 4-F" and a variation of "The Nightmare Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe." For the film "Knock on Wood" (1954), she wrote "All About You," which Cole Porter called "a perfect love song."         For most of her career, Mrs. Kaye wrote songs and music solely for her husband. She once estimated that she wrote more than 100 songs for him during their 40-year collaboration. She was also involved in the production of almost all his films. She was twice nominated fpr Academy Awards for her work on "The Five Pennies" (1959) and "The Moon Is Blue" (1953). Musical Comedy on Television         In the 1970's, she embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971 and at Yale in 1975. In 1979, she produced and narrated the course as a 90-minute PBS program, "Musical Comedy Tonight," which won a Peabody Award. In 1975 she was executive producer for a television special, "Danny Kaye: Look In at the Met." She also produced and edited "Assignment Children," a Unicef film that starred her husband.         In the last three years, Mrs. Kaye devoted most of her time to writing a book about her life with Mr. Kaye, "Fine and Danny," for Alfred A. Knopf. She was also writing a catalogue of show-business material that she and her husband had donated to the Library of Congress.         Brooklyn College awarded her an honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1985. This year she endowed the Sylvia Fine Chair in Musical Theater there. She recently financed the restoration of the 664-seat Playhouse at Hunter College.         Mr. Kaye died in 1987 at age of 74. Mrs. Kaye is survived by her daughter, a magazine and television journalist, and a sister, Rhoda Gamson of New York City.         Correction:  October 30, 1991, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the songwriter Sylvia Fine Kaye omitted a survivor. He is Robert Fine Forrest, of Manhattan, her brother.       
         Ernestine McClendon, an actress, comedian and theatrical consultant, died on Sept. 23 at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 77 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of cancer, said Joahn Webb, a friend.         In the late 1950's, after 18 years as an actress, Ms. McClendon founded Ernestine McClendon Enterprises, a theatrical agency, in New York City. Later she also operated the agency in Los Angeles.         In recent years, she returned to performing, appearing in Los Angeles this year as a stand-up comedian. She made her first comedy appearance at the Apollo Theater in Harlem with her husband, George Wiltshire, who died in 1976, and his partner, Pigmeat Markham. She also appeared with them on Broadway and as a guest on Ed Sullivan's television show.         She acted in films including "A Face in the Crowd," "The Last Angry Man," "The Apartment" and "The Young Doctors."         She is survived by two sisters, Lessie M. Holloway of the Bronx and Wilma Taborn of Virginia Beach, Va.; a brother, Samuel K. Epps of Brooklyn; a daughter, Phyllis Davis of Baton Rouge, La., and four grandchildren.       
         Roberta Strauss Feuerlicht, an author of 18 books of history and biography who frequently espoused liberal social and political causes, died yesterday of congestive heart failure, her husband said. She was 59 years old.         Mrs. Feuerlicht was born in 1931 in New York City. She earned a bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1952, and after working as an editor of The Glen Oaks News and This Month magazine, began writing books. She published biographies of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Gandhi, Marie Curie, Theodore Roosevelt and Martin Luther King.         Among her most discussed works was her 1972 study, "McCarthy and McCarthyism," which argued that the late Wisconsin Senator was "an enemy of America's basic institutions" who "came closer to destroying America than any Communist, foreign or domestic."         Writing for The New York Times Book Review, Fred J. Cook described "McCarthy and McCarthyism" as "excellent, solidly researched."         Mrs. Feuerlicht's 1977 book on the trial and executions of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti was praised in The New York Times by John Leonard as "the most comprehensive and persuasive account of the case we have," although he faulted the author for her tendency to "pontificate."         She is survived by her husband, Herbert Alan Feuerlicht of Manhattan, and a son, Ira, of Brooklyn.       
         Natalia Ginzburg, an author commonly ranked with Umberto Eco as one of Italy's most important writers of fiction, died on Monday at her home in Rome. She was 75 years old.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for her publisher, Einaudi, said yesterday.         Although once dismissed as a minor writer because of her preoccupation with family life, Miss Ginzburg had seen her six works of fiction, a play ("I Married You for the Fun of It"), essays, a biography of the 19th-century novelist Alessandro Manzoni and translations of Flaubert and Proust recognized in recent years as the creations of a major artist.         Miss Ginzburg was born in Palermo, Sicily. Her mother was Catholic; her father, a professor of anatomy, Jewish. Her formative years were spent in Turin. There, she met and married Leone Ginzburg, a teacher of Russian and a leader of the anti-fascist intellectuals who in the late 1930's formed the core group of the Einaudi publishing house.         From 1940 to 1943, the Ginzburgs were confined to a small village east of Rome because of their Jewish heritage. It was during this time that Natalia Ginzburg published her first book, "The Road to the City," using the pseudonym Alessandra Torninparte in order to circumvent laws restricting the activities of Jews. 'I Got to Know Grief'         In 1943, her husband was arrested and imprisoned for anti-fascist activities. His death in prison a few months later was never explained by the authorities. "I got to know grief very well -- a real, irremedial and incurable grief that shattered my life," she recalled in an essay written in 1986, "and when I tried to put it together again I realized that my life had become irreconcilable with what had gone before. Only my vocation remained unchanged. At first I hated it, it disgusted me, but I knew very well that I would end up returning to it, and that it would save me."         After the war, Miss Ginzburg returned to Einaudi as an editor and continued to write. She won several Italian literary prizes and gained international recognition with the publication of "Voices in the Evening," a novel (1961), and an autobiography, "Family Sayings" (1963).         In "Family Sayings," she mingled her family story -- dominated by her impatient scientist father and ever-cheerful mother -- with the events of Italian history in the period between the two world wars. In a preface to the book, Miss Ginzburg wrote: "Possibly some people may not be pleased to find themselves described in the book under their own names. To such I have nothing to say."         Her biography of Manzoni, which Mary McCarthy called an "original and engrossing work," stood the old-style heroic genre on its head. While admiring Manzoni's literary achievements, her study also lays bare Manzoni's shocking indifference to his children.  Taking Sides in an Adoption         Miss Ginzburg's last book created an uproar. "Serena Cruz, or True Justice" recounts an explosive adoption case that divided Italy in 1989. In the dispute, a Filipino girl was taken from her adoptive Italian parents on grounds that the adoption was illegal. Miss Ginzburg strongly sided with the adoptive parents, arguing that their nurturing the child for 14 months should have entitled them to keep her.         In a profile of Miss Ginzburg in The New York Times Magazine in 1990, the American writer Mary Gordon recalled having asked her to account for the quality of understatement that characterizes her work.         "I was the little sister," Miss Ginzburg replied. "When you are the youngest in the family, people are always telling you to hurry up, to get to the point, say what you mean. I think that's why I write the way I do."         Asked what kind of writer she would have become had her life not been disrupted by the war, she told Ms. Gordon: "Of course I wrote about the war. I was formed by the war because that was what happened to me. I think of a writer as a river: you reflect what passes before you. The trees pass, and the houses; you reflect what is there."         "I write about families," she continued, "because that is where everything starts, where the germs grow." Likened to Chekhov         The subtlety and economy of Miss Ginzburg's style has prompted critics to liken her to Chekhov. "When I write something I usually think it is very important and that I am a very fine writer," she wrote in an essay for The New York Times Book Review in 1986. "But there is one corner of my mind in which I know very well what I am, which is a small, a very small writer."         In 1983, Miss Ginzburg was elected to the Italian Parliament as a representative of a left-wing party unaffiliated with the Communists. She served only one term. "I did it because I like to learn about things," she told Ms. Gordon. "I like to learn about them so that I can write about them."         In 1950, she married Gabriele Baldini, a professor of English literature at the University of Rome. He died in 1969. She is survived by her four children, Alessandra, Carlo, Leone and Susanna. Funeral services are to be held tomorrow.       
         Elizabeth M. Cahill, wife of William T. Cahill, a former Governor of New Jersey, died on Wednesday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after a brief illness. She was 79 years old and lived in Haddonfield, N.J.         Mr. Cahill, a Republican who had served in the House of Representatives, was Governor for four years, starting in January 1970.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Cahill is survived by five daughters, Kathleen Tully of Haddonfield, Mary E. Cahill of Washington, Regina Blake Keeley of Potomac, Md., Teresa Cahill of Boston and Eileen Campbell of Merchantville, N.J.; two sons, William T. Jr. and John P., both of Collingswood, N.J.; a brother, George Myrtetus of Scotch Plains, N.J., and 13 grandchildren.       
         Leah Silberzan Sayles, a leader in the movement to legalize abortion in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan.         She was 61 years old and died of a brain tumor, her family said.         Ms. Sayles joined the board of directors of the Abortion Justice Association in 1969, was a founding member of the National Abortion Federation and was active in the National Abortion Rights Action League.         Soon after earning a master's degree in social work from the University of Pittsburgh in 1968, she became the counseling director for Planned Parenthood in Western Pennsylvania, based in Pittsburgh. In 1973 she established Women's Health Services in Pittsburgh and served as its executive director for 11 years. The agency at one time described itself as the nation's largest nonprofit abortion clinic.         She is survived by her husband, Donald; two sons, David, of Manhattan and Adam, of Kenova, W. Va., and a sister, Frances Edlitz of Rockville, Md.       
         Simone Yellen Feldman, an interior designer, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 61 years old.         She died of leukemia, said Victoria Hagan, her partner in Feldman-Hagan Interiors, a New York design firm.         Mrs. Feldman was born in New York and obtained a B.F.A. from Syracuse University. She established her own design firm in the late 1950's and became a member of the American Society of Interior Designers in 1975. Ms. Hagan met Mrs. Feldman through a mentor-apprenticeship program sponsored by the A.S.I.D. when she was a student at the Parsons School of Design in 1982. Mrs. Feldman founded Feldman-Hagan Interiors with Ms. Hagan in 1985 to specialize in residential interiors and corporate office work.  Uncluttered, Not Minimal         In the last few years, Feldman-Hagan Interiors has risen to prominence and garnered a following among stylish clients who favored a look that is uncluttered but not minimal. Spare, often neutral-colored rooms, were furnished with an eclectic mix of antiques and modern pieces, as well as graphic modern photographs.         Feldman-Hagan Interiors participated in the 1988 showhouse at Keewaydin, a home in Southampton, L.I., that benefited the Rogers Memorial Library there, and in the prestigious 1990 Kips Bay Boys' and Girls' Club Decorator Showhouse. The decorators devised a "salon of social consciousness," an airy living room that was considered the most influential room in the showhouse.  Recycling a Theme         Combining such objects as an antique toy airplane with a Louis XVI settee and including some handwritten words from Antoine de Saint-Exupery's "The Little Prince," the room wove the concepts of recycling and responsibility to nature into an elegant framework.         Mrs. Feldman's corporate clients have included U.S. Steel, the Harmonie Club and, most recently, Mitsui Fudosan, a Japanese real-estate company.         Mrs. Feldman is survived by her husband, Edgar; a brother, Sherman Yellen; a daughter, Mindy Schanback, and a grandson, Benjamin, all of Manhattan.       
         Mary Vandergrift, a founder and longtime executive of Parke-Bernet Galleries auction house and for many years a major figure in international auctions, died in her sleep on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and also had a home in Bucks County, Pa.         Her daughter, Joan Sweeney of Manhattan, said the cause of death was heart failure.         Ms. Vandergrift was born in Philadelphia on Sept. 4, 1901, and attended college there. Pursuing an interest in art and antiques, she worked for American Art Galleries, later known as American Art Anderson Galleries, a well-known auction house in New York. In 1937, she left American Art with a group of employees that included Hiram H. Parke, Otto Bernet, Leslie A. Hyam and Lewis Marion. Together they formed Parke-Bernet Galleries, which came to dominate New York City's art and antiques auction scene.         Throughout her assocation with the house, Miss Vandergrift oversaw press relations and the design and production of catalogues. When Parke-Bernet was acquired by Sotheby & Company, an English auction house, in 1963, she was named executive vice president of the new firm, Sotheby Parke Bernet. When she retired in 1971, she was succeeded by John Marion, who is now chairman of the firm, which changed its name to Sotheby's Inc. in 1985.         Miss Vandergrift was on the board of the Northside Center for Child Development. Her first husband, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Sr., a career officer in the Army, died in the early 1950's; in 1968 she married E. Swift Newton, an Irish businessman, who died in 1974.         She is survived by her daughter; a sister, Katherine, of Manhattan; her step-son, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Jr., of Orlando, Fla., and three granddaughters.       
         Charlotte Moorman, the cellist, avant-gardist and performance artist who won notoriety for her arrest by the New York City police in 1967 for playing the cello nude from the waist up, died yesterday in Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, which she had been fighting since 1979, said a friend, Barbara Moore.         "Historically, she will be seen as very important to the history of video and performance art," said John G. Hanhardt, curator of film and video at the Whitney Museum of American Art. "She was a vital presence and had a passionate commitment to the avant-garde. She contributed to the humanization of television and video."         She was called "The Jeanne d'Arc of New Music" by the composer Edgard Varese. Ms. Moorman was arrested on Feb. 9, 1967, by two policemen who interrupted her performance at the Cinematheque in Manhattan of "Opera Sextronique" by Nam June Paik, a composer, video artist and performance artist. She was performing nude, as the score had dictated, before an audience of 200 invited guests. Although Mr. Paik was released from custody and not charged, Ms. Moorman was tried and convicted for partial nudity. Later, the sentence was suspended.         In February 1977, a decade after the arrest, Ms. Moorman and Mr. Paik staged a re-creation of their original presentation, called "The People of the State of New York Against Charlotte Moorman." This time, the audience paid $10 a ticket, and this time the two police officers who stormed the stage and threw a coat around Ms. Moorman's shoulders were actors.         Madeline Charlotte Moorman was born in Little Rock, Ark., where she grew up, on Nov. 18, 1933. She received a bachelor's degree in music at Centenary College in Shreveport, La., and studied cello with Horace Britt at the University of Texas in Austin from 1956 to 1957.         Subsequently, she studied cello at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, and became a member of Jacob Glick's Boccerini Players from 1958 to 1963. She was also a member of the American Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski.  Works Called Scandalous         When asked during an interview how she had become interested in the avant-garde, Ms. Moorman said that one day she had grown of a Kabalevsky cello piece and someone had suggested that she try playing John Cage's "26 Minutes, 1.499 Seconds for a String Player," which, among other things, requires the performer to prepare and eat mushrooms.         In 1963, Ms. Moorman was the founder of the Annual New York Avant-Garde Art Festival. Although it wasn't strictly annual, she presided over 15 festivals during the ensuing years. The last one was in 1982. The events showcased artists, often attracted wide publicity and took place at locales like Shea Stadium, Grand Central Terminal, the Staten Island Ferry and the World Trade Center.         She first collaborated with Mr. Paik in 1964. Other works were composed for her by Joseph Beuys and Jim McWilliams. She also performed works by Yoko Ono, who was once her roommate.         Some of Ms. Moorman's best-known pieces, many of them deemed to be scandalous at the time they were performed, are "Cello Sonata No. 1 for Adults Only" in 1965; "TV Bra for Living Sculpture," in 1969, in which she wore a bra made of two small television sets; "Global Groove," a video performance in 1973, and a 1971 Nam June Paik piece, popularly known as "The TV Cello," in which Ms. Moorman played a cello made out of three television sets, to which strings had been attached.         She is survived by her second husband, Frank Pileggi, of Manhattan.         Correction:  December 4, 1991, Wednesday         An obituary on Nov. 9 about the cellist and performance artist Charlotte Moorman misattributed three works she performed. "Cello Sonata No. 1 for Adults Only," "TV Bra for Living Sculpture" and "Global Groove" were all by Nam June Paik, not by Ms. Moorman.

         Sybil Hart Kooper, a retired justice of the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in New York, died yesterday at her home in Brooklyn Heights. She was 66 years old.         She died of breast cancer, a former aide said.         It was because of the cancer that she retired on Oct. 31 from the Second Judicial Department of the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division is the state's intermediate appeals court and the Second Judicial Department is in Brooklyn.         Justice Kooper was appointed to the Family Court by Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1973, elected to the State Supreme Court two years later and was named by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to the Appellate Division in 1985.         A champion of women's rights, she observed in 1982, during a convention of the National Association of Women Judges, that "women judges are sometimes very lonely."         She added, in an interview: "Through this organization we've gained a sense of identification and belonging. We've enhanced our sense of personal worth, price, strength." Notable Murder Trials         During her judicial career, she presided at some notable murder trials. Among them was the racially motivated slaying of a black transit worker, William Turks, by a group of white youths in 1983. When Justice Kooper sentenced a defendant, Gino Bova, to a 5-15 year sentence, she said with stinging terseness that there had been "a lynch mob" on the Brooklyn street that night. "The only thing missing was a rope and a tree," she said.         Justice Kooper, who born in Brooklyn, attended Wellesley College and graduated from the New York Law School. As an attorney, she specialized in family law before being named to the Family Court. Her father, Walter R. Hart, was also a justice of the State Supreme Court and rose to become Presiding Justice of the Appellate Term, Second Department.         Not long before she went on the bench, Justice Kooper sued to gain admittance to the 130-member citywide Metropolitan Trial Lawyers Association, contending that she had been excluded because of her sex. The suit was eventually settled and she became the association's first female member.         One appellate opinion she wrote concerned the boycott of the Red Apple grocery operated by Koreans in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. Her finding in that case was that police officers were obliged to implement an order by a lower court that said demonstrators must remain at least 50 feet away from the store's entrance.         She is survived by her husband, Justice William C. Thompson of the Appellate Division; three sons from her first marriage, to Robert Ross, which ended in divorce: John Hart Ross of Washington D.C., James Franklin Ross and William Stewart Ross, both of Brooklyn, and a daughter from her second marriage, to Stanley E. Kooper, Dr. Grace Kooper, of Cumberland, R.I.

Correction:  December 14, 1991, Saturday         An obituary headline yesterday about a retired justice of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court rendered her name and age incorrectly in some editions. She was Sybil Hart Kooper, and she was 66 years old.

Recognizing the growing importance of homemakers and working women, Mrs. Rindlaub organized nearly 400 women at the agency into sounding boards for products and marketing. As forerunners of marketing-research focus groups, they offered ideas and reactions for products, brand names, packaging and advertising.         Mrs. Rindlaub, born in Lancaster, Pa., was from a Pennsylvania Dutch family. As a teen-ager, she taught typing and shorthand at her father's business school and worked for Armstrong Cork as a secretary to the advertising manager. She became editor of company publications.         She joined B. B. D.&O. in 1930 as a copywriter and supervised campaigns for United Fruit, General Mills and Campbell's Soup. Her slogan for Oneida silverware, "Back home for keeps," resonated as a wartime theme in the 40's. Her work appeared in two compilations, "100 Top Copywriters and Their Favorite Ads" and "100 Greatest Advertisements."         She was a vice chairwoman of the National Safety Council, wrote a newsletter column for the National Council of Women, was a director of the Advertising Women of New York and the Fashion Group and was an adviser to the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.

She was 77 years old and lived in New York City and Jupiter, Fla.         She had suffered from a blood disorder for more than 20 years, said her husband, Lynn Phillips.         Soon after graduating from Rosemount College in Rosemount, Pa., in 1935, she joined the Hearst Corporation, starting at Good Housekeeping magazine. She then moved to Harper's Bazaar, becoming executive editor in 1952. Carmel Snow, Nancy White and Dianna Vreeland were among her associates during the 1950's and 1960's.         In 1971 she was named director of marketing of Harper's Bazaar, and in 1980 became retail marketing manager of Town & Country. Though she retired in 1984, she continued as consultant to Town & Country until the end.

She died of a heart attack, said her sister, Margit Cartwright of Northampton.         Known for her interpretations of Bach, Miss Pessl was an active performer for more than half a century. As founder and director of the Bach Circle, a New York group specializing in lesser-known works of Bach and other Baroque composers, she helped introduce 18th-century music to a wide audience.         Miss Pessl was born in Vienna and studied there at the State Academy of Music. Before immigrating to the United States in 1931, she had a busy career performing in Europe.

By the mid-1930's, she was living in California and was well-established as a painter of commissioned portraits, with Hollywood studio heads like Louis B. Mayer and Adolf Zukor among her clients.         In the 1940's she painted portraits of several members of the Truman Administration and their families, which led to commissions for portraits of the President, his wife and daughter.         Miss Kempton's husband, A. M. McNamara, a lawyer and business executive, died several years ago.
