         Nackey Scripps Loeb, former publisher of two influential conservative newspapers, The Union Leader and The New Hampshire Sunday News of Manchester, N.H., died on Saturday at her home in Goffstown, N.H. She was 75.         Her health had deteriorated recently, partly because of complications from injuries in a 1977 car accident, The Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Loeb was a granddaughter of E. W. Scripps, a major figure in the creation of what became the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain.         She retired in May after 18 years as publisher of the New Hampshire newspapers, which are the state's largest, and as president of the Union Leader Corporation.         She had succeeded her husband of 29 years, William Loeb, who bought the papers in the 1940's and died in 1981.         The papers' influence stems partly from the outspoken role they play in their state's widely watched presidential primaries.         ''We mourn her passing,'' said Steve Forbes, a Republican presidential contender who has won the endorsement of the newspapers. ''Let us be guided by her spirit.''         Mrs. Loeb could be pungently partisan. On the day when President Clinton visited New Hampshire soon after his acquittal on impeachment charges, a front-page editorial, written by her, had the headline, ''Don't Come Back, Kid.''         She was a native of Los Angeles and attended Scripps College in Claremont, Calif.         Her survivors include two daughters, Nackey Scagliotti of Boothbay Harbor, Me., and Edith Tomasko of Hopkinton, N.H.; three brothers, Robert Scripps of Fredericksburg, Tex., Charles E. Scripps of Cincinnati and Samuel H. Scripps of Rhinebeck, N.Y., and three grandchildren.       
         Jean MacArthur, the widow of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who remained at her husband's side through the darkest days of World War II and was often introduced by him as ''my finest soldier,'' died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 101.         Throughout their 27-year marriage, the couple, who met when she was 36 and he was nearly 20 years older than her and was the survivor of an earlier unhappy marriage, maintained an old-fashioned formality. Mrs. MacArthur addressed her husband in the presence of others as ''the general.'' He called her ''ma'am'' and in his later years, confided that she was his ''constant friend, sweetheart and devoted support.''         Mrs. MacArthur, whom William Manchester, the MacArthur biographer, described as ''a poem of womanhood,'' married General MacArthur in New York in 1937. They had met two years previously when he was a fellow passenger on the S.S. President Hoover, en route to the Philippines to assume his duties as military adviser to the government there. Later, he became the supreme allied commander in the Southwest Pacific, waged the campaign against Japan and accepted the surrender of Japanese forces in 1945 in Tokyo Bay aboard the U.S.S. Missouri.         When the war ended, he oversaw the occupation of Japan as supreme commander of allied forces in Japan. After North Korean forces invaded South Korea, he also became supreme commander of the United Nations forces in Korea until April 1951, when, in a dispute over the prosecution of the war, he was relieved of both commands by President Harry S. Truman. He returned to America and a hero's welcome and became chairman of Remington Rand and then of the Sperry Rand Corporation. He died in 1964.         Mrs. MacArthur displayed an indomitable spirit and determination in the face of wartime trials.         After the Japanese invaded the Philippines, it was decided to abandon Manila in 1942 and move the government to the island of Corregidor. Mrs. MacArthur packed a few necessities and, as she was leaving the apartment, she passed a cabinet containing the decorations awarded to her husband. She removed the medals from their cases, wrapped them in a towel and made room for them in her suitcase by discarding some of her own clothes.         Later, when the military situation on Corregidor rapidly deteriorated, the general informed her that President Manuel Quezon of the Philippines had offered her and their young son, Arthur, passage to Australia. ''We have drunk from the same cup; we three shall stay together,'' she replied. The MacArthurs and their 4-year-old son lived in an underground bunker during months of bombardment before agreeing to evacuation on President Franklin D. Roosevelt's orders.         Mrs. MacArthur, the former Jean Marie Faircloth, was born in Nashville on Dec. 28, 1898. Her father, Edward C. Faircloth, was a banker and businessman. She was 8 when her parents divorced and her mother, a native of Murfreesboro, Tenn., took her young daughter and her two sons, Cameron and Frederick, back to her birthplace.         The head of the Murfreesboro household was her grandfather, Capt. Richard Beard, a Confederate veteran, and Mrs. MacArthur was raised in a home where a Confederate uniform was a badge of honor.         Fellow members of the Daughters of the American Revolution recalled that ''every time Jean Faircloth heard a Fourth of July firecracker go off, she jumped to attention and saluted.'' Young men were advised that ''if you want to win Jean Marie, you better get a uniform.''         Mrs. Faircloth married again in 1907 and there were two children of that marriage to Frederick Smith -- Harvard Smith and Donna Angeline Smith.         Mrs. MacArthur was educated at Ward-Belmont College in Nashville and at Soule College in Murfreesboro, from which she graduated.         As a young girl, she had not been close to her father, but as he grew older and wealthier, he frequently took her on trips and cruises with him. When he died, he left her a substantial fortune, and she used it to travel extensively, visiting friends in Manila, cruising in Europe and taking her half-sister on a South American cruise and her half-brother on a three-month round-the-world cruise.         A vivacious woman with meticulous manners, Mrs. MacArthur took seriously the social duties connected with her husband's position, both in the military and later in private life. After his death, she refused to bask in reflected fame, leading a quiet social life within a select circle of well-known New Yorkers. She pursued her interests in fashion, theater and opera.         Friends recalled that on one occasion at the Metropolitan Opera, she paused as she walked down the aisle to make sure that the plaque bearing her name was still attached to an orchestra seat. ''I paid $1,000 for it,'' she said.         She also worked on behalf of several civic and philanthropic activities, and was honorary chairman of the board of the Gen. Douglas MacArthur Foundation in Norfolk, Va. In 1990, at age 91, with her friend Barbara Bush at her side, she cut the ribbon opening the research center of the MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk, where her husband is buried.         Mrs. MacArthur received the distinguished public service award from the Department of Defense in 1984, and in 1988, President Ronald Reagan presented her with the Medal of Freedom, the highest award given a civilian in peacetime, for her patriotic service to the nation. The government of the Philippines honored her in 1993 with its Legion of Merit medal. She was one of the few private citizens to receive a visit from the Emperor and Empress of Japan during their trip to the United States in 1994.         One of her favorite stories when she reached the last decade of her life was about her conversation with the driver as she was bouncing around in a New York City taxi. ''I'm 90 years old,'' she said. ''Can you go a bit slower please?''         ''I'm sorry, Mrs. MacArthur,'' the driver said. ''I remember you from the Philippines and how you bounced around in the jeeps there and it didn't bother you.''         Her intimate friends also recalled that although she would order a martini ''to be social'' when dining out, she had earlier briefed the waiters and bartenders in her favorite restaurants on what that really meant. A martini glass filled with water and decorated with a lemon twist would be brought to her, and she would smile appreciatively as she sipped.         She is survived by her son, Arthur, of New York City, and her half-sister, Angie McCarthy, of Murfreesboro, said Col. William J. Davis, executive director of the MacArthur Foundation in Norfolk.         Mrs. MacArthur will be buried beside her husband at the MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk after a private service for her on Wednesday, Colonel Davis said.       
         Hsieh Ping-ying, a Chinese feminist author known for her autobiographical work, died on Jan. 5 in San Francisco. She was 93.         Miss Hsieh moved to San Francisco in the mid-1970's from Taiwan, to which she had fled from mainland China in 1949.         Miss Hsieh ''pioneered the literary construction of a soldier image for women -- as imaginative as it may have been -- and thereby influenced this kind of literature in China for decades,'' said Charles A. Laughlin,  professor of modern Chinese literature at Yale University.         Her first book was ''War Diary,''  published in 1928 in Shanghai. Dr. Laughlin recalled that, in writing the book, Miss Hsieh accompanied soldiers of the Chinese Nationalist army in 1926 and 1927, when it was trying to bring warlords in the eastern half of China under control and while she was a ''girl soldier'' with propaganda training.         ''At a time when Chinese women were trying to find new modes of identity in the 20th century after having shed the shackles of traditional Chinese feminine identity, there were many different, alternative identities available to them,'' Dr. Laughlin said, ''and I think she was the first to create this very military one.''         A scholar's daughter, Miss Hsieh was born in a village in Hunan province. Before she was 20, she enrolled in the Wuchang Central Political and Military School. The academy trained young women to be uniformed propagandists attached to the regular military.         After her relatively brief military service Miss Hsieh returned to her village and an arranged marriage. In 1940 her book ''Girl Rebel: The Autobiography of Hsieh Pingying'' was published in the United States.         After her marriage ended, Ms. Hsieh was charged with being a Communist and radical and was imprisoned. After her release she studied Chinese literature and worked as a roving writer, editor and teacher. In 1937, when Japan invaded China, she again became a ''girl soldier,'' accompanying Chinese combat troops to the front. Diary entries about her experiences appeared in newspapers and in another book. After World War II she escaped to Taiwan, where she taught and wrote.         Her second husband, Earl Chia,  died in 1988. The couple became American citizens after moving to San Francisco. She is survived by a daughter, Lily Chia Brissman of Nacogdoches, Tex.; two sons, Luke, of Palos Verdes, Calif., and Wen, of Ambler, Pa., and four grandchildren.       
         Justice M. Dolores Denman, the first woman to serve as presiding judge in the Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court, died on Jan. 17 at her second home in Naples, Fla. She was 68 and lived in Buffalo.         After struggling with cancer for months, she announced in late December that she planned to step down from the bench.         Justice Denman, a former Buffalo city judge and Erie County Court judge, was elected to State Supreme Court in 1976. The next year, Gov. Hugh L. Carey appointed her to the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, covering western New York.         After an unsuccessful run for state attorney general in 1978, she was re-elected to State Supreme Court with bipartisan support in 1979 and was reappointed as an associate justice of the Appellate Division in 1981.         Gov. Mario M. Cuomo named her presiding justice for the 22 western counties of the Fourth Department in 1991. She also served on the five-member administrative board of the state's Unified Court System.         Mary Dolores Welch was born in Buffalo. She was a 1957 honors graduate in English and American studies at the University of Buffalo. She earned her law degree at its School of Law in 1965 and began her legal career that year in the Panama Canal Zone. She was an assistant prosecutor in Erie County before becoming a city judge in Buffalo in 1972.         She is survived by her husband of 35 years, James Denman; two sons, Daniel Stanton of Ridgewood, N.J., and James L. Denman of Manhattan; a daughter, Diana Denman of Atlanta; a brother, Rupert Welch of Falls Church, Va.; and three grandchildren.       
         Victoria A. Fromkin, an internationally renowned linguist who gathered the flotsam of human discourse -- slips of the tongue, mishearings and other speech errors -- and used it to illuminate the way in which language is organized in the mind, died on Jan. 19 in Los Angeles. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said officials at the University of California at Los Angeles, where Dr. Fromkin, an emeritus professor of linguistics, had taught since 1965.         In addition to publishing many articles on psycholinguistics, Dr. Fromkin and Robert Rodman wrote ''An Introduction to Language'' (Harcourt Brace), now in its sixth edition and regarded as the seminal undergraduate textbook in the field.         As Dr. Fromkin was gleefully aware, everyday speech contains many a slip 'twixt the brain and the lip. While earlier scholars had noted the theoretical usefulness of these errors, she was the first to gather them in quantity, colleagues said, building a collection of linguistic inadvertencies like spoonerisms (''speech production'' coming out as ''preach seduction''), semantic substitutions (''That's a horse of a different race'') and slips of the ear (''All of the members of the group grew up in Philadelphia'' heard as ''All of the members of the group threw up in Philadelphia'').         To know Dr. Fromkin was to be accustomed to having every verbal lapse transcribed for scientific posterity in a notebook she carried.         Dr. Fromkin used the collection, which grew to more than 10,000 examples, to offer evidence of the unconscious knowledge of language structure that people draw on whenever they speak.         A person who means to say ''bridge of the nose'' but says ''bridge of the neck'' instead, she explained, was furnishing concrete, if unwitting, evidence that the words ''nose'' and ''neck'' are stored near each other in some sort of mental lexicon.         Dr. Fromkin was born Victoria Alexandra Landish in Passaic, N.J., on May 16, 1923. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1944. She married Jack Fromkin in 1948. A son, Mark, died in an automobile accident at age 16.         Returning to school in her late 30's to study linguistics, Dr. Fromkin received a master's degree from U.C.L.A. in 1963 and a Ph.D. from the same institution in 1965. She joined the faculty that year.         From 1980 to 1989, she was vice chancellor of graduate programs at U.C.L.A., one of the first women in the University of California system to hold such a position.         She was a past president of the Linguistic Society of America. Dr. Fromkin is survived by her husband.         ''We all produce slips of the tongue,'' Dr. Fromkin wrote in 1980. ''And those of us trying to understand the nature of language and language use are grateful for this fact.''       
         Anne Devenney, the spark plug of community organization who helped keep the tidy, solid neighborhoods of the northwest Bronx from turning into another burned-out urban slum, died Jan. 9 in the Bronx. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A former resident of Norwood, the Bronx, she recently lived with her daughters in Yonkers.         Mrs. Devenney was a founder, president emeritus and living legend of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, which started in the mid-1970's. An umbrella organization for nine community groups, it champions home ownership, tenant-controlled housing, street safety and local investment.         ''She was a no-nonsense Bronx grandmother who took leadership of a whole part of the Bronx in some of its darkest times as the head of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition,'' said the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, who had known her for some 20 years. ''She led the charge against arson for profit, housing deterioration and unresponsive politicians. She was a real original.''         At times, it seemed that her coalition was fighting sluggish bureaucracies and corporate obtuseness as much as the obvious symptoms of urban blight. It took on the problems of drug dealing, street crime, vacant buildings and the flight of residents that those things would set off, but it also attacked mortgage redlining and the deterioration of city services.         Anne O'Hanlon was a child of the Depression, the youngest of seven children born to Irish immigrant parents in Hell's Kitchen, on the West Side of Manhattan. She lived in tenements there, in Harlem and in Morningside Heights. As a teenager, she washed and ironed and scrubbed floors for the well-to-do on Riverside Drive for $1.25 a day.         She dropped out of high school and got a $12-a-week dime-store job, but returned to night classes to earn a high school diploma. A defining experience of her youth was the eviction of her family from their apartment house, which was demolished to make room for a ramp to the George Washington Bridge.         In 1941, she married John Devenney, and in 1956, the couple moved to Putnam Valley, N.Y., from which Mr. Devenney commuted to his draftsman's job in New York City. But the suburbs were not her natural habitat, and Mrs. Devenney later said that she hated being dependent on a car and that all the rain and snow and hard mud for months on end made her long for the swept pavements of the city.         In 1962, the family moved back to the Bronx into a fifth-floor five-room apartment on Perry Avenue, but in a few years, the ailments of the inner city moved into the neighborhood. Black and Hispanic refugees from the South Bronx moved in, with the causes of their flight in pursuit.         Landlords, frightened by the wave of arson sweeping the borough, began to neglect their buildings and even abandon them. Many white working-class families started to think of moving to other places for a haven. But Mrs. Devenney's upbringing among people of different races and creeds had taught her that the struggle against community destruction knew no color.         Banding together with members of the clergy and young community organizers, she began to haunt hallways and community centers, trying to shake people out of their complacency and into partnerships with residents of surrounding areas where the blight was setting in.         The result was the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition. It and its affiliated groups badgered city officials for decent sanitation services and the money to keep streets, parks and other public places in good repair. They trooped to City Hall, demanding action against landlords who burned their buildings for the insurance money.         They homed in on redlining by insurers that refused to write policies in their neighborhoods for fear of losses and by banks that denied mortgages in the community despite the large amounts of deposits that they held from its residents.         Coalition members picketed corporate headquarters, invaded annual meetings with proxies from stock-owning churches, and met personally with politicians and executives who knew little of the people living in those communities.         Mrs. Devenney's husband died in 1993.         She is survived by two daughters, Betty Devenney and Carol Gibney, both of Yonkers; two sons, John, of Macon, Ga., and Joseph, of Mahopac, N.Y.; 14 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Devenney stayed in the forefront of the campaign for neighborhood survival until the late 1980's, negotiating with commissioners, mayors and banking and insurance executives for a fair share of city services and private-sector investment.         She described herself as ''conservative-liberal-radical,'' explaining, ''I have to be conservative because I want to conserve my neighborhood, liberal to keep my mind open and radical to carry a picket sign.''       
         Catherine M. Rae, a writer who published her first novel at 73, died on Dec. 25 at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 85 and lived in Guilford, Conn.         Shortly after earning her Ph.D. at 65, Ms. Rae wrote her first book, ''Edith Wharton's New York Quartet,'' a work of literary criticism about the writer, who with Eudora Welty served as Ms. Rae's inspiration. The book was published in 1984.         Her first attempt at fiction went unpublished after an editor at St. Martin's Press suggested it was beyond repair and she should write another.         This resulted in ''Brownstone Facade,'' a mystery romance in the style and tone of her beloved Wharton set on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1920. It was published in 1988 and called ''a cozy, intelligent diversion'' by The New York Times.         Seven other novels followed, among them ''Flight From Fifth Avenue'' and ''The Hidden Cove'' in 1995 and ''Sunlight on a Broken Column'' in 1997; an eighth is being edited for publication. Often set against the backdrop of fin de siecle New York society, her works frequently centered on a historical event like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Ms. Rae's literary papers -- she was an avid researcher -- will be donated to the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library.         She was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Horace Mann School in 1931. She received a bachelor's degree from Barnard in 1935, a master's degree in teaching from Manhattanville College in 1970 and a Ph.D. in English literature from Denver University in 1979.         Ms. Rae's husband, Gene, died on Nov. 13. She is survived by a son, David, of Ridgewood, N.J.; three daughters, Lucy Rae Ricciardi of Greenwich, Conn., Catherine Rae Reed of Littleton, Colo., and Mary Louise Rae Arnold of Fort Worth, and eight grandchildren.       
         Hedy Lamarr, the raven-haired Viennese beauty who became one of the reigning temptresses in Hollywood films in the 1930's and 40's, especially as Delilah vamping Victor Mature's Samson, was found dead in her home in Orlando, Fla., yesterday. She was 86.         Miss Lamarr was forever identified with ''Ecstasy,'' a 1933 Czech film in which she appeared nude in a swimming scene and in a lovemaking sequence that was torrid for its time. The film was banned in many places in the United States for a number of years. But even though most Americans never saw it, ''Ecstasy'' excited their interest in the actress and shaped her career.         But as David Thomson, the film historian, said of her work in the United States: ''It became her lot to be cast as exotic, sultry women -- and she did her best; but conscientiousness is not quite what we expect in our femme fatales. Too often, she had a worried look.''         Miss Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Marie Kiesler in Vienna, the daughter of a well-to-do banker and a concert pianist. She studied acting with Max Reinhardt in Vienna in 1931. He watched her read her lines one day and declared that she was either ''the most beautiful girl in the world'' or ''the most beautiful girl in Europe.'' (Press reports at the time carried both versions.)         She appeared in a few films before ''Ecstasy,'' a mostly silent film that was well received in Europe, where it was released as ''Symphonie der Liebe.'' Pope Pius XI  denounced it, but Mussolini issued a permit so that it could be shown at the Venice Film Festival. It won no awards there but attracted attentive audiences, most of them men.         By the time ''Ecstasy'' had begun to make the rounds in Europe, Miss Kiesler  was married to the first of her six husbands, Fritz Mandl, a Viennese munitions maker who was then in the process of making a tidy fortune by selling his wares to the Nazis. Mr. Mandl was upset by the film and spent a great sum of money tracking down and purchasing prints of ''Ecstasy'' so that nobody would see it. He explained that it was not so much because his wife could be seen nude, but because of the look on her face during the sex scenes.         Mr. Mandl came to regret all the money he spent buying the film. He didn't get all the prints. Then the Nazis seized his factory (he didn't pay his taxes, they claimed), and  Miss Kiesler left him (she thought he was dull) and made her way to London. There she got an acting job and was seen by Louis B. Mayer, who immediately offered her a contract to work for MGM, his Hollywood studio. Mr. Mayer changed her name to Lamarr after a silent film star named Barbara La Marr, whom he admired.         ''Ecstasy'' arrived in the United States in 1934 and was promptly banned in New York.  It was the subject of numerous court tests in the 1930's.         When the star of ''Ecstasy'' arrived in New York on the liner Normandie in 1937, she was mindful that ''Ecstasy'' had arrived before her and was determined to have audiences believe she was more than just a pretty face. She refused to display her knees for the photographers from the New York dailies who met the ship (her skirt reached her ankles), and she asked them not to refer to her as Hedy Kiesler anymore. ''Please call me Hedy Lamarr,'' she said.         In 1938 she made her first American film, ''Algiers,'' with Charles Boyer, with the result that undergraduates at Columbia voted her the girl with whom they would most like to be marooned on a desert island. She became popular; men fantasized about her, and women began to wear their hair as she did, parted down the middle.         But Miss Lamarr never achieved the stardom of some of her fellow emigrees -- Greta Garbo, Greer Garson or Marlene Dietrich -- all of whom won plaudits not just for their  sex appeal but also for their acting. The reviews of Miss Lamarr's films all emphasized her beauty, but when the scripts actually gave her something to say, the critics were not as passionate.         ''Now that she has inadvisedly been given an opportunity to act,'' wrote Bosley Crowther, reviewing ''Lady of the Tropics'' for The New York Times in 1939, ''it is necessary to report that she is essentially one of those museum pieces, like the Mona Lisa, who were more beautiful in repose.''         When she played a seductress enchanting  British plantation owners in Africa in ''White Cargo'' in 1942, Miss Lamarr purred, ''I am Tondelayo.'' This became grist for comedians; Jack Benny made  many jokes on the radio about an imaginary salesgirl named Tondelayo Schwartzkopf.         In another of her best-known roles, she gave Victor Mature the ultimate haircut in  ''Samson and Delilah,'' Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 epic. DeMille, who never overlooked the box-office potential of sexy women in the Bible and the actresses who played them, had a clinging gown made for her out of feathers from prize peacocks he kept.         Among Miss Lamarr's other films were  ''Comrade X'' (1940) with Clark Gable, for King Vidor; ''Boom Town'' (also 1940), in which she seduced Gable. She also appeared as a showgirl with Judy Garland and Lana Turner in ''Ziegfeld Girl'' (1941), and with Spencer Tracy and John Garfield in ''Tortilla Flat'' (1942). She was considered difficult to please and was said to have turned down memorable parts that went to Gene Tierney (''Laura'') and Ingrid Bergman (''Casablanca'' and ''Gaslight.'') After her appearance in ''Samson and Delilah'' she went on to display her perfect profile in such films as ''Copper Canyon'' (1950), ''A Lady Without Passport'' (1950), the comedy ''My Favorite Spy'' (1951) and ''The Story of Mankind'' (1957) as her career faded .         Her private life was messy and sad.         In early 1939, she met Gene Markey, a writer and producer in Hollywood, and they  eloped to Mexico. She divorced Mr. Markey the following year, complaining to a judge that they had been married for 14 months and that in all that time, he had spent only four evenings alone with her. The judge granted the divorce, but suggested that if she ever contemplated a future marriage, she should spend more than a month getting to know her man.         After her divorce from Mr. Markey, Miss Lamarr went to a Hollywood dinner party at the home of Janet Gaynor and there met George Antheil, the composer. Miss Lamarr and Antheil got to talking about the war and how tough it was going to be to stop the Nazis.         As the story goes, Miss Lamarr recalled hearing some conversations that had occurred between her first husband, Mr. Mandl, and the Nazis, who seemed to place great value on creating some sort of device that would permit the radio control of airborne torpedoes and reduce the danger of jamming. She and Antheil got to discussing all this. The idea, they decided, was to defeat jamming efforts by sending synchronized radio signals on various wavelengths to missiles, which could then be directed to hit their mark.         Antheil supplied the technical expertise for the concept and on Aug. 11, 1942, the two received a United States patent for the use of radio-controlled missiles that could be used against the Germans. There were some doubts that Miss Lamarr had the technical background to give much to the project, but Antheil always credited her. The government was not initially interested in their device, but a refined version of it was used by the American military in the 1960's -- after the patent had expired. They never made a dime. In 1996 they were honored for their work by a professional engineering society. ''It's about time,'' was Miss Lamarr's only comment.         In 1941 Miss Lamarr was briefly engaged to the actor George Montgomery. She continued to make movies and worked hard to sell millions of dollars in war bonds. She told an audience in Philadelphia that she was just ''a gold digger for Uncle Sam.'' In the spring of 1943 she married the British actor John Loder. She knew him six months before she married him. They were divorced three years later.         Miss Lamarr's other marriages -- to Teddy Stauffer, a former band leader who ran a nightclub in Acapulco, Mexico; Howard Lee, a Texas oilman; and Lewis W. Boles, a West Coast lawyer -- all ended in divorce.         She adopted a son, James, and had two children with Loder, a son, Anthony, and a daughter, Denise; they all survive her.         Early in her career, a certain litigiousness manifested itself and continued to dog her existence. In 1943 she sued Loew's and MGM because they failed to pay her a contractual $2,000 a week. They said they were unable to pay her what they owed because President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had issued a wartime executive order limiting all salaries to $25,000 a year. The case was settled out of court.         Over the years, she was involved in several other lawsuits that did not work out so well. Among them was one against a Los Angeles department store that had accused her of shoplifting. (She was acquitted of the charge, and her own lawsuit against the store was dismissed.)         Best known of her lawsuits was one directed in the 1960's and 70's against the publisher and ghostwriter of ''Ecstasy and Me: My Life as a Woman,'' an autobiography that was intended to revive her notoriety as a sex goddess. She said the book was ''deliberately written as an obscene, shocking, scandalous, naughty, wanton, fleshy, sensual, lecherous, lustful and scarlet version'' of her life. Her suit failed.         In 1991, living sparingly in South Florida, she was again accused of shoplifting ($21 worth of personal-care items from a drug store) but not prosecuted. In recent years, Miss Lamarr lived quietly in a suburb of Orlando. Friends said she was legally blind and did not venture out on her own.         ''What happened to me?,'' Miss Lamarr  asked the syndicated columnist Sheilah  Graham in 1966. ''I made $7 million and yet I was on relief and they gave me all of $48 a week.''         ''I'm not so crazy about acting,'' she told Miss Graham. ''All that makeup and getting up so early. Maybe I'll go to Europe. Oh, they want me. I have many offers.''       
         Betty Cage, an administrator of the New York City Ballet who played a quiet but important role in creating the company, died on Dec. 19 at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 82 and lived in Manhattan.         Her title for many years was simply that of general manager, but Ms. Cage was a linchpin of the City Ballet. She avoided the limelight and was unknown to the general ballet going public. A woman of few words, she presided over generations of dancers, choreographers and backstage personnel with a wryly detached wit and a calm, almost uncanny sense of approaching trouble.         Ms. Cage was, as Lincoln Kirstein described her role in ''Thirty Years,'' his history of the City Ballet, ''at once labor negotiator, certified public accountant, legal expert, mother superior, confessor, psychiatrist and practicing witch (white magic).'' She was, Kirstein wrote, ''proficient in the science and pursuit of the possible and impossible.''         Born in Minneapolis, Ms. Cage grew up in Buffalo before she moved to New York. She worked in a law office before becoming an assistant editor at John Bernard Myers's literary journal View and an assistant to Frances Steloff at the Gotham Book Mart, jobs that introduced her to the world of poets, artists and intellectuals involved in dance in the 1940's.         It is likely that Kirstein met Ms. Cage at the Gotham Book Mart, where he is said to have invited her to work with Ballet Society, a precursor to City Ballet. Ms. Cage arrived in 1947 and retired formally in 1985, working first as an assistant to Frances Hawkins, the business manager at Ballet Society. It was there that Ms. Cage formed a close professional relationship with Morton Baum, who as chairman of the City Center's finance committee in 1948 extended a crucial invitation to the ballet company to become a resident of the theater. Ms. Cage also helped to engineer the City Ballet's 1964 move to Lincoln Center on terms agreeable to the ballet company and to City Center. In 1985, she founded the Dancers Emergency Fund at City Ballet.         Ms. Cage was also a practitioner and proponent of tai chi, the Chinese exercise system. She collaborated with her husband, the writer Edward Maisel, on ''Tai Chi for Health.''         She is survived by her husband.       
         Hazel Wolf, an ardent environmentalist whose life spanned the 20th century and whose causes encompassed the era's social turmoil, died in Port Angeles, Wash., on Wednesday. She was 101 and lived in Seattle.         Since the early 1960's Ms. Wolf was a leader in the Audubon Society, serving as secretary of the Seattle chapter for 37 years and helping to establish 21 of the 26 Audubon chapters in Washington. She was also active in the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, as its one-time president and as editor of its newsletter until her death.         Born in the 19th century, Ms. Wolf had long spoken of wanting to witness the 21st. She told the oral historian Studs Terkel, who profiled her in his 1995 book ''Coming of Age,'' that she intended to live until the year 2000. ''Then I'm going,'' she said.         Especially in the Seattle region, but also beyond, she was elder stateswoman in a community of intersecting social causes, recognized by the Association of Biologists and Ecologists of Nicaragua for conservation work there, by the Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility with their Paul Beeson Peace Award, by the National Audubon Society with its medal of excellence and last year by Seattle with its Spirit of America Award.         But long before the environmental movement blossomed, providing a cause that made her celebrated in her later years, Ms. Wolf was steeped in struggles over human rights, communism, labor issues, peace, feminism and immigration.         Hazel Anna Cummings Anderson was born on March 10, 1898, in Victoria, British Columbia. Her father was Canadian and her mother was American. After separating from her first husband, Edward Dalziel, she moved to the United States in 1923 with her daughter, finding work as a legal secretary, her lifelong career.         She joined the Communist Party during the Depression, attracted by its support for social welfare programs like food subsidies, unemployment aid and social security.         Her first party meeting, she recalled in a speech years later, was at a home where the local sheriff was at that moment trying to evict a family. ''I joined in what was occurring,'' she said. ''As the sheriff's men brought the furniture out to pile it on the sidewalk, the rest of us picked it up and took it into the house by the back door. This went on for quite a while until the sheriff and his men, who were not very enthusiastic in the first place, left in despair and frustration.''         Ms. Wolf said she lost interest in the party during World War II, as the wartime boom made issues of economic security less compelling to her. But years after she left the party, the government tried to expel her, starting a personal and legal struggle that shaped her life. That fight lasted 15 years, as McCarthyism rose and fell. She once joked that a lawyer she worked for at the time spent so much effort on her case that it was not clear who was working for whom.         The experience led her into advocacy for the rights of immigrants, a cause she never gave up. ''The foreign born were the earliest victims of the McCarthy witch hunt,'' she said 10 years ago in a talk to a high school class. ''They still have a hard and uncertain life.''         In that lecture, as on many other occasions, Ms. Wolf recounted being thrown in jail briefly in 1958, charged with sedition though she had left the Communist Party 13 years before. She told the two other women in her jail cell that she had been accused of conspiring to overthrow the government by violent means. ''What a wonderful idea,'' one of her fellow prisoners said.         ''I never did try to overthrow the government, or if I did, I didn't do a very good job,'' Ms. Wolf said.         But her associates said she never gave up trying to overthrow whatever she saw as unjust, whether it was the behavior of big corporations or the policies of the United States in Nicaragua. Her reputation grew, and she became a frequent public speaker (many of her speeches can be found on the World Wide Web at members.tripod.com/HazelWolf). Only a broken hip prevented her from joining the protests by unions and environmentalists in Seattle during the recent meeting of the World Trade Organization, said Brock Evans, president of the Western Outdoor Clubs.         ''One of her major causes was always for labor to join with environmentalists,'' he said. Another was for environmentalists to include Native Americans, blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups in their movement.         ''People gang up to protect all kinds of things -- civil liberties, freedom of speech,'' Ms. Wolf once wrote. ''It's in our genes to gang up. Anytime we want anything, we gang up.''         Summing up her many causes, she told the American Immigration Lawyers Association last year, ''We lost most of the battles but we won the war in all of them.''         She told them insouciantly that when she finally became an American citizen in 1974, after taking the oath and forswearing allegiance to foreign potentates, she went to a bar to celebrate with friends. ''I proposed the following toast: 'To hell with Queen Elizabeth and to hell with Richard Nixon, too.' ''         She is survived by her daughter, Nydia Levick of Port Angeles, five grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and four great-great grandchildren. Her second marriage, to Herbert Wolf, also ended in divorce.         Ms. Wolf was already at most people's retirement age when a friend persuaded her to join the Audubon Society in the early 1960's. It was the era when Rachel Carson was warning that pesticides and the eradication of habitats were threatening the earth with a silent spring with no song birds, but more than that book or her friend's arm-twisting, it was bird-watching (specifically, observing a brown creeper grubbing in the woods) that sparked her deep involvement with Audubon. For decades more, she continued to go to the woods for inspiration and to urge others along the environmental path.         But she spiced her advocacy with a dollop of salt. In a speech last year on saving the endangered salmon of the Pacific Northwest, she reminded her Seattle University audience of the first reason to do so: the fish are ''good to eat.''         And in a speech on sustainable forestry practices in 1998, she said her goal was not, as she quoted the poet, to ''spare that tree, cut not a single bough,'' but rather to make sure there would always be forests for wild creatures and to provide homes, furniture, paper and ''probably even skateboards.''       
         Mary Cantwell, who wrote essays, books and editorials for The New York Times, many about the changing public and private lives of women in America, died yesterday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Margaret Lescher of Riverdale, the Bronx.         As a member of The Times editorial board for 16 years, Ms. Cantwell wrote often about issues affecting women. A notable one concerned ''the squeal rule,'' the label she coined for a 1982 Reagan administration proposal to forbid giving contraceptives to teenagers unless their parents were informed. Such a rule, she wrote, would discourage effective contraception and increase teenage pregnancies.         ''Thanks to the coinage,'' the columnist William Safire later wrote, ''the battle is being won by the anti-squeal forces.''         Apart from unsigned editorials, Ms. Cantwell wrote personal observations for The Times and elsewhere about the pride and pain brought by three decades of transformation in the lives of women, particularly in the spheres of work, marriage and divorce, and parenthood.         Why could she not cry about a sick calico cat, she wondered in a ''Close to Home'' column in 1990. One reason, she realized, is that ''Women were reputed to weep on the job.''         ''Not this woman. No way I was going to let somebody know I'd been gotten at; no way I was going to give somebody that satisfaction.''         On divorce, she gave voice to many readers' feelings in a ''Hers'' column in The Times in 1980, describing the day she and her former husband watched their older daughter's high school graduation: ''There on stage is someone who is half he, half she; their blood, their genes. They created somebody: the woman is awed. As long as there is a she, the woman thinks, there is an us.''         Starting in her childhood in Bristol, R.I., Ms. Cantwell was an acute observer of the era in which she lived.         ''I never wanted to be anything but a writer,'' she once said, ''but I saw no hope, had no expectations. I feel, perhaps wrongly, that I grew up in an era when writing was very much a boys' club. It took a brave woman, braver than I, to write books.''         Still, she wrote three. The first, ''American Girl'' (Random House, 1992), was a love letter to Bristol. A Times reader ''wrote in and said there is a small town in the background of everything I ever wrote, so why didn't I write about that small town,'' she said. And so she did, about a three-generation household in a town where the oldest resident carried a gold-headed cane to lead the Fourth of July parade.         After ''American Girl,'' her readers wrote in again. Now they wanted to know what happened to that girl. ''New York was what happened to that girl,'' Ms. Cantwell said, explaining how she came to write ''Manhattan, When I Was Young'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1995). It described her life in the prosperous postwar years, the heyday of the Stork Club and Bonwit Teller.         In her third book, ''Speaking With Strangers'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1998), she talked about pushing herself to travel, after the end of her marriage to Robert Lescher, a literary agent.  She also described an on-again-off-again affair with a celebrated Southern writer she identified only as ''the balding man,'' a womanizer who dropped her for someone younger.         She said that she had not wanted to distract readers by naming him. Later, after many critics and some readers had guessed, she acknowledged him to be James Dickey.         After Ms. Cantwell graduated from Connecticut College in 1953, she landed a job in New York as a copywriter at Mademoiselle magazine, where she worked during the next 23 years, including 9 as managing editor and features editor.         In 1980, she was invited to be one of the early guest writers of the Hers column in The Times. Later that year, she joined the Times editorial board, commenting on social policy issues like smoking, abortion and assisted suicide, and on whimsical topics such as the world as seen from the M10 bus.         In 1981, she wrote ''Dear Abby,'' a widely quoted editorial about Evangeline Gouletas-Carey, the new wife of Hugh L. Carey, the governor of New York. Before the wedding, Mrs. Gouletas-Carey described herself as a widow. But her former husband turned up alive and well, and so did two other former husbands she had not mentioned.         ''Dear Abby'' read as if it were a letter to the advice columnist from Mrs. Gouletas-Carey. ''What I want to know is, Abby, can you think of a way I might have avoided all this fuss?'' It was signed, ''Wondering.''         She matured as a writer, she said, after she discovered the novelist Jean Rhys. ''That was a writer I could best emulate,'' she said last year. ''That was a life and sensibility I understood.''         She was struck by one Rhys observation: ''If I stop writing my life will have been an abject failure,'' Rhys wrote in ''Smile, Please,'' an autobiographical memoir. ''I will not have earned death.''         Ms. Cantwell reflected on that in a 1980 ''Hers'' column. ''To earn one's death,'' she wrote, ''I think of it as a kind of parlor game. How, I shall ask my friends, would you like to earn your deaths? And how would I like to earn mine? The question is strangely liberating, implying as it does action, energy, choice. In fact, it has an unexpectedly American ring: death as First Prize. I like it -- it makes the nights less frightening.''         Besides Margaret Lescher, she is survived by another daughter, Katherine Lescher of Sydney, Australia;  her mother, Mary G. Cantwell of Bristol; a sister, Diana Nickerson of Pittsburgh; and a granddaughter.       
         Jeanne Simon, the wife of former Senator Paul Simon who forged her own public career as a prosecutor, lawmaker and lobbyist for literacy and libraries, died on Sunday at their home in Makanda, Ill. She was 77.         Mrs. Simon had undergone surgery for the removal of a malignant brain tumor in September. At the time, her surgeons said the operation had succeeded, but they left open the long-term prognosis.         When her husband, an Illinois Democrat, left the Senate in 1997, Mrs. Simon joined him on the faculty of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale as an adjunct professor of library affairs. She helped him found and shape the agenda of the Public Policy Institute at the university.         In 1993 Mrs. Simon was named chairwoman of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, a post to which President Clinton reappointed her in 1997. In that position she promoted literacy programs and financing for libraries.         Born in Chicago, Jeanne Hurley graduated from Barat College in Lake Forest, Ill., and from Northwestern University Law School. She served as an assistant state's attorney for Cook County and was one of a few women in the Illinois Legislature when she met her husband, then a fellow lawmaker.         They were married in 1960 and teamed for several of his political campaigns, including the senator's 1988 stab at the Democratic presidential nomination.         She chronicled her experiences on the stump in a well-received memoir, ''Codename Scarlett -- Life on the Campaign Trail by the Wife of a Presidential Candidate.''         Besides her husband, Mrs. Simon is survived by a daughter, Sheila Simon of Carbondale; a son, Martin, of Crofton, Md., and four grandchildren.       
         Filomen D'Agostino Greenberg, a self-taught stock trader who used her good fortune to help her alma mater, New York University Law School, grow into an academic leader, died Friday. She was 101 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Arriving from Coney Island one morning in 1917 to start classes, Fil D'Agostino -- as she was called by friends -- found five small rooms crammed into a single building east of Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. Fresh out of high school, she got a $3-a-week clerk's job and received her law degree in 1920.         While she was practicing negligence and criminal law, she married Max Greenberg, a 1919 New York University law graduate who became a highly successful expert in contract law; he died in 1980.         In World War II, Mrs. Greenberg worked as a government censor. One day she came across a letter filled with arcane abbreviations and fractions that read like code. She realized that she was looking at stock-market quotations. Her interest piqued, she reached for the daily paper, and a new carer opened up.         Since her husband showed no interest in the market, she pursued it on her own, but they both began many years of strong financial support for the law school. She continued her investments, and her donations, after her husband's death.         By 1990, her gifts totaled more than $6 million, which made her the school's biggest benefactor at the time. Her help made possible the Filomen D'Agostino Residence Hall for about 370 students; its inspiration was her difficult trip back and forth from Brooklyn every day when she was a student. Her help also financed the Greenberg Lounge on the campus, the Greenberg Faculty Research Fund and the Greenberg Professorship in Contract Law.         She is survived by a sister, Deborah Johnston.         Law, Mrs. Greenberg once said, was not her first career choice. ''I wanted to study medicine,'' she said, ''but no school in New York would admit a woman, and my family was too poor to send me away to study.''       
         Mildred Root Mottahedeh, a collector of Chinese export porcelains and co-founder of a company that produced porcelain reproductions for several United States presidents and institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died last Thursday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         Born in Seabright, N.J., Mildred Root began collecting Japanese prints at 13 after moving to New York. She met Rafi Y. Mottahedeh, an Iranian-born importer, in New York, and the union of ''two collecting nuts'' came to be, she told The New York Times in 1989.         Married in 1929, the Mottahedehs began acquiring Oriental porcelains, ivories, jades and bronzes, amassing one of the world's finest private collections with some 2,000 pieces. In his foreword to ''China for the West,'' an authoritative publication on the Mottahedeh collection, Nelson A. Rockefeller, a friend and fellow collector of Chinese export porcelain, described the collection as ''utterly fabulous, an artistic and cultural treasure without comparison in its field.''         In 1929, the couple founded Mottahedeh & Company in Manhattan, which rose to prominence as one of the most prestigious firms in the reproduction of porcelain, producing some 1,500 different items for more than 3,000 stores, from Tiffany's to small gift boutiques. The company also reproduced pieces in the collections of museums like the Metropolitan and the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris for sale in their shops. Mottahedeh reproductions have graced the White House as well as the reception rooms of the State Department in Washington.         With an eye for good design and a mind for practicality, Mrs. Mottahedeh refused to reproduce a piece simply for its historical significance but demanded instead that the object ''have character and usability.'' Among those works meeting her criteria were a monteith, or punch bowl, incorporating the presidential seal, which President Ronald Reagan presented to heads of state, and a dinner service designed by Pierre L'Enfant for George Washington.         When her husband died in 1978, Mrs. Mottahedeh succeeded him as president and remained active in the company, even after it was sold, until her retirement in 1998.         A member of the Bahai faith since 1929, Mrs. Mottahedeh served for many years as the first Bahai representative to the United Nations. With her husband, she founded a series of primary and secondary schools in Uganda, and maintained four village development projects in Maharashtra state in India that served as training facilities in agricultural techniques, public health services and the development of local handicrafts.         In 1958 the couple created a foundation, Mottahedeh Development Services Inc., to help with social and economic development projects in the third world.         She is survived by a daughter, Peri Yusef of London; a son, Roy P., of Brookline, Mass.; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Eva Julia Neer, a biochemist and heart researcher at Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, died on Sunday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 62.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, her family said.         Dr. Neer was widely known for her investigations into the ways a certain class of proteins helps people see and smell, lets brain cells communicate and makes the body respond to hormones and most prescription drugs. In more than 30 years of research, she combined the tools of chemistry, biology, physics and molecular biology to explain how cells interpret the messages they get from light, hormones and neurotransmitters.         Dr. Neer spent most of her professional life in the cardiovascular unit at the hospital and last went to her laboratory the week before she died, working on the last of her many scientific papers. She was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, its Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences.         Born Eva Augenblick in Warsaw, she arrived in New York at age 8 and grew up in Queens and Scarsdale. She attended Radcliffe College, graduated from Barnard College in 1957 and received her medical degree at Columbia University in 1963.         After finishing her internship and residencies, she joined the staff at Harvard as a researcher in biology in 1966. She was appointed an assistant professor in biochemistry at the medical school in 1976 and became a full professor in 1991.         She joined what was then Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in 1976 as an associate in medicine and was named a biochemist at Brigham and Women's six years later. She also was associated with the American Heart Association as an investigator and with the biochemistry section of the National Institutes of Health, which gave her its N.I.H. Merit Award in 1989.         Dr. Neer is survived by her husband, Dr. Robert Neer, and their two sons, Robert Jr. and Richard, all of Cambridge.       
         Nuala Pelletier, the office manager for The New York Times Company Foundation, died of breast cancer on Sunday at her home in Sparkill, N.Y. She was 63.         Mrs. Pelletier, a native of Dublin, was with the foundation, which gives grants to nonprofit organizations, for eight years.         Mrs. Pelletier, the former Madeline Nuala Moran, began working for The Times in 1959, where she was joined by other members of her family as the years passed. Her husband, Robert Pelletier, who died in 1997, was a Times art director; her daughter, Alexandra, is a news assistant on the Times national desk; her sister, Clare Salvaggio, is a staff assistant on the Times Magazine staff, and another sister, Cecilia Moran, was a  Times secretary, now retired.         Besides her two sisters and her daughter, Alexandra, of Sparkill, Mrs. Pelletier is survived by her mother, Madeline Moran of Chestnut Ridge, N.Y.; another daughter, Etain, also of Sparkill; a son, Kieran, of Turbotville, Pa.; another sister, Marie Long of Jersey City; three brothers, John Moran of Manalapan, N.J., Joseph Moran of Ireland, and Robert Moran of Wappinger Falls, N.Y.; and two grandsons.       
         Mae Faggs Starr, an Olympic champion sprinter and the first renowned athlete of the Tigerbelle women's track teams at Tennessee State University, died Jan. 27 at her home in Woodlawn, Ohio. She was 67.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Eddie Starr.         In the 1950's, when women's track and field began its emergence, the Tigerbelles became a national force. Tennessee State's most heralded sprinter would be Wilma Rudolph, who at the 1960 Games in Rome became the first American woman to capture three gold medals in a single Olympics. Faggs, known as ''the mother of the Tigerbelles,'' was the first American woman to compete in three Olympics and was a mentor to Rudolph.         At the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, she ran the first leg on the 4x100 relay that captured a gold medal in a world-record 45.9 seconds, teaming with Barbara Jones, who would go on to Tennessee State; Catherine Hardy; and Janet Moreau.         At the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, Faggs ran on an all-Tennessee State 4x100 relay squad -- with Rudolph, Margaret Matthews and Isabelle Daniels -- that won a bronze medal.         Faggs won 11 national Amateur Athletic Union titles and was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in Indianapolis in 1976.         Aeriwentha Mae Faggs was born in Mays Landing, N.J., but grew up in New York City. She was a student at Bayside High School in Queens when, at age 16, she competed in the 1948 Olympics in London, failing to qualify for the 200-meter finals.         In the fall of 1952, she left for Tennessee State, a historically black school in Nashville. She had never been in the South and was warned by her father about the segregation she would face. But she thrived at Tennessee State, having been the first athlete recruited by Ed Temple, who would build a national reputation as the Tennessee State women's track coach and an Olympic coach.         ''She had a lot of determination, a lot of drive,'' Temple recalled Tuesday from his home in Nashville. ''She didn't back off from anybody, and she was a good student.''         Faggs was tested early on by her teammates.         ''I was already a national outdoor champion, I was national indoor champion, I had been to the Olympics,'' she recalled in an interview with Runner's World magazine in 1993. ''My teammates, all they cared about in practice was running past Mae Faggs. You couldn't let your guard down at all because if one ran past you . . . hey. They turned around and gave you one of those looks that said, 'Uh-huh, I got you now.' ''         With the Melbourne Games coming up, Faggs was trying for her third Olympic berth while Rudolph was a teenager hoping for her first. At the United States trials, Faggs set out to steady Rudolph's nerves with the finals of the 200 meters in sight even though they would compete against each other.         ''I knew Wilma was nervous because she was only 16, and I knew how nervous I was at 16 trying to make the Olympic team,'' Faggs remembered. ''So I told her: 'You do everything I do.' And she says, 'O.K.'         ''In the 200, Wilma was on the inside lane, I was in the second lane, and I couldn't see her coming out of the corner of my eye. So I turned my head and said, 'Come on.' And she said, 'I'm coming.' And she was coming. I mean, she was blowing down that straightaway. I had to reach back and get some of those horses I didn't think I had to beat her.''         After graduating from Tennessee State, Faggs received a master's degree from the University of Cincinnati and then taught physical education at high schools in the Cincinnati area.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Eddie Starr II, of Phoenix, and a daughter, Evelyn Starr, of Pittsburgh; two brothers, Melvin Faggs, of New York City, and Steve Murray, of Huntsville, Ala.; and two grandchildren.       
         Lenore Kight Wingard, an American swimmer who won medals in the 1932 and 1936 Olympics, died Wednesday at a hospital in Cincinnati, where she lived. She was 88.         Wingard won a silver medal in the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles and a bronze at the 1936 Games in Berlin, both in the 400-meter freestyle.         Her silver-medal performance in 1932 came just a tenth of a second behind Helene Madison of the United States in a race so close that the judges took 15 minutes before declaring a victor. And both Wingard and Madison, who won with a time of 5 minutes 28.5 seconds, broke the previous world record.         As much as her medals, Wingard remembered the atmosphere of the 1936 Olympics, which was dominated by the presence of Hitler. Wingard, who swam in the days of wool suits and shirts, recalled that she once couldn't cross a street and go to her dormitory room for more than two hours because Hitler was coming down the route.         ''Where we stayed, we were fenced in, always guarded by soldiers,'' she told The Cincinnati Enquirer in an interview in 1991. ''When it was over, I was glad to get home.''         Wingard, a member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was born in Frostburg, Md. She taught herself to swim when she was 14, growing up in the Pittsburgh area.         She then went on to local, state and national meets. In 1933, she won all the national freestyle swimming championship meets from 100 meters to 1,500 meters. By 1936 she held more swimming titles than any other woman.         Wingard won 20 national freestyle championships, and she held 21 American records and 7 world records in the freestyle.         After retiring from competitive swimming, she managed pools, taught swimming and, until about five years ago, swam about three miles a week at a local Y.M.C.A.         She is survived by her husband, Cleon J. Wingard; a son, Cleon Jr., of College Hill, Ohio; a daughter, Diane Lynn Peterson, of Denver; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Jacqueline Auriol, the glamorous French flier who set several speed records as one of the world's leading military test pilots in the 1950's and 60's, died Saturday at her Paris home. She was 82.         Ms. Auriol was born to the world of fine boarding schools and country manors and married the son of the man who would become president of France. However, she would eventually transcend her role as the official tea pourer of Elysee Palace to succeed in a field that had been almost entirely masculine, except for Hanna Reitsch of Germany, a test pilot for the Third Reich.         Ms. Auriol's life was transformed when her face was crushed in a 1949 accident in a plane in which she was a passenger. She endured 33 plastic surgery operations over the next three years. (She did not see her two sons, Jean-Claude and Jean-Paul, until her face was as restored as possible. It seemed to work: a newspaper commented that her nose might now be American, but her smile remained unmistakably French.)  Rather than discouraging her, the experience turned her resolve to achieving greatness in the air.         Though she had learned stunt flying before her accident, her goal became nothing less than breaking the sound barrier. She watched the Vampire fighter being built in 1951 and eagerly volunteered to be one of the first to fly it.         ''That day I experienced a sense of completeness,'' she told Collier's magazine, ''an extraordinary sensation of power.''         But she had to settle for being the second woman to break the sound barrier, in 1953. The first was Jacqueline Cochran, an American, earlier that year. The two Jacquelines were to become famous rivals, as each in turn would edge beyond the other in speed.         Jacqueline Douet was born on Nov. 5, 1917, at Challans, a small town on the Bay of Biscay. Her father, Pierre Douet, was a wealthy shipbuilder. She spent most of her childhood at Nantes, then studied art in Paris at L'Ecole du Louvre. On weekends, she would ski in the French Alps.         In 1936, she meet her future husband, Paul Auriol, through a friend who was a ski champion. His father, Vincent, was a prominent leader of the Socialist Party. Both families opposed an alliance between Socialists and wealthy industrialists, so they insisted they were too young to marry. She was sent to Sweden, while Paul toured Italy.         However, two years after their original meeting, they married at a small mountain chapel. They divorced in 1967 and remarried in 1987. She was later widowed. Only her two sons survive her.         When World War II broke out, she refused to leave France while her husband was in the resistance movement. She lived in hiding under a false identity. ''I began to realize that I loved danger,'' she told The Washington Post in 1970.         After the war, her father-in-law became president and she, her husband and Jean-Paul, her older son, moved into Elysee Palace. She soon realized ''the parties and receptions were not enough to keep my interest.'' At dinner one night, she sat next to a flying ace and was so captivated by his stories that she asked if she and her husband could take flying lessons from him.         ''It was very difficult politically for my father-in-law because so few women flew at this time,'' she said.  ''I was pretty and I knew I was pretty. There was publicity and I began to be heavily criticized for my flying.''         The result was that her husband gave up flying, while she dropped out of the social and political life to devote herself to it. Then the accident happened. ''I was broken into a million pieces,'' she said. ''I had no face, no nose, nothing.'' She needed a new purpose in life. ''I had the chance of my life to really become a good pilot,'' she said. ''Now that my beauty was gone I would have to derive a reason for being from the plane which had taken it away.''         As an aviatrix, as Current Biography listed her in its 1950's coverage of her achievements, she succeeded greatly, flying more than 100 types of aircraft. She received aviation awards from Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. She was decorated with France's Legion d'Honneur and wrote an autobiography called ''Vivre pour Voler,'' meaning living for flying. At her death, Jacques Chirac, President of France, called her ''the incarnation of courage and modernity for the French people.''         Her conception of modernity did not include all of feminist philosophy. ''These very feminist women irritate me when they say, 'Men hold me back,' '' she said. ''It's not true.''         But she never undervalued the effect of luck. She had a narrow brush with death in 1956, for example, when her Mystere IV plane went into spin and she managed to bring it back under control only a few dozen yards from the ground.         It was all worth it. In the Colliers interview, she spoke of the rows of flowers on the grounds of Elysee Palace. ''Poor creatures,'' she said, ''guardians and ornaments of the Elysee. Once my life was like theirs.'' She then smiled broadly. ''Perhaps I should teach them to fly,'' she said.       
         Barbara Cooney, an author and illustrator of children's books whose first work was published in 1940 and whose 110th, ''Basket Moon,'' appeared last fall, died on Friday at a hospital in Portland, Me. She was 83 and lived in Damariscotta, Me.         Miss Cooney honored the admonition she ascribed to her best-loved character, Miss Rumphius, who said, ''You must do something to make the world more beautiful.''         She won the Caldecott Medal for illustration twice, first in 1958 for a version of Chaucer's ''Chanticleer and the Fox'' in full color in the scratchboard technique she had been using for roughly 20 years. Her second Caldecott, in 1980, was for paintings for Donald Hall's ''Ox-Cart Man'' that were in a distinctive primitive folk art style.         Each prize changed the artistic course of her career. After the first she began to paint, and after the second she began to write her own stories to illustrate, including what she retrospectively called a trilogy -- ''Miss Rumphius'' (1982), ''Island Boy'' (1988) and ''Hattie and the Wild Waves'' (1990). They made up what she said was ''as close to any autobiography as I will ever get.''         She was born in 1917 at the Hotel Bossert in Brooklyn Heights, which was built by her maternal grandfather. ''Hattie and the Wild Waves'' describes in detail her artist mother's childhood in a wealthy German-American family.         Miss Cooney grew up on Long Island and began summering in Maine at age 2. She graduated from Smith College in 1938 and studied lithography and etching at the Art Students League in New York.         She married Dr. Charles Talbot Porter and reared four children while he practiced medicine in Pepperell, Mass., later moving to a house overlooking the sea in Damariscotta.         The somewhat awed narrator of ''Miss Rumphius'' describes her great-aunt as ''little and old'' but adds, ''she has not always been that way.'' Miss Rumphius is also known as the Lupine Lady because, after an adventurous life, she has returned to the Maine coast, where she harvests and scatters the seeds of her favorite plant. ''Island Boy'' tells the story of Matthais Tibbetts, who lived almost his entire life on a remote Maine island.         Maine, the much-loved scene of many of Miss Cooney's books, treasured the author in turn. In 1989 the Maine Library Association created the Lupine Award to honor outstanding children's books by state residents or authors of books about Maine, beginning with Miss Cooney, and in 1996 Gov. Angus King proclaimed her a Living Treasure of the State of Maine. In 1997 Miss Cooney announced a donation of $550,000 to the library in Damariscotta, and later added $300,000. Groundbreaking for a library costing $2 million will be next month.         Miss Cooney received many honorary degrees and won numerous awards in addition to the Caldecotts, including the American Book Award for ''Miss Rumphius'' in 1983.         In addition to her husband and four children, she is survived by two brothers, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.         Miss Cooney's work is much admired for its historical detail and accuracy, from the embroidery on Eleanor Roosevelt's baptismal gown (''Eleanor'') to details of Finnish folklore (''Louhi, Witch of North Farm'').         In her 1959 Caldecott acceptance speech she explained: ''How many children will know that the magpie sitting in my pollarded willow in 'Chanticleer and the Fox' is an evil omen? How many children will realize that every flower and grass in the book grew in Chaucer's time in England? How many children will know or care? Maybe not a single one. Still I keep piling it on. Detail after detail. Whom am I pleasing -- besides myself? I don't know. Yet if I put enough in my pictures, there may be something for everyone. Not all will be understood, but some will be understood now and maybe more later.''       
         Jean Howard, who rode the comet of her extraordinary beauty, ethereal glamour and insouciant intelligence to become a Ziegfeld girl, a Hollywood starlet, a legendary hostess and the house photographer of the film colony, died at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Monday. She was 89.         Ms. Howard's circle included Tyrone Power, Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Jennifer Jones, Merle Oberon, Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe -- impressive company for the daughter of a traveling salesman. She thrived in a seemingly ancient time when stars socialized for purposes other than publicity, including simply enjoying each other's company.         They played croquet in matches that lasted years (with timeouts for rest, refreshment and the occasional movie), played on California beaches and hung out in Palm Beach, Palm Springs and the south of France. They also mingled at Ms. Howard's Spanish-style home on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills; she and her first husband, Charles K. Feldman, who used his success as the first super-agent to become a producer, bought it for $18,000 in 1942.         Everywhere, Ms. Howard snapped pictures. One shows Gene Tierney, then a top star at 20th Century Fox, in pigtails, looking longingly into the handsome face of the mysterious millionaire Howard Hughes. Another shows a tipsy Richard Burton kissing everyone in sight, including a less-than-charmed Clifton Webb.         Still another shows Dietrich almost touching heads with Ann Warner, wife of Jack, the studio head, as they intensely discussed never-to-be-known secrets over a smoky table at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Linda Christian can be seen being fitted for her wedding gown to marry Tyrone Power.         Many of these photographs were stored in shoe boxes. Meanwhile, Ms. Howard studied photography and began to get assignments taking pictures for magazines like Life and Vogue. Years later, the idea coalesced to combine her snapshots and professional work in a picture book.         In 1989, Harry N. Abrams published ''Jean Howard's Hollywood: A Photo Memoir.'' James Watters wrote the text, which is delivered through Ms. Howard's first-person voice. The book evokes a lost world where stars lived lives that were breathtakingly glamorous, but still somehow life-sized.         In the pictures, everyone, it seems, is smoking. Everyone is holding a drink, everyone is dressed in black tie or cocktail dress. People gather around the piano and sing. Conga lines end up in swimming pools.         ''These photographs bring back memories of a time and a place that have long since faded,'' Ms. Howard wrote in the book's introduction. ''Hollywood has changed and things don't happen as they once did. Never mind. The people who crowd these pages are clear as snowcapped mountains on a bright sunny day.''         Ms. Howard was born Ernestine Hill in Longview, Tex., and grew up in Dallas. She became acquainted with a local photographer, who had discovered several child stars, including Ginger Rogers, and believed she had a bright future. So she changed her last name to that of the photographer, Mahoney, even though her father continued to foot the bills for her fashion shows and beauty contests.         Her father took her to Hollywood one summer in the late 1920's. ''I was his coverup while he was on a two-week toot with a girlfriend behind my stepmother's back,'' she said in the book.         She soon returned to Hollywood and checked into the all-girl Studio Club, founded by Mary Pickford to help young hopefuls working toward movie careers. In 1930 she landed a contract with Metro Goldwyn Mayer, appearing first as a chorus girl in ''Whoopee,'' Eddie Cantor's Broadway musical hit.         Florenz Ziegfeld, who had produced the Broadway show and was a partner in the film, asked her and three other showgirls to go to New York for his next musical, ''Smiles.'' Ziegfeld cast her under the name Jean Howard, which he deemed less cumbersome than Ernestine Mahoney. She got a part in the last ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' where one review cited her ''pulchritude, figure and charm.''         As an MGM contract player she had small roles in a number of movies in the 1930's and 1940's, including ''Broadway to Hollywood'' and ''The Prizefighter and the Lady.'' The studio chief Louis B. Mayer, passionately attracted to her, proposed marriage and promised to divorce his wife. She said later that when she rejected him he got drunk and tried to throw himself out of a window.         She became engaged to Feldman, a lawyer and film agent, who is credited with being the first to sell director, actors and other talent as a single package. According to The New York Times of Aug. 26, 1934, the two had attended a Friday night dinner party at the Colony restaurant in New York and decided to get married immediately.         Mayer's jealous threat to torpedo Feldman's career did not materialize, and the agent went on to play an increasingly prominent role in Hollywood, eventually producing ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' in 1951, among other films.         The couple had a famously tempestuous relationship, which resulted in a divorce in 1948. But they continued living in the same house, with its tortoise shell pedestals and Chinese porcelain lamps and a garden room where Judy Garland belted out songs on many occasions. They called it their ''can't live with you, can't live without you postmarital relationship.''         In a 1989 interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune, Ms. Howard said she ''wanted to be the other woman in his life.''         Ms. Howard traveled extensively, often with her friend Cole Porter. That resulted in another picture book, ''Travels With Cole Porter,'' published in 1991.         In 1964, she felt seasick on a Mediterranean cruise and got off the yacht in Capri. She went to a nightclub called Number Two, where a band called the Shakers was playing. She asked a band member, Tony Santoro, if he would play a song she had written. He did, though not necessarily because of its quality.         ''I was more interested in this beautiful woman than the music,'' he said in a telephone interview. They lived together for nine years, mainly in Capri and Rome, and were married in 1973. He is her only immediate survivor.         Ms. Howard once said that ''glamour is flimsy.'' She knew the stars as people, including one of her favorite subjects, Marilyn Monroe. ''She didn't know who she was or who she belonged to,'' Ms. Howard told the San Diego paper. ''The marriages never gave her anything to go on. There was the ballplayer (Joe DiMaggio) and Arthur Miller.         ''Miller was a very good writer and all of that, but I have never seen him in anybody's living room, and I have been in a few living rooms.''         Then there was the party she gave for Senator John F. Kennedy during the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, at which he won his party's nomination. After everyone had left and she was cleaning up, she heard someone scratching at the window screen, according to a 1993 article in Town & Country.         She looked out and saw Kennedy, who said, ''I'm starving and nothing's open at this hour.'' She led him to the kitchen and fed him scrambled eggs. She said the senator then pulled her to him and kissed her. She told the magazine that people would have to read her autobiography to find out what happened.         But she never published one.       
         Katharine Washburn, an essayist, editor, anthologist and translator whose legacy includes a cornucopia of verse from the dawn of civilization to the present, died Wednesday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 57.         The apparent cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Ms. Washburn was editor, with John S. Major, of ''World Poetry: An Anthology of Verse From Antiquity to Our Time'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), an updated and expanded version of Mark Van Doren's 1928 ''Anthology of World Poetry.''         At 1,338 pages, including the index, the volume contains 1,600 poems ranging over more than 4,000 years, from ancient Sumer and Egypt to the late 20th century. The editors organized it in eight chronological parts from the Bronze Age forward, with each section subdivided by language.         Most of the poems were translated into English for the anthology by other poets. Its English-language verse sampled the best from Chaucer to the present.         Ms. Washburn herself translated poetry from classical and modern European languages. Among her earlier work was a 1986 translation from the German of poems by Paul Celan (North Point, 1986). At her death, she was working on a novel, ''The Translator's Apology.''         She was co-editor of ''Dumbing Down: Essays on the Strip Mining of American Culture'' (Norton, 1996). It presented the worried views of observers from many vantage points of the present state of American life, art and thought.         She co-edited ''Tongues of Angels, Tongues of Man: A Book of Sermons'' (Doubleday, 1999). It was filled with the ringing words of preachers addressing the vagaries of the world, from the Sermon on the Mount to Savonarola's contempt for the vanities of Renaissance Florence to the anti-Nazi defiance of the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer.         Ms. Washburn was a graduate of Pembroke-Brown University and earned an M.A. at Columbia University, where she also received a Ph.D. in classic Greek. In the 1980's she was on the editorial staff of the Book-of-the-Month Club, and her articles appeared in The New York Times Book Review, Partisan Review, Parnassus and New Republic, among others.         She is survived by her husband, Sherwood; her parents, Calman Winegarden of Toledo, Ohio, and Margaret Winegarden of Rochester; a sister, Mary Hoyle of San Francisco; and three sons, Andrew, Michael and Will, of Brooklyn.       
         Vivian Fine, a composer who wrote ballet scores for Martha Graham and Jose Limon, as well as copious amounts of orchestral, chamber and vocal music, died on Monday at the Southern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington after an automobile accident. She was 86 and lived in Hoosick Falls, N.Y.         Ms. Fine composed in a style that evolved gracefully over the years. Her early works, with their expressive dissonance, inventive counterpoint and sharp rhythmic edges, reflect both the influence of her teacher, Roger Sessions, and the practical demands of writing for modern dance groups. Later she developed a language in which technical demands and a slightly acerbic sensibility were balanced by wit and lyricism. By the late 1980's her shorter works were being included regularly in recital and chamber programs.         Ms. Fine was born in Chicago on Sept. 28, 1913, and began her musical life as a piano prodigy. She won a scholarship to the Chicago Musical College when she was 5. She later studied with Djane Lavoie-Herz, a student of Scriabin. Her early composition teachers included Ruth Crawford Seeger and Adolf Weidig. She moved to New York in 1931, where she continued her piano studies with Abby Whiteside and studied composition with Sessions.         In the mid-1930's Ms. Fine worked as a rehearsal pianist for several New York dance companies, and within a few years she was composing for them as well. Among her early ballet scores are ''The Race of Life'' (1937) for Doris Humphrey, ''Opus 51'' (1938) for Charles Weidman and ''Tragic Exodus'' and ''They Too Are Exiles'' (both 1939) for Hanya Holm. She later wrote ''Alcestis'' (1960) for Graham and ''My Son, My Enemy'' (1965) for Limon.         Ms. Fine's symphonic works include ''Elegiac Song'' for muted strings (1937) and ''Meeting for Equal Rights 1866,'' for soprano, baritone, narrator and chorus (1976).         As an active campaigner for American music, she helped found the American Composers Alliance in 1938 and was its vice president from 1961 to 1965. She was also concerned with feminist issues. One of her operas, ''The Women in the Garden'' (1978), includes among its scenes a colloquy between Virginia Woolf, Isadora Duncan, Gertrude Stein and Emily Dickinson, using quotations from their writings. Her last major work, ''The Memoirs of Uliana Rooney'' (1994), was a multimedia opera with a libretto by Sonya Friedman that followed a female composer through the decades of the 20th century. The work is partly autobiographical but alludes as well to Alma Mahler and Ruth Crawford Seeger.         Still, Ms. Fine was uneasy with the idea of defining composers by their sex. ''I hope the term 'woman composer' will be dropped soon,'' she told an interviewer from The New York Times in 1989. ''I think we are in a better place than we were 20 years ago. Women are accepted in literature, painting and sculpture. We don't talk of 'poetesses' anymore. And woman performers as soloists -- singers, pianists, violinists -- have been accepted for a long time.''         Ms. Fine taught composition at the Juilliard School, New York University, the State University of New York at Potsdam and Bennington College in Vermont.         She is survived by a sister, Adelaide Fine of Shaftsbury, Vt., and two daughters, Peggy Karp of Berkeley, Calif., and Nina Karp of North Bennington, Vt.         Correction:  March 28, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the composer Vivian Fine on Friday omitted a survivor. He is her husband, Benjamin Karp of Hoosick Falls, N.Y.       
         Helen Venturelli, a champion of better benefits for widows of police officers and firefighters killed on the job, died March 15 at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 86 and lived in the Bronx.         In 1943, Mrs. Venturelli's husband, Pasquale, a policeman, leapt onto the running board of an automobile to try to apprehend two teenagers who were stealing the car. He died instantly when they rammed the vehicle into a wall.         Mrs. Venturelli was left with two sons, Robert, 9, and Alfred, 7, and a pension of $125 a month, with no increases for inflation. She earned extra money from various part-time jobs, and was eager to get involved when Florence Churchill, who was trying to raise three children with polio on a $125 monthly pension after her husband died in the line of duty, wrote her in 1960 about forming an organization to fight for higher payments to police widows.         At the first meeting of what became the Police and Fire Line of Duty Widows of New York City, Mrs. Venturelli pressed to include firefighters' widows, a suggestion that was immediately embraced. The group started a series of demonstrations at City Hall and elsewhere, and in 1962 won an increase in pensions equal to half the average monthly salary of a police officer, $347. In 1968, after years of struggle, they won hospitalization insurance, the same as that given to city workers.         Mrs. Venturelli succeeded Mrs. Churchill as president in 1977 and served in that post for 20 years. A striking woman with blue eyes, perfectly coiffed hair and a collection of distinctive hats, her powers of persuasion at City Hall and in Albany were keen, said Louise Crane, vice president of the widows' group.         ''She knew how to talk, she could talk to anybody,'' said Mrs. Crane, whose husband was shot six times as he chased a robbery suspect up a Harlem fire escape in 1963.         Mrs. Venturelli is survived by her son, Alfred of Westchester; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Venturelli visited Albany each year to fight for inflation adjustments. Beginning in 1978, she and her allies were successful each year.         ''If you don't keep after something, you sometimes get forgotten,'' Mrs. Crane said. ''And another thing Helen did: she always had them write thank-you notes.''       
         Nancy Binns Reed, a composer of musicals and operas, died on Saturday at her home in Burke, Va. She was 75. The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Reed, who wrote some 250 compositions, ranging from songs to marches to operas, achieved her widest success with the 1953 pop song ''Oh, Happy Day,'' which she co-wrote with Don Howard Koplow. Mrs. Reed also wrote a musical, ''Tocqueville!'' in 1976 and ''The Blue Opera,'' a contemporary treatment of Orpheus and Eurydice.         Her husband, Ogden Cartwright Reed, died in 1980. She is survived by a daughter, Amy Reed Geiger of Fairbanks, Alaska; three sons, Hayward C., of Spokane, Wash., Ogden Cartwright Reed Jr. of Philadelphia and Chris B., of Los Angeles.       
         Essie Green Edmiston, an art dealer who represented many 20th-century African-American artists through her Harlem gallery, died on Feb. 26. She was 61 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was bladder cancer,  said Sylvia Hueston, a friend.         Mrs. Edmiston began showing art in her Brooklyn apartment in the 1970's while running a full-time psychiatric social work practice. After meeting the painter Romare Bearden, she turned her attention toward art as a career. With a credit union loan she established the Park Plaza Gallery in Park Slope in 1979. This was followed by the Essie Green Galleries in Harlem in 1989.         There she showed work by Bearden, Lois Mailou Jones and Jacob Lawrence, all of whom she knew as friends. She also showed the work of Allen Stringfellow, Norman Lewis, William S. Carter, William Ossawa Tanner, Charles Ethan Porter, Edwin Bannister and Charles Alston. At the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture she organized a Bearden show in 1991 and a Stringfellow show in 1998.         Mrs. Edmiston was born in Miami in 1938 and grew up in Springfield,  Mass. She received a master's degree in social work from New York University and was preparing a dissertation in social policy at Columbia University at the time of her death. She continued to practice as a psychiatric social worker until the mid-1980's.         She was a founding stockholder of  the Innercity Broadcasting Corporation, which is the owner of the radio stations WBLS-FM and WLIB-AM in New York City. She was also on its board. She was also a board member of the Nanette Bearden Contemporary Dance Theater. Since 1973 she  had been a member of the Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist organization.         She is survived by her husband, Sherman K. Edmiston Jr.; two stepchildren, Sherman K. III and Lisa A.  of New York City; three grandchildren; her mother, Mary L. Green,  and two brothers, Reuben Jr. and Eli Green, all of Springfield, Mass.; and five sisters, Betty Davis of Oakdale, Conn., Katherine Mutcherson of Silver Springs, Md., Iraline G. Barnes of Washington, Phyllis Green of Atlanta, and Lorraine Green of Chicago.       
         Sandra Schmirler, the star of the first women's curling team to win an Olympic gold medal and one of Canada's most popular athletes, died Thursday in Regina, Saskatchewan. She was 36.         She died of cancer, the Canadian Curling Association said.         Known as Schmirler the Curler, Schmirler starred in a sport that is one of Canada's passions, especially with families in the western provinces. One newspaper called her the public face of a Canadian sport.         ''When you played her, you were in awe,'' Colleen Jones, a two-time Canadian champion, told The Globe and Mail of Toronto. ''You knew she was better. You knew she was going to beat you. It was like playing against Gretzky.''         All curlers, men and women, recognized her focus and skill.         ''She is one of the best players, probably the best player ever,'' said Russ Howard of New Brunswick. ''She raised the level of curling. It's unbelievable what she did.''         Curlers slide round granite stones down a 146-foot-long, 15-foot-7 1/2-inch-wide sheet of ice into a 12-foot circle known as the house, while two sweepers with straw or synthetic brooms help steer the stone.         Schmirler, who was born in Biggar, Saskatchewan, on June 11, 1963, was introduced to curling when she was 12. By high school, she had won provincial prep titles in curling while also starring in badminton and volleyball.         After graduating from the University of Regina, Schmirler was asked to join a local team. Later, she joined forces with Jan Betker, Joan McCusker and Marcia Gudereit, forming a foursome of friends, working mothers and Olympic gold medalists.         The Caledonian Curling Club, with Schmirler as the skip, or captain, won the provincial title its first season together, 1990-91. The women then won the Canadian and world titles in 1993, 1994 and 1997.         Schmirler was six months pregnant when she won the world title in 1996 and was on maternity leave from her job with a recreation center when the team went to the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.         ''When you have success and you're having fun, it just snowballs and gets bigger and bigger,'' Schmirler said of the team's success.         Schmirler's group won the 1998 gold medal by defeating Denmark in Nagano, the first Olympics to make curling an official medal sport. The first athletes from Regina to win an Olympic gold medal became national heroines.         Carol Anne Letheren, chief executive officer of the Canadian Olympic Association, said Schmirler ''was a Canadian with whom other Canadians could identify.''         Schmirler's team was voted the Canadian Press team of the year for 1998, and she was inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame last March.         Shortly after Schmirler gave birth to her second child last summer, following a difficult pregnancy, doctors discovered a malignant tumor in her chest cavity. During surgery last September to remove blood clots, she nearly died on the operating table.         Doctors were not able to pinpoint the source of the cancer as she underwent chemotherapy, radiation therapy and other forms of alternative treatment.         All the while, the country rallied to support her and help pay for her medical expenses.         ''I didn't think I was that good until I started reading all the cards and letters and faxes and e-mails,'' said Schmirler, who died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital's Palliative Care Unit.         ''All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler,'' Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada said in a statement. ''Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life.''         She is survived by her husband, Shannon England; their daughters, Sara and Jenna; her mother, Shirley; and two sisters, Carol and Beverley.         Flags at all provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.       
         Sasha Von Scherler, an actress and comedian who appeared in more than 100 productions in New York City, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 65 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung disease, said her daughter, Ruth Mayer.         Miss Von Scherler followed her mother, an actress trained by the playwright and producer David Belasco, into a life in the theater. Her father, a Prussian baron named Walram-Voystingus Albert Alexander Von Schoeler, did not approve.         In a 1980 interview in The New York Times, Miss Von Scherler said her early life was marked by some radical peregrinations, from a convent school in Windsor, Ontario, to Tokyo, where she first set foot on stage in an amateur production.         After attending the Yale School of Drama -- she was expelled for staging a personal sit-in to show her opposition to building stage scenery -- Miss Von Scherler made her professional debut at the Cherry Lane Theater in 1956, in George Bernard Shaw's ''Admirable Bashville.'' It was the first in a nearly unbroken string of plays over the next 20 years.         Among her roles were Mrs. Brown in Eugene O'Neill's ''Great God Brown'' in 1959, Olivia in Joseph Papp's 1969 production of ''Twelfth Night'' in Central Park, and Avonia Bunn in three separate productions of ''Trelawney of the Wells.'' She helped support her acting habit by appearing in several soap operas.         More often than not Miss Von Scherler, a woman with large, twinkling eyes and a merry laugh, played supporting roles, often stealing scenes. In a 1971 review of ''Trelawney,'' Walter Kerr of The Times wrote that ''Miss Von Scherler was rather like a fine painting propped in one corner; the rest of the room might be filled with attractive objects and engaging people, but your eye kept wandering back to her.''         In the mid-1980's Miss Von Scherler earned a master's degree in social work and became a therapist and counselor; she worked for more than 10 years at an AIDS treatment center in Greenwich Village.         In 1995 she appeared in ''Party Girl,'' a film written and directed by her daughter, Daisy Von Scherler Mayer.         In addition to Daisy and Ruth Mayer, both of Brooklyn, she is survived by her husband, Paul Avila Mayer, and another daughter, Rachael, of Glen Ridge, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Hart, the editor of two highly praised books of song lyrics by her brother-in-law, Lorenz Hart, of Rodgers and Hart fame, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Ontario, Calif. She was 94 and lived in Rancho Mirage, Calif.         Mrs. Hart was the widow of Lorenz Hart's brother, Theodore, a comedian. She and Robert Kimball edited ''The Complete Lyrics of Lorenz Hart'' (Knopf, 1986), containing some 670 of the songs Lorenz Hart wrote before his death in 1943.         The book was lauded in a review by the cabaret singer Bobby Short in The New York Times Book Review. He said Mrs. Hart ''took on the herculean task of compiling Larry Hart's historic works a decade ago'' for her other book, ''Thou Swell, Thou Witty,'' which Mr. Short said was ''an admirable effort on its own, but, as it turns out, it was merely the tip of the iceberg.''         Mr. Short wrote that Mrs. Hart and Mr. Kimball, an expert on the musical theater, ''left no stone unturned in their search for every lyric ascribed to Hart,'' and ''what has been achieved here is something monumental.''         Mrs. Hart edited ''Thou Swell, Thou Witty'' (Da Capo, 1976) and wrote a memoir included in the book. One critic said that work was ''indispensable for anyone interested in Hart, which is to say anyone interested in Broadway musical comedy, and Mrs. Hart's words are honest, unpretentious and affecting.''         Her son, also named Lorenz, said Friday that ''Thou Swell, Thou Witty'' had played a critical role in the growth of the popularity of Rodgers and Hart songs that he said had taken place since then. The best-known Rodgers and Hart songs include ''The Lady Is a Tramp,'' ''Manhattan'' and ''Blue Moon.''         Mrs. Hart, the former Dorothy Lubow, was born in Brooklyn. She left school at 16 and became a dancer for a time. Then she spent years as a writer and columnist for show-business fan magazines. She married her husband in 1938. He died in 1971.         Besides her son, of Arlington, Va., she is survived by a granddaughter.       
         Hannah Komanoff, the first woman elected to the Board of Supervisors in Nassau County, N.Y., died on Sunday at a hospital in Long Beach, on Long Island. She was 89.         Mrs. Komanoff, a Democrat, was elected to the board from Long Beach, where she lived much of her life, in 1973, and served three terms from 1974 to 1985.         She opposed nuclear power development on Long Island and a proposed bridge across Long Island Sound from Oyster Bay to Rye. She was also a trustee and president of the Long Beach Board of Education from 1957 to 1973.         Mrs. Komanoff, who lived in Lido Beach, N.Y., for the last 11 years, was born in the Bronx on July 28, 1910, and graduated from New York University in 1931.         She moved to to Long Beach in the 1940's.         Her husband, Isidore Komanoff, died in 1985. She is survived by two daughters, Frederica Miceli of Manhattan and Ruth Underwood of Studio City, Calif.; a son, Charles Komanoff of Manhattan; a brother, Stanley Winters of Port Charlotte, Fla.; and five grandchildren.         Correction:  April 18, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary yesterday about Hannah Komanoff, the first woman elected to the Board of Supervisors in Nassau County, N.Y., misstated the date of her death. It was April 9, not last Sunday.       
         Alice Sheets Marriott, matriarch of the tight-knit family whose name stands on thousands of hotels worldwide, died on Monday in Washington. She was 92.         Beginning in 1927 with a single root beer stand, Mrs. Marriott and her husband, J. Willard Marriott Sr., built one of the world's leading hospitality companies. Today, Marriott International, which is still run by the Marriott family, has more than 140,000 workers and annual sales approaching $10 billion.         Along the way, Mrs. Marriott also raised a family that now numbers two children, eight grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren. She ''personified the American dream,'' Marriott International said in a statement.         Alice Sheets was born in Salt Lake City, on Oct. 19, 1907. In June 1927, while still a teenager, she graduated with honors from the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree in Spanish. Two days later, she married Mr. Marriott, another University of Utah graduate, and the couple set off in a Ford Model T to Washington, where Mr. Marriott had just opened a root beer stand. There she worked as the shop's bookkeeper, taking its hard-earned nickels to the bank each day.         As summer turned to fall, root beer sales slipped, leaving the Marriotts anxious to expand their menu. Mrs. Marriott spoke to the chef of the Mexican Embassy to learn the recipes for tamales and chili con carne. The Marriotts practiced the dishes in their apartment for two days, then added them to the menu at the stand, which they renamed The Hot Shoppe. The spicy dishes were a hit, and the Marriotts quickly opened more Hot Shoppes.         ''Almost from the start, my parents -- especially my father -- launched the process of figuring out how to do something right and then writing it down. From washing windows to burnishing silverware to arranging buffet tables and processing customers' checks, no aspect of the workplace went untouched,'' J. W. Marriott Jr., wrote in his 1997 memoir, ''The Spirit to Serve: Marriott's Way.''         A devotion to detail served the Marriotts well, as the chain thrived, eventually expanding to 65 sites. The Marriott family was also growing -- J. W. Jr. was born in 1932, and Richard followed in 1939.         Then, in 1957, the Marriotts moved into the hotel business, which was taking off in tandem with the interstate highways. Mrs. Marriott spent much of the night before the opening of the first Marriott hotel, the Twin Bridges Motor Hotel in Arlington, Va., helping hang pictures in each of its 365 rooms.         By offering travelers a consistent, dependable and safe night's rest, the Marriott chain quickly surpassed more established competitors. Today, many hotel operators consider Marriott the world's top hotel company, with a reputation for treating employees and customers fairly.         As Marriott grew, Mrs. Marriott spent more time on charity work in the Washington area, including serving two 10-year terms on the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. A conservative Republican, she was vice chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1965 to 1976, and honorary chairman of the 1973 Nixon inaugural committee.       
         Lila Kedrova, the Russian-born actress whose portrayals of an aging French prostitute in screen and stage versions of ''Zorba the Greek'' won her an Academy Award and a Tony, died on Feb. 16 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. She was believed to be around 82.         Her death was announced in The Sault Star on Feb. 17 but was not reported by news agencies.         Although she appeared in scores of films and plays in England, Canada and on the Continent that won her accolades ranging from a French Cesar for the film ''Razzia sur la Chnouf'' (1955), the Evening Standard Award in London for her stage role in ''The Cherry Orchard'' in 1969, a Genie Award (Canada's equivalent of the Oscar) for ''Eliza's Horoscope'' (1970) and a Golden Mask at Taormina in Sicily for the film ''Tell Me a Riddle'' (1980), Ms. Kedrova was best known her for portrayal of Madame Hortense in ''Zorba.''         In the film and Broadway musical adaptations of the 1946 Nikos Kazantzakis novel ''Zorba, the Greek,'' which starred Anthony Quinn, Miss Kedrova won raves as the earthy Zorba's aging, dying mistress.         ''The old woman of Lila Kedrova is brilliantly realized, a wrinkled and tacky relic of a once successful coquette, still hopeful, audacious and courageous,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in his review of the 1964 film in The New York Times.         When she recreated her role on Broadway in 1983, Frank Rich of The Times described Ms. Kedrova's Madame Hortense as ''a small, round, smeary-faced woman out of a Toulouse-Lautrec canvas'' who could bat ''her big, Betty Boop eyes with a schoolgirl's blushing flirtatiousness.''         He said: ''Miss Kedrova may indeed be of a certain age, but we see the young 'cabaret star' she claims to have once been; we also see that the old Hortense is remembering the young Hortense just as we do. No wonder Miss Kedrova shimmers, and no wonder our eyes mist over.''         The role that won Miss Kedrova her Oscar as best supporting actress and her Tony for best featured actress in a musical was first offered by the film's Greek director, Michael Cacoyannis, to Simone Signoret.         But, Miss Kedrova said, after two days on location in Crete, Miss Signoret withdrew, and Mr. Cacoyannis telephoned Ms. Kedrova in Paris to invite her to join his cast.         ''I accepted, but in fact my feelings were ambivalent,'' she told The Times of London some years ago. ''It was a fascinating role, but not perhaps for me. What had I in common with this vulgarian, this whore, 20 years older than myself? Then I thought I must try to understand her heart, enter completely into her mentality and find what is most real and sincere in myself. I found I could do this, but I was quite amazed, quite unprepared to win the Academy Award.''         There was one other problem, Miss Kedrova told Nora Ephron in a profile in The New York Post in 1965. When Mr. Cacoyannis called, he asked if Miss Kedrova spoke English.         ''He asked me the question in French,'' she said. ''And I replied, 'Oui.' It was the biggest lie in my life.''         But remembering the lyrics to a few American songs she had sung and expressions like ''How do you do?'' and ''Thank you,'' she got the part.         Miss Kedrova, who was born in Leningrad into the Kedroffs, a distinguished and well-to-do musical family, fled the aftermath of the Russian Revolution with them and became an emigree in Paris.         A restless child, she was a frequent truant and runaway. ''Once I joined the Gypsies; another time I took a job in a circus pulling a bear on a chain,'' she told The Times of London. ''When I was 12, I fell in love with the theater and knew then what I wanted to do. And though my parents had planned a musical career for me, they allowed me to join a troupe of Russian actors, resident in Paris, who played according to the Stanislavsky method. I was with them for three years.         ''In those days I acted with complete spontaneity, lived my parts almost instinctively, and it was some time before I realized that any talent, however bright, needs guarding and guiding.''         So she studied drama with the actor-director Pierre Valde, who became her first husband.         In the early 1950's she began to achieve critical and popular success onstage in France, where she starred in productions like ''The Rose Tattoo,'' ''A View From the Bridge,'' ''A Taste of Honey'' and ''The Brothers Karamazov.''         Her second husband, Richard Howard, a director whom she married in 1969, said that Miss Kedrova, who had no other immediate survivors, made her last stage appearance in the early 1990's at the Chichester Festival and her last film in 1993. The couple maintained homes in Toronto and Paris as well as Sault Ste. Marie.         Some reference books listed Miss Kedrova's year of birth as 1918, and Mr. Howard pointed out that other, later dates were to be found elsewhere. He said that when her family fled Russia, they left their papers behind. And the false papers they were given in France were confiscated by the Nazis.         ''She liked it that way,'' Mr. Howard said of her agelessness. ''I remember her telling me that it was wonderful because she could choose to be any age she wanted to be, and that she wanted to be 16.''       
         Micheline Glover, who as an 18-year-old girl worked for the French Resistance during World War II, delivering secret messages under the eyes of unwitting German soldiers, died April 15 in White Plains Hospital in White Plains, N.Y. She was 76.         Mrs. Glover, who was born in Paris, received a citation after the war from Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for one of her activities in the Resistance: rescuing Allied airmen shot down by the Nazis.         She recalled in a privately published memoir that she was first drawn to the Resistance -- the clandestine underground that sought to disrupt the German occupation of France -- when at age 16 she joined a student protest march in Paris. German troops fired on the students with machine guns, killing several.         Two years later, after Mrs. Glover had moved with her family to Montlucon, she discovered that her English tutor was in the Resistance, and she asked him whether she could do something ''to help our cause.''         Soon Mrs. Glover became a courier for Pierre Kaan, a philosophy professor who was a major figure in the Resistance. Professor Kaan, who was Jewish, was eventually captured and killed in a Nazi death camp.         Mrs. Glover's first assignments were riding trains throughout the country, carrying secret messages taped to her back. In this work, she seems to have had nerves of steel.         Once, the train in which she was riding came to a sudden halt. She and the other passengers were told to leave the train to have their identification papers checked. Mrs. Glover's papers were found to be unacceptable, and she was instructed to stand aside while other passengers were checked and questioned. She followed orders, but when the passengers with acceptable identification papers were told to return to the train, Mrs. Glover slipped away from her forgetful guard and quietly boarded the train as it pulled out of the station.         On one occasion, she recalled in her memoir, she sat in a cafe filled with German soldiers and passed messages to her contact, sipping a glass of wine.         Another time, in still another cafe filled with enemy soldiers, her contact whispered a desperate request to her to help him repair the package he was carrying. She did his bidding, but not without first discovering that the package contained a deflated rubber raft destined for some secret mission.         A more elaborate and perhaps even more dangerous mission involved photographing the damage sustained by a large tire factory that had been bombed by American aircraft.         She could not afford to be caught prowling a factory that produced strategic war materials, but in the rubble she came upon two American airmen who had been shot down in the attack. Somehow, she would have to spirit them out of the country. She procured a couple of bicycles for the airmen to ride by night, only to discover that neither knew how to ride a bicycle.         ''I was very glad we did not meet any German patrols on our way,'' she wrote.         One of the airmen was later killed; the other escaped.         Mrs. Glover finished the war as an interpreter and was awarded a medal of honor from the French government.         She met her husband, Garlan Glover, at a Red Cross dance in Paris. The couple married and moved to White Plains in 1955. Mrs. Glover then devoted herself to raising a family.         Micheline Blum-Picard was born in Paris, the daughter of a French government official. She attended school in Montlucon.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Glover is survived by a daughter, Christiane, of Ossining, N.Y.; four sons, Derek of Ridgefield, Conn., Brian of White Plains, Renny of Boulder, Colo., and Wayne of North White Plains; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Glover recalled that in her Resistance work, after she received word that Allied forces were about to land on the Normandy coast, she asked to take part in the fighting. Her superiors decided that she could not be allowed to serve as a combat soldier, but rather as a nurse.         Nevertheless, she got her way. Even as a nurse, she was permitted to carry a rifle, a pistol and a hand grenade. She recalled that she fired repeatedly once the landings began, but could not be certain whether she hit anyone.       
         Jean Head Sisco, a Washington-based executive and consultant and an energetic advocate of putting women on corporate boards, died on Thursday at her home in Chevy Chase, Md. She was 74.         The cause was a brain tumor, her management consulting firm, Sisco Associates, said.         Mrs. Sisco was named to the boards of 23 corporations during her three-decade career.         She was named Director of the Year last year by the National Association of Corporate Directors and in 1995 received the Breaking the Glass Ceiling award of the National Women's Economic Alliance Foundation.         She was a partner in Sisco Associates, which she founded in 1979. It specializes in international risk and trade analysis.         Her husband, Joseph J. Sisco, a former under secretary of state for political affairs and a former president of American University, joined the firm in 1981.         She was born in Muleshoe, Tex., and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Louisville and a master's degree in business administration from the University of Chicago. She worked for the Woodward & Lothrop retail chain for 24 years, until 1974, and rose to be its vice president for personnel and labor relations.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Dr. Carol Bolton Sisco of Riva, Md., and Jane Murdock Sisco of Bethesda, Md.       
         Margaret E. B. Jones, a retired Army major who served with the only battalion of African-American women to serve overseas in World War II, died on April 11 at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington. She was 89.         Mrs. Jones spent most of her adult life in military service and had lived in Alexandria, Va., since 1980, said her husband, Everett Jones, a retired Army major.         In 1945, Mrs. Jones, then Second Lieutenant Barnes, was one of 31 officers who accompanied more than 700 enlisted members of the Women's Army Corps' 6888th Battalion when they were sent to England. The battalion had been formed after civil rights organizations and black newspapers complained that the military was not using African-American women in meaningful jobs.         When the battalion arrived in Britain, members were told to sort through piles of mail that filled two hangars in the countryside, said Charity Adams Earley, who was the battalion's commanding officer.         Mrs. Earley said that white women serving in Europe were working as drivers for officers or doing other tasks equivalent to their male counterparts, and the women of the 6888th had hoped for the same kinds of duties.         ''They told us that if we were going overseas, we would be given assignments men had,'' she recalled from her home in Dayton, Ohio. ''That was a fairy tale.''         Instead, in the sealed orders they received, which they were not permitted to open until the planes carrying them to Britain were in the air, they learned they would be assigned to the postal unit. But soon, Mrs. Earley said, the women realized how vital their new job was to troop morale in wartime Europe.         The women moved three million pieces of mail in three months, much of it letters sent to soldiers who had been transferred, had died, or been scattered after the D-Day assault in France.         ''To move the mail with them was a really tough job,'' said Judith Bellafaire, curator of the Women in Military Service for America Memorial in Washington. ''They worked in 24-hour shifts and they cleared that mail out and were credited with raising the morale of the troops. They have a lot to be proud of.''         Mrs. Jones was in charge of public relations for the battalion, which broke records for the amount of mail it distributed.         Some of the mail, which had been sitting in storage for months, contained spoiled cakes and cookies, and there was even a package of steaks a mother had sent to her son overseas, Mrs. Earley recalled.         Margaret Ellen Barnes was born on Jan. 7, 1911, in Oberlin, Ohio. Her mother, Margaret Sallee Barnes, was active in community and civil rights groups, and her father, James D. Barnes, worked as a chef. Her mother's parents had been slaves in Kentucky, and she reared her children to value education and to stand up for their rights.         After three years at Howard University, where she later received a bachelor's degree, Margaret Barnes joined the military in 1943, a time when it was racially segregated and there were few places for women. She signed up for the same reasons many men did at that time, said her husband: ''She wanted to do something for her country.''         Mrs. Jones became one of the first African-American women commissioned as an officer in the Women's Army Corps. At the time, African-Americans were limited to 10 percent of the overall troops, said the Army Center of Military History. When 400 women were accepted as officer candidates for the WAC's, the 40 black women became known as the Ten Percenters.         Ordered to Fort Breckenridge, Kan., after her basic training, she became the executive officer of a company that consisted of 175 black women. Even though many of the women had college educations, they were assigned to cleaning floors and latrines in the hospital and working in the post laundry.         Mrs. Jones complained to a superior officer, and persuaded him to reassign them to other duties, according to a book about the 6888th Battalion, ''To Serve My Country, To Serve My Race,'' (New York University Press, 1996) by Brenda L. Moore.         After the war, Major Barnes returned to Howard to complete her degree. She then did graduate work in American history at the University of Minnesota.         She was recalled to active duty in 1949, and placed in command of a training company at Fort Lee, Va. After her marriage in 1953, her husband was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and she to Fort Belvoir, Va. Later they were both sent, separately, to France, and then she was assigned as a special services officer in Kansas. She retired as chief of administration at Maison Fort in France and later accompanied her husband to a post in Germany.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Ulla Isaksson, who wrote screenplays for two Ingmar Bergman films and novels about women's issues, died on April 20 in Stockholm after a long illness. She was 83.         In 1958 Mr. Bergman directed ''Brink of Life,'' which Ms. Isaksson (pronounced EE-sack-sohn) adapted  from one of her short stories. Two years later they collaborated again on ''The Virgin Spring,'' which was inspired by a 13th-century ballad about a deeply religious farming family whose young daughter is raped and murdered. The film, which starred Max von Sydow, Gunnel Lindblom and Brigitta Pettersson, received an Academy Award as best foreign film in 1960.         ''Brink of Life,'' which starred Eva Dahlbeck, Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Andersson, Erland Josephson and Mr. von Sydow, is set in a maternity ward and chronicles the psychological and physical traumas of several women during childbirth.         ''It is to the credit of the director and the scenarist that the drama, like life itself, does not come up with neatly contrived answers to all the problems posed,'' wrote A. H. Weiler in The New York Times when the film was introduced to American audiences in 1959. The film received acting and directing awards at the Cannes International Film Festival.         Ms. Isaksson's novels include ''The Tree,'' ''Paradise Square,'' ''The Birthday'' and ''The Women's House.''         ''She was not an aesthetic writer,'' said Per Westberg, a member of the Swedish Academy who had known Ms. Isaksson for 45 years. ''She pondered great problems -- between good and evil, between men and women. She was a true moralist.''         With her husband, Erik Hjalmar Linder, a critic, author and literary historian, Ms. Isaksson wrote what is widely considered to be the definitive biography of Elin Wagner, one of Sweden's earliest and foremost feminist novelists, who died in 1949.         When Mr. Linder was stricken with Alzheimer's disease, Ms. Isaksson wrote ''The Book About E,'' a memoir about caring for him. Her husband died in 1994.         Ulla Margareta Lundberg was born on June 12, 1916, in Stockholm.  According to Mr. Westberg, she grew up in a very religious household.         ''Her early writing is trying to break loose from it but still keep some of the moral vigor,'' he said. ''That early work is about women who are trying to emancipate themselves. Today it sounds very banal, because so many books have been written on that subject. But she was a role model for the next generation of women writers.''         Ms. Isaksson is survived by two sons from a previous marriage, Hans Isaksson and Gunnar Isaksson; a sister, Kerstin M. Lundberg; and five grandchildren, all of Stockholm.       
         Betsy Dworkin, a former senior lecturer in social policy and administration at the University of London's Chelsea and University colleges, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich Village. She would have been 67 today.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Ronald Dworkin.         Mrs. Dworkin was born in Manhattan to Walter and Adelaide Ross.         She received a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in 1955 from Radcliffe College, where she studied American history and literature, and she was a Fulbright Scholar in Paris. She received a master's degree in the history of fine arts in 1957 from Harvard.         She went on to be a writer on the staff of the Metropolitan Museum, an associate editor of Art News and managing editor of a sister publication, the quarterly Portfolio. In 1962, she moved to New Haven, where she helped run a poverty program in the public school system.         In 1969, she moved to Britain, where in 1972 she received a second master's degree, this one in social policy, from the London School of Economics. From 1972 to 1989 she taught at Chelsea and University colleges.         In addition to her husband, Professor Ronald Dworkin, who teaches at New York University and at the University of London's University College, she is survived by a son, Anthony of London; and a daughter, Jennifer Dworkin of Manhattan.       
         Evelyn Swarthout Hayes, a former concert pianist, educator and arts patron, died on March 24 at George Washington University Hospital. She was 87 and lived in Washington.         Mrs. Hayes, who was born Evelyn Swarthout in Jacksonville, Ill., began her music career in the 1930's, appearing several times in recitals at Town Hall in New York. In 1939 she married Patrick Hayes, a music administrator. The couple moved to Washington when he was appointed manager of the National Symphony Orchestra.         Mrs. Hayes joined the piano faculty at American University in 1951 and taught there until retiring in 1976. She also continued to perform, giving recitals at the National Gallery and elsewhere, and she created ''Music in Schools,'' an educational radio program for young listeners.         She served as a judge in many piano competitions as well as giving lectures and master classes around the country.         Her husband, who founded the Hayes Concert Bureau -- later renamed the Washington Performing Arts Society -- died in 1998. She is survived by a son, Bryant, of New York; a daughter, Elisabeth Hayes of Chicago; a grandchild; two step-grandchildren and two step-great-grandchildren.       
         Margo Kaufman, a humorist, writer and radio commentator with a keen instinct for the comedic possibilities in the mundane, died on Friday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 46.         The cause was breast cancer, her husband, Eric Mankin, said.         In her writings for such publications as The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and Cosmopolitan magazine, Ms. Kaufman established her gift for homing in on the hilarity -- and sometimes pathos -- in everyday life. She regaled readers with accounts of traveling with her family, tedious home renovations and her beloved pug dogs or, after her cancer was diagnosed in 1989, with details of her illness and its often painful treatment.         Piping and sardonic, her distinctive voice was familiar to radio listeners in Los Angeles, where she was a regular commentator on KABC, and nationally, with frequent appearances on National Public Radio's ''Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me.''         She eventually elaborated upon the essays in three books, ''1-800-Am-I-Nuts?,'' ''This Damn House!: My Subcontract with America'' and ''Clara, the Early Years: The Story of the Pug Who Ruled My Life.''         A graduate of Northwestern University, Ms. Kaufman began her career as a columnist for City Paper, an alternative weekly in her native Baltimore, and continued writing after she moved to Los Angeles, first at the LA Weekly and then for national publications.         An aficionado of pug dogs, which she regarded as ''living proof that God has a sense of humor,'' Ms. Kaufman proudly carried a business card identifying herself as a Hollywood correspondent for Pug Talk magazine.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her son, Nicholas; her father, Allan Pearlstein of Boca Raton, Fla.; her mother, Gloria Asnes of New York; a sister, Laurie Goldberg of Atlanta; a brother, Robert Pearlstein of Baltimore; and a grandmother, Flora Pearlstein of Baltimore.         ''You just can't get through life without a sense of humor these days,'' Ms. Kaufman told an audience in 1993, a year after learning that her cancer had spread. ''The most awful things can be really funny. You have to be able to laugh or it gets too depressing.''       
         Dr. Ruth Erica Benesch, a biochemist and educator who teamed with her husband at Columbia University to advance the knowledge of how the body's red blood cells function, died on March 25 at her home in the Bronx. She was 75.         The cause was vascular disease, her family said.         She and her husband, Dr. Reinhold Benesch, shared a laboratory at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and studied the mechanisms by which hemoglobin transports oxygen to living tissues. In 1966, they discovered that one particular phosphorous compound, called 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, had an important role in loosening the bonds between hemoglobin and oxygen.         Max F. Perutz, the British biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1962, wrote that the discovery by the Benesches in 1966 ''opened a new era'' of knowledge about the respiratory system. Their work, he said, generated a ''flood of papers'' from scientists around the world and made Mrs. Benesch one of the most-cited women in science in the 1970's.         The couple were professors of biochemistry at Columbia. He died in 1987; she became an emeritus professor of biochemistry in 1995.         Born Ruth Erica Baade in Paris, she was raised in Berlin. In 1939, she  escaped a few months before the war in Europe, taken out by the a Kindertransport program, which rescued Jewish children from Germany. She graduated in 1946 from the University of London, came to the United States the following year and received a Ph.D. in biochemistry at Northwestern University in 1951.         She was affiliated with Johns Hopkins University, the State University of Iowa and the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Mass., before she joined the staff at Columbia as a research associate in 1960. She was named an associate professor in 1972 and a full professor in 1980.         Dr. Benesch is survived by a son, Andrew, of Highland Park, N.J.; a daughter, Susan, of Milford, Conn.; a sister, Madeleine, of London; and two granddaughters.         Correction:  April 15, 2000, Saturday  An obituary on April 4 about Dr. Ruth Erica Benesch, a Columbia University biochemist, misstated her maiden name and the year of the death of her husband and collaborator, Dr. Reinhold Benesch. Her maiden name was Leroi, not Baade. Her husband died in 1986, not 1987.       
         Claire Trevor, an Academy Award-winning actress who epitomized cynical but warm-hearted careerists -- reporters, gun molls, saloon entertainers and trollops -- died Saturday at a hospital near her home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 91 and had suffered from respiratory ailments in recent months, said Richard Elbaum, a spokesman for the family.         A Brooklyn native who became enamored of stage acting and found her way into the movies during Hollywood's golden age, Miss Trevor appeared in nearly 70 films, working under legendary directors like John Huston and John Ford and playing alongside such famous leading men as John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart.         She played the former girlfriend of a gangster (Humphrey Bogart) who becomes a burned-out streetwalker in ''Dead End'' (1937) and a freewheeling woman forced out of town by bluenoses in the classic version of ''Stagecoach'' (1939). She was the alcoholic mistress of a mobster played by Edward G. Robinson in ''Key Largo'' (1948) and a spunky jet passenger in ''The High and the Mighty'' (1954).         She may be best remembered for ''Key Largo,'' for which she won the Oscar for best supporting actress playing the part of Gaye Dawn, a has-been cabaret singer who, in one emotionally charged scene, is forced by her sadistic lover to sing ''Moanin' Low'' in return for a drink. Feebly, she manages to sob through the song, but Mr. Robinson's character denies her because, he says, her singing was ''rotten.''         Miss Trevor also received Academy Award nominations for ''The High and the Mighty'' and ''Dead End.''         The blond, smoky-voiced Miss Trevor was a dedicated performer who repeatedly breathed fresh life into her films, many of which sorely needed her grace and gumption. Early on she became a ''queen of the B's,'' the low-budget action movies that rounded off double bills. But she got plenty of ''A'' roles, making the most of them.         In other key roles, she was a faithless lover in ''The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse'' (1938), a conspiratorial killer in ''Murder, My Sweet'' (1945), a vitriolic Broadway actress in ''The Velvet Touch'' (1948), an overprotective mother in ''Marjorie Morningstar'' (1958) and a scornful shrew in two melodramas, ''Two Weeks in Another Town'' (1962) and ''How to Murder Your Wife'' (1965).         The modest Miss Trevor was one of the few actresses whose seemingly effortless talent made most viewers take her for granted, while film buffs cherished her. Looking back, she concluded that she never became a top star because she lacked the drive that energizes them. ''I didn't know,'' she said, ''that to make a real career in Hollywood you have to become a 'personality,' have to cultivate publicity departments and become known as 'The Ear' or even 'The Toe.' ''         On television, she won an Emmy award in an acclaimed 1956 revival of ''Dodsworth,'' with Fredric March in the title role. She artfully portrayed his vain wife, who consorts with shallow lovers in a futile battle against age. Miss Trevor said she enjoyed working for television because it provided her with a wider, more sympathetic range of roles. But she said she never wanted to sacrifice personal happiness for her career. ''As for a TV series, never,'' she said, ''Life's too short and, frankly, I'm not terribly ambitious.''         Claire Trevor was born Claire Wemlinger on March 8, 1909, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, the only child of Noel and Betty Wemlinger. (Mr. Elbaum said Miss Trevor's stepson, Donald Bren, said she was born in 1910; many reference works list her birth in 1909.) Her father was a Fifth Avenue merchant tailor who soon moved the family to Larchmont in Westchester County. After her graduation from high school, Miss Trevor took art courses for six months at Columbia University before studying for six more months at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She began honing her craft in repertory theater in Michigan, St. Louis and Long Island and through shorts filmed in Brooklyn.         These appearances led to starring roles in two Broadway plays, ''Whistling in the Dark,'' a hit, and ''The Party's Over,'' a flop. The Fox movie company had noticed her, however, and offered a five-year contract. Although she wanted to stay in the theater, she had no immediate stage prospects and accepted Fox's offer, arriving in Hollywood in 1933.         She then made 14 Fox quickies over four years. Most were action-adventure pictures dominated by the leading men, but she won wide praise for playing several hard-bitten newspaper reporters. ''I worked like a demon, and I knew it was a job,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1995. ''Saturday night, you never could plan on going out to dinner because we'd break for dinner for one hour and work till 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the morning.''         Spencer Tracy was the early co-star she admired most, and she said she quickly began imitating ''the clever way he throws away a line.'' Another favorite leading man was Mr. Robinson, with whom she appeared in ''Big Town,'' a popular radio series, from 1937 to 1940. He played Steve Wilson, editor of the mythical Illustrated Press, and she was Lorelei Kilbourne, his ace reporter and foil.         Her longtime wish to return to Broadway materialized in 1947, when she and Philip Dorn co-starred in a comedy, ''The Big Two.'' The consensus of critics was that they gave the play much more artistry and vitality than it deserved. It closed after 21 performances.         Her private life was far different from the lives of the sassy characters she played. She was married to Clark Andrews, director of her radio show, from 1938 to 1942, when they divorced. In 1943 she married Cylos Dunsmoore, a Navy lieutenant. The marriage produced a son, Charles, but ended in divorce in 1947.         Her third marriage, to Milton Bren, a film producer, lasted from 1948 until his death in 1979 of a brain tumor. Mr. Bren had two sons from a previous marriage, later prompting Miss Trevor to recall fondly that they had ''an instant family.'' In 1978 Miss Trevor lost her son, Charles, in an airliner disaster.         The losses of her son and husband in the span of a year left her devastated, and she moved to New York, settling into a Fifth Avenue apartment and embarking on a busy social schedule. She also occasionally returned to acting, in her last role playing an aging schoolteacher in the 1987 television movie ''Norman Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties.''         Miss Trevor would later return to California, where she was also known as a generous philanthropist.         She is survived by her stepsons, Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Company, a real estate investment firm in Newport Beach, and Peter Bren, president of Koll-Bren-Schreiber, a real estate investment firm in New York.       
         Janet C. Carter, a champion of African and African-American fine arts, died on Tuesday in Manhattan.         The cause of her death was heart failure, said her husband, Ron Carter, the jazz bassist. He declined to disclose her age.         Mrs. Carter had a role in the formative stages of the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Children's Art Carnival, an arts education organization in Harlem. She owned a gallery on the Upper West Side that specialized in works by Africans and African-Americans.         She was an early member of the Studio Museum's board and remained a member until her death, said Edward S. Spriggs, who became the museum's first permanent director in 1970, two years after it opened. ''She was particularly active in community outreach,'' he said.         Janet Hasbrouck Carter was born in Syracuse, the daughter of a mechanic and a housewife. She attended Syracuse University, Howard University and Virginia Union University and graduated from City College of New York with a bachelor's degree in English and a master's degree in black literature.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Ron Jr., of Roxbury, Mass., and Myles, of Chelsea, Mass.; two sisters, Delores Clemons of Norfolk, Va., and Diane Cohen of Washington; two brothers, Homer Hasbrouck of New York and Merritt Hasbrouck of Chicago; and a grandson.       
         Vicki Sue Robinson, the vivacious pop-gospel singer whose 1976 hit ''Turn the Beat Around'' became a signature anthem of the disco era, died on Thursday at her home in Wilton, Conn. She was 46.         The cause was cancer, said Gina Andriolo, her publicist.         A prolific jingle singer whose 1999 Off Broadway show, ''Vicki Sue Robinson: Behind the Beat,'' had a successful limited engagement at the Kaufman Theater, Ms. Robinson was a powerful, exuberant belter whose dance-oriented records were among the best sung and least gimmicky disco records of late 70's.         In her autobiographical show, a gaudy theatrical extension of her popular, long-running cabaret act, she showed her range as an all-around entertainer. As both a singer and songwriter, Ms. Robinson, who described herself as a latchkey child with a bohemian upbringing, exemplified the New York musical melting pot in the late 1960's and 70's with its colliding echoes of pop, rock, gospel and Broadway.         Ms. Robinson was born in Harlem to a black actor and a white radical  folk singer. She made her singing debut at the Philadelphia Folk Festival when she was 6. Her early influences were folk and blues legends like Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie and Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, all friends of her mother. But she was also influenced by jazz singers like Dinah Washington and Sarah Vaughan, and later by Laura Nyro. While still a teenager, she appeared on Broadway in the musicals ''Hair'' and ''Jesus Christ Superstar.''         She is survived by her husband, Bill Good, and her mother, Marian Robinson.         Signed by RCA Records in the mid-1970's, she made four albums and  was nominated for a Grammy for best pop female vocalist. More recently, a single, ''House of Joy,'' became a major dance hit in Britain.         Her show ''Behind the Beat'' was an uninhibited, sometimes campy cabaret extravaganza that blended pop-soul oldies, personal confessions, inspirational ballads and audience singalongs, and included versions of some of her best-known jingles pitching everything from fabric softener to the New York Telephone Company  (''We're all connected'').       
         Verna Aardema Vugteveen, a late-blooming, prolific writer who regaled generations of American children with the folklore of faraway Africa, died on Thursday at a nursing home in Fort Myers, Fla. She was 88.         Verna Aardema, the name on her books (of Dutch origin and pronounced AR-duh-ma), taught elementary school in Michigan from 1934 to 1973. She also contributed articles to The Muskegon Chronicle in Michigan and taught Sunday school as she developed into a full-time author and folklorist, retelling the lore of Mexico and, particularly, Africa for children ages 4 to 8.         She chose Africa when she realized that the continent, its people and their traditions remained terra incognita to American children. Her books became popular because they carried a natural storyteller's rhythm that lent itself to being read aloud by parents, and they were attractively illustrated and appealing to listeners of all ages.         Ms. Aardema had 33 books published, the first, ''Tales From the Story Hat,'' in 1960, and the latest, ''Koi and the Kola Nuts: A Tale From Liberia,'' last year. Her New York agent, Marilyn Marlowe, said that Ms. Aardema had several more  completed when she died.         Among her best-known books were ''Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears: A West African Tale'' (1975), and ''Bringing the Rain to Kapiti Plain'' (1981), which James Earl Jones read to inaugurate the PBS weekly program ''Reading Rainbow'' in 1982. Another favorite, ''Who's in Rabbit's House?'' (1977), retold a Masai tale in which a rabbit marshals his animal friends to remove a monster that has taken up residence in his home.         She was born Verna Norberg in New Era, Mich., and graduated from what is now Michigan State University in 1935. After she gave up teaching  to devote more time to writing, she maintained a presence in the schools as a guest story reader and lectured at colleges to help aspiring writers.         Locally, many knew her as the Story Lady. A stroke in 1992 left her in a wheelchair.         Her first husband, Albert Aardema, died in 1974. Her second husband, Joel Vugteveen, also died. She is survived by a son, Dr. Austin Aardema of Fort Myers; a daughter, Paula Dufford of Valrico, Fla.; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.       
         Louise Tanner, a writer whose work often mirrored her Social Register upbringing, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.         The widow of Edward Everett Tanner 3rd, who, as Patrick Dennis, wrote ''Auntie Mame,'' Ms. Tanner was herself the author of five books, including the novel ''Miss Bannister's Girls,'' inspired by her experiences as a student at Miss Chapin's, a New York finishing school.         Born Louise Frith Stickney, Ms. Tanner grew up in what she called ''Edwardian opulence'' on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She demonstrated her writing talent at an early age by winning Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris. After graduating from Vassar in 1944 she met Mr. Tanner; they were married four years later, preventing her, she once remarked, from having ''wound up a very embittered ex-debutante.''         Her wry, wisecracking persona made her the perfect counterpart to her husband, who based one of the main characters in his 1962 best seller, ''Genius,'' on his wife. He also cast her in the role of Pixie Portnoy in his 1961 novel, ''Little Me,'' which was made into a Broadway musical.         In addition to two social histories  ''Here Today'' (1959) and ''All the Things We Were'' (1968), Ms. Tanner wrote two novels for young adults, ''Reggie and Nilma'' and ''Dr. IRT.''  She is survived by a son, Michael; a daughter, Betsy; and a grandchild, all of New York.       
         Margaret Connors Driscoll, the first woman to be chief judge of the Connecticut Juvenile Court, died on Tuesday at the Carolton Chronic and Convalescent Hospital in Fairfield, Conn. She was 85 and lived in Bridgeport, Conn.         Judge Driscoll was named to the juvenile court in 1960 and was chief judge there from 1976 to 1978. An opponent of mandatory sentences and long confinement for juveniles, she was president of the National Council of Juvenile Court Judges in 1976 and 1977.         From 1978 until she retired in 1985, she was a judge on the Connecticut Superior Court.         In 1944, she was the Democratic candidate for Congress from Fairfield County. She was beaten by the Republican incumbent, Clare Boothe Luce.         She was born and reared in Bridgeport and graduated in 1935 from Wellesley College. She received her law degree in 1938 from Yale Law School, one of five women in the class.         Her husband of 48 years, John J. Driscoll, who was president of the Connecticut State Labor Council for 24 years, died in 1994.         She is survived by a son, David, of Chevy Chase, Md.; a sister, Jerri Reilly of Fairfield; and a grandson.       
         Edele Nielsen Holtz, who helped create the Clark Center for the Performing Arts in Manhattan and played an important role in Alvin Ailey's early career, died on May 20 at the Asheville Health Care Facility in Swannanoa, N.C. She was 82 and lived in Swannanoa.         Ms. Holtz and her husband, Alwin, who died last year, became friends with Ailey in the early 1960's when a colleague of the young choreographer approached Ms. Holtz about rehearsal space at a new branch of the Young Women's Christian Association on Eighth Avenue and 53rd Street in Manhattan, where she was director of activities.         Ms. Holtz, a peppery, no-nonsense social worker, agreed and eventually set up programs to benefit dancers, musicians and actors working in the theater district. Many of the programs, including a series of workshop performances for new choreographers, were suggested by Ailey. The performances were presented at Clark Center, a theater carved out of space that had been a hotel ballroom. The series provided crucial exposure for young choreographers who came of age artistically in the 1960's, 70's and 80's.         Ms. Holtz and her husband came to New York after working in refugee and education programs in the Middle East for 10 years, beginning in 1948 as field staff members of the United Nations-Quaker Project for Palestinian Refugees in Gaza. The experience served them well in helping Ailey as much-needed surrogate parents and de facto booking agents and accountants in the tumultuous early days of Ailey's company.         During her long career with the Y.W.C.A., Ms. Holtz was also the executive director of branches in Brooklyn and New Orleans and was a staff member of the group's national board.         Ms. Holtz is survived by two sisters, Greta Rikard of Salem, Va., and Inga Hoffman of Santa Cruz, Calif.       
         Penelope Fitzgerald, who began a prize-winning literary career late in life with a series of understated novels written in lilting prose, died on Friday in Highgate, London. She was 83 and lived in London.         Ms. Fitzgerald was the author of the 1995 novel ''The Blue Flower'' about the German poet Novalis and his hapless love for a 12-year-old girl. The book won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1998, defeating works by authors Philip Roth and Don DeLillo.         The writer A. S. Byatt once called Ms. Fitzgerald ''Jane Austen's nearest heir, for precision and invention.'' Ms. Fitzgerald published her first novel, a mystery, ''The Golden Child,'' in 1977, when she was 60. The book was written to entertain her dying husband, Desmond Fitzgerald. But despite her late start, Ms. Fitzgerald wrote 13 books, including biographies. They were leavened with a forgiving humor and gentle flashes of illumination. She won England's  Booker Prize for ''Offshore'' in 1979.         Her books were short, usually around 200 pages, and comprised of brief, pointed scenes. For her early books, she drew on her own life. There was her experience working in a bookshop and living in an abandoned warehouse in Suffolk, recounted in ''The Bookshop'' in 1978. That novel was short-listed for the Booker Prize. Then came her story of trying to survive as a young mother on a houseboat on the Thames in ''Offshore.'' In ''Human Voices'' (1980) she used material from her job at the BBC during World War II. ''At Freddie's,'' 1982, was based on her job teaching child actors.         Ms. Fitzgerald's characters were people fallen into difficult circumstances, struggling to cope. She once called them ''exterminatees,'' which she defined as ''likely to be stamped out with other things unlikely to succeed.'' Yet there was a deep sympathy, an underlying moral vision in her work. She did not write religious books, but she once described herself as religious.         Everything in Ms. Fitzgerald's background ordained her for an intellectual career, and yet for much of her adult life she was beleaguered, coping with a husband who drank and had difficulty keeping a job, and raising three children. She was born in 1916. Both her grandfathers were Anglican bishops. Her father, Edmund Valpy Knox, was the editor of Punch. One uncle, Ronald, was a Catholic convert, a Monsignor and a  spokesman for the church. Another uncle, Dillwyn, was a Greek scholar and cryptographer who helped break German codes in World War I and II. A third uncle, Wilfred, became an Anglo-Catholic priest. It was a deeply competitive family, with Ms. Fitzgerald, her brother, Rawle, who became a foreign correspondent, and their uncles vying at the dinner table at literary games. She later wrote a biography of her father and his brothers, ''The Knox Brothers,'' published in 1977. Ms. Fitzgerald's mother, Christina, was one of the first female students at Somerville College, Oxford. Penelope was sent to boarding school at the age of 7, an experience that devastated her.  Then, when she was 18 and about to go to Somerville herself, her mother died.         At Somerville, she studied with J. R. R. Tolkien and graduated with honors in 1938. She married Desmond Fitzgerald, a major in the Irish Guards. He had been trained as a barrister, but became a travel agent.  Ms. Fitzgerald once told an interviewer that her husband ''didn't have much luck in life.'' She supplemented the family income by working at various jobs, including in the Ministry of Food. With her husband, she was editor of ''The World Review,'' a small literary journal. The family moved often and ended up living on a dilapidated houseboat in London. In 1963 it sank for the second time. ''A lot of people would have gone down, too,'' Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria told a writer for The New York Times magazine last year. ''My dad was drinking a lot then.  Somehow, my mum pulled herself together.'' The family moved to public housing and Ms. Fitzgerald became its main breadwinner. She is survived by Maria, of London; another daughter, Christina Dooley, of Cornwall; a son, Valpy Fitzgerald of Oxford, and nine grandchildren.         Ms. Fitzgerald published her first book, a biography of the Victorian artist Edward Burne-Jones, in 1975. Yet despite the difficulties of her life as a young married woman, she refused to blame the delay in her writing career on her obligations as a wife and mother. ''In all that time, I could have written books and I didn't,'' she told The Times Magazine. ''I think you can write at any time of  your life.'' She was also reticent about her marriage.         Indeed, there was a delicate, elusive quality about Ms. Fitzgerald.  She had an apologetic, modest manner that concealed an underlying strength. ''She's prepared to play the scatty old lady,'' A. S. Byatt told the Times. ''But there's a steely intelligence under that gentle scattiness.''         In her later works, Ms. Fitzgerald departed somewhat from the autobiographical mode of her earlier fiction. She wrote ''The Beginning of Spring'' (1988), set in pre-Revolutionary Russia. ''The Gate of Angels,'' was about Cambridge in 1912 and based loosely on her uncles' lives. She loved the research involved in historical fiction, she said, but found writing incurably painful.  ''I hate writing, ,'' she told Publisher's Weekly. ''You just welcome any interruption that comes.''         Her editor at HarperCollins in London, Stuart Proffitt, compared her recent books to Beethoven in his ''late period,'' he said, '''where everything is getting pared down but the content is more concentrated.''         Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria said that she worked until the week she died. Her final book, ''The Means of Escape,'' a story collection, is to be published next fall by Counterpoint.         ''I have remained true to my deepest convictions,'' Ms. Fitzgerald said in 1998. ''I mean to the courage of those who are born to be defeated, the weaknesses of the strong, and the tragedy of misunderstandings and missed opportunities, which I have done my best to treat as comedy, for otherwise how can we manage to bear it?''         Correction:  May 8, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the British novelist Penelope Fitzgerald on Wednesday misidentified the publisher of ''The Means of Escape,'' her story collection due this fall. It is Houghton Mifflin, not Counterpoint.       
         Helen Beardsley, a mother of 20 who recounted the story of her unusual family in a book that was later made into a popular movie, died  April 26 at a hospital in Healdsburg, Calif. She was 70 and lived in Santa Rosa, Calif.         The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, her family said.         In 1968, Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda starred in the film ''Yours, Mine and Ours,'' based on Mrs. Beardsley's 1964 book, ''Who Gets the Drumstick?'' (Random House), which recounted the logistical problems of raising 20 children in a modern middle-class American family.         Mrs. Beardsley's first husband, Lt. Richard Dale North, a Navy pilot, died in a fighter-jet crash in 1960, when she was six months pregnant with their eighth child. The next year, she married another naval officer, Chief Warrant Officer Francis L. Beardsley, whose wife had recently died of diabetes, leaving him with their 10 children. The 18 children ranged in age from 6 months to 15 years. By 1964, the Beardsleys had two additional children of their own.         ''I was the oldest of the North boys,'' said Nicholas North, who became a middle child. ''I had lost a father, but all of a sudden I had older brothers.''         Teresa Wyble, the youngest of the North children, said that when the families joined, it was as if she had gained a twin. ''There is only six months between my sister Joan and I, and there are several of us like that,'' Mrs. Wyble said. She said the household had at least one birthday in every month but May.         When the Beardleys were first married, they lived in a two-story, four-bedroom house in Carmel, Calif. Later, using proceeds from the book and movie, they added a floor, five bedrooms and five bathrooms.         A bread company used the children in its commercials in the 1960's and delivered 50 loaves to the Beardsleys every two weeks. The Navy commissary listed the family as a restaurant so that the Beardsleys could buy food at wholesale prices.         Helen Eileen Brandmeir was born April 5, 1930, in Seattle. She studied nursing at Seattle University. She was named Mother of the Year by the National Campfire Girls in 1963 and was a member of the California Advisory Commission on the Status of Women.         When Mr. Beardsley retired from the Navy in 1968, the couple opened three bakeries in Monterey, Calif. In 1973, Mrs. Beardsley went to work for the Carmel Community Hospital. She later worked as a cardiovascular technologist at a hospital in Fresno, Calif. The couple retired to Santa Rosa in 1986.         Mrs. Beardsley is survived by her husband; 20 children; 44 grandchildren; and 2 great-grandchildren.         Explaining once how she had managed to keep the house running smoothly, Mrs. Beardsley said, ''I think the military background helped.''       
         Dr. Harriet Lange Rheingold, a child psychologist and research professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina, died on April 29 at a retirement center in Chapel Hill, N.C. She was 92.         Dr. Rheingold did not begin her specialized research until she was 45, after 20 years of patient care and undergraduate teaching. She made a name for herself nationally in the next 20 years with her work in developmental psychology.         She focused on the social and exploratory skills of infants and young children. Her interests ranged from infant sociability and responsiveness to independent behavior and the development of valued traits like sharing, helping and caring.         Her teaching and writings helped to change the way psychologists view normal infant behavior by helping to shape the recognition that infants interact with their environment from birth. Her books included ''The Infant Separates Himself From Her Mother,'' published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1970.         A native New Yorker, she graduated from Cornell University in 1928 with a degree in philosophy and earned a master's in psychology at Columbia University in 1930. She then was a research fellow, psychologist and assistant professor at Rockford College in Illinois.         In 1955 she received a Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Chicago. She was a research psychologist at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., before joining the North Carolina faculty as a research professor in 1964.         In 1985 she organized a symposium, ''Toward a Unified Science of Behavioral Development,'' for the Society for Research in Child Development. The same year she also addressed the 18th World Congress on Early Childhood Education in Jerusalem.         Dr. Rheingold is survived by her husband, Dr. Don W. Hayne; two sons, Paul D. Rheingold of Rye, N.Y., and Dr. Arnold L. Rheingold of Wilmington, Del.; six grandchildren, and two great-grandsons. Her first husband, Dr. Joseph D. Rheingold, a psychiatrist, died in 1978.       
         Elizabeth Wilcox, who took more than 100,000 sensitive photographs chronicling 35 years of medical care at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and then gave them to the center, died on May 6 at a retirement community in North Branford, Conn. She was 84 and had lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and in Redding, Conn.         The cause was a stroke, said her son Herbert B. Wilcox III.         Mrs. Wilcox, known as Libby, was a professional photographer known  for her medical photographs, but her work at the hospital, in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, was done as a volunteer; her husband, Dr. Herbert B. Wilcox Jr., was long affiliated with the center. She also worked as a freelance photographer for national magazines like Time and Newsweek.         ''I take pictures like a writer writes,'' she once said. ''Each negative is a note in the manuscript. After all, what photography is, is to write with light.''         In 1991 she and her husband, a  retired associate professor of medicine at Columbia University's medical school, gave the center her collection of more than 100,000 photographic images, almost all taken at the center.         The collection also includes negatives, prints and pages from publications in which her photographs appeared with articles and sometimes in advertisements, particularly medical advertisements. The collection, which is named for her, is housed in the Augustus C. Long Library at the medical center and is not on display to the public.         ''The collection chronicles the history of this medical center and looks in depth at every aspect of medical and nursing education and the delivery of health care,'' said Dr. Pat Moholt, associate dean for scholarly resources in Columbia University's health sciences division, which includes the medical center.         She said Mrs. Wilcox ''was a very perceptive photographer and, through photography, drew out the essence of a situation or of a person.''  She added, ''Through her photographs you could grasp a whole story.''         Mrs. Wilcox began her work at the center in 1957 with a day-to-day visual chronicle of clinical research relating to childhood nephrosis, a kidney disease.         In 1962, she photographed former President Herbert Hoover as a patient there. After receiving pictures she had taken of him, he wrote her: ''They are on the flattering side. But I can stand some of that.''         In the same year she went to Liberia with students from the medical school who spent two months at a leprosarium there.         During the 1965 blackout, she rushed to the medical center and spent the long night taking pictures. Those who see her blackout photographs understand ''the complexity of the situation and the urgency of what these committed people were trying to accomplish,'' Dr. Moholt said.         A picture she took at the medical center during the blackout is now on display at the Museum of the City of New York.         After Peggy Jo Kienast gave birth to quintuplets in 1970, Mrs. Wilcox was the only photographer permitted to take official pictures of them at the medical center.         She achieved early mastery of the computer as a tool to help her index the collection given to the medical center.         A native of Baltimore, she was the daughter of Dr. Gordon Wilson, a physician, and Elizabeth Elliott Wilson, and she attended Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore.         Her husband, whom she married in 1937, died in 1997.         Besides her son Herbert, of North Hero, Vt., she is survived by two other sons, Gordon W. of Seattle and Thomas E. of Concord, Mass.; and five grandchildren.       
         Priscilla Rudin Stern, who took pride in being the daughter, wife and mother of rabbis, died yesterday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 65 and lived in Great Barrington, Mass. The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Rabbi Jack Stern, the former leader of the Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale.         She was a graduate of Wellesley College and a founder of the Spouse Support Network of the Central Conference of American Rabbis. Several of her poems appeared in Jewish women's publications.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, Jonathan Stern of Washington, D.C., and Rabbi David Stern of Dallas, whose wife, Nancy Kasten, is also a rabbi; a daughter, Elsie Stern, of Brooklyn; her stepmother, Lili Rudin of New York City;  a brother, Stephen Rudin of Manhasset, N.Y.; a stepbrother, Jeffrey Laikind of New York City; four grandchildren; and nieces and nephews.         Services will be held at 12:30 p.m. tomorrow at the Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale.       
         Joan Stoliar, a freelance book designer otherwise known as the den mother of New York fly-fishers, who took her love of pristine trout streams into city classrooms, died on June 18 at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said her husband, Arthur.         Mrs. Stoliar's talents were in demand for books requiring special treatment for their illustrations or instructional materials. She also supplied the graphic designs for trade books by Richard Bach, James Clavell, Johnny Carson and the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska, among others.         For Mr. Bach she designed his best sellers ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' (Macmillan, 1970), ''Illusions'' (Delacorte, 1977) and ''The Bridge Across Forever'' (Morrow, 1984). ''Illusions'' was the first book design to be copyrighted in its entirety.         At the behest of the mayor's office she created a commemorative volume in 1989 to mark the 200th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration. Later, she designed New York City's souvenir parade program for troops returning from the Persian Gulf war.         In her angler's incarnation, Mrs. Stoliar was a board member of the Manhattan-based Theodore Gordon Flyfishers and the founding director of their Trout in the Classroom program. It helps to outfit and maintain artifical tanks in a number of public schools in which children raise hatchling brown trout.         The students then release the fish in the streams of the city's upstate watersheds. The program was created to help make the children aware of the clear brooks and rivers in the Catskills and Hudson Valley.         Mrs. Stoliar also inspired the club's Project Access, a volunteer effort to build trails and access ramps at two trout streams in the Catskills. She enlisted the Department of Environmental Conservation and other interested parties to make selected fishing holes accessible to the disabled and elderly.         Born Joan Kramer in Brooklyn, Mrs. Stoliar graduated from Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh in 1950 and worked as an art director at various publications before turning freelance. She frequently lectured on book design at publishers' seminars.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Stoliar is survived by a daughter, Lee Stoliar Dufresne of Charlotteville, N.J.; a son, Evan, of Manhattan; a sister, Dr. Virginia Stein of Somerville, N.J.; and a granddaughter.       
         Phyllis Propp Fowle, a New York lawyer who was the first woman to be an officer of the Army judge advocate general's corps, died Thursday in Manhattan. She was 92 and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.         She was also the only woman in the corps to serve overseas during World War II. Colonel Propp, as she was known to her former Army colleagues, was made a distinguished member of the corps at a banquet in her honor in April 1999 at the Judge Advocate General's School in Charlottesville, Va.         A native of Laurel, Iowa, and a 1930 graduate of the University of Iowa, she earned her law degree there and was the only woman in the law school's class of 1933. She was working in the legal department of the Federal Land Bank in Omaha in 1942 when Congress opened the Army to women by creating the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps. She was in the first group to sign up.         As a captain in 1942, she persuaded the Army to transfer her to the judge advocate general's corps. In January 1945 she reported to European Command headquarters in Paris.         She rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and processed hundreds of legal cases in Frankfurt and Heidelberg, Germany. One involved the Hessian crown jewels, purloined by three Army officers from Kronburg castle outside Frankfurt. Early in 1947, when the Army discharged all its women, it asked Colonel Propp to remain as the civilian chief of legal assistance, which she did until 1951.         From then until the 1970's, while she was in private practice in Manhattan, she served as an advocate general in the Army Reserve, encouraging female law students to follow her path into the corps. She formally retired from practice two years ago.         Mrs. Fowle is survived by her husband, Farnsworth Fowle, a retired New York Times reporter and former foreign correspondent, whom she married in Europe 49 years ago.       
         Rose Wyler, who wrote more than 50 books for children on science and other topics, died on June 12 at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Ms. Wyler was the sole author of over two dozen books and a co-author of others. One of her best-known works is ''Spooky Tricks'' (1968), which she wrote with her husband Gerald Ames. When it was reissued in 1994, Scripps Howard News Service called it ''the perfect Halloween book'' for ''school-agers who are just beginning to read.''         Ms. Wyler once recalled that as a girl she ''always had a collection of stones, bugs or leaves and always wanted to know more about nature.'' She never could find books on nature as a child, she said, so at 11 she decided she was going to write them.         Her book ''Science Fun With Toy Boats and Planes'' (1986) was praised by The Christian Science Monitor, which said: ''For the young physicist, there is a wealth of information in this little book.''         A native of the Bronx, Ms. Wyler  received a B.A. from Barnard and a master's from Teacher's College at Columbia. Her first marriage ended in divorce. She married Mr. Ames in 1948. He died in 1993.         She is survived by two sons, Joseph Kosok of Vera Cruz, Mexico, and Karl Kosok of Silver Spring, Md.; a stepdaughter, Eva-Lee Baird of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.       
         Diane Divers Blair, who taught and practiced politics in Arkansas for 30 years, becoming fast friends with Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, died on Monday at her home in Fayetteville, Ark. She was 61.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         At her death she was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Arkansas, where she lectured and wrote from 1968 until her retirement three years ago.         Mrs. Blair befriended the Clintons in the mid-1970's. She worked as a researcher for Mr. Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992, and as an adviser in his 1996 re-election effort. In 1993, Mr. Clinton appointed her to the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.         The friendship drew scrutiny in Mr. Clinton's first term after it was revealed that Mrs. Blair's husband, James B. Blair, the chief counsel to Tyson Foods, had helped Mrs. Clinton make nearly $100,000 in profits from trading in commodity futures.         Professor Blair was a regular guest at the White House, and the Clintons reciprocated, visiting her in Fayetteville three times in recent months during her illness.         The Clintons are expected to attend a memorial service for her next month.         Professor Blair was born in Washington. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Cornell University in 1959 and received an M.A. in political science at the University of Arkansas in 1967.         In between she worked as an analyst for the President's Committee on Government Contracts, a researcher for the Senate Special Committee on Unemployment and legislative secretary to Senator Stuart Symington, Democrat of Missouri.         After moving to Arkansas, she served Governors Dale L. Bumpers and David H. Pryor on various state commissions.         In 1980, Governor Clinton appointed her a commissioner of the Arkansas Educational Television Network, and she served until 1993. The board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting elected her chairman in 1997 for a two-year term.         In addition to writing many articles and book chapters, she was the author of ''Arkansas Government and Politics: Do the People Rule?'' (University of Nebraska Press, 1988).         In addition to her husband of 21 years, Professor Blair is survived by a son and a daughter by an earlier marriage, William R. Kincaid of Washington and Kathryn K. Jong of Fayetteville; two stepdaughters and a stepson, Heather E. Blair of Chicago, Arden S. Blair of Columbia, Md., and James R. Blair of Fort Worth; a sister, Lois Alard of Fayetteville, and two grandchildren.       
         Judy Angelo Cowen, a photographer who specialized in portraits of children, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 83 and had homes in Manhattan and Elberon, N.J.         Born Judy Bach in Manhattan, Ms. Cowen was educated at the Dana Hall School and Pine Manor College in Massachusetts. After the death of her husband, Lt. Harry Angelo, a member of the United States 30th Infantry Division who was killed in 1944 at the battle of St. Lo in Normandy, Ms. Cowen began experimenting with photography, using as subjects her young son and his cousins. By the early 1950's, she had built her own darkroom, where she worked year round.         During the next decade, her portraiture expanded to the children of celebrities and the socially prominent, and for the next 30 years she traveled to sittings across the United States. Her work, in which children were allowed to roam freely in their own element, was hailed for its subtlety and eloquence.         In 1962 she married Arthur Cowen Jr., the chairman of the securities firm Cowen & Company. Mr. Cowen died in 1986.         She is survived by a son, John M. Angelo of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Lorie Cowen Levy of Irvington, N.Y., and Jill Cowen of Manhattan; a stepson, Tony Cowen of Manhattan; eight grandchildren; and a sister, Carol Gruntal of Westchester, N.Y.       
         Nora Kahn Piore, a New York economist and health policy expert, died Saturday at New York Hospital. She was 87 and lived in Greenwich Village.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         She was born in the Bronx, the daughter of Alexander Kahn, a founder of the New York Liberal Party and former general manager of The Jewish Daily Forward.         She graduated Phi Beta Kappa in economics in 1933 from the University of Wisconsin, where she received an M.A. in the subject a year later.         Over her long career, Mrs. Piore was a union organizer and supervisor of education for union members; a research economist for a Senate subcommittee dealing with health legislation; a special economic assistant in the New York City Health Department; and head of a joint project with Hunter College that analyzed the economics of health initiatives in President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society program.         From 1972 to 1982, she was a professor of public health economics at Columbia University, and from 1971 to 1982, was associate director of its Center for Community Health Systems. In that capacity, she provided raw data that helped budget makers at City Hall and in Albany to allocate Medicare and Medicaid money.         Until the late 1980's, she continued consulting for health-related foundations and agencies and was a director of the Health Services Improvement Fund of Blue Cross-Blue Shield.         Her husband of 70 years, Dr. Emanuel R. Piore, died last month.         She is survived by a son, Michael J., of Boston; two daughters, Dr. Margot Onek of Washington and Jane Gilman of South Orange, N.J.; a sister, Jeanne Barnett of Alexandria, Va.; and six grandchildren.       
         Ruth R. Goddard, a leader of the American Jewish Committee for more than 50 years who was also active in many other philanthropies in New York, died Tuesday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 98.         In 1968, she was the first woman to be elected a national vice president of the committee. She remained active as an honorary national vice president and honorary chairwoman of the organization's Women's Campaign Board.         She worked for many groups devoted to health care, education and the arts, notably the theater. She was a longtime member of the board of the American Theater Wing.         Born Ruth Rubin in New York, she had a successful career as a fashion stylist and as a business partner of her first husband, Samuel Kass. After their divorce, she married D. Samuel Gottesman in 1944. That marriage ended in 1949; she then adopted the name Goddard, after an aunt. She owned a radio station in Waterbury, Conn., in the 1950's.         She had no immediate survivors.       
         Natalie Davis Spingarn, a medical writer who endured multiple bouts of cancer and became a prominent spokeswoman for cancer survivors, died on June 6 in Washington. She was 78.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her son Jonathan said.         Mrs. Spingarn's latest book, ''The New Cancer Survivors: Living with Grace, Fighting with Spirit,'' was published this year. Her personal story ''Hanging in There: Living Well on Borrowed Time,'' was published in 1982.         She created the ''Cancer Survivor's Bill of Rights'' for the 75th anniversary of the American Cancer Society, said Joann Schellenbach, a spokeswoman for the organization. The document, written in 1988, was widely distributed among those with cancer, and Mrs. Spingarn became an important figure in the patients' rights movement, Ms. Schellenbach said.         Mrs. Spingarn's paper demanded that patients have a say in their medical treatment, that former cancer patients be freed of any social stigma and that employers and insurance companies not discriminate against them.         Cancer pervaded Mrs. Spingarn's life and the lives of many around her.  She had a mastectomy in 1974. But the cancer spread, first to her spine, for which she had radiation therapy in 1977, then to her hip, for which she had chemotherapy in 1979. She had a second mastectomy in 1981. Mrs. Spingarn's grandmother died of cancer. Her two sisters had breast cancer, and one died of pancreatic cancer. One of her two sons is a lymphoma survivor.         Natalie Davis was born May 26, 1922, in New York City, and reared in  New Rochelle. She graduated with a bachelor of arts degree from Vassar College in 1943, and became a journalist, then wrote on health and social policy for the federal government. In the early 1960's, she became a staff assistant to Abraham A. Ribicoff, the secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and became his executive assistant when he was elected senator from Connecticut.         Mrs. Spingarn is survived by her husband, Jerome Spingarn; two sons, Jonathan of Atlanta and Jeremy of Norwood, Mass.; and two grandchildren.       
         Nancy Marchand, the distinguished character actress who excelled at playing wise and imperious authority figures -- newspaper publishers, queens, grande dames and a madam -- and who achieved perhaps her greatest fame as the domineering mother of a mob boss in the television series ''The Sopranos,''  died on Sunday at her home in Stratford, Conn., one day short of her 72nd birthday. She also had a home in Manhattan.         Her daughter Katie Sparer Bowe said that no specific cause of death was given, but for several years the actress had been suffering from cancer and chronic pulmonary disease.         A wide diversity of playwrights -- among them Chekhov, Shaw and  Shakespeare as well as Jean Genet, Paul Osborn and A. R. Gurney -- was within Ms. Marchand's range. She once described her physical presence as ''a strange combination of being very imposing and down-to-earth,'' an accurate assessment of the seemingly contradictory image she projected.         That description could be applied to the overburdened wife she played in the 1980 Broadway revival of Osborn's ''Morning's at Seven,'' the patrician publisher on the long-running ''Lou Grant'' television series and her portrayal of Livia Soprano, the monster mother of them all, a woman bred into the Mafia who without a blink of hesitation sets up her son Tony to be assassinated because he has moved her to a nursing home.         Except for her indomitability, Livia was in direct contrast to all the ''tasteful ladies'' Ms. Marchand  played in her busy career. At 70, after more than 50 years of acting, she discovered a new popularity, and it was for playing a wildly unsympathetic character. Livia Soprano was a role that she compared to that of Caligula's great-grandmother in ''I, Claudius,'' a woman who also happened to be named Livia.         Throughout her career, Ms. Marchand gave her roles an unexpected edge. Even when her characters were at their most officious, they retained a measure of charm, and her more affectionate characters could also be sardonic. She was an expert at both light and more serious comedy, moving effortlessly from the outrageous antics in the movie spoof ''The Naked Gun,'' to Lady Bracknell in ''The Importance of Being Earnest.''         In plays like ''Morning's at Seven,'' she warmed an audience's collective heart, but she never wore her own heart on her sleeve, avoiding the cul de sac of sentimentality. Instead she was wily in performance, turning in an instant from comedy to poignance.         Often she acted onstage with her husband, Paul Sparer -- in everything from ''A Phoenix Too Frequent'' by Christopher Fry to Edward Albee's ''Delicate Balance'' to Mr. Gurney's ''Love Letters.'' Mr. Sparer also had his own rewarding career in plays that included Elie Wiesel's ''Zalmen, or the Madness of God'' and ''The Burnt Flowerbed'' by Ugo Betti. Individually and together they were ultimate theatrical professionals.         Mr. Sparer died in November. In addition to her daughter Katie, an actress who lives in Stratford, Ms. Marchand is survived by a son, David of Madison, Wis.; another daughter, Rachel Sparer Bersier, an opera singer of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.         Offstage, Ms. Marchand was the reverse of so many of her strong-willed characters, a woman with a natural sense of insecurity, someone who felt uneasy in social situations. ''I'm always very uncomfortable with people.'' she once explained in an interview in The New York Times. ''It's something that I get upset with myself for, but that's the way I am. But I love people. And  when I'm on the stage, I can embrace people and still feel safe. There are a lot of different facets to my personality that I don't use all the time in my house, or in everyday life, that I can experience and share when I'm on a stage.''         Her roles, she said, were more a question of chance than choice. But whatever she was called on to do, even if it meant being as malevolent as Livia Soprano, she did it with enthusiasm. As always, she was captivated by her profession. Looking back on her career, she said, ''Acting was something I had to do.''         Nancy Marchand was born in Buffalo on June 19, 1928. After studying theater at Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, she made her first professional appearance onstage in 1946 in ''The Late George Apley'' in Ogunquit, Me. It was while acting in Shakespeare and Shaw at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, Mass., that she met -- and then married -- Mr. Sparer. When they moved to New York, she appeared on live television, playing Jo in a dramatization of ''Little Women,'' and then playing the female lead opposite Rod Steiger in the original television version of Paddy Chayefsky's ''Marty.''         In 1957 she made her Broadway debut in ''Miss Isobel,'' and two years later won an Obie award for her role as Madame Irma in the Off Broadway premiere of ''The Balcony'' by Genet. For several years she played leading Shakespearean roles with the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn. As an original member of the A.P.A. theater company (formally the Association of Producing Artists), she was Lady Sneerwell in ''The School for Scandal,'' Arkadina in ''The Seagull,'' Dona Ana in ''Man and Superman'' and other classic characters.         Continuing her devotion to repertory theater, she joined the theater at Lincoln Center to act in plays by Schiller (Queen Elizabeth in ''Mary Stuart''), Gorky and Sean O'Casey (''The Plough and the Stars'' with Jack MacGowran).         Ms. Marchand worked with equal ease on Broadway, off Broadway and in regional theater, as well as in movies and on television. In the 1980's she played the title role in Christopher Durang's ''Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,'' Bessie Berger in Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing'' at Circle in the Square, Klytemnestra in Ezra Pound's ''Elektra'' and the august mother in ''The Cocktail Hour'' by Mr. Gurney.         In the following decade, she moved on to Jon Robin Baitz's ''End of the Day'' at Playwrights Horizons, and, in 1993, acted in a double header of Peter Shaffer plays, ''Black Comedy'' and ''White Liars,'' at the Roundabout Theater Company. That same year she also played the wicked stepmother in a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella'' at the New York City Opera.         Her movie appearances included ''The Hospital''; two films with the team of Merchant Ivory, ''The Bostonians'' and ''Jefferson in Paris'';  and the remake of ''Sabrina,'' in which she played Harrison Ford's mother. When she played Mrs. Pynchon, the publisher of The Los Angeles Tribune on ''Lou Grant,'' the role became a keystone of her career; for it she won four Emmy awards. Some years later on television's ''Spearfield's Daughter,'' she switched cities and became the publisher of The New York Courier.         When Ms. Marchand played Livia Soprano on ''The Sopranos,'' television viewers wondered how her son Tony, played by James Gandolfini, and his wife (Edie Falco) could put up with her malice and her prejudices. The answer, of course, was that there was nothing much they could do against this self-dramatizing force of nature.         At the end of the show's first season, Tony was about to smother his mother with a pillow, but a stroke got there first and she was left gasping for breath in a hospital bed. David Chase, the creator of the Home Box Office series, said yesterday that he always planned to bring Livia back for a second year. He added that he was impressed by Ms. Marchand's  courage as she continued to perform despite her illness.         When that season ended, Ms. Marchand said she was looking forward to the second round: ''Who knows what lurks in the mind of Livia?'' Viewers soon found out: more of the same.         During the last show of the second season, there was a sudden twist in the narrative. Tony gave his mother airline tickets so that she and his aunt could fly to Arizona. Before she could get on the plane, Livia was stopped by men from airport security. The tickets were stolen property. Frantically, she telephoned her son.         Because filming on the third season of ''Sopranos'' was not scheduled to begin until Aug. 1, that scene represents Ms. Marchand's final performance: about to be arrested and furious at Tony for putting her in that predicament. Mr. Chase would not discuss forthcoming events in the series, but if the actress had lived, undoubtedly the mother and son battle would have continued and Livia Soprano would have had the last word.         Correction:  June 21, 2000, Wednesday  An obituary of the actress Nancy Marchand yesterday misidentified Livia, a Roman historical figure, in some copies. Livia, to whom Ms. Marchand compared her television role as Livia in ''The Sopranos,'' was the great-grandmother of the Emperor Caligula, not his mother.         A page one reference to the obituary misstated the character's name as Lydia in some copies.         Correction:  June 22, 2000, Thursday  An obituary of the actress Nancy Marchand on Tuesday misstated the title of a Peter Shaffer play in which she appeared with the Roundabout Theater Company in 1993. It is ''White Lies,'' not ''White Liars.''       
         Alice Lord Landon, a pioneer in women's swimming and diving who was a presence on the American Olympic scene for eight decades, died last Thursday at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 98.         At age 13, Alice Lord swam nine miles across Long Island Sound. At 18, she was a platform diver on the first United States women's swimming team in the Olympics.         At 82, she led the procession of American athletes at the Los Angeles Olympics, wearing a replica of her uniform from the 1920 Games at Antwerp, Belgium.         And at 94, she carried the torch for the Atlanta Games when it moved through Daytona Beach, Fla.         ''Alice was the grand dame of the Olympians,'' said Dorothy Franey Langkop, honorary executive director of United States Olympians, an association of former competitors that the diver and her husband, the Olympic high-jump champion Dick Landon, helped found in the mid-1940's.         Lord Landon was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1993.         She was evidently the oldest female American Olympian, according to the United States Olympic Committee. Hal Prieste, 103, who won a diving bronze medal for the United States in 1920, is listed as the oldest living American Olympian.         Growing up in Brooklyn and then Westchester County, Alice Lord was encouraged by her father to pursue physical fitness.         ''My brother and I walked 20 miles a day,'' she would recall. ''I swam distance, going a little further and faster every day, but not for competition. I wasn't working to make the Olympics, because I didn't know what the Olympics were.''         She began competing with the newly formed Women's Swimming Association of New York, which dominated the emerging sport. But diving conditions were primitive. The practice pools were often only 6 feet deep, forcing Lord Landon to snap forward quickly and cup her hands after entering the water to keep her head from hitting the bottom.         Competing at the 1920 Games, she was handicapped by the lack of a coach and failed to make the finals in platform diving. But her teammates from the swimming association were among the stars of the Games. Aileen Riggin Soule, now 94, won the gold medal in springboard diving, and Ethelda Bleibtrey captured three golds in swimming to lead an American women's sweep.         On the ship going to Antwerp, Alice Lord met Dick Landon, and the high-jumper and the diver were married two years later in a burst of publicity over their Olympic romance.         ''He got so tired of answering how we met,'' she remembered long afterward. ''Finally he answered that we met in midair: he was going up and I was going down.''         Lord Landon remained active in the Olympic movement. She was an official of United States Olympians, held the starter's gun for women's swimming in the Olympic trials during the 1920's and 1930's, helped choose team uniforms and raised money for the United States squads.         She is survived by a daughter, Bunny McMunn, of Ormond Beach; two grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandchild. Her husband died in 1971.         Although she promoted the Olympic movement, Lord Landon spoke out on its blemishes. She felt that the Olympic ideal of placing participation above winning was violated when winners were honored but losers were forgotten.         ''The creed is fine,'' she said. ''It hasn't always been lived up to.''       
         Christie R. Basham, a former executive producer of ''Meet the Press'' who was one of the first women to work as an executive in television network news, died on Sunday at her home in Washington, D.C. She was 68.         The cause was brain cancer, The Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Basham, a native New Yorker, graduated from Connecticut College and spent 19 years with NBC in Washington, beginning in 1957 as an aide to David Brinkley and advancing to director of news operations and other executive posts.         After some years as an executive with CBS and then at WETA, a Public Broadcasting outlet in Washington, she returned to NBC in 1982 and went on to become assistant vice president for NBC News in Washington. She also held other executive posts besides being executive producer of ''Meet the Press.''         Her husband, William R. Basham, died in 1986. Her survivors include a brother, a niece and a nephew.       
         Dr. Josephine D. Martin, a psychiatrist who helped rootless children, troubled adolescents and terrified civil rights activists in a lifelong crusade to weld the healing of personal and social wounds, died on July 6 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         Dr. Martin, who lived in Manhattan and East Hampton, had long battled an autoimmune disorder, her family said.         She became known as the unofficial doctor to the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, or more personally, ''the little lady doctor from up North.'' She had gone to Mississippi to work with children under a precursor of the Head Start program and diagnosed their bloated stomachs as resulting from acute malnutrition. She soon found herself holding the hands of civil rights workers as they experienced daily intimidation and humiliation.         ''She was just something we had never seen before,'' said Unita Blackwell, one of the leaders in the fight to register black voters in Mississippi in the 1960's, and now the mayor of Mayersville, Miss. ''She was a white woman who was caring and loving.''         As Molotov cocktails exploded on Ms. Blackwell's lawn in the Freedom Summer of 1964, Dr. Martin sent Ms. Blackwell's traumatized 7-year-old son to Vermont to attend summer camp. An abandoned New York City child she took under her wing when he was 4 is now a lawyer who will help direct a foundation to be set up in her honor.         Josephine Diaz was born in Tampa, Fla., on Dec. 31, 1915. Her father was born in Spain, became a cigar-maker, then immigrated to Tampa. When Josephine was very young, her family moved to New York City, where she attended elementary and high school.         She contracted tuberculosis as a teenager and spent two years in a sanitarium. At 19, she married a  fellow patient, a social worker named Earl Martin. They worked together organizing people who had had tuberculosis to fight for better treatment.         Meanwhile, she attended several colleges. At the State University of New York in Buffalo, she was offered a scholarship to medical school, but the couple moved because of Mr. Martin's job. She eventually graduated from Hunter College.         She then worked at jobs in medical research and marine biology. Eventually, in her 30's, she entered medical school at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, borrowing and working to pay tuition.         After divorcing Mr. Martin, she married Cedric H. Belfrage, one of the founders of the leftist National Guardian. He was forced to leave the United States because of his political views, said Dr. Martin's third and last husband, Robert J. Schwartz. (Mr. Belfrage is deceased, as is Mr. Martin.)         Dr. Martin went with Mr. Belfrage to London, where she qualified to work for the National Health System; while there, she treated W.E.B. Du Bois, the sociologist and black protest leader, for a heart ailment.         Increasingly, she felt she needed to know more about patients' personal histories and living conditions. Psychiatry seemed a way to bridge the gap.         Back in New York, she entered a psychiatric residency at Bellevue Hospital and stayed on as a full-time psychiatrist working with children and adolescents. She started a day program for mentally ill youths, and, because public schools often refused to accept them, she also set up an educational program for them at Bellevue.         In 1967, after her divorce from Mr. Belfrage, she married Mr. Schwartz, a banker who had helped her with financial matters. Mr. Schwartz was also an economist who organized members of his profession to push for arms reductions. He became a leading advocate of investing in socially responsible enterprises.         ''All my husbands were wonderful men, each appropriate for his time,'' Dr. Martin liked to say.         On July 4, 1963, she and Mr. Schwartz went to Baltimore to participate in a demonstration against an amusement park that refused to admit blacks. They spent the night in jail. On July 8, the Baltimore City Council passed an emergency resolution to set up a human rights commission to mediate the park's racial problems.         ''What better way to spend the Fourth of July than to go to jail in the war for independence for millions of Americans whose freedom from tyranny did not come with the Declaration of Independence of 1776?'' she wrote in the National Guardian at the time.         In 1964, Dr. Martin took an extended vacation from Bellevue to go south, where she worked in the Mississippi Child Development Center, the forerunner of Head Start. Her interest in the South dated to 1950, when she became friends with Claude Williams, a white preacher working to integrate his church in Fungo Hollow, Ala.         She quickly became involved in the civil rights movement as tensions were escalating. She contributed her medical knowledge in teaching sessions and her psychiatric skills in individual sessions with frayed and frightened campaigners.         ''Some, more disturbed, under constant stress, decompensated or engaged in provocative behavior, putting themselves and others at risk,'' Dr. Martin wrote in an autobiographical essay. ''On occasion, hospitalization became necessary.''         She sent the troubled civil rights workers to Manhattan, to Gracie Square Hospital, where she had contacts, for fear of what might happen to them in Southern hospitals.         In his 1972 book, ''The Making of a Black Revolutionary,'' James Forman wrote a personal inscription in the copy he gave Dr. Martin. It said that she ''helped me to unravel many of the conflicting tendencies caused by a very active life, enabling me to bring focus and greater clarity to this head.''         Mr. Schwartz said that several times Mr. Forman, a leader in the Southern struggle, would arrive at their Manhattan apartment saying it was impossible to return to Mississippi. He would consult with Dr. Martin, and ''10 days later he was back again,'' Mr. Schwartz said.         Likening the situation to a M.A.S.H. unit, Ms. Blackwell said, ''She was the doctor who was on the battleground.''         Dr. Martin soon found other battlegrounds back home. Working for St. Luke's-Roosevelt, she set up an innovative home care psychiatric program for residents of welfare hotels. At the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, she worked with troubled adolescents, homeless families and others who needed help.         At the same time, she socialized in Mr. Schwartz's world of Wall Street financiers. During a pause in the conversation, she would say, ''How about giving some clothing to the poor kids at Bellevue?''         Boxes would soon arrive at the hospital's door.         Dr. Martin said her life added up to simply doing the next right thing. ''I had never had the notion that my role was to 'do good' or 'empower' anybody,'' she said, ''but to be able to offer my skills as needed, to live my life as seemed right to me.''       
         Ruth Werner, a colorful and successful Soviet spy whose exploits included radioing invaluable atomic bomb data to Moscow in the middle of World War II, died on July 7 in Berlin. She was 93.         In her 20 years as an intelligence operative in China, Poland, Switzerland and England, she had a number of close calls. But she always managed to extricate herself from the predicament -- unlike Klaus Fuchs, the agent who fed her the British atomic bomb secrets, who was imprisoned in Britain for nine and a half years, or Richard Sorge, the master spy who recruited her, who was executed in Japan in 1941.         Her espionage work was entwined with her romantic life, which included an affair with one of her spy chiefs; later she married a British Communist to become a British citizen and only later came to love him. She told some but not all of her story in a 1974 autobiography, still observing the iron rules of conspiracy by never mentioning Mr. Fuchs, who was still alive.         Ms. Werner was known by the code name Sonja, which was given to her by Mr. Sorge in 1933. Ruth Werner was her pen name. All of her identities had their roots in a prosperous Jewish household in Berlin, where she was born Ursula Ruth Kuczynski, one of six children of Robert Rene and Berta Kuczynski. Her father was a distinguished economist.         Ms. Werner was drawn early to the Communist movement and became a member of the German Communist Party at 19. She was immediately fired by the publishing house where she worked. Soon afterward she met and married Rolf Hamburger, an architect.         She started writing for the party newspaper, Rote Fahne. In 1930, having been told by the party that she would be contacted in Shanghai, she moved with her husband to China.         They began a pleasant bourgeois life, but she was waiting impatiently for the promised contact. It took four months and friendship with Agnes Smedley, an American leftist journalist, who introduced her to Mr. Sorge. Mr. Sorge, then 35, had been the Shanghai agent of the Soviet Army's intelligence service for a year. The service was known by its Russian initials, G.R.U.         Mr. Sorge asked whether she was ready to face danger. She nodded and agreed to make room available for his clandestine meetings with Chinese Communists, the chief interest of Moscow.         Ms. Werner joined the ring without her husband's knowledge, stored weapons and hid a Chinese comrade who was on the run. Two years later, when Mr. Sorge left Shanghai for Moscow, he recommended her to the G.R.U.         Though her marriage was deteriorating, she and her husband had had a son, Michael, while in Shanghai. When the G.R.U. asked her to go to Moscow for training, she left the boy with in-laws in Czechoslovakia.         In the G.R.U. school she learned Morse code, Russian and how to build radio transmitters and receivers. In February 1934 she was sent to turbulent Manchuria, which had been seized from China by the Japanese. Her boss was Ernst, a former sailor, with whom she became romantically involved.         ''Our transmitter was the link between the partisans and the Soviet Union,'' she wrote. She sent coded messages twice a week, and bought and transported chemicals for explosives for the Chinese Communist partisans.         In 1935, Moscow, fearing the two spies were about to be exposed, ordered Ms. Werner and Ernst to flee China. She accepted an assignment in Poland, this time with her husband, although she was pregnant with Ernst's child. Her daughter, Janina, was born in April 1936.         In late 1938 she was sent to Switzerland to set up a new spy ring, again with her husband, but he soon left her and went to the Far East. In February 1939 she met Len Beurton, an English Communist who had fought in Spain with the international brigades. For him, he once wrote, it was ''love at first sight; she had a very good figure.''         In 1940, the G.R.U. authorized a marriage of convenience by which Ms. Werner became British, but the love came to be mutual -- the marriage lasted until his death three years ago.         Ms. Werner had already begun clandestine transmissions from a radio set she had built in her rented house near Oxford when, in 1941, she met Mr. Fuchs, who was working at the British atomic research facility nearby.         The two spies would bicycle into the countryside for their meetings, and Mr. Fuchs would hand over written materials that, Ms. Werner once told an interviewer, were ''like hieroglyphics.''         Norman Moss, author of ''Klaus Fuchs: The Man Who Stole the Atomic Bomb'' (1987), said that Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin's chief aide, set up the Soviet atomic bomb project in 1942 as a result of the information transmitted by Mr. Fuchs and Ms. Werner, and that the information saved the Soviet researchers a great deal of time. The Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb in 1949.         Ms. Werner was also running other agents, including a Royal Air Force officer, a specialist in submarine radar and even her brother and father. She was once told that the chief of G.R.U. had said, ''If we had five Sonjas in England, the war would end sooner.''         In the early 1950's she and her family -- another son, Peter, had been born in 1943 -- left England for East Berlin. Her only connection with the G.R.U. after that was in 1969, when she was invited to a ceremony to receive her second Red Banner, the highest Soviet military decoration.         She turned to writing, producing some short stories; a biography of Olga Benario, a German Communist who was gassed by the Nazis in 1942; and her autobiography.         She is survived by her three children, five grandchildren and three sisters.       
         Emily Maxwell, the wife of the author and New Yorker editor William Maxwell, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her daughter Kate Maxwell said.         Mrs. Maxwell published short articles and reminiscences in The New Yorker, and from 1957 to 1965, she wrote year-end reviews of children's books for the magazine's Christmas list. She was also a painter.         Mr. Maxwell dedicated a number of his books to his wife. One of them, ''The Old Man at the Railroad Crossing and Other Tales'' (1957), is a collection of fables he wrote for her, some as bedtime stories when she couldn't sleep, and others as Christmas gifts for the family.         In addition to her daughter Kate, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband; another daughter, Brookie Maxwell, also of Manhattan; a grandson; and two brothers, Robert Noyes of Portland, Ore., and H. F. Noyes of Athens, Greece.       
         Virginia Moffat Nickerson, a leader in many philanthropic and cultural organizations in New York, died June 18 at her home in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. She was 73 and lived in New York City and Cold Spring Harbor.         In 1997, Mrs. Nickerson was honored by the mayor of New York for her work in behalf of the Children's Aid Society. She had played an important role in the recruitment of many of the society's 1,200 volunteers.         Mrs. Nickerson was also active in the support or leadership of organizations including the Union Theological Seminary, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the New York Philharmonic and the Garden Club of America.         A graduate of Vassar College, Mrs. Nickerson earned a master's degree from Columbia University in 1949.         Mrs. Nickerson's first husband, E. Farrar Bateson, died in 1977. She is survived by her second husband, Adams H. Nickerson; her children, Douglas Bateson, Emily Bateson, William Bateson and Rosina Bateson Barker; a brother, Keith Moffat; and six grandchildren.       
         Grace M. S. McKittrick MacNeil, a civic worker and philanthropist who was the national president of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. from 1969 to 1972, died on June 30 in Natchez, Miss. She was 92, lived in Natchez and had also lived in Princeton, N.J.         Mrs. MacNeil was a longtime owner and operator of plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana.         After holding paid and unpaid posts with Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., whose headquarters are in Manhattan, she was on its board of directors for some years and was elected national president after holding lesser executive posts in the 1960's.         While she was president, she ''led the organization to its highest membership, of over 3.9 million members,'' Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. said in announcing her death. She also oversaw the beginning of a national Girl Scouts program of education about, and improvement of, the environment. Her philanthropies included giving more than 60 acres of land to help preserve a Natchez Indian historic site.         She was born in Natchez and graduated from H. Sophie Newcomb College in New Orleans. Her husband, Douglas H. MacNeil, died in 1963.         Her survivors include two daughters, Elizabeth Boggess and Anne MacNeil, both of Natchez; a grandson; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Laurel Fox Vlock, who was instrumental in the videotaping and archiving of many survivors' accounts of the sufferings caused by the Holocaust, died on Saturday in New Haven, Conn. She was 74 and lived in Woodbridge, Conn.         She died of injuries suffered in a car accident on Friday, said Kathy Landau, a friend.         She also worked in television as a producer and in other capacities.         A native of New Haven, Ms. Vlock first learned about the Holocaust in her youth, when her parents, John J. and Rose Greenberg Fox, were aiding its victims during World War II.         Later she was profoundly moved when she heard an Auschwitz survivor tell of his experiences. She was a local filmmaker in 1979 when she and  Dr. Dori Laub, a psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, founded the New Haven-based Holocaust Survivors Film Project to compile videotaped interviews with survivors.         Soon after the project began, Ms. Vlock said in an interview in The New York Times, ''Everybody talks about the unspeakable, but it is speakable, and when it is spoken, it has a force that isn't found anywhere else.''         Ms. Vlock was a co-founder of what came to be called the Fortunoff Archive of Holocaust Testimonies, at Yale University. At the archive's formal opening in 1982, when it already contained 250 taped interviews, she observed that, with 40 years having passed since the Holocaust, the time left for collecting first-hand accounts was ''indeed running out.''         By 1985 the archive had more than 700 videotaped testimonies. Roughly half were recorded in the New Haven area. Others were donated by similar projects in California, Illinois, Long Island and Israel. By 1995 there were 3,200 taped testimonies.         Ms. Vlock was an adviser to the archive for almost two decades. People who viewed the tapes ''have an epiphany,'' she said in a 1985 interview. ''They understand for the first time why people don't forget 40 years later.''         In 1981 she won an Emmy Award for a television documentary about survivors, ''Forever Yesterday,'' filmed for WNEW-TV in New York. Some of the survivors who were interviewed wept as they described the murder of loved ones long ago.         Ms. Vlock received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University and a master's degree from Queens College.         Her survivors include her mother,  who is 102, of New Haven; her husband, Jay; two sons, Daniel, of Ridgefield, Conn., and Michael, of Stony Creek, Conn.; a daughter, Sandra Vlock, also of Stony Creek; a sister, Marian Wexler of New Haven; and nine grandchildren.       
         Ronne Wohl Wulwick, a founder of Hineni, an outreach group that encourages young Jews to reconnect to their heritage, died last Saturday at her home in Old Westbury, N.Y. She was 85.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Wulwick, a Bronx native who also lived in Palm Beach, Fla., helped establish Hineni in the early 1970's and remained an active member. The organization is based in the Hineni Heritage Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Wulwick was also involved in Fight for Sight, an organization that fosters vision research, and was active in groups for teenage suicide prevention. She helped raise money for Hadassah, the Anti-Defamation League and the United Jewish Appeal. She also helped start a fundraising campaign for Long Island Jewish Hospital in Hyde Park, N.Y.         Mrs. Wulwick's first husband, Joseph S. Wohl, to whom she was married for 46 years, died in 1979. She is survived by Sam Wulwick, whom she married in 1988; three daughters, Elinor Wohl of Manhattan, Nancy Drake of Aspen, Colo., and Vicki Greenberg of Lawrence, N.Y.; a son, Larry W. Wohl of Manhattan; a brother, Jack Jaffess of Miami; and seven grandchildren.       
         Rose Marie Thomas, the head of the fund-raising organization for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, which was founded by her husband, the comedian Danny Thomas, died on Wednesday. She was 86 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         Mrs. Thomas had held the fund-raising position since the death in 1991 of her husband, who established the hospital four decades ago.         During his lifetime, she also helped raise money for the hospital, a research and treatment center for catastrophic childhood diseases.         Born Rose Marie Cassaniti in Detroit, she was a singer who had a radio show. She met Mr. Thomas in Detroit, and they were married in 1936.         She is survived by two daughters, the actress Marlo Thomas, and Terre Thomas; a son, Tony; five grandchildren and three sisters.       
         Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in the 1950's led to a movement that found American homes for thousands of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell, Ore., after a stroke on July 24. She was 96.         Mrs. Holt first attracted national attention when she and her husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were American soldiers.         In 1954, Mrs. Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore., to watch a film about Amerasian children in South Korean orphanages.         ''We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Mrs. Holt later wrote in ''The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on adoption. ''We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching for someone to care.''         At first, the Holts sent money to South Korean orphanages but soon decided that the children needed families. They were both about 50 years old, and had already reared six biological children. Each wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Mrs. Holt later recalled, but each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take so many.         At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more than two foreign-born children. But in 1955, Congress passed the Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from infancy to 3 1/2. Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the process easier.         At the Holt house, soon there were children lined up to get a daily dose of vitamins, and the washing machine ran day and night.         Mr. Holt returned to South Korea for more children, while Mrs. Holt found families in the United States willing to take them.         In 1956, they founded the agency that would become Holt International Children's Services. At the time, there was no system in place for international adoptions. The Korean-American children were the first such large group to be adopted.         The Holts, who were Baptist, believed with missionary fervor that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American families. Holt International now handles about 1,000 international adoptions each year from 12 countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year.         Until days before her death, Grandma Holt, as she came to be known, was active in the agency. One of her daughters, Molly Holt, works for the Holt agency in South Korea.         She is also survived by nine other children, Barbara Chambers, Suzanne Peterson, Linda Pack, Robert Holt, Mary Last, Christine Russell, Helen Stampe, Paul Holt and Betty Blankenship; three sisters, Beulah Stronczek, Katherine Stanger and Grace Fisher; a brother, William L. Holt; 19 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.         Though the poverty they had seen in the Korean film footage shocked them, the Holts had seen hard times themselves. Bertha Marian Holt was born on Feb. 5, 1904, in Des Moines. Her father was a schoolteacher and a mail carrier. She received a degree in nursing in 1926, and the next year married a cousin, Harry Holt. The couple moved to South Dakota, where they became ''custom farmers,'' working land owned by others until they had saved enough to buy their own.         In the face of drought and poor farming conditions, Mr. Holt also milled flour and mined lignite coal. But during the Depression, the Holts left their farm for taxes owed and moved to the Willamette Valley in Oregon.         There the Holts prospered, eventually owning a lumber mill, but in 1950 Mr. Holt suffered a heart attack. The Holts turned to prayer, asking God to give them a mission and allow Mr. Holt more time to live. The orphans, they believed, were that mission.         While in South Korea in 1964, Harry Holt suffered another heart attack and died. Many thought the agency would close, but Mrs. Holt took over, traveling endlessly. She also worked to improve conditions at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other countries to set up adoption programs.         ''She would say, 'You know, I'm just a grandma, but here's what I think,' '' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, who was adopted through the Holt agency and now works there as a vice president.         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson named Mrs. Holt the National Mother of the Year, and in 1995 she became the only non-Korean to receive the Korea National Merit Award. But, Ms. Cox said, Mrs. Holt liked to say that she preferred the  photographs that children sent from all over the world.         ''She championed the idea that love and a safe, permanent home could transcend differences of nationality, race and ethnic background,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after Mrs. Holt's death.         In letters to agency employees, adopted children and adoptive families, Mrs. Holt spoke frequently of the Lord and quoted the Bible, which she said she had read 40 times.         Those who knew her said she seemed to have enormous energy. In 1996, she set the world record for the 400 meter race in the over-90 age group at the Hayward Classic in Eugene.       
         Constance Stuart Larrabee, a photographer who recorded the vanishing tribes of southern Africa, the World War II battlefields of Europe and her life on Maryland's tranquil Eastern Shore, died on July 27 at her home in Chestertown, Md. She was 85.         Known as Constance Stuart earlier in her career, Mrs. Larrabee in 1997 donated her African images to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African Art, her World War II pictures to the Corcoran Gallery and her views of the Eastern Shore to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum.         All three institutions simultaneously exhibited those collections in 1998. A traveling display, titled ''South Africa, 1936-1949 -- Photographs by Constance Stuart Larrabee,'' is being readied for a national tour by the Museum of African Art.         Yale University staged a 120-picture retrospective in 1995, presenting the remarkable panoply of her work. It opened with family portraits of Ndebele people in tribal garb, particularly of mothers with infants, and other tribal groups at work, rest and play.         She photographed South African soldiers fighting their way up the Italian boot, as well as the liberation of Paris, with Gen. Charles de Gaulle, in profile, addressing a crowd. Finally, the show ended on a genteel note in Maryland, where she bred Norwich and Norfolk terriers on a farm and depicted the rivers and creeks, wildlife and people of her surroundings.         Two of her South African photographs were included in Edward Steichen's famous international exhibition and collection of the mid-1950's, ''The Family of Man.'' The Museum of Modern Art billed it as ''the greatest photographic exhibition of all time,'' and she shared the credits with the likes of Margaret Bourke-White, Frank Capra and Henri Cartier-Bresson.         Born in England, Mrs. Larrabee grew up in Pretoria, South Africa, and studied photography in London and Munich. In 1936 she started a portrait studio in Pretoria to capture the white South African elite along with visitors like Noel Coward and members of the British royal family.         Apart from her commercial work, she began to chronicle the vanishing ethnic cultures of Bushmen, Transkei peoples and others in the region. Her exhibitions drew national attention and led to her appointment as a war photographer.         She accompanied the South African Sixth Armored Division and the American Sixth Army as they swept through Europe. At one point she came under German artillery fire aboard a French tank.         She arrived in the United States in 1949, married Col. Sterling Loop Larrabee and settled in Chestertown, where she established a long association with Washington College. She supported its arts programs and helped establish the Constance Stuart Larrabee Arts Center.         Her husband died in 1975. No immediate family members survive.       
         Loretta Young, the Academy Award-winning actress whose high cheekbones, pale skin and luminous eyes made her a reigning Hollywood beauty of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday in Los Angeles. She was 87 and lived in Palm Springs, Calif.         Miss Young, who won an Oscar as best actress for her performance in ''The Farmer's Daughter'' in 1947, later became a favorite of television viewers as the glowing star who twirled onto the stage in a designer gown each week to introduce an uplifting drama on ''The Loretta Young Show.'' She retired almost 40 years ago and never returned to the big screen.         Miss Young died at the home of her sister, Georgiana Montalban, the wife of the actor Ricardo Montalban, said Norman Brokaw, the chairman of the William Morris agency and her agent for 50 years. The cause was ovarian cancer, he said.         Hers was an art learned early in life. She first appeared on screen at age 4 as a fairy in the silent film ''The Primrose Ring.'' In 1928, she became a leading lady, starring opposite Lon Chaney in ''Laugh, Clown, Laugh.'' In addition to ''The Farmer's Daughter,'' in which she played an effervescent Swedish-born maid who runs for Congress, she appeared in nearly 100 films, often in the arms of such matinee idols as Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Tyrone Power or Cary Grant.         Her movies included ''Taxi'' with James Cagney in 1932; ''Zoo in Budapest'' with Gene Raymond in 1933; ''Man's Castle'' with Tracy, also in 1933; ''Call of the Wild'' with Gable in 1935; ''The Stranger'' with Orson Welles and Edward G. Robinson in 1946; and ''The Bishop's Wife'' with Grant in 1947.         Miss Young's screen image suggested a blend of virtuous poise, sensuality and vulnerability, and in fact, she once admitted to having had ''crushes'' on all of her leading men and to being ''susceptible'' to men in general. Reflecting on her appeal to moviegoers, she told Edward J. Funk, co-author of an unpublished autobiography:         ''My appeal wouldn't have been to the intellectuals or the neurotics. Nor to the shop girls and secretaries -- that would have been Joan Crawford's market. But there were an awful lot of women out there who were like me -- who were willing to play by the rules, didn't sleep around and were very aggressive. A Loretta Young movie had a happy ending; that's what it was geared to: a nice husband, nice lover, no abuse of any kind -- that's what the heroes and heroines were in those days.''         While Miss Young said she considered herself more of a ''movie star'' than an actress, she achieved her greatest popularity as the ''first lady'' of dramatic television, with ''The Loretta Young Show.'' In the half-hour anthology series, which ran on NBC from 1953 to 1961, Miss Young played characters from Queen Nefertiti to a nightclub singer. A trademark of the show was her glamorous entrance.         ''I did that to mollify the show's designer, Marusha,'' Miss Young said in a 1995 interview. ''I initially just walked through the doors, and Marusha was upset because no one would see the wonderful back of the dress.''         So Miss Young, who had studied ballet as a child, asked for a retake in which she entered the set and pirouetted before walking toward the camera. Viewers loved it.         The show at first was an audacious step for her, since at the time a fearful Hollywood was attacking television, a new medium and a formidable rival. Miss Young said friends and advisers warned her that if she appeared on television regularly she would be ''blackballed out of this business'' and ''never get another job.'' But she saw television as the ''wave of the future,'' and signed a contract with NBC and Procter & Gamble to produce and star in the dramatic series.         Miss Young appeared in 165 episodes. A devout Catholic, she ended each show by delivering a homily to the audience. Her show extolled ''respect for law and order and for disciplined deportment and character-building standards,'' she said in her 1961 memoir, ''The Things I Had to Learn,'' written with Helen Ferguson. ''Above all, we want to prove the strength, the good, really, of people.''         Although critics derided the moralistic melodramas as ''Sunday night soap opera,'' the series became one of the most popular on television, earning Miss Young millions of dollars and a reputation as one of the best businesswomen in Hollywood.         In 1972, she was awarded $559,000 by a jury in a breach-of-contract suit against NBC in which she contended that the network had humiliated her through the overseas release of introductory and closing segments of the show showing her in outmoded gowns and hairstyles.         She won the first of three Emmy Awards in 1953, which made her the first actress to win both an Oscar and an Emmy. The annual poll of TV-Radio Mirror readers earned her six consecutive gold medals as their favorite actress, and an episode of the series received the first television Grand Prix at the 1959 Cannes International Film Festival. The series was revived in 1962 as ''The New Loretta Young Show'' and ran for a year.         In 1995, Nostalgia Television, a national cable network, began reruns of the original show, the rights to which Miss Young had turned over to her son, Christopher Lewis, and his wife, Linda, who are film producers.         Perhaps the biggest controversy in her long career arose years after she left the screen. In 1994, her adopted daughter, Judy Lewis, maintained in an autobiography, ''Uncommon Knowledge,'' that she was the daughter of Miss Young and Clark Gable and that she was conceived during the making of ''Call of the Wild,'' in which the two starred.         In 1935 when the film was made, Miss Young was single and Gable was married to Ria Langham. Miss Lewis said that Miss Young was terrified that a scandal would end her career and Gable's, and that she had arranged to give birth in secret, taking more than a year off from work and citing an unspecified illness. Later, Miss Lewis asserted, Miss Young arranged her ''adoption,'' retrieving her from an orphanage where she had been temporarily placed.         For years, Miss Young refused to confirm or deny her daughter's account, dismissing it as ''a rumor from a bygone era.'' After the book's release, mother and daughter did not speak to each other for months.         Mr. Brokaw said yesterday, ''She didn't want to ever publicly acknowledge it.''         Miss Young, whose given name was Gretchen Michaela, was born on Jan. 6, 1913, in Salt Lake City. When she was 2 her parents separated, and her mother moved with her daughters and son, Jack, to Hollywood. She borrowed $1,000 from a Roman Catholic bishop, persuaded a department store to let her have furniture on credit and opened a boardinghouse.         Miss Young attended a convent school and began appearing as a child extra in movies, often working with her older sisters, Polly Ann and Betty Jane.         First National Studio signed her to a contract at age 14, put braces on her teeth and renamed her Loretta, a change she gladly accepted as evidence that she was on her way to becoming a star.         In 1930, at 17, Miss Young eloped with Grant Withers, her co-star in the film ''The Second-Story Murder.'' The marriage was annulled the following year. In 1940, she married Thomas H. A. Lewis, an advertising executive who later became a producer of her television series. The couple, who divorced in 1969, had two sons, Christopher, a producer, and Peter, a guitarist and songwriter.         Strong-willed, independent and rebellious, Miss Young was among the first female stars to command a six-figure salary. In 1939, when she rejected a five-year, $2 million contract with 20th Century Fox to try working as a freelance actress, she was blackballed by the studios. She made only one film, ''Eternally Yours,'' with David Niven, during the next two years.         She owned the rights to ''The Loretta Young Show'' and had control over its content, casting and final editing. And she paid strict attention to the show's moral tone.         During the filming for one episode, ''Come to the Stable,'' about two nuns who come to the United States from France to build a hospital for children, Miss Young became so disturbed by swearing on the set that she came up with the idea of a ''swear box.'' Cast and crew had to contribute up to 25 cents for each offense, and the money was donated to a home for unmarried mothers.         In 1963, at age 50, with movie offers still coming her way, Miss Young left show business. She later acknowledged that her retirement was perhaps premature and that she had always intended to resume her career. Although she was offered more than 150 parts, her last major role was that of an owner of a fashion magazine in ''Lady in the Corner,'' a 1989 television drama.         She lived an almost reclusive life and was rarely interviewed or photographed, although she occasionally appeared in public to promote one of her favorite charities. Her later years were quietly shared with her third husband, Jean Louis, a designer for Columbia Pictures, whom she married in 1994. Mr. Louis won an Oscar of his own in 1956 for his designs for ''The Solid Gold Cadillac.''         Mr. Louis died in 1997. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Montalban, Miss Young is survived by her three children.         Miss Young said that her faith sustained her through the difficult times in her life and that her mother had given her an invaluable sense of worth, independence and flair. In her memoir, she wrote: ''I believe that if we have lived our lives fully and well, and have accomplished, at least in part, the things which we were put here to do, we will be prepared -- mentally, spiritually and physically -- for our separation from this world.''

         Virginia Admiral, an American painter and writer who studied with Hans Hofmann, died on July 27. She was 85 and lived in New York City.         Ms. Admiral was born in Oregon and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago. While working on the Federal Arts Project in Oakland, Calif., in 1938, she became closely involved with the San Francisco poetry scene. With the poet Robert Duncan she published a single issue of a small-press magazine, Epitaph, which developed into The Experimental Review. Later, in New York, she wrote for True Crimes magazine.         In 1940 she enrolled at the Hofmann School in New York to study painting, where she met the artist Robert De Niro, who was working as a class monitor. They married in 1942; their son, the actor Robert De Niro, was born in 1943 and lives in New York City. Ms. Admiral's husband died in 1993. She is survived by a sister, Eleanor Haefele of Sacramento, and five grandchildren.         In 1942 Ms. Admiral exhibited in the Springs Salon for Young Artists at Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century Gallery in Manhattan. She had a solo show there in 1946 and was included in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection at the Venice Biennale in 1947.         In the 1960's Ms. Admiral was active in the antiwar movement, often contributing work to shows based on political themes. She was also instrumental in establishing low-cost housing for artists in SoHo. From 1973 to 1980 she showed at Buecker and Harpsichords gallery.         Her work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in  New York and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice.       
         Sally Amato, a singer and actress who founded the Amato Opera with her husband, the conductor Anthony Amato, died on Wednesday at her home in City Island in the Bronx. She was 82.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. Amato was in many ways the welcoming face of her family-run opera company. An operagoer was greeted by her at the door of the tiny Amato theater on the Bowery, and would then proceed down a flight of stairs or into the balcony, where Mr. Amato would conduct, stopping at intermission to draw raffles out of a barrel and award prizes to audience members. The company became a home for enthusiasts on both sides of the footlights: amateur singers (and some who became professionals) go there to learn and perform the great works and occasional rarities, and opera lovers on tight budgets go there to hear their favorite scores.         Mrs. Amato was born Serafina Bellantone in Manhattan in 1917. She began her performing career as a child, when she and her sisters performed vaudeville skits in movie theaters, and she continued to work as an actress and singer into the first decades of the Amato Opera, which she and her husband started in 1948.         She met Mr. Amato in 1943, when they were both performing at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J. The meeting itself was not auspicious: Mr. Amato and Ms. Bellantone had been cast as American Indians, and in one scene Mr. Amato was to throw his future wife to the floor and kick her. But she was charmed by his expressions of concern when the scene ended. She also said that she admired his tenor voice.         The Amatos married in 1945, and continued to work together at the American Theater Wing, where Mr. Amato directed workshops. They also shared an abiding love of opera, and it occurred to them soon after World War II that a company was needed to provide opportunities for aspiring singers returning from military service. The Amato Opera gave its first performances in the basement of Our Lady of Pompeii Church in Greenwich Village. The company later moved to 159 Bleecker Street; in 1963 it took over the jewel box theater at the corner of the Bowery and Second Street that has been its home ever since.         Mrs. Amato performed with the company under her maiden name for several seasons, but she increasingly took on many of the house's nonmusical jobs. She made many of the company's costumes, ran its box office, and operated its lighting board.         Mrs. Amato is survived by her husband and a sister, Ann Frydel, of Manhattan.       
         Eva Gatling, an art historian and curator who for many years was the director of the Heckscher Museum in Huntington, N.Y., died on Tuesday at the Westminister-Canterbury, a continuing care community in Virginia Beach, Va., where she had lived in recent years. She was 87.         ''The majority of the museums in America are small,'' Ms. Gatling once wrote. ''They have a potential for greatness that often escapes public attention.'' As head of the Heckscher from 1962 to 1978, she turned it into a valuable suburban museum.         Ronald G. Pisano, an art curator, said, ''She had an unerring eye for art, and was responsible for enriching the Heckscher collection with significant acquisitions, and elevating its reputation to that of one of the finest regional museums in America.''         August Heckscher founded the museum in 1920. In the 1950's it showed works from its permanent collection on a limited schedule. Under Ms. Gatling's leadership, the museum expanded the collection and held four or five major exhibitions each year. She rediscovered the work of Helen Torr and was instrumental in acquiring many paintings by Arthur Dove, Ms. Torr's husband. George Grosz's ''Eclipse of the Sun'' became the centerpiece of the collection.         Eva Ingersoll Gatling was born in Mobile, Ala., and graduated from the University of Alabama and Yale University.         Before joining the Heckscher, she was director of exhibitions at Duke University, curator at the Museum of the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and assistant director of the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa.         When Ms. Gatling retired, the Heckscher honored her with an exhibition, ''The Art of the Director: Eva Gatling's 15 Years at the Heckscher Museum.'' In 1996, another exhibition, ''A Founding Director's Legacy,'' was a tribute to her.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Pat Hearn, one of the leading art dealers of the last two decades, a founder of the Gramercy International Art Fair and a pioneer of the art scene in the East Village, SoHo and Chelsea, died on Friday at her vacation home in Provincetown, Mass. She was 45 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, Colin de Land.         In her 17 years as a dealer, Ms. Hearn was widely respected as unusually empathetic to artists, open to new art and willing to share artists and ideas with other dealers. When her cancer was first diagnosed and it seemed that her insurance company would not cover her treatment (although it eventually paid for some of it), her friends organized a benefit to which hundreds of artists and dealers donated work and money.         Her gallery was in some ways a continually evolving artwork in which everything, from the 1950's-ish cursive letterhead to the furniture and design of her different spaces, expressed a distinct personality and sensibility. Yet none of this competed with the art on view, which reflected an eclectic mix of artistic generations and media -- painting, Conceptual Art and video art -- and a viewpoint that evolved from somewhat kitschy neo-pop to neo-geo to an ecumenical feminism.         The artists to whom Ms. Hearn gave first shows, or first New York shows, included the painters Philip Taffee, Milan Kunc, Peter Schuyff, Jutta Koether, Monique Prieto and, most recently, Jeff Elrod, and the Conceptualists Susan Hiller, Renee Green, Lincoln Tobier and Simon Leung. She showed artists she knew from her school days in Boston, including the painter George Condo, the installation artist Jack Pierson and the photographer Mark Morrisroe, and fostered the careers of such older artists as the painter Mary Heilmann, the video artist Joan Jonas and the Conceptualist Lutz Bacher. She was especially proud that she was able to mount posthumous shows of the work of Eva Hesse and Ana Mendieta.         Behind all this was a very complex woman, at once sophisticated and wholesome, stringent in her taste, yet extremely generous. Slim, dark-haired and usually dressed in a stylish mixture of designer and vintage clothes, Ms. Hearn resembled a bohemian Holly Golightly. In the early years she was usually trailed around her gallery by a nervous, adoring Chihuahua named Chi-Chi. She liked to give Easter Sunday parties and in the late 90's she held an annual Christmas party, complete with decorated tree, in her Chelsea gallery.         Ms. Hearn was born in Providence, R.I.. She studied painting and video at the Boston Museum School, sang with a band called Wild and Wonderful, and had a brief encounter with performance art before becoming an art dealer. She spent a year in Paris on a travel grant from the museum school in 1981, and while working at an alternative space called Usine Pali Kao began to realize that she was more interested in other artists' work than in her own. She returned to Boston, and while living on unemployment insurance, started a performance space in her home -- a ground-floor room in the Hemenway Hotel -- that she and her friends called the Poly Cow. A few months later she left for New York and a few months after that, in November of 1983, she opened her first gallery.         In terms of location, Ms. Hearn tended to be the first art dealer on the block. When most East village galleries were situated between First Avenue and Avenue A, she opened on Avenue B and Sixth Street and then expanded to a big SoHo-style space with polished wood floors on Ninth Street near Avenue D. In 1988 she moved to the relatively gallery-free southwest corner of SoHo, on Wooster Street near Grand, which soon teemed with new, experimental galleries. And in 1995, hers was one of three galleries to open on a deserted stretch of West 22nd Street in the wilds of west Chelsea on the same snowy February night. The other two were the Matthew Mark Gallery and the Morris-Healy Gallery, and the joint opening signaled a radical reshuffling of the downtown art scene that would eventually bring nearly 150 new galleries to Chelsea.         The year before, Ms. Hearn, Mr. Marks and Paul Morris of Morris-Healy had begun to explore the idea of a New York art fair for younger dealers. The result was the Gramercy International, a lively, live-in fair that took place at the Gramercy Hotel on Lexington Avenue and 21st Street for five years before graduating to larger spaces. The 2001 Gramercy International will be held on Pier 90 and will include 160 participants, nearly double the number of last year's fair at the Javits Center.         Ms. Hearn's first marriage ended in divorce. She and Mr. de Land, whose SoHo gallery, American Fine Arts, is as much an art piece as her own, were married last year after almost 10 years together.         In addition to Mr. de Land, Ms. Hearn is survived by her mother, Alice Darcy Hearn of Cranston, R.I.; two sisters, Marie, of Providence, and Marion, of Warren, R.I.; and two brothers, John, of Providence, and William J., of Cranston.       
         Lena Cymbrowitz, a first-term state assemblywoman from Brooklyn, died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 43.         Her family said she had been ill for a long time, but gave no details.         Ms. Cymbrowitz, a Democrat, represented the 45th District, which includes Sheepshead Bay, Manhattan Beach, Gerritsen Beach and parts of Flatbush, Midwood and Brighton Beach.         A member of the committees on agriculture, children and families, health, insurance, and social services, she was an advocate of allocating more state money to provide mammographies for detection of  breast cancer in women.         She is survived by her husband, Steven; a son, Jay; and a daughter, Jennifer.       
         Renee Orin, an actress and singer known for her roles in Broadway musicals, died on Sunday in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 73 and lived in Los Angeles.         She had lymphoma, said her husband, Albert Hague, a Tony-winning composer of Broadway musicals.         Ms. Orin made her Broadway debut in the 1955 musical ''Plain and Fancy,'' which her husband composed. Her Broadway credits also  include ''Finian's Rainbow.''         She was called ''a singer with a lovely voice and a charming, ingratiating personality,'' by the jazz critic John S. Wilson in a 1976 review in The New York Times of a program of songs sung by her and her husband at the Ballroom nightclub.         Born in Slatington, Pa., she received a bachelor's degree in drama from Carnegie Tech.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Janet Hague of Portland, Ore., and a son, Andrew Hague of Manhattan.       
         Annie Devine, a no-nonsense Mississippi trailblazer for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, died on Aug. 22 at a hospital in Ridgeland, Miss. She was 88 and lived in nearby Canton.         Mrs. Devine, a soft-spoken woman with a ready smile, became deeply involved in the civil rights movement of the early 1960's. She helped organize voter registration drives in Canton and surrounding Madison County, where fewer than 100 of the county's estimated 10,000 black adults were registered.         At the time, blacks in the Deep South were kept from the ballot boxes by legal chicanery and worse; in Mississippi 94 percent of black adults were not registered. Thanks largely to Mrs. Devine, blacks began to show up at the county courthouse almost daily, demanding to register.         She attended the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City along with Victoria Gray-Adams and Fannie Lou Hamer. Their objective was to unseat their state's all-white delegation and be recognized as delegates of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, of which Mrs. Devine was a founder.         After that failed, the three sought to run for the House of Representatives, but were shunned by the white party establishment and blocked from running as independents. When the new Congress was sworn in January 1965, the three women, backed by hundreds of protesters, demanded that the House deny membership to Mississippi's representatives-elect because blacks had consistently been prevented from registering and voting in the state. Their effort, called the Mississippi Challenge, failed in the short run, but led to a nationwide lobbying drive by the Mississippi Freedom Democrats and calls for Congressional investigations into voting in Mississippi. Thus, the three women's resolve fed into the groundswell that produced the Voting Rights Act of 1965.         Annie Devine was born in Mobile, Ala., and reared in Canton. She graduated from Tougaloo Southern Christian College, now Tougaloo College, and taught in the public schools. She was an executive for a life-insurance company before she threw her energies into the civil rights struggle.         In the 1960's she also helped found the Child Development Group of Mississippi. Under its aegis she was a longtime volunteer in the Head Start program, involving parents and marshaling community support.         Mrs. Devine's husband, Andrew, died in 1973. She is survived by two daughters, Monette Watts of Harvest, Ala., and Barbara Russell of Canton; a son, Andrew, of Omaha; a brother, Garfield Heath of Detroit; 8 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Sophie Davis, a successful businesswoman whose backing helped create the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education at the City College of New York, died on Saturday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 74.         The cause was breast cancer, her son Alan said.         Mrs. Davis helped her husband. Leonard, found the Colonial Penn Group of insurance companies, and they gave millions of dollars to art, dance, music and Jewish philanthropic causes, including the Holocaust Museum in Washington.         But one project in which she took the most pride was the medical program at City College, which helps place economically disadvantaged students into medicine with the understanding that they will practice for at least two years in low-income communities.         Students in the seven-year accelerated medical degree program take three years of undergraduate work at City College, two years of medical training at Sophie Davis and their final two years at one of six cooperating medical schools, including New York University and SUNY/Downstate. The graduates are known as ''Sophies.''         The Davises' first gift, $1.2 million, to the school, which began as an experimental program, was given anonymously in 1972. Five years later, Mrs. Davis agreed to have her name attached to the school.         When the school gave her an honorary degree at that time, she brought a phalanx of friends and relatives to the ceremony to see her in her academic cap and gown; she had dropped out of City College to get married.         Mrs. Davis was born in 1926 in the Bronx to Isadore and Esther Kesten, immigrants from Minsk, Russia. After skipping a grade in high school, she attended City College at night; there she studied accounting and met Leonard Davis, whom she married in 1945. He survives her.         In addition to her husband and her son Alan, of San Francisco, Mrs. Davis is survived by another son, Michael, of Belvedere, Calif., and four grandchildren.         While Mr. Davis worked as an accountant and later in the insurance business, Mrs. Davis worked at his side, organizing the office, handling the bookkeeping and serving as his sounding board. She was also a director of the Colonial Penn Group, which they founded in 1963, until they sold it in 1984.         ''I always discussed everything with her,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We made the decisions jointly, based on which one of us felt the strongest. Sometimes we had to figure out which of us that was.''         He said that the company avoided borrowing money, for example, because Mrs. Davis violently opposed it.         But he prevailed on the issue of buying a magazine that later merged with Modern Maturity, the magazine of the AARP, which he helped found. ''She was opposed, and she got the other senior members of my staff to oppose it, too,'' Mr. Davis recalled. ''But I felt very strongly about it, so we bought it.''         The Sophie Davis medical school was one of many projects the couple supported at City College. They also provided funds for a performing arts center, Aaron Davis Hall, named after Mr. Davis's father. Mrs. Davis helped choose some of the resident performers, and she and her husband often entertained them after performances.         As the Davises began to spend more and more time in Palm Beach (although they kept their Fifth Avenue apartment), they played a similar role as impresarios, establishing the Regional Arts Foundation, with Mrs. Davis as president, in the early 1970's. The foundation brought performers like Isaac Stern, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the New York City Ballet to southern Florida, then considered by some a cultural wasteland.         ''She felt a responsibility to bring music and dance to this area,'' said Judith Mitchell, chief executive of the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts in West Palm Beach, which took over the performance series in 1994.         The Davises also became involved with the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach. Mrs. Davis served as a trustee and spearheaded the drive to build a new wing.         But even from Florida, she kept in touch with the medical school named after her. She and her husband gave the school another $2 million for an endowed scholarship fund in their names. And last year, when she attended the graduation ceremony, the students stood up and started chanting her name: ''Sophie! Sophie! Sophie!''       
         Dawn Langley Simmons, an author whose tumultuous life included a sex change operation and an interracial marriage that scandalized her adopted hometown, Charleston, S.C., died on Sept. 18 at her daughter's home there. She was 77.         Mrs. Simmons, who was the adopted child of the English actress Margaret Rutherford, had Parkinson's disease, said her daughter, Natasha.         Mrs. Simmons was the author of more than 20 books, including novels, biographies, and books for her children. Several of her books understandably touched on her life experiences, given a journey that started on an English estate, touched down on an Indian reservation and stirred deep turmoil in civil-rights-era Charleston.         Jack Hitt, a journalist who grew up in Charleston across the street from Mrs. Simmons and wrote about her for GQ magazine, remembered her as a figure with a piercing stare, a pillbox hat and ''a Dippity-Do hairstyle -- a dowdy doppelganger of Jackie Kennedy.''         Mrs. Simmons was a person around whom legends swirled, Mr. Hitt said. She lived in a grand house filled with antiques and with a hidden garden. She was said to have had a coming-out party for two of her dogs, who were displayed on velvet cushions in the living room, dressed in chenille, long gloves and pearls.         Mrs. Simmons was named Gordon Langley Hall when she was born, at Sissinghurst, the estate of the writer Vita Sackville-West, in Heathfield, Sussex, England. Gordon was the illegitimate child of Jack Copper, Sackville-West's chauffeur (a grandfather was Rudyard Kipling's gardener) and Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, who came, Mrs. Simmons always said, from a high social class.         Mrs. Simmons said she was born with an adrenal abnormality that causes the female genitalia to resemble a man's and was thus raised as a boy. She always maintained that she was -- unequivocally -- female.         As a boy, young Gordon played with Sackville-West's son, Nigel Nicolson. Mr. Nicolson remembered Gordon in a telephone conversation from England last Friday. ''We called him 'Dinky,' and I always think of him that way,'' he said, adding that young Gordon always looked like a boy.         At Sissinghurst, the young Gordon met Virginia Woolf, Ms. Sackville-West's lover and the author of ''Orlando,'' a novel about a boy who changes into a beautiful woman. ''Had she lived a little longer, Vita would have been intrigued to know that the child 'Dinky,' as she called me, would become a real-life Orlando,'' Mrs. Simmons wrote in her memoir, ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend,''(1995, Wyrick & Company).         In his late teens, Mr. Hall emigrated to Ontario, where he worked as a missionary, teacher and midwife among the Ojibwa Indians, according to his book about his experiences, ''Me Papoose Sitter'' (Crowell, 1955). He became an editor for The Winnipeg Free Press, and from 1953 to 1956 was society editor of The Nevada Daily Mail in Missouri. Mr. Nicolson said he was ''a very good journalist.''         He also wrote books about Princess Margaret, Jacqueline Kennedy and American Evangelism. According to the reference work ''Contemporary Authors,'' a critic named W. H. Archer praised Mr. Hall's ''Rose for Mrs. Lincoln: A Biography of Mary Todd Lincoln'' (Beacon Press, 1970), calling it ''scrupulously researched'' and written in ''a charmingly premeditated style.''         In New York in his 20's, Mr. Hall met Margaret Rutherford, who became enchanted with him and, with her husband, Stringer Davis, adopted him.         In that period Mr. Hall also befriended the painter Isabel Whitney, who left him $2 million at her death in 1962, he said. Around that time, he moved to Charleston, settling into a faded 1840 house on Society Street in the Ansonborough section, which had a large gay population. He became friendly with Charleston's grandes dames, restored his house and filled it with Chippendale furniture, mirrors said to belong to George Washington, and bed steps said to have been owned by Robert E. Lee.         In 1968 he underwent a sex change operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and became Dawn Pepita Langley Hall.         The following year Dawn Hall married her 22-year-old black butler, John-Paul Simmons. The publisher of ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' was quoted as calling it the first documented interracial marriage in Charleston's history. A bomb threat forced the couple to move the wedding from a Baptist church to the bride's home, and the gifts were destroyed by a firebomb.         In England, Miss Rutherford was reported to have said, ''I am delighted that Gordon has become a woman, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of another race, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of a lower station, but I understand the man is a Baptist!''         Soon, Mrs. Simmons appeared to be pregnant. Then in 1972, she began strolling with a baby carriage bearing a little girl whom she called Natasha.         That was the final straw for many people in Charleston. Mrs. Simmons claimed that a white man broke into her house wearing a ski mask and beat her, breaking her nose and foot and necessitating hospitalization.         She also said that her husband beat her. In 1974, after a period of turbulence in which she accused her husband of selling her belongings to buy whisky, the family moved to Catskill, N.Y. Some time later, Mr. Simmons was confined to a mental institution near Albany. His daughter says he is now an outpatient.         Mrs. Simmons spent most of her later years in Hudson, N.Y., where she was an active member of a local Episcopal church and a leader of its youth group. She continued to support her husband and daughter on her meager earnings as a writer.         Her daughter said she would prefer not to discuss her mother's past. ''I would like her to be remembered as the grandmother that she was, as a family woman,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''She was devoted to my children.''         In addition to her husband and daughter, Mrs. Simmons is survived by three grandchildren.         After she published ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' in 1995, her childhood friend, Mr. Nicolson, reminisced about her in The Spectator. ''I have maligned her in the past, mocked her strange fate and refused to meet her,'' he wrote.         ''She had asked me for help in arranging an English marriage,'' he wrote, ''and when she called on me, I hid.'' On a trip to Charleston, he avoided meeting her, but saw her on television. ''I saw on the wall behind her photographs of my mother,'' he continued. ''For the first time I was touched.''         But ''there is not a word of reproach for me in her book,'' Mr. Nicolson marveled. ''Like everything else about Dinky, it is gallant, resilient and unfailingly generous.''       
         Tatiana Riabouchinska, an international ballet star who was the model for the dancing hippopotamus in the 1940 film ''Fantasia'' and the oldest of the three ''baby ballerinas'' who brought fame to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the 1930's, died on Aug. 24 in Los Angeles. She was 83 and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Riabouchinska began her ballet career at 14 and continued performing into the early 1950's, dancing most notably with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1932 to 1942 in works by George Balanchine, Leonide Massine and David Lichine, whom she married in 1943. She was celebrated for the joyousness and warmth of her dancing and for her musicality and lightness. Her jumps were high and soft, her footwork quick and her arms exceptionally beautiful.         ''Because the impetus is exactly right, she strikes you as dancing her whole number on an impulse, spontaneously for the joy of it,'' the critic Edwin Denby wrote of her.         Born in Moscow, Ms. Riabouchinska was put under house arrest early in the Russian Revolution along with her father, who was a banker for the czar, and her mother and three siblings. But their servants helped the mother and four children escape and they fled to France, eventually settling in Paris. There Ms. Riabouchinska studied with Russian teachers, including Mathilde Kschessinska, who had been a prima ballerina at the Mariinsky Ballet and the mistress of the czar.         Ms. Riabouchinska was spotted by Balanchine while dancing in a Schiaparelli costume in the Chauve Souris, a fashionable Paris revue. He signed her to the Ballet Russe, which she joined at 15, becoming the oldest of the three dancers who were known as the baby ballerinas. The others, Tamara Toumanova and Irina Baronova, were 13.         At the Ballet Russe, Ms. Riabouchinska created roles in dances including ''Jeux d'Enfants'' and ''Les Presages,'' both by Massine; in ''La Concurrence'' and ''Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,'' by Balanchine; and in Lichine's charming ''Graduation Ball,'' in which she played a student identified as the Romantic Girl. Coached by the choreographer Michel Fokine, Ms. Riabouchinska was also known for her performances in two Fokine classics, ''Le Spectre de la Rose'' and ''Les Sylphides.''         Ms. Riabouchinska went on to dance with companies including Ballet Theater, Les Ballets des Champs-Elysees and the London Festival Ballet. Disney animators sketching rehearsals used her for the hippopotamus ballerina in Disney's 1940 movie ''Fantasia,'' with her husband the model for the alligator. The two were also seen dancing in silhouette in the 1946 cartoon ''Make Mine Music.''         The Lichines retired in Los Angeles in 1950, opening a school in Beverly Hills and forming the Ballet de la Ville des Anges and several other companies that failed to receive enough financial support to last long. After Lichine's death in 1972, Ms. Riabouchinska ran the school until 1998. She continued to teach ballet at another school up to her death.         She is survived by a daughter, Tania Lichine Crawford of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.         Ms. Riabouchinska, a trouper from an early age, was known for her equanimity. In comparing dancers of her day with those of today, she said,  ''We had fun, but they just have hard work.''       
         Penelope Russianoff, a psychotherapist, writer and lecturer who advised women on how to assert themselves, died on Aug. 28 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 82 and also had a home and practice in Sherman, Conn.         Dr. Russianoff maintained that women must unlearn the helplessness they learned at an early age. Helplessness, she held, can lead to serious problems like depression, overeating, battering, alcoholism, drugs and sexual dysfunction.         Marriage and male companionship are fine, she asserted, but a woman must be able to do without them. It is good for a woman to have a man's attention, she said, but self-esteem must not depend on it. She tried to show her clients how to communicate with themselves and others.         Her practice always included some celebrity clientele. It grew after the director Claudia Weill suggested to Paul Mazursky that he cast her as a therapist in his 1978 film ''An Unmarried Woman.''         Its main character, played by Jill Clayburgh, falls apart when her husband suddenly deserts her for a new life. Dr. Russianoff acted the oh-so-sincere therapist who makes her feel better about herself, using truisms that can comfort the deeply distressed.         Her appearance in the movie, filmed in her Manhattan penthouse office, drew much criticism from colleagues. It also increased her practice and earned her a book contract.         ''Why Do I Think I Am Nothing Without a Man?'' became a national best seller in 1982. A second book, ''When Am I Going to Be Happy?'' (1989) was reissued by Bantam in 1997 and remains in print.         Dr. Russianoff, whose maiden name was Pearl, was born in Baltimore. She graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1939 with honors in psychology and philosophy, and received a master's degree in clinical psychology in 1941. She received a doctorate in that discipline at Northwestern University in 1951.         She was a member of the faculty of the New School for Social Research from 1960 until the late 1990's.         Her husband, Leon Russianoff, a noted clarinetist and teacher, died in 1990. She is survived by a daughter, Sylvia Linguiti of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.         Dr. Russianoff ran workshops on performers' phobias and treated many sufferers of stage fright. After her debut on camera, she was much in demand on talk shows and as a speaker at forums on women's problems.         Of the movie, she said, ''It was great fun, especially because I could change the lines.''         The lines in the original script by Mr. Mazursky, she said, ''were not things therapists would say.''       
         Lucille Fletcher, who transfixed a national audience with her radio drama ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' on CBS's ''Suspense'' in 1943, died on Thursday in Langhorne, Pa. She was 88 and lived in Oxford, Md.         Besides her radio plays, Miss Fletcher was the author of novels, stage plays and screenplays, but she was best known for ''Sorry, Wrong Number,'' a 22-minute thriller first broadcast on May 25, 1943.         It concerns Leona Stevenson, a bedridden neurotic who, thanks to a crossed telephone wire, overhears two men plotting a woman's murder. After making fruitless calls to the police, she discovers that the intended victim is herself.         The drama, starring Agnes Moorehead in a virtual monologue with sound effects, proved so popular that it was broadcast nationally seven times from 1943 to 1948 and was ultimately translated into 15 languages, including Zulu.         In 1948 Miss Fletcher adapted it for a film that starred Barbara Stanwyck, whose performance earned an Academy Award nomination. ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' also won an Edgar from the Mystery Writers of America, inspired two operas and was remade for cable television in 1989 with Loni Anderson.         Miss Fletcher once described ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' as an experiment in radio sound effects. ''I grew up in an era when the radio was a wonderful medium for the imagination,'' she said. ''You could get any effect you wanted with sounds.''         Her daughter Dorothy Herrmann said Miss Fletcher got the idea for the drama after an obnoxious well-dressed woman refused to permit her to go ahead on a supermarket checkout line on Manhattan's East Side when Miss Fletcher was buying some milk or cereal for one of her children, who was sick.         ''No, you cannot,'' the woman said. ''How dare you?''         The drama, Ms. Herrmann said, was Miss Fletcher's act of revenge.         Miss Fletcher's more than 20 radio plays also included ''Hitchhiker,'' an eerie drama about a man who keeps seeing the same hitchhiker as he drives to California. Orson Welles starred as the driver, and the haunting score was written by Bernard Herrmann, Miss Fletcher's first husband, best known for his score for Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho.''         In the late 1950's Miss Fletcher began writing novels. ''Blindfold,'' in which a psychoanalyst is virtually kidnapped by the government to treat a nuclear physicist in such secrecy that he is not allowed to see his patient or hear any identifiable details of his life, was made into a 1966 film that starred Rock Hudson and Claudia Cardinale. Among Miss Fletcher's other novels were ''And Presumed Dead,'' ''The Strange Blue Yawl,'' ''The Girl in Cabin B54'' and ''Eighty Dollars to Stamford.''         In 1972 Joan Hackett and Len Cariou starred on Broadway in Miss Fletcher's ''Night Watch,'' about a New York heiress who has witnessed a murder but cannot prove it. In The New York Times the critic Clive Barnes called ''Night Watch'' a superior thriller, ''which from its first blood-curdling scream to its last charming surprise is a first-class example of its genre.'' In 1973 it was made into a film starring Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey.         Miss Fletcher, who was born in Brooklyn in 1912, wanted to be a writer from childhood. In 1933 she graduated from Vassar College, where she was a fierce, friendly competitor for literary prizes with her classmate Mary McCarthy.         Employed by CBS in the depths of the Depression, she was a typist, music librarian and publicity writer. While typing radio plays, she decided she could master the form.         In 1939 she married Mr. Herrmann. His biographer, Steven C. Smith, said that the idea for ''Hitchhiker'' came to her when the couple were traveling in their 1940 Packard convertible to Hollywood and Miss Fletcher spotted an odd-looking man  on the Brooklyn Bridge and again on the Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey. A year later, she said, ''I conceived of doing it as a ghost story.''         Miss Fletcher's marriage to Mr. Herrmann, with whom she had two daughters, ended in divorce in 1948.         In 1949 she married John Douglass  Wallop, a novelist whose ''Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant'' was adapted into the 1955 musical ''Damn Yankees.'' He died in 1985.         In 1988 William Morrow published Miss Fletcher's last novel, ''Mirror Image,'' a tale of terror and illusion.         Besides Ms. Herrmann, of New Hope, Pa., Miss Fletcher is survived by her other daughter, Wendy Harlow of Phoenix, Md.; a sister, Dr. Iris Norstrand of Brooklyn, and two grandsons.         In an interview with The Washington Post, Miss Fletcher once said: ''Writing suspense stories is like working on a puzzle. You bury the secret, lead the reader down the path, put in false leads and throughout the story remain completely logical. Each word must have meaning and be written in a fine literary style. Mysteries are a challenge, a double task for the writer, for the reader is aching to solve the puzzle before you do.''       
         Lucy A. Wicks, a psychologist who worked with people infected with H.I.V. and the founder of the Manhattan School for Children, one of the most innovative and sought-after alternative public schools in Manhattan, died Saturday at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center. She was 49.         The cause of death was breast cancer, said her husband, Daniel N. Arshack.         Dr. Wicks was the organizer and chief proponent of the school, which grew out of playground chatter with other neighborhood mothers and now enrolls about 500 children in kindergarten through eighth grade on West 93rd Street.         While there has been a long history of alternative public schools in Manhattan, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the city, most were founded by groups of teachers, administrators or civic groups. The Manhattan School is one of a tiny group of schools founded by parents, and Dr.  Wicks was widely recognized as zealous, canny and willing to pull strings to make the school possible.         The school, founded in 1992, was born in part out of frustration. As Dr.  Wicks's children approached school age, she visited her neighborhood school, at the time suffering from low test scores, demoralized teachers and leaky walls. The principal told her that as a parent, she should not expect to play a role in improving the school, her husband recalled. ''To Lucy, that simply wasn't acceptable,'' Mr. Arshack said.         The school Dr. Wicks conceived was small and intimate, with only two classes per grade. It now attracts dozens of applicants for each vacancy. Unlike many other public and private schools, it invites parents to share in every aspect of the school day, from leading reading groups to cleaning up after lunch to  simply sitting and watching.         In 1996, Dr. Wicks won a seat on the local school board. She was director of the H.I.V. Mental Health Clinic of Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital.         Ms. Wicks was born in Manhattan and grew up in Franklin Lakes, N.J. She graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio. She worked as an artist, making tapestries, quilts and oil paintings, before earning her doctorate in clinical psychology at the New School in Manhattan. She was a student of the Sufi branch of Islam.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her children, Adam, 12, and Eliza, 10; her father, Zeno W. Wicks of Louisville, Ky.; three brothers, Zeno Wicks of Brookings, S.D., David Wicks of Louisville and Douglas Wicks of Pittsburgh; and two sisters, Kayo Wicks of Louisville and Robin Wicks of Mogadore, Ohio.       
         Elizabeth Gordon, the influential editor of House Beautiful magazine for more than 20 years, a missionary of taste to the American homemaker and an indefatigable supporter of Frank Lloyd Wright, died on Sept. 3 in Adamstown, Md., where she lived. She was 94.         When she took over as editor of House Beautiful in 1939, Ms. Gordon was determined to educate the American public about appropriate design and new American architecture. She devoted entire issues to topics like climate control and the emerging ranch house in California.         Her ''pace setter'' issues in the late 1940's tracked and explained important trends in design to an audience just learning how to consume. In a 1953 essay, ''The Threat to the Next America,'' she railed against cultural dictatorship and the evils of ''a self-chosen elite who are trying to tell us what we should like and how we should live,'' by which she meant the followers of International-style architecture, the curators at the Museum of Modern Art and European architects like Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier.         The article attracted the appreciative attention of Frank Lloyd Wright, who became a mentor and close friend.         Another influential essay in 1960, ''We Invite You to Enter a New Dimension: Shibui,'' extolled the principles of understated resonance and serenity in design and is credited with introducing traditional Japanese design ideas to the American public.         ''She was an amazingly influential editor, crusading for the softer side of contemporary design,'' said Louis Oliver Gropp, the recently retired editor in chief of House Beautiful. ''When she covered a topic she did it in staggering depth.''         Ms. Gordon was born in Logansport, Ind., attended the University of Chicago and briefly taught high school in Wisconsin. In the 1930's she moved to New York to work as a promotional copywriter for several newspapers. She used that job as a springboard to a syndicated column on home maintenance for The New York Herald Tribune, then an editorship at Good Housekeeping, where she remained for eight years.         During the Depression, she wrote a popular how-to book, ''More House for Your Money'' (Morrow).         Ms. Gordon, who always used her maiden name professionally, married Carl Hafey Norcross, a writer and expert on aviation and planned communities, and became a pilot herself. Mr. Norcross died in 1988; Ms. Gordon is survived by a sister-in-law, Gertrude Norcross of San Diego.         At House Beautiful, Ms. Gordon, who was as famous for her large hats as for her imperious taste and insatiable curiosity, once called the magazine ''a propaganda and teaching tool.'' It took her five years of research and seven trips to Japan to prepare for the special issue on shibui. In 1988, she deposited all the materials in an archive at the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington. Some of her other collections were donated to the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York.         But it was her diatribe against the International style that proved a turning point in her career. It virtually equated the style with communism, or at least a foreign architectural invasion, and warned people not to be sure that ''it can't happen here.'' Soon after it was published, she received a mysterious telegram: ''Didn't think you had it in you. Am at your service from here on.'' It was signed only ''Godfather,'' but it came from Wright.         For the rest of the 1950's, the master architect and the determined editor worked closely together. When Wright designed one of his famous Usonian houses for a retrospective exhibition, the editors of House Beautiful furnished it. She called her office ''an extension of Taliesin,'' and allowed Wright to install an apprentice architect from Taliesin as the magazine's architecture editor.         Ms. Gordon devoted two special issues to Wright, keeping the aging architect in the public eye when the eyes of critics had turned elsewhere. He always referred to himself as her Godfather, and designed a bed with built-in cabinets and a jungle motif for her and her husband.         In 1964, Ms. Gordon left the magazine world, angry with the growing intimacy between editorial content and advertising demands.         In the 1970's, she and her husband retired to Maryland and a house filled with Japanese textiles and an Otto Natzler pottery collection. From there she continued to consult and lecture widely on design matters close to her heart.         In 1972, a special issue on Scandinavian design that she had published with an accompanying exhibition that traveled the country won her the insignia of a knight, first class, in the Finnish Order of the Lion. In 1987, she was made an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects. As her goddaughter Brooke Shearer Talbot said, Ms. Gordon ''wore those big pieces of metal at every opportunity.''         ''She was not afraid to stand out.''       
         Mary Shepard, the modest illustrator whose line drawings of Mary Poppins brought to life the ultimate British nanny in a series of seven books by P. L. Travers published from 1933 to 1988, died in London on Sept. 4. She was 90.         Her father was E. H. Shepard, the illustrator of ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' and ''The Wind in the Willows.'' When ''Mary Poppins'' was being readied for publication, Pamela Travers wanted him to do the pictures.         He was too busy, but, as Miss Travers wrote almost a half-century later, on a friend's mantle she saw a Christmas card that had ''a happy imperfection, a sense of wonder.'' It was done by Mary Shepard, then 23 and just out of the Slade School of Art.         Travers's editor, Peter Llewelyn Davis (in the tight British literary world he was one of the Lost Boys befriended by J. M. Barrie, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks, the parents in ''Mary Poppins,'' bore more than a passing resemblance to the Darlings of ''Peter Pan''), worried about Miss Shepard's inexperience, but their collaboration had begun.         And it was a collaboration. In an attic, Travers said, she found a wooden peg Dutch doll with painted coal-black hair, a turned-up nose and small, bright blue eyes that became the model.         That doll was later sent to the Donnell Library in Manhattan. But Miss Shepard bought a similar one to use as she drew. She wanted the nanny to stand in the fifth ballet position, with feet turned out and nearly parallel, but Travers insisted on the more comfortable fourth position, with the feet at right angles. Travers died in 1996 at the age of 96.         In the 1964 Walt Disney movie starring Julie Andrews, the time period and decor were pushed back from the 1930's of the book illustrations to a plush Edwardian era, but Ms. Andrews's costume and bearing stayed true to Miss Shepard's drawings (with her feet back to the fifth position), and Miss Shepard received a payment from the filmmakers.         Mary Eleanor Jessie Shepard was born on Christmas Day 1909. She had an idyllic Edwardian childhood and an artistic education.         In 1937 she married E. V. Knox, a friend and colleague of her father's, and outside publishing was known as Mary Knox. Her husband, who had been a widower, was the editor of Punch, the humor magazine. She was only seven years older than Knox's daughter, Penelope, who as Penelope Fitzgerald began publishing novels in her late 50's and died last spring at the age of 83. Knox died in 1971.         As they grew older, the two women became more like sisters. They lived near each other, talked every day and took care of each other, especially after Knox's death.         Miss Shepard was Auntie Mary to Fitzgerald's three children and had only one other relative, Minette Hunt, the daughter of her brother, who was killed in World War II. Her last drawings were made for a Fitzgerald grandchild, shortly after she entered the nursing home where she spent her last years. She did not know that Penelope had died.         A family memorial service was held at the Hampstead Parish Church on Sept. 14, where Miss Shepard worshiped daily as long as she was able. She was so modest that she said she did not wish to be buried with her husband in the pretty Hampstead cemetery because her name would add clutter to his stone.         Instead, the Fitzgerald children, Maria Fitzgerald, Tina Dooley and Balphy Fitzgerald, have arranged that twin stones be placed next to Knox's. They will be side by side above the cremated remains of Penelope and Mary, one showing a hand with a pen, the other, a hand with a paintbrush.       
         Jean Peters, a 20th Century Fox contract player whose unpretentious beauty earned her leading roles in some of the top films of the late 1940's and early 50's before she abandoned her career and practically disappeared from view after a secretive marriage to the billionaire Howard Hughes, died on Oct. 13 at her home in Carlsbad, Calif. She was 73.         The cause was leukemia, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Peters, who was known as  Pete during her acting years, was a lead actress from the moment she arrived in Hollywood at the age of 21 after winning a Miss Ohio State beauty contest whose prizes included a Fox screen test.         The studio quickly offered her a seven-year contract. Within months of being driven cross-country by her widowed mother, the owner of a tourist camp outside their hometown, Canton, Ms. Peters was chosen as the female lead in the lavish epic ''Captain from Castille,'' opposite Tyrone Power.         Though never considered one of Hollywood's great actresses, the green-eyed, fresh-faced Ms. Peters had a straightforward naturalness on camera that made her a favorite leading lady of some of the top stars of the period.         She appeared with Ray Milland in the baseball comedy ''It Happens Every Spring'' (1949), and with Marlon Brando in Elia Kazan's ''Viva Zapata!'' (1952), Richard Widmark in Sam Fuller's ''Pickup on South Street'' (1953), Joseph Cotten and Marilyn Monroe in ''Niagara'' (1953), Spencer Tracy in ''Broken Lance'' (1954), Burt Lancaster in ''Apache'' (1954) and, perhaps most memorably, as one of three American women in Rome in Jean Negulesco's ''Three Coins in the Fountain'' (1954).         Many remarked at the time on Ms. Peters's informal off-camera style,  avoiding Hollywood night life and the networking scene in the studio commissary for private picnics with her hairdresser and makeup artist on the floor of a dark set.         She was most often seen without makeup and wearing jeans and simple shirts. She lived in a rented bungalow decorated with watercolors she had painted herself. The studio publicity machine painted her as an Ohio farm girl and a bit of a tomboy baseball fan, an image that was difficult to reconcile with the sculptured beauty who appeared on the screen.         ''Back home, I still have 3 dogs, 18 cats, a goat named Josephine and a lamb called Ali Baba,'' she told an interviewer in 1948.         To another, in 1949, she remarked: ''I don't like servants or big houses, and I'd hate to waste my time playing bridge in the afternoons. I think women need to cook and sew.''         Shortly after arriving in Hollywood, Ms. Peters met and began a quiet relationship with the reclusive Hughes -- also famous for his ostentatiously unpretentious wardrobe -- and for a decade the couple dated, usually getting together once a week, often to watch movies until late into the evening in one of Hughes's screening rooms. Among his holdings at the time were RKO Studios, Trans World Airlines, Hughes Aircraft and the Hughes Tool Company.         She was rarely seen in public and never in the company of another man, though Hughes was often seen on the town with some of the top actresses of the day. Because of the long nature of their relationship, there were frequent rumors that the couple had secretly wed.         For a few months, in 1954, Ms. Peters was married to Stanley W. Cramer 3rd, a Texas oil executive, but it ended in divorce and, like all of her marriages, without children. It was in 1957 that another rumor arose of a secret wedding between Hughes and Ms. Peters. This time it was true. The couple had married in a private ceremony in Tonapah, Nev.         Ms. Peters, whose final movie was ''A Man Called Peter'' (1955), retired from film acting and was rarely seen in public during the 13 years she remained married to Hughes. Neither granted interviews.         Over the years, Ms. Peters established herself in a remote, hilltop mansion in Bel Air while her husband, growing ever more reclusive and secretive, adjourned to the penthouses above a Las Vegas casino where he passed most of the last decades of his life.         They would still get together once a week or so, usually watching movies in Hughes's sanctuary.         An acquaintance, D. L. Lyons, a writer for The Ladies' Home Journal, described Ms. Peters's cloistered life in the late 1960's when he tried to visit her. ''At that time, in 1968, very much married to Howard, she lived in splendid solitude on Bel Air Road, atop a peak of the Santa Monica Mountains, under 24-hour surveillance of guards who followed her everywhere,'' he wrote.         By 1970, with her marriage disintegrating, Ms. Peters moved to a smaller house in Beverly Hills, let the guards go and even began to appear in public, attending movie screenings and going to restaurants.         Shortly after her divorce became final in 1971 she was married for a third time, to Stanley Hough, vice president and director for production operations at 20th Century Fox. Mr. Hough died in 1996, and Ms. Peters  moved to be closer to her sister in Carlsbad, a suburb of San Diego.         According to reports at the time of her divorce from Hughes, Ms. Peters had agreed as part of the settlement not to discuss their private life together and not to return to movies, at least as long as the billionaire was alive.         In 1976, though, shortly after his death, Ms. Peters made her first screen appearances in two decades, playing roles in a television mini-series, ''Arthur Hailey's The Moneychangers,'' and in a public television production of ''Winesburg, Ohio.''         In 1981 she had a role in another television film, ''Peter and Paul.''  After that, she made only rare guest appearances on television series like ''Murder, She Wrote.''         A friend, Arlen Hurwitz, once recalled how Ms. Peters reacted to the attention of fans during the height of her career in the late 1940's. ''Whenever fans stop Jean on our wanderings, she has her own patented way of handling them,'' Ms. Hurwitz said.         ''They say, 'Are you Jean Peters?' and she frowns and asks in a puzzled voice, 'Who is Jean Peters?' It always works. They go off looking bewildered and we go on about our business.''       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later served as editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.         Ms. Fanning died of colon cancer at her Boston home, where she lived with her husband and was writing a book about her years in Alaska. She was regarded as a pioneering figure in the world of journalism, especially because she was working at a time when few women held positions of power within the industry.         Under her ownership, the Daily News fought its way up from a circulation of 12,000 to 50,000, becoming Alaska's largest newspaper. Along the way, it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for a 15-part series on the powerful Teamsters union in Alaska.         The newspaper also took controversial liberal stands on gun control, environmental issues and the land rights of Alaskan natives, earning it the enmity of the business establishment.         Nothing in Ms. Fanning's childhood and early married life hinted that she would, at nearly age 40, reinvent herself as a risk-taking journalist.         She was born on Oct. 18, 1927, in Joliet, Ill. The only child of a bank president, she went to private schools, made her debut at a tea dance in 1945 and graduated from Smith College in 1949. That year, she met Marshall Field IV, a multimillionaire whose family owned a department store chain and published The Chicago Sun-Times.         She once credited that marriage as her introduction and informal education in the world of journalism, but never considered working in the field until much later. While her husband ran the business, she volunteered at various charities. Society columnists dubbed her ''the Grace Kelly of Chicago.''         But in 1963, Ms. Fanning and her husband divorced because of what she later called her discontent with the high-society lifestyle. She joined the Christian Science church. Then in 1965, she piled her three children into a Buick station wagon and drove north on the Alaska Highway.         ''After the divorce, my life was on a downhill slide,'' she told a writer for Town & Country in 1986. ''I needed to grab onto something solid and permanent.''         She found that in the rugged land of Alaska.         At the end of their road trip, the family settled in Anchorage. The Daily News, an eight-page tabloid that was then overshadowed by The Anchorage Times, hired Ms. Fanning to organize its library for $2 an hour. She quickly moved up through the ranks to become a reporter whose byline appeared frequently on the front page. She once credited Alaska with fostering the kind of opportunities that anyone with willpower and an entrepreneurial spirit could take advantage of.         In 1966, she married Larry Fanning, who had worked as editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He had gone to Alaska to help Ms. Fanning sell her house but became enamored with the state. Against the advice of several friends, the two bought the Daily News in 1967. The newspaper began running investigative stories that riled the corporate establishment. Many businesses refused to advertise in the newspaper.         Mr. Fanning died at his desk of a heart attack in 1971. His wife became the sole editor and publisher, and persisted in keeping up the newspaper's crusading efforts. Under her tenure, and with large infusions of money from Ted Field, Ms. Fanning's son from her first marriage, the newspaper continued to thrive. It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.         In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor. She married her third husband, Amos Mathews, around the same time. During her five years at The Monitor, she was credited with building up the publication's news coverage. But in 1988, she and two other top editors resigned over budget cuts imposed by the church.         After she left The Monitor, Ms. Fanning spent a year at the Institute of Politics at Harvard. She then taught classes as an adjunct professor at Boston University until 1993.         While living in Boston, Ms. Fanning also held influential positions at several news organizations. She became the first woman president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and she joined the board of directors of The Boston Globe Newspaper Company in 1992. From 1988 to 1989, she sat on the board of directors of The Associated Press. She also served on the board of several charitable foundations.         In her final years, she began work on a memoir about her work in Alaska. She never really left the state that she loved -- she and her husband kept a home in Anchorage where they lived for four months each year. The two also traveled extensively, taking trips to Syria, Jordan, Russia and Malaysia.         Ms. Fanning is survived by her husband and three children: Mr. Field of Los Angeles, Katherine Stephen of Washington, D.C., and Barbara Field of Boston.       
         Jacquelyn Reinach, a writer, composer, television producer and co-creator of the ''Sweet Pickles'' series of children's books, which featured characters like Accusing Alligator and Smarty Stork, died on Sept. 30 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 70.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son Barron. A former smoker, she had produced anti-tobacco programs for the American Cancer Society and other groups.         Although Ms. Reinach wrote more than 50 books and 600 songs, several musical shows and educational productions and contributed to Shari Lewis's television series ''Lamb Chop Play Along'' on PBS, she was best known for the ''Sweet Pickles'' books first published in 1976.         The series, which she created with Richard Hefter, a writer and illustrator, and Ruth Lerner Perle, based on a menagerie of alphabetical animals with gentle foibles, sold more than 50 million copies. It also secured her a substantial fortune as the books and marketing tie-ins went on to generate more than $200 million in worldwide sales. The books, which went out of print in the mid-1990's, are now traded regularly on eBay and may be revived under a new publishing contract, Mr. Hefter said.         Mr. Hefter said the phenomenon began with the notion of ''a peer group with no authority figures.''         ''There'd be no parents, no family, just alphabetic characters equally divided between male and female,'' he said. ''Because Jackie was a psychologist by training, each character was given a specific personality trait.''         ''The behaviors were never corrected,'' he added. ''Goof-Off Goose always goofs off, and others learn to accept it. Accusing Alligator learns a lesson but remains the same. They're all lovable in their foibles, and none are menacing.''         Ms. Reinach came up with the series title to suggest that life's problems were resolvable pickles, Mr. Hefter said. ''Holt, Reinhart hated the name, so we kept it,'' he said. The publisher sold 10 million copies, and the Weekly Reader Book Club, owned by Xerox, sold 40 million more.         The first 26 books used characters going through the alphabet -- Bashful Bear, Clever Camel, all the way to Zany Zebra -- but when a demanding public clamored for more, the partners made up 14 new stories with the same cast.         Jacquelyn Krasne Reinach was born in Omaha, grew up in Beverly Hills and graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of California at Los Angeles before moving to New York. She wrote scripts for the Fran Allison ''Learn at Home'' television series and worked with Shari Lewis on a series of ''Headstart'' books for McGraw-Hill. She won an Emmy in 1993 for a young people's anti-smoking program, ''Know the Facts: Keep Your Power,'' and wrote and produced a traveling school program for the American Heart Association.         In 1966 she was the organizing force behind an effort by Upper East Side parents to occupy their restless sons on weekends. Called Operation Saturday, it shuttled the boys from sports fields to airport freight hangars and magazine photo labs.         Among her 600 songs was ''Liberation, Now!'' which became the feminist anthem of the Women's Strike for Peace in 1970. (That year she also wrote a 300-recipe feminist cookbook: ''How to Enjoy the Leisure Life in a Beach House, Mountain Cabin, Lake Shack, Ski Chalet, Trailer, Country Home or City Apartment.'') Another song, ''The Family,'' became the theme of the United Nations' Year of the Family in 1994.         Her shows included ''Love Is Spoken Here,'' written with Stanley Ralph Ross and staged at the Maine State Music Theater.         Ms. Reinach's first three marriages ended in divorce. In addition to her son Barron, of Manhattan, she is survived by her fourth husband, Dion Neutra, an architect and the son and partner of the modernist architect Richard Neutra, whom she married this year; another son, Alan, of Fillmore, Calif.; a brother, Donald Krasne of Beverly Hills; and her mother, Dorothy Krasne of Los Angeles.         In her final months Ms. Reinach kept up a busy schedule and signed a contract to publish three new children's books. ''She had 25 years of things to do,'' said her son Barron. The first new book is to be published this spring: ''Mr. Raccoon, Where's Your Spoon?''       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later was editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.

         Sybil H. Milton, a leading scholar of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust and a senior historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, died on Oct. 16 in the clinical center of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. She was 59.         Dr. Milton, who lived in Chevy Chase, Md., died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said her husband, Henry Friedlander, a professor of history at the City University of New York and president of the German Studies Association.         She taught German history at Stanford University and elsewhere before becoming director of archives at the Leo Baeck Institute in New York from 1974 to 1984. Afterward, she was a consultant to the Holocaust Memorial Council.         At the time of her death, Dr. Milton was vice president of the Swiss-appointed Independent Commission of Experts, which was investigating Swiss policies toward Jews and Nazis during the Holocaust.         Last December, the commission issued a report condemning Switzerland's restrictive policies toward Jewish immigration during the war years when European Jews were seeking refuge from Nazi genocide.         Dr. Milton, who represented the United States on the commission, studied Swiss banks and the Nazi handling of Jewish-owned assets, precious metals and works of art.         Menachem Z. Rosensaft, a member of the executive committee of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which oversees the Washington museum, and who knew of Dr. Milton through her work there, said she was a pioneer in studying the memorials and archives of the Nazi death camps throughout Europe.         During a long hospitalization, Dr. Milton continued work on her latest book, ''The Camera as Weapon and Voyeur: Photography of the Holocaust as Memorial Evidence,'' which Dr. Friedlander said he plans to complete.         Sybil Halpern was born on Oct. 6, 1941, in New York City to Jewish parents who had fled Austria when the Nazis came to power.         After graduating from the High School of Music and Art, she received a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1962, a master's the next year and a doctorate from Stanford University in modern German history in 1971.         Dr. Milton's marriage to Daniel Milton ended in divorce. She is survived by Professor Friedlander.       
         Dr. Miriam M. Salpeter, a neurobiologist whose research contributed to the understanding and treatment of neuromuscular disorders like myasthenia gravis, died on Tuesday at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, N.Y. A resident of Ithaca, she was 71.         The cause was thyroid cancer, her family said.         Dr. Salpeter was chairwoman of the department of neurobiology and behavior at Cornell University from 1982 to 1988. At her death, she was a professor in the department, a position she had held since 1973.         Dr. Salpeter specialized in electron microscopy and the study of regeneration and synapses, the minute space between nerve or muscle cells through which nerve impulses are transmitted. She wrote about 150 scientific papers and edited several books on the subject, including ''The Vertebrate Neuromuscular Junction.''         An expert in cell biology, she teamed with Dr. Lewis Bachmann, an Austrian scientist, and Dr. Edwin E. Salpeter, her husband, to invent a technique that lets scientists see individual signaling molecules and to determine their position and quantity in cells, crucial measurements.         She later applied the discovery of the technique, quantitative electron microscopic radiography, to biological questions related to synapses.  The technique shed new light on the function of the neuromuscular synapse and the disorders associated with it. One such disorder, myasthenia gravis, stems from faulty nerve conduction. It often causes serious chronic muscle weakness in the face and neck, resulting in drooping eyelids, slurred speech and double vision.         Known as Mika, she was born Mirle Mark in Riga, Latvia. Her family moved to Canada and, in 1945, on to New York, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa in psychology from Hunter College in 1950.         She received a Ph.D. in psychobiology and neuroanatomy at Cornell in 1953 and did postgraduate work in neuroanatomy and cell biology at Cornell and Case Western Reserve University.         Besides her husband, a Cornell professor emeritus, she is survived by two daughters, Judy Salpeter of Berkeley, Calif., and Dr. Shelley Salpeter of Woodside, Calif.; a sister, Naomi Lasher of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.       
         Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, the first woman in the world to serve as a prime minister, died yesterday shortly after voting in Sri Lanka's elections. She was 84.         Mrs. Bandaranaike's final act was to vote in a parliamentary election she hoped would return the family's party to power leading a governing coalition known as the People's Alliance. Her death from a heart attack on Election Day seemed poetically timed for a woman whose family business is politics and whose political career spanned four decades.         Mrs. Bandaranaike rose to power in 1960 as a bereaved wife and mother of three, just a year after her husband, Solomon, then prime minister, was assassinated by a Buddhist monk. She quickly established herself as the undisputed leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party -- founded by her husband -- and a formidable politician in her own right.         She also became the matriarch of a political dynasty. In the final years of her life, her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, succeeded her as the standard bearer of the family party and has served as president of the country since 1994. The father, mother and daughter have led Sri Lanka for 21 of the 52 years since it gained its independence from the British.         ''Mrs. Bandaranaike's legacy is this: After her husband died, there was so much confusion and the party was almost collapsing,'' said K. M. de Silva, a Sri Lankan historian. ''She was an untried leader. But she not only survived, she sustained the party and the family in politics.''         Her body was taken to her stately  home on Rosemead Place in the Cinnamon Gardens section of Colombo, the capital. State radio canceled regular programs to play elegiac music and state television looked back on her life.         She will be buried alongside her husband on Saturday in a state funeral at the family's ancestral home in Horagulla. Friday and Saturday have been declared days of national mourning. All liquor shops, bars, cinemas and slaughterhouses have been ordered to close.         ''She was a heroic mother of the nation,'' the Sri Lanka Freedom Party said in a statement.         But the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has come to stand for very different policies and values than it had in her day.         Mrs. Kumaratunga firmly repudiated her mother's brand of Sinhalese nationalism, which had inflamed ethnic tensions between the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese majority and the predominantly Hindu Tamil minority. The daughter's years in office have been dominated by her as-yet-fruitless efforts to end a 17-year-old war with separatist Tamil rebels. Mrs. Kumaratunga also steered the party toward a more open, market-oriented economy and away from the centralized, state-dominated socialism that had been her mother's trademark.         Mrs. Bandaranaike was born Sirimavo Ratwatte on April 17, 1916, into one of the island nation's wealthy feudal families, one that was at the pinnacle of Sri Lanka's social hierarchy. In 1940 -- 60 years ago today -- she married S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, the scion of an elite, feudal clan that had thrived for generations with the patronage of the British Empire.         Mr. Bandaranaike made the transition from his Anglicized, upper-class background to become a populist and a nationalist. And his wife carried forward his passions with even greater decisiveness and vigor,  historians say. She was a shrewd political leader with a wide base in the Sinhalese majority.         In a recent interview, Anura, the Bandaranaike's youngest child and only son, said their father had been the affectionate, demonstrative parent while their mother was aloof.         Mrs. Bandaranaike -- known simply as Mrs. B -- served twice as  head of state, from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1977. She nationalized many foreign and local enterprises and left Sri Lanka's economy into one that was heavily state dominated.         She also zealously pursued efforts to make Sinhalese the sole national language, a stance that deeply alienated the country's Tamil speakers. And she changed the university admissions policy to benefit the Sinhalese, disadvantaging the Tamils.         During five years of her daughter's presidency, Mrs. Bandaranaike served as prime minister, which had become a largely ceremonial role under the Constitution adopted in 1978. Increasingly feeble and unable to speak clearly, she resigned as prime minister in August, though she retained her seat in Parliament.         She lived on Rosemead Place with her elder daughter, Sunethra, a philanthropist who is 57 and never got involved in politics.         But the political family she had nurtured splintered in her later years. Her son, Anura, 51, who lives  next to his mother's home in the family compound, went over to the family's despised rival, the United National Party, after his sister, now 55, won the right to succeed their mother. But both the son, as a leader of the opposition, and the daughter, as president, have carried on the family's political tradition.       
         Sonja Bullaty, a photographer noted for lyrical composition and startling use of color and light in a vast body of work created during a five-decade collaboration with her husband, Angelo Lomeo, died on Oct. 5 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 76, and had homes in Manhattan and Bellmont, Vt.         The cause was cancer, Mr. Lomeo said.         Born in Prague into a Jewish banking family, Ms. Bullaty received her first camera at 14, a consolation gift from her father for having to abandon school and normal teenage activities as their world darkened with the approach of war.         ''I have loved the camera ever since, because it gave me joy and it gave me a life,'' she said. ''In the following difficult years I had no camera but often saw things indelibly etched on my mind. Perhaps to this day I search for some of those missing images.''         She was deported to Poland on her 18th birthday and spent the next four years in captivity, first in the Lodz Ghetto, then in the Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen concentration camps. Toward the end of the war, she escaped a death march near Dresden, which was then in flames, by hiding with a girlfriend in a haystack in the barn where the prisoners had been held for the night. Although Nazi soldiers, armed with pitchforks, were sent back to roust the women, they remained undetected, and Ms. Bullaty managed by stay alive until liberation allowed her to return to Prague.         There, she discovered that none of her family had survived.         Eventually, she sought out the well-known Czech photographer Josef Sudek and over time became what he called his ''apprentice-martyr,'' mixing chemicals for the darkroom, filing negatives and absorbing the unwritten rules of composition as she watched him print his dark, moody, almost abstract works. Master and pupil, they shared an affinity for the simplicity of windows and the mystery of reflections, and a fondness for patriotic kitsch and the seemingly banal. Ms. Bullaty wrote about her mentor in a 1978 book, ''Sudek.''         In 1947, she arrived in New York, her boat fare paid by distant relatives who found her name on a survivors' list and invited her to stay with them.         That same year, she met Mr. Lomeo when she inquired over an intercom about a darkroom in the building he managed and he went in search of the woman behind a voice he called ''the most beautiful I had ever heard.'' He offered her a gift of apples, and they became almost immediately inseparable. They married in 1951, and for five decades lived and worked together while managing to retain their individual visual perspectives. He is her only survivor.         During the next decade, the couple built a reputation photographing paintings and sculptures in museums and galleries.         They began shooting in black and white and were well into their joint career when they turned, in the early 1970's, to the vivid, saturated color now associated with them.         Critics often remarked on the painterly aspects of their compositions, on the evocations of Hopper and Magritte, of van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne and the Venetian colorists.         Together they made six books, ''Provence,'' ''Tuscany,'' ''Venice and the Veneto,'' ''Circle of Seasons: Central Park Celebrated,'' ''Vermont in All Weathers,'' and ''America America,'' published this year by Abbeville Press. Their photographs appeared in Life, Time and Audubon magazines and have been exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the International Center of Photography and George Eastman House in Rochester.         ''I want to express with it what I see, experience and feel, a world real or surreal, sad or funny, but a world uniquely my own,'' Ms. Bullaty said of the guiding force behind her work. ''Perhaps to live I needed to know there is beauty.''       
         Mireille Johnston, an author and television figure widely known for her cookbooks on French regional cuisines, died Oct. 5 at her home in Paris. She was 65.         Her death was unexpected, and the cause was not immediately clear, her family said.         Mrs. Johnston was born in France, received degrees from French and American universities, married an American in 1959 and lived for years in the United States before returning to France in 1977. She was bilingual and better known to Americans and Britons than to the French.         Her first cookbook, ''The Cuisine of the Sun'' (Biscuit Books, 1976), was applauded by the food critic Mimi Sheraton in The New York Times Book Review.         The book ''stays within the boundaries of Provence, concentrating on the author's native city, Nice,'' Ms. Sheraton wrote. ''There are wonderfully clear, complete and authentic recipes,'' she added. ''Appetizers, soups, fish and vegetable dishes are strong points in this collection, all so appetizing it was hard to read through without dashing into the kitchen to try some.''         In working on that book, Mrs. Johnston recalled last year, ''I wrote a sort of cookbook about my experiences, and I realized food was the key to so much -- a way of observing pleasures and economic trends in society.''         Her next cookbook, ''The Cuisine of the Rose'' (1982), was about classical Burgundian and Lyonnais cooking. The work was praised by other food connoisseurs, especially for its recipe for chicken with crawfish or shrimp.         Mrs. Johnston's book ''The French Family Feast'' (1988) was about home cooking and family dining traditions.         She also commented on French cuisine for American television. And she chatted with cooks and producers of food in various parts of France on two series of BBC television programs, titled ''A Cook's Tour of France,'' which were broadcast and rebroadcast in the 1990's.         She wrote two volumes, based on the series and bearing its title, about French regional cuisines and cultures. The volumes were published in the 90's -- first separately, then as a single book.         Her parents were Jean-Philippe and Marguerite Sigard Busticaccia.         From 1961 to 1968, she was an instructor in French literature, successively, at Yale, Barnard and Sarah Lawrence.         She is survived by her husband, Thomas M. C. Johnston, who is a former aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and two daughters, Margaret-Brooke Johnston-Clarke and Elizabeth Johnston, both of Paris.       
         Gwen Verdon, whose high-kicking artistry, flaming red hair and head-turning figure made her an unforgettable presence in musicals like ''Can-Can,'' ''Damn Yankees'' and ''Chicago,'' died yesterday in Woodstock, Vt. She was 75 and had homes in Bronxville, N.Y., and Quogue, N.Y.         She died at the home of her daughter, Nicole Fosse.         Widely regarded as the best dancer ever to brighten the Broadway stage, Ms. Verdon was also a performer who brought more than physical excitement to her roles. A highly capable actress as well as an exceptional dancer, she was adept at enriching the characters she played. Whether oozing seductive come-ons as the Devil's sexy troubleshooter in ''Damn Yankees'' or brooding over a whiskey as a disillusioned prostitute in a waterfront dive in ''New Girl in Town,'' a musical adaptation of  O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' she always reached for, and found, her character's heart.         The League of American Theaters and Producers said yesterday that the lights of Broadway's marquees would be dimmed in her memory at 8 p.m. last night.         Ms. Verdon's first Broadway success was explosive. In 1953 she auditioned for the Cole Porter musical ''Can-Can,'' and won a part as a featured dancer in the show, which was written and directed by Abe Burrows and had choreography by Michael Kidd. The show's star was the temperamental French actress and singer Lilo, who was not amused by the way audiences were applauding this redheaded newcomer during out-of-town tryouts and who saw to it that Ms. Verdon's part was cut back. Ms. Verdon, in turn, was disgusted enough to announce that she was quitting the show, and maybe even giving up dancing.         But on opening night on Broadway,  she delivered a fiery Apache dance that brought the audience to its feet -- and kept them there. She was already back in her dressing room for a costume change when one of the producers came pounding in to tell her that the audience was chanting her name and cheering and that she had to come back for a curtain call so that the show could continue. She took her bows, wearing a bathrobe, and knew she had arrived. Brooks Atkinson, in his review in The New York Times, cheered the ''impudence, recklessness and humor'' of her dancing and called her ''the practical star of the show.'' It was a late arrival for a dancer -- she was 28 and had been performing since the age of 3 -- but it was unforgettable.         ''Can-Can'' made Ms. Verdon a marquee name and brought her her first Tony Award. Nevertheless, she left the show before it ended its run and returned to working with the Hollywood choreographer Jack Cole, whose assistant she had been in the early 1950's. She was working on a film with Cole when she was approached by the producers of a new Broadway musical to be called ''Damn Yankees.'' Written by George Abbott and Douglass Wallop, the story centered on a Faustian deal made by a passionate baseball fan who agrees to sell his soul to the Devil for the chance to help his beloved Washington Senators beat the New York Yankees.         A Life and Career Linked to Fosse         The show had music and lyrics by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross and was to be directed by Abbott. Ms. Verdon was offered the part of Lola, the Devil's No. 1 helper. She wasn't eager to return to Broadway despite her success in ''Can-Can,'' but finally signed on. It would be her first experience with an up-and-coming choreographer named Bob Fosse, fresh from his first Broadway success with ''The Pajama Game.''         From that point on, Ms. Verdon's life and career were inextricably linked to Fosse. She was to become the living embodiment of his work on Broadway, and he in turn became her mentor, her lover and eventually her husband. Fosse soon found that working with Ms. Verdon was more of a collaboration than a tutorial. ''The happiest times I ever had with Gwen were when we were working together'' he said in an interview in 1971. ''They stimulated all sorts of things.''         For Ms. Verdon, working with Fosse provided ''direction like I've never had in my life.'' Years later, looking back on that experience, she recalled how ''Bob choreographs down to the second joint of your little finger.''         ''Damn Yankees'' opened to bravos in May 1955. Ms. Verdon's co-stars were Ray Walston as the Devil and Stephen Douglass as the hapless fan who is transformed into the home-run-hitting Joe Hardy. As Lola, Ms. Verdon brought the house down with her slinky rendition of ''Whatever Lola Wants,'' a locker-room seduction scene in which her sultry yet playful striptease for Shoeless Joe was hot enough to tempt the Devil himself. ''Damn Yankees'' racked up over a thousand performances and brought Ms. Verdon her second Tony. It was an impressive showing for a performer who spent her early childhood years laced into orthopedic boots to correct legs that had been weakened and deformed by a series of illnesses.         Gwyneth Evelyn Verdon was born on Jan. 16, 1925, in Culver City, Calif. Her parents were British expatriates. Her mother, Gertrude, had been a member of Denishawn, the influential modern dance troupe.Her father, Joseph, was an electrician at MGM. Show business was part of the household, and baby Gwyneth was pointed toward the stage from the time she could walk. When she wasn't wearing those knee-high corrective boots, she was being taught basic ballet, ballroom dancing and learning how to tap and do the old soft-shoe. At age 6, she was already performing in theaters where she was billed as ''the fastest little tapper in the world.'' By the time she graduated from high school, her career seemed well on its way.         But then, at 17, she eloped with a writer for The Hollywood Reporter, James Henaghan. The marriage lasted five years, until Mr. Henaghan's freewheeling lifestyle brought it to an end. The couple had a son, Jimmy, and after the divorce Ms. Verdon left him in the care of her parents and resumed her career.         She auditioned for Cole and was hired by the talented, ferociously  abrasive dance director. She became a member of Cole's troupe for five years and made her Broadway debut in his 1950 flop, ''Alive and Kicking.'' Cole's connections with Hollywood studios brought her work as a ''specialty dancer'' in several films, including ''On the Riviera.'' She also coached stars like Jane Russell in the art of moving sexily on screen.         When Mr. Kidd made his offer of a part in ''Can-Can,'' she was weary of anonymity, weary of Cole -- a perfectionist given to tantrums -- and ready to leave Hollywood for a second chance at success on Broadway. She wouldn't be seen on screen again until 1958, when she got star billing opposite Tab Hunter in the film adaptation of ''Damn Yankees.''         Ms. Verdon's fourth Broadway show was ''New Girl in Town,'' based on O'Neill's bleak tale about a waterfront prostitute's redemption through love. Directed by Abbott, with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill and choreography by Bob Fosse, ''New Girl in Town'' opened in May 1957 with Ms. Verdon in the title role. Brooks Atkinson called her performance ''sobering and admirable'' but found the show an uneasy blend of the antic and tragic. Nevertheless, Ms. Verdon came away with Tony No. 3, which she shared with her co-star, Thelma Ritter.         The musical that became the perfect showcase for Ms. Verdon's gifts as both dancer and actress was also the first of her shows to be both choreographed and directed by Fosse. The 1959 ''Redhead,'' which had music by Albert Hague and lyrics by Dorothy Fields had been written for the British music hall star Beatrice Lillie. But Ms. Lillie turned out to be otherwise engaged and Ms. Verdon agreed to star on the condition that Fosse be the director.         Ms. Verdon was cast as Essie Whimple, a shy worker in a London waxworks museum. It was a role in which she had ample opportunity to display her acting talent. And in the dances created for her by Fosse, she did everything from a tango to a ragtime strut, from Chaplinesque comedy to a brassy music-hall routine.She won another Tony Award, her fourth.         The following year, when ''Redhead'' was on tour in Chicago, Miss Verdon and Fosse were married, and by the time the tour reached Los Angeles she had decided to retire from show business with the intention of concentrating on family life. In 1963 their daughter, Nicole, was born. She is also survived by her son, Jimmy Henaghan of Los Angeles; four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.         Dance-Hall Hostess With Heart         It wasn't until 1966 that Ms. Verdon returned to the stage, in ''Sweet Charity.'' The musical had its unlikely roots in Fellini's film classic ''Nights of Cabiria.'' Once again, Fosse was director and choreographer. Ms. Verdon played the role immortalized by Giulietta Masina although the character had been changed from a Roman prostitute to a New York dance-hall hostess.         Even though the critics were less than ecstatic about ''Sweet Charity,'' Ms. Verdon was given numbers like ''Hey, Big Spender'' that added to her legend as a peerless performer on Broadway. The musical ran for more than 600 performances and became something of a cult favorite long after it closed. But increasing fatigue led Ms. Verdon to surrender the lead to Helen Gallagher before the show's run ended. When the 1968 Hollywood film version was being cast, Ms. Verdon lost out to the younger Shirley MacLaine.         Meanwhile, Fosse's open infidelities were disrupting their marriage, and by 1971 the couple were legally separated although they continued to work together on occasion and were never divorced.         A Chance To Play Roxie         In 1972, with her career as a dancer clearly drawing to a close, Ms. Verdon tried her hand at a thriller called ''Children! Children!'' which quickly flopped. But there was one more Broadway musical waiting in the wings and it would reunite Ms. Verdon and Fosse once again, onstage if not in marriage.         ''Chicago,'' which began life as a stage play in the 20's and then became a vehicle for Ginger Rogers in the 1942 film ''Roxie Hart,'' was a show Ms. Verdon had wanted to do for years. When Fosse decided to take it on as a musical, and John Kander and Fred Ebb signed on to write the score, Ms. Verdon at last got her chance to play Roxie, a woman jailed, tried and acquitted for shooting her lover.         When it opened in 1975, ''Chicago'' won applause for its three leads, Ms. Verdon, Chita Rivera and Jerry Orbach. Clive Barnes in The Times saluted ''three superlative, knock-em-in-the-aisles performances by three stars who glitter like gold dust all evening,'' but most of the critics found it too determinedly seedy and cynical for its own good. It proved to be Ms. Verdon's farewell to Broadway. Her successor in the role was Ann Reinking, Fosse's companion, who also restaged Fosse's choreography for the show's highly successful revival in 1996.         At Fosse's request, Ms. Verdon served as superviser of his 1978 musical, ''Dancin,' '' and also worked with him on his 1979 autobiographical film, ''All That Jazz.''         In 1983 Ms. Verdon appeared in a made-for-television movie, ''Legs,'' as the choreographer of the Rockettes. Her television appearances included ABC's daytime serial ''All My Children.''         The urge to perform also drew her back to Hollywood in the 1980's. She had a small role ''The Cotton Club'' (1984), and was part of a lauded acting ensemble in ''Cocoon'' (1985).         In 1999 she made an offstage return to Broadway as the artistic adviser for the musical ''Fosse,'' a compilation of highlights from his career. Ms. Verdon was with Fosse in 1987 when he died of a heart attack at age 60 on a Washington sidewalk, minutes after the opening of the revival of ''Sweet Charity,'' which she had helped him reconstruct. She attended to his funeral and, despite their many marital difficulties and years of separation, wholeheartedly assumed the duties of devoted widow, nourishing and helping to preserve his dance legacy, in which she had played such a vital role.         Their collaboration was relatively brief, but remarkably productive and intensely shared. Reflecting on their years together in an interview before Fosse's death, she said: ''I was a great dancer when he got hold of me, but he developed me, he created me.'' She made the most of it.         Correction:  October 24, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the Broadway dancer Gwen Verdon on Thursday misstated the title of a song in the 1966 musical ''Sweet Charity'' and misattributed the performance. The title was ''Big Spender,'' not ''Hey, Big Spender,'' and the performance was by a group of dancers, not by Ms. Verdon.       
         Julie London, whose understated voice and striking honey-blond appearance made her one of the top female vocalists of the 1950's and 60's, died yesterday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 74.         Miss London, who lived in the San Fernando Valley, suffered a stroke five years ago and was in poor health, a spokesman for Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center told The Associated Press.         She was also an actress in scores of movies and television shows, including the popular role of Nurse Dixie McCall in ''Emergency!'' in the 1970's.         Miss London went from playing bit parts in the early 1940's to starring roles and pin-up status among World War II servicemen. Then, in 1947, she married the actor Jack Webb, later famous on ''Dragnet,'' and stopped working to be a full-time wife and mother. After they divorced five years later, she became a serious singer under the tutelage of Bobby Troupe, a jazz musician and songwriter.         Her first 45 single, released in 1955, was ''Cry Me a River,'' and it was included on her first album, ''Julie Is Her Name.'' More than three million copies of the album and single were sold. She made more than 30 albums.         She was voted one of the top female vocalists of 1955, 1956 and 1957. On New Year's Eve 1959, she married Mr. Troupe, who died last year.         Adjectives such as sexy, intimate, breathy, husky and suggestive were applied to her singing. The singer herself told Life magazine in 1957: ''It's only a thimbleful of a voice, and I have to use it close to the microphone. But it is a kind of oversmoked voice and it automatically sounds intimate.''         Her sound and her looks were closely intertwined. Most of her albums were graced by sultry, yet sophisticated pictures of her.         Miss London was born as Julie Peck in Santa Rosa, Calif., on Sept. 26, 1926. Her parents, Jack and Josephine Peck formed a song and dance team in vaudeville and radio. In 1929, they moved to San Bernardino, where her parents had a radio show on which Julie sometimes appeared. In 1941, they moved to Los Angeles and she graduated from Hollywood Professional High School.         She then took a job as an elevator operator in a department store where she was discovered by talent agent Sue Carol, the wife of the actor Alan Ladd. She appeared in her first film, ''Nabonga,'' in 1944, and began singing with the Matty Malnech Orchestra. She met Mr. Webb who was then in the Marine Corps. They married in 1947, and she gave up her budding movie career to become a full-time wife and mother.         They had two daughters, Stacy and Lisa. They divorced in 1953. After meeting Mr. Troupe she began singing again, recovering some of what she called sagging confidence.         Her movie career also revived. She starred as an alcoholic singer in the 1956 film ''The Great Man.'' She then starred or co-starred in ''Man of the West,'' ''Voice in the Mirror,'' ''The George Raft Story'' and ''The Third Voice.'' She composed the title song for ''Voice in the Mirror.''         In 1972, she began her role in ''Emergency!'' After the show ended in 1977, she did one last film before retiring from show business.         She is survived by a daughter from her marriage to Mr. Webb, Lisa Breen of Manhattan Beach, Calif. She also left three children from her 39-year marriage to Mr. Troupe: a daughter, Kelly Ronick, and twin sons, Jody and Reese, all of Los Angeles.         Correction:  October 23, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the singer and actress Julie London on Thursday misspelled the surname of her second husband, who died last year. He was Bobby Troup, not Troupe.       
         Anna Berenson Mayer, a social work policy planner and retired professor of social policy at Rutgers University, died on Wednesday at a New Brunswick, N.J., hospital. She was 91 and lived in East Brunswick, N.J.         Dr. Mayer, who received a doctorate in social work from Columbia University, was chosen in 1983 to head a newly formed Governor's Committee on Children's Services Planning for New Jersey. It was to make recommendations on children's issues to Gov. Thomas H. Kean.         ''We have to make sure that every child in the state has a maximum opportunity for healthy development,'' she said in an interview later that year. One obstacle she saw was inadequate welfare benefits for the poor, which, she said, made it '' very difficult to provide adequate counseling to families and their children'' who lacked ''the basic needs of food, shelter, good health care.''         She made similar observations when she delivered the panel's report to the State Legislature with the governor beside her.         She was also known as one of two co-authors of a monograph, ''Day Care as a Social Instrument,'' written for the Ford Foundation in the early 1960's. The founders of Head Start used it to help shape their program, which began in 1965.         She was born in New Orleans and taught at Columbia and New York Universities and then for a decade at the Rutgers Graduate School of Social Work.         Surviving are her husband, Nathan; a son, Steven, of Albany, Calif.; two grandchildren; and two sisters, Ruth Forsyth of New Orleans and Florence Marx of Bogalusa, La.       
         Eugenia Rawls, a theater actress who portrayed Tallulah Bankhead and others in one-woman shows, died on Nov. 8 in Denver. She was 87.         A native of Macon, Ga., Miss Rawls first took the stage at age 4 in a local production of ''Madame Butterfly,'' encouraged by her grandmother and two aunts, with whom she lived during most of her early life. After attending Wesleyan College in Macon she made her Broadway debut in 1934 in Lillian Hellman's ''Children's Hour.''         As an understudy for the actress playing Bankhead's daughter in Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' in 1939, Miss Rawls met the woman who would become her mentor and lifelong friend. ''Who are you?'' Bankhead reportedly demanded. ''You look enough like me to be my own child.'' Weeks later, Miss Rawls was playing Alexandra to Bankhead's Regina Giddens on Broadway, after which they toured 104 American cities.         Bankhead was matron of honor at Miss Rawls's 1941 wedding to Donald Seawell, a lawyer and the founder and chairman of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, and she later became godmother to the couple's two children.         Miss Rawls performed in Lillian Smith's ''Strange Fruit''; with Jose Ferrer in ''The Shrike''; with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in ''The Great Sebastians''; in Noel Coward's ''Private Lives''; and in Tennessee Williams's ''Glass Menagerie.''         In 1971, three years after Bankhead's death, Miss Rawls developed ''Tallulah, a Memory.'' She performed the one-woman work at Lincoln Center, which commissioned it, at the Kennedy Center and the ANTA Playhouse in Los Angeles before turning it into a book in 1979.         In 1972, Miss Rawls became the first American actress to perform at the Abbey Theater in Dublin. She also developed two other solo shows in the 1970's: ''Affectionately Yours, Fanny Kemble'' and ''Women of the West,'' and published a volume of poetry, ''A Moment Ago,'' in 1984.         In her later years, she turned to television, appearing on ''As the World Turns'' and ''The Guiding Light.'' She read the signature work of Lillian Smith in the PBS production of ''Memory of a Large Christmas,'' first broadcast in 1996.         A new theater is to be named for her at the Auraria Higher Education Center, home to the University of Colorado at Denver, Metropolitan State College and Denver Community College.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Brook Ashley of Santa Barbara, Calif.; a son, Brockman Seawell of New York; two brothers, Hubert F. Rawls Jr. of Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Richard Russell Rawls of Fernandina Beach, Fla.; a sister, Dorothy Louise Rawls Tuttle of California; a granddaughter; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Belcher Dyk, one of the last surviving participants in the women's suffrage movement, died in her apartment in Rochester on Nov. 18. She was 99.         In a life that included working with delinquent girls, writing three books on psychology and producing anthropological studies of Navajo Indians with her husband, she never lost her fierce commitment to equality.         Only the protests of family members prevented her from going door to door in her wheelchair to canvass for Hillary Rodham Clinton's senatorial campaign in New York this fall. ''If I have learned one thing, New York needs a woman's touch,'' she said at rally for Mrs. Clinton on Aug. 22.         ''My mother was a suffragette,'' she said in the opening line of the Ken Burns documentary on the suffragists, ''Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,'' which was shown last year on the Public Broadcasting System. Her choice of word was surprising, said her daughter, Penelope Carter, of Rochester.         ''The word suffragette reminded her of the Rockettes,'' Ms. Carter said. ''She was a suffragist.''         Mrs. Dyk's deepest inspiration was her mother, Annie Manson Belcher. She was one of the first women admitted to Tufts Medical School in the late 19th century, but school officials made her drop out when she married, Ms. Carter said. The free spirit of Mrs. Belcher, who by then was married to Arthur Fuller Belcher, a lawyer, is suggested by a family story of borrowing a minister's house for a Maine vacation. When a a house of ill repute next door burned down, Mrs. Belcher graciously invited the prostitutes to stay in the minister's house, engendering a local scandal.         Mrs. Dyk and her mother walked side by side down Beacon Avenue in Boston to demand the vote. Both were overjoyed when the 19th Amendment became part of the Constitution on Aug. 26, 1920.         ''We had worked so long,'' Mrs. Dyk said in the documentary. ''If you had worked years to do it, if you believed in it, if you thought great things were going to come out of it -- great in terms of the position of women in our culture, position of women in jobs, position of women everywhere -- and this was going to improve that . . . I mean lives would be changed.''         Later in the documentary, she said she feared that women's lives ''haven't changed as much as we hoped for.'' She told friends and family members that if women had voted as a bloc, they could have effected more change. ''I don't know if we did enough with it,'' she said.         Mrs. Clinton, however, lauded her contributions in a statement after her death. ''Her devotion to her family, her profession and her work in both the local and global community is an example for women everywhere,'' the first lady said.         Mrs. Dyk was born in Portland, Me., on March 25, 1901. She was proud to say that her pedigree included several families from the Mayflower, including Myles Standish. She grew up in Newton Center, Mass., and, like her mother, attended Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass. She earned a master's degree in economics from Simmons College in Boston, and did further graduate work at the University of Wisconsin and the University of California at Berkeley.         She worked as a psychiatric social worker with delinquent girls in upstate New York, where, among other things, she taught her clients to play pool. She worked as a researcher at what was then called the Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York in Brooklyn, and was co-author of three books: ''Anxiety in Pregnancy and Childbirth'' (Hoeber, 1950); ''Psychological Differentiation'' (Wiley, 1962); and ''Left Handed'' (Columbia University Press, 1980).         She completed the last volume with her husband, Walter Dyk, an anthropologist who studied Navajo Indians. His principal work, called ''a revelation of the real life of the tribe'' by The New Yorker, was in the form of an autobiography of one man, ''Son of Old Man Hat,'' (Harcourt Brace, 1938).         After his death in 1972, Mrs. Dyk took transcripts of taped conversations and other research and wrote ''Left Handed,'' a continuation of the first book.         Ms. Carter said her mother's strong will was evident when Mr. Dyk was suffering from Parkinson's disease and cancer and she was juggling two jobs and raising two children in the 1950's and 1960's. ''What choice did I have? I did what I had to do,'' she said.         But when she had choices, she took an unconventional approach. ''One of my earliest memories was her looking me in the eye and saying with just a bit of venom, 'Don't be so good,' '' Ms. Carter said. ''She meant you've to have some spirit, go against the grain.''         Mrs. Dyk emphasized to her daughter that it was not necessary to marry, and that it was important to get the education that would allow her to live independently. When Ms. Carter began smoking, Mrs. Dyk said it was fine with her. With nothing to rebel against, the girl quit the next day.         In addition to Ms. Carter, Mrs. Dyk is survived by her son, Timothy, of Washington, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Dyk smoked into her 80's, drove into her 90's and voted in the recent election. She recalled how she felt when she was among the first women to vote.         ''I was terribly frightened that I would push the wrong lever,'' she said. ''I still go into that booth with the same feeling -- what if I voted Republican?''       
         Juliet Garretson Hollister, in whose kitchen an interfaith organization called the Temple of Understanding was born 40 years ago, died on Sunday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 84.         In 1960, at a time when nuclear Armageddon was not unthinkable, she felt the need to do something, she said later.         As she recalled it, she was sitting in her kitchen when, over peanut butter sandwiches, she told a like-minded friend, ''The world is in a mess.'' Her prescription, for a starter, was to promote dialogue and understanding among the world's religions.         Mrs. Hollister, who was ''just a nice little mother,'' as she put it, at first got nowhere. She was also, however, the wife of a well-connected partner in a Manhattan law firm and did not simply take the ''no'' of foundation executives. Then she met Eleanor Roosevelt, who liked her idea and opened doors for her.         Mrs. Hollister's idea became the Temple of Understanding, which grew into an international educational group recognized by the United Nations as a nongovernmental organization.         As its moving spirit and chairwoman, Mrs. Hollister met and became acquainted with world figures like the Dalai Lama. From its Manhattan headquarters and under her leadership, the group organized symposiums, round-table discussions at the United Nations, educational projects, global forums and spiritual summit meetings abroad.         In addition to Mrs. Roosevelt, she was supported by Dr. Albert Schweitzer; Pope John XXIII; U Thant, secretary general of the United Nations; Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India; and President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt.         The Temple of Understanding has chapters overseas and was based in New York at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights before moving in the 1990's to its present center, on Fifth Avenue at 56th Street.         Mrs. Hollister's husband, Dickerman Hollister, died in 1983. She is survived by their two sons, G. Clay, of Chevy Chase, Md., and Dickerman Jr., of Greenwich; a daughter, Catharine H. Ecton of Cabin John, Md.; six grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.         Juliet Garretson was born in Forest Hills, Queens. She studied comparative religion at Columbia University and Union Theological Seminary, but as a woman found the road to a career in theology blocked.         But reading up on the world's great faiths, she became convinced that they all, in one way or another, shared basic humane principles.         That belief inspired her concept of the Temple of Understanding as an educational platform and a meeting place for people to learn about one another's creeds: what Eleanor Roosevelt called a ''spiritual United Nations.''       
         Lucia Evangelista, a former soprano, a notable figure in New Jersey cultural circles and the wife of the renowned American bass Jerome Hines, died on Oct. 26 in North Plainfield, N.J. She was 83 and had been suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease.         Ms. Evangelista was born in Genoa, Italy, on April 30, 1917. She studied voice at the Verdi Conservatory in her hometown and made her operatic debut at 19 as Mimi in ''La Boheme'' at the Teatro Politeama Genovese. After touring in Italy, she moved to the United States in 1947, then sang for two seasons with the New York City Opera.         In 1952 she sang Violetta in a one-hour abridged version of ''La Traviata'' for the ''Opera Cameos'' television program, which was widely shown. That same year she married Mr. Hines, a leading bass at the Metropolitan Opera. They eventually settled in Scotch Plains, N.J.         The couple made several concert tours together. After Ms. Evangelista retired from singing in 1957 to raise a family, she worked as an administrator and fund-raiser for arts organizations. She and Mr. Hines were co-founders of Opera Music Theater International, a training company for young singers. She also organized a series of benefits for the New Jersey State Opera, which were held at places like the Newark Museum and the Meadowlands.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by four sons, John and Russell, of Scotch Plains; David, of Boston; and Andrew, of Macungie, Pa.; and by 12 grandchildren.       
         Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, whose deep sense of obligation to others and passion for charity work led her to build an international network of homes and treatment centers for the sick and disabled, died on Thursday at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St. Edmunds, England. She was 77.         A small woman of indomitable energy who ate sparingly and often got out of bed at 4:30 a.m. and who liked to supervise her dozens of projects herself and delegate as little as possible, Lady Ryder was gripped by the notion that she had a moral mission to help the less advantaged -- the poor, the sick, the displaced.         She had a religious view of suffering and grace, once telling an interviewer, ''I believe that to be with people who are suffering, whoever they are, makes one humble.''         Her name was familiar to the British public through the 500 or so Sue Ryder charity shops in cities and towns across the country. Sales from the stores, which volunteers run and sell both new and used goods, are used to raise money for the Sue Ryder Foundation, the group that runs the Sue Ryder centers. Lady Ryder bought her own clothes from the stores.         She first got an inkling of what would be her life's work as a girl in Leeds, when her mother took her on mercy missions to the poor in the woeful slums there. Born Margaret Susan Ryder in 1923 into a prosperous farming family outside Leeds, Sue, as she was called, was the youngest of her mother's five surviving children.         As the Depression ground on in the mid-1930's, the family fell on hard times and left the family home and moved to what had been a summer cottage in Thurlow, Suffolk.         Sue Ryder, who once thought that she would become a nun, married a young naval officer at 18. He was killed in the war several weeks later.         Lying about her age, she volunteered as a nurse and was soon sent to work at the Polish section of the Special Operations Executive, which ran spies and helped resistance organizations in enemy territory. Her work there gave her a lifelong sympathy for refugees and for prisoners and other casualties of war.         It also left her with an abiding admiration for Poland. She took the name of the country's capital as part of her title when she was elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer in 1979.         After the war, she worked in camps for displaced persons and, among other activities, organized trips to British vacation houses for survivors of concentration camp. She also did relief work in France, meeting the practical problems she encountered with a typically stubborn belief in her abilities. Once, a truck that she was driving laden with stoves and drugs to combat tuberculosis and typhus broke down in midjourney. She pushed it to the side of the road with the help of passers-by and proceeded to clean the carburetor and replace the spark plugs herself before setting off again.         In 1953, she used a small inheritance and some borrowed money to found the Sue Ryder Foundation, whose symbol is rosemary, a sign of remembrance. The foundation was dedicated to the memory of those who had been killed in the two world wars.         Soon after, she opened the first Sue Ryder Home, for disabled people. By 1965, she had established 30 homes, where those bearing the scars of the war lived in comfort and without restriction, in England, Germany, Greece, Poland and Yugoslavia.         As Europe rebuilt itself after the war, Sue Ryder became a champion for the dispossessed. She traveled 50,000 miles a year, often driving, carrying supplies across the Continent, supervising the homebuilding and visiting refugees.         Through the years, Lady Ryder's organization continued to expand. There are now 20 homes in Britain and 80 centers in 20 countries around the world. In Britain, the organization has 2,500 employees.         There are residential centers and day-care centers that provide help for those with long-term illnesses and for those who need palliative care, and centers for people with neurological and degenerative diseases. Each year in Britain, 3,000 people are cared for at the residential centers, 12,000 visits are made to the day centers, and more than 37,000 home visits are made by the nursing staff.         In 1998, Lady Ryder retired as a trustee of the organization that she founded as a dispute about its future raged. She founded a new group, the Bouverie Foundation. The Sue Ryder Foundation has been renamed Sue Ryder Care, and it is being reorganized and modernized.         In 1959, Sue Ryder married Group Capt. Leonard Cheshire, a war hero and holder of the Victoria Cross. It was a true meeting of interests. Captain Cheshire, it happened, had his own charitable foundation, and he first met his future wife when she visited one of his homes for the disabled. Her husband. was elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer in 1991. He died the next year. The couple had two children, Jeremy and Elizabeth, who survive.         In 1979, the Queen Mother opened the Sue Ryder Foundation Museum in Cavendish, with exhibitions that included Lady Ryder's war uniforms and a reconstruction of her mother's room. But Lady Ryder insisted that her work was about the people whom she helped rather than herself.         The museum, she said, was a tribute ''to all those who suffered and who continue to suffer.''         ''It is intended,'' she added, ''to show the misery in the world and the needs which exist more vividly than the written word could do. It is not dedicated to me.''       
         Eleanor Naumburg Sanger, the first program director of WQXR, the classical music station that was later purchased by The New York Times Company, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100.         Mrs. Sanger and her husband, Elliott M. Sanger, who helped found the station, assembled the music and interviews that turned WQXR, one of the country's first FM classical stations, into a New York institution. She came upon the job almost by accident: Called down to the station one day not long after it was founded in 1936 to help out with a deluge of mail, she stayed for 23 years.         During more than 20 years as program director, Mrs. Sanger oversaw the staff that selected the symphonies and operas for each day's broadcast, published a program guide, hired announcers, and arranged for live radio performances by many great musicians, including Vladimir Horowitz and Van Cliburn.         Mrs. Sanger was born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on Sept. 20, 1900. She taught at the Ethical Culture Society School. Except for a brief period in Paris, she spent her entire life in Manhattan.         She and her husband stayed on at WQXR long after the Times Company purchased it in 1944. Mrs. Sanger helped transform the station into an outlet for reporting breaking news to The Times's readers in New York between the paper's daily editions.         Mrs. Sanger is survived by a son, Kenneth E. Sanger, of White Plains,  three grandchildren, and four great-grandsons.       
         Dr. Susana Rotker-Martinez, director of the Rutgers Center for Hemispheric Studies, was hit by a truck and fatally injured Monday while crossing a road in Piscataway, N.J. She was 46 and lived in Highland Park.         Her husband, Dr. Tomas Eloy Martinez, a fellow faculty member and journalist, was treated for lesser injuries; she was pronounced dead later Monday evening at a nearby hospital.         Dr. Rotker-Martinez joined the Rutgers faculty in 1991. At her death, she was also a professor in the department of Spanish and Portuguese and director of the university's graduate program in Spanish.         Born in Venezuela, she was formerly a journalist and film critic in Caracas and an assistant professor at the University of Buenos Aires. She became a full professor this year.         Dr. Rotker-Martinez wrote several books, both in Spanish and in English, as well as book chapters, articles, professional papers and reviews. She edited ''The Memoirs of Fray Servando Teresa de Mier,'' the life of a venturesome Mexican friar, issued in English in 1998 by Oxford University Press.         A revised and updated version of her book ''The American Chronicles of Jose Marti: Journalism and Modernity in Spanish America'' was published this year by University Press of New England. She was preparing a collection of essays, ''Citizens of Fear,'' which is to be published in both English and Spanish.         She was a 1975 graduate of Catholic University Andres Bello in Caracas. She received an M.A. in 1986 and a Ph.D. in Spanish-American literature in 1989 while working as a teaching assistant at the University of Maryland.         Besides her husband, director of the Rutgers Latin American studies program, Dr. Rotker-Martinez's survivors include their daughter, Sol Ana Martinez, 14; her parents, David and Cecilia Rotker; and a brother, George Rotker, all of Caracas.       
         Teresa Sterne, a pioneering producer of classical recordings, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said a friend, Norma Hurlburt, executive director of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.         As the director of Nonesuch Records from 1965 through 1979, Ms. Sterne turned a small budget label into one of the most adventurous companies in the recording business.  When she was invited to take charge of Nonesuch, the label was a subsidiary of the pop-oriented and profitable Elektra Records. Nonesuch's business had consisted mostly of acquiring the rights to existing recordings of Baroque music by European ensembles and reissuing them at budget prices in the United States.         Ms. Sterne, called Tracey by her friends and colleagues, brought a vision to the job born of her long experience in music. She had been a piano prodigy, and though she gave up public performance as an adult, she maintained close ties with the composers and performers of her day.         At Nonesuch she brought attention to areas of music neglected by the major labels, particularly contemporary music and American vernacular music. She championed American composers like George Crumb, Elliott Carter, Morton Subotnick, Charles Wuorinen and Donald Martino, not just recording their works but commissioning them, an unusual move for the leader of a record company. She also issued important recordings of lesser-known works by Schoenberg, Busoni, Stravinsky and other major figures.         She nurtured relationships with several excellent performers not widely known at the time, like the pianist Paul Jacobs, the mezzo-soprano Jan DeGaetani and the pianist Gilbert Kalish. Many of the artists she discovered were first recognized  for their work in contemporary music. Ms. Sterne encouraged them to  record past works that interested them as well, like Jacobs's critically hailed recording of the Debussy etudes and Mr. Kalish's engaging survey of the Haydn piano sonatas.         The mezzo-soprano Joan Morris and her husband and professional partner, the composer and pianist William Bolcom, made some popular Nonesuch recordings of vernacular American songs from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. And Ms. Sterne sparked a nationwide craze for ragtime with a series of Scott Joplin piano works played by Joshua Rifkin.         She was also in the forefront of the early instrument movement in Baroque and Renaissance repertory. And under her leadership, Nonesuch's Explorer series introduced music from Bali, India, Peru and other countries to a wider audience. Ms. Sterne believed that every record she produced should have a purpose, and she involved herself with everything, from the packaging to the liner notes.         But in late 1979 she was dismissed from Nonesuch. Early in her tenure the record label had been acquired by Warner Communications, and by the mid-1970's, it was grouped under a parent company, Elektra/Asylum/ Nonesuch, headed by Joe Smith. Warner officials asserted that Nonesuch was losing money. In an interview with The Boston Globe at the time, Mr. Smith said: ''Nonesuch is in business, and it is losing its credibility in its marketplace. We can't make records that sell only outside the Russian Tea Room.''         Ms. Sterne argued that the losses were mostly caused by the parent company's poor marketing and distribution. A letter condemning her dismissal, written by 10 Pulitzer Prize-winning composers, including Mr. Carter and Aaron Copland, was sent to the vice president of Warner Communications and widely circulated in the press, to no avail.         Ms. Sterne never anticipated becoming a record producer. She was born in Brooklyn on March 29, 1927, to a cultured family with a toehold on the middle class. Her mother was a cellist who gave up her career to nurture her musical daughter. Ms. Sterne's father, a violinist, deserted the family when she was 14. Her paternal uncle, Robert Sterne, a professional violinist, became an important mentor.         From the age of 10, she was educated at home by private tutors, living with her mother and a beloved aunt in ''a kind of aristocratic poverty,'' as she once told a friend. In 1939, when she was 12, she made her professional debut as a pianist playing Grieg's Piano Concerto with the NBC Symphony Orchestra at Madison Square Garden. The next year she played Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto with the New York Philharmonic at Lewisohn Stadium, winning cheers from the audience and glowing reviews from critics. Her career as a prodigy flourished.         But after such a rarefied and isolated upbringing, Ms. Sterne felt that she lacked the pragmatism and confidence to pursue a professional career. Wanting experience in the real world, she became a secretary, soon winding up in the offices of the powerful manager Sol Hurok, where she nurtured the careers of other young artists. A series of administrative jobs, including assistant to the director at Vanguard Records, led to her  hiring by Nonesuch.         Ms. Sterne, who never married, leaves no immediate survivors. After her dismissal from Nonesuch, the company went through many changes. Earlier this year, Robert Hurwitz, its director since 1984 and a great admirer of Ms. Sterne, issued a two-disc recording in tribute to her, containing highlights from favorite albums she had produced and live recordings of performances she gave in her early years as a piano prodigy.       
         Marie Windsor, who played sassy femmes fatales, cynical bawdyhouse matrons and two-timing crooks in 74 movies with enough verve to win the informal accolade ''Queen of the B's,'' died on Sunday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80.         Acting opposite male stars like Marlon Brando, George Raft, James Garner and John Wayne, she portrayed a succession of strong, but seldom admirable characters: she was the blunt, beautiful dame with the bedroom eyes who was rotten to the core and didn't care who knew it.         ''I know you like a book, ya little tramp,'' Sterling Hayden said to her in the 1956 film ''The Killing,'' directed by Stanley Kubrick.''You'd sell out your own mother for a piece of fudge.''         In ''The Narrow Margin'' (1952), she played a sexy gangster's widow who ends up riding across the country by rail with a police escort played by Charles McGraw. ''She's a dish,'' he tells his partner, ''a 60-cent special: cheap, flashy, strictly poison under the gravy.''         Later, he tells her, ''You make me sick to my stomach.''         ''Yeah?'' she snarls. ''Well, use your own sink.''         She also made guest appearances on more than 100 television shows, including ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' Her film career spanned five decades, and included film noir classics like ''Force of Evil'' (1948) and westerns like ''The Fighting Kentuckian'' (1949), with Mr. Wayne. But she also had no qualms about appearing in quickie efforts like ''Cat Women of the Moon'' (1954), ''Swamp Women'' (1955) and ''Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'' (1955). ''I think those films added to my luster,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. ''I think people said, 'She can even do that and survive.' ''         She came to take pride in the title Queen of the B's. As she said in several different interviews over the years, ''It's better to be queen of something than nothing at all.''         Emily Marie Bertelsen was born on Dec. 11, 1919, in Marysvale, Utah, a small farming community where her father was a mechanic. Her grandmother took her to see films with Clara Bow, the ''It Girl,'' as a child. By the time she was 11, her parents drove 30 miles over dirt roads to take her to acting lessons.         After she won two local beauty pageants and studied drama for two years at Brigham Young University, her parents drove her to Hollywood to study with Maria Ouspenskaya, the famed acting instructor. She stayed at the Hollywood Studio Club,  whose residents included Marilyn Monroe and Donna Reed. She worked as a cigarette girl at the Mocambo, a Sunset Strip nightclub.         In 1941 she made her movie debut in Paramount's ''All-American Coed,'' wearing a costume of velvet carrots. After appearing in some bit parts, she headed for New York, where she was cast in more than 400 radio shows, including a nine-month stint on the soap opera ''Our Gal Sunday,'' from 1943 to 1945. During her last year in New York, she played the femme heavy in the Broadway play ''Follow the Girls.''         MGM then signed her to a contract, though she did lesser roles for many other studios, including some very small ones, through the 1950's.         ''A lot of things hampered my career,'' she said in an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle in 1994. ''At 5 foot 9, I was too tall for most leading men. And I never had a classic face. One of my casting directors at Paramount said about me, before I'd even started my career, 'Her eyes are too big and she has a bad mouth.' ''         The Chronicle quoted Frances Bergen, the mother of Candice and a long-time friend, as suggesting that Ms. Windsor's striking resemblance to Joan Crawford might have obscured her during Crawford's heyday. But Ms. Windsor found a niche in film noir, a genre of mainly crime thrillers that captured a sense of postwar disillusionment. In ''Force of Evil,'' she played Roy Roberts's sultry, promiscuous wife in a tale about the numbers racket. For the first time, she received featured billing and was pictured in the advertising. She once said in an interview: ''I didn't know I was doing film noir, I thought they were detective stories with low lighting! Even Kubrick, in  'The Killing,' never used the term film noir to my knowledge.''         Perhaps her best remembered role was in the low-budget ''The Narrow Margin,'' in which she played a sexy gangster's wife with a heart of gravel. That role spurred Kubrick to cast her as an unfaithful wife in ''The Killing,'' for which she won the best supporting actress award from Look.         ''One of the reasons film noir is so popular today is that it left so much to the imagination, in contrast to today when everything is so explicit,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times last year. ''Film noir engaged the audience, let them use the gray matter between their ears.''         Ms. Windsor is survived by her husband, Jack Rodney Hupp; her son, Richard Hupp; a brother, Jerry Bertelsen; and a sister, Louise Atherley.         She was a director of the Screen Actors Guild for 25 years, and was aligned with the union's conservative wing, represented by Ronald Reagan and Charlton Heston. But many conservative movie viewers might be hard pressed to believe it. Her characters were just so radically evil.         She told Classic Images, a film magazine: ''Fans would send me Bibles with specific verses underscored and accompanied by handwritten warnings that 'the devil would get me and I'd go to hell,' if I didn't reform.''       
         Alice Recknagel Ireys, one of the most prominent landscape architects of the second half of the 20th century, with more than 1,000 public and private projects to her name, died Tuesday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.         A bridge between the 19th-century tradition of gracious landscaping for grand estates and elegant modern design for postwar suburban homes, she also created many major public garden spaces. Important projects can be seen in both the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.         One of her famous designs was for the Fragrance Garden at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which became a prototype internationally for gardens used by people with disabilities.         Born in Brooklyn on April 24, 1911, as Alice Recknagel, Mrs. Ireys lived all her life in the Brooklyn Heights town house occupied since 1835 by five generations of her family.         Her serious gardening began in a youth program at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which was founded in 1910, a year before her birth.         ''The Burpee company provided the seeds, and after we planted them and followed their growth, we were allowed to take the plants home,'' she recalled in an interview not long before her death.         In 1935, she completed her formal training as a landscape architect at the Cambridge School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture in Massachusetts when it was affiliated with Smith College.         Before setting up her own practice in 1947 in her home, she worked in Manhattan with other landscape architects, mostly women, on public housing projects, public playgrounds, college campuses and lakeside plantings at the 1939 New York World's Fair.         Mrs. Ireys traveled to England and France and worked in 17 states, but it was her native Brooklyn, with its famous botanic garden, that commanded her attention and affection over a lifetime.         She was one of the remaining links to a golden age of landscape architecture as a profession for women, beginning around the end of the 19th century. Her principles formed a critical transition in American garden history between the great estate era and the explosion of suburban and town gardens that followed World War II.         By scaling down and reconfiguring broad terraces, flower walks and parterres, she conferred on modest properties the same sense of privilege and gracious outdoor living that had once been reserved for country estates. She made a great virtue of the serpentine line to give the illusion of length and breadth.         She emphasized the simple pleasures of walking around flower beds, sitting under the dappled shade of a tree or dining with friends on a terrace. Achieving this, however, required underlying construction and a sophisticated selection of plants and trees compatible with the climate and the care that could be supplied.         ''To produce a living functional picture as well as a beautiful one'' was how Mrs. Ireys defined garden design in the first of her four books, ''How to Plan and Plant Your Own Property'' (1967). Her books, with their accessible prose, site plans and photographs, have served as basic training for many in the next generation of professional landscape architects and for amateurs as well.         She also wrote ''Small Gardens for City and Country'' (1978) and two books published in 1991 for W. Atlee Burpee & Company, ''Designs for American Gardens'' and ''Garden Designs,'' which included her popular planting plans, originally published in Burpee catalogs.         Mrs. Ireys considered it a challenge to design a garden of any size. ''Once,'' she reminisced, ''I met a woman who wanted a garden but could not afford one, so we made a deal. I designed and planted her garden, and she delivered two loaves of homemade bread to us once a week for two years. My children were thrilled.''         Galen Williams, a landscape designer in East Hampton, N.Y, who assisted her, recalled: ''Her eye was so finely tuned that once after appraising a mock-up for a front and side fence, Mrs. Ireys requested that one section be lowered by an inch and the other by a half-inch. The next time it was perfect.''         After a major planting of evergreens was completed by Mrs. Ireys, Ms. Williams recalled, ''the trees instantly looked as if they had been there for 50 years.''         The way her gardens settled into the landscape gave them a sense of timelessness, even though they had to be carefully monitored.         ''If you do well in people's gardens, they keep coming back,'' was Mrs. Ireys's summation of her long career. But she could also bluntly tell one client to remove a row of azaleas because ''it looks like motel planting.''         In later years, she inspected large gardens from the vantage of a golf cart, using her cane as a pointer.         In Manhattan, Mrs. Ireys's public work can be seen in the colonial-style garden behind the Mount Vernon Hotel Museum and Garden, the former Abigail Adams Smith Museum on East 61st Street, a 1799 carriage house that became a popular hotel on the East River.         In 1988, at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, she designed two gardens, the Mae L. Wien Cutting Garden and Helen's Garden of Fragrant Plants, a memorial to Helen Goodhart Altschul, who was blind for the last 20 years of her life. Both demonstrate an array of visual tricks that make small plots appear larger.         In 1978, Mrs. Ireys was elected a fellow in the American Society of Landscape Architects. In 1991, she received the Liberty Hyde Bailey Award from the American Horticultural Society. Recently, she gave her professional papers to Smith College. A documentary film about her life and work, ''The Living Landscapes of Alice Recknagel Ireys,'' by Malcolm MacDougall, was released this year.         Mrs. Ireys is survived by a sister, Catherine Ropes of Hartsdale, N.Y.; two daughters, Catherine Gandel of Los Angeles and Dr. Anne Lennon of Green Harbor, Mass.; a son, Dr. Henry T. Ireys of Baltimore; and five grandsons. Her husband, Henry T. Ireys, whom she married in 1943, died in 1963.         Next June, Mrs. Ireys was to receive the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Better Earth Award, recognizing people who are engaged in important environmental work in the community that benefits the planet. As a lecturer and designer at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden for more than 50 years, Mrs. Ireys considered the garden her true home and did her most important community project for it.         The Fragrance Garden she designed there was completed in 1955 and later extensively restored. It is accessible to the blind and to visitors who use wheelchairs. An oval garden with raised perimeter beds that can be easily touched and smelled, the Fragrance Garden is divided into four sections with Braille labels: fragrant flowers, plants for touch, plants with scented leaves and kitchen herbs. The flagstone walk around the central lawn makes it easy to move around the edges.         ''At night when I can't sleep,'' Mrs. Ireys said, ''I think about my different jobs and what fun they all were.''       
         Christabel Leighton-Porter, who became the sweetheart of British troops in World War II as the model for a comic strip heroine who was forever shedding her clothes, died Dec. 6 in Horsham, England. She was 87.         While American troops ogled pinups of Betty Grable and the Varga girls of Esquire magazine, British soldiers, sailors and airmen went to war inspired by The Daily Mirror's comic strip ''Jane.''         Six days a week, Jane, a curvaceous blonde secret agent -- Mrs. Leighton-Porter as drawn by Norman Pett -- found herself in madcap escapades. Jane tangled with Nazi spies, tumbled down cliffs and became caught in tree branches in episodes that invariably concluded with her stripped down to her underclothes.         When she was not posing as Jane, Mrs. Leighton-Porter traveled around England in a chorus-girl show, ''Jane in The Mirror,'' entertaining servicemen and bucking up home front morale.         ''Suddenly I became a sweetheart all over the world,'' she recalled. ''One admiral told me that there wasn't anybody on the ships, from the lowest rating to the highest in the fleet, who didn't have a drawing of Jane in his pocket or on his bunk.''         Christabel Jane Drewry was born on April 11, 1913, in Eastleigh, England; her father worked at the town carriage works. In her late teens, she became an artist's model, and in 1939 she was acclaimed Britain's Perfect Girl in a beauty pageant at the London Palladium.         She was discovered by Mr. Pett while modeling at an art school in Birmingham, where she also worked as a telephone operator. Mr. Pett had been drawing for The Daily Mirror since 1932, when he created ''Jane's Journal: The Diary of a Bright Young Thing,'' using his wife, Mary, as a model. But Mrs. Pett grew interested in golf as the years passed and the newspaper became interested in a Jane who revealed some flesh.         When Britain went to war in 1939, Mrs. Leighton-Porter's Jane began to lose her garments and the comic strip began to gain a huge audience on the fighting fronts. Bomber crews painted Jane on Lancaster fuselages, submarines went to war with weeks of her advance comic panels stored away, and tank crews plastered Jane's undraped likeness on their turrets. Churchill is said to have cited Jane's morale-boosting as Britain's secret weapon.         Jane finally shed every stitch of her clothing in a September 1944 episode. The Daily Mirror reported that a British infantry division was so inspired that it advanced six miles in France the very next day.         Notwithstanding her achievements in the war effort, Mrs. Leighton-Porter had to negotiate with the lord chamberlain, the court official responsible for censoring stage shows, when she made her stage appearances in scanty outfits. ''They were never offensive,'' she said of those shows. ''I was very modest.''         Jane received numerous marriage proposals, but the smitten soldiers  did not know that the real Jane was married, something Mrs. Leighton-Porter kept secret so as not to disappoint her fans. Her husband, Arthur, was a Royal Air Force pilot.         Mrs. Leighton-Porter continued modeling for ''Jane'' after the war, and when Mr. Pett left The Daily Mirror in 1948, the drawings were taken over by his assistant, Michael Hubbard. The next year, Mrs. Leighton-Porter appeared in the British movie ''The Adventures of Jane.''         The comic strip continued until 1959, when Jane sailed into the sunset with her boyfriend, Georgie Porgie. Mrs. Leighton-Porter settled into family life in Bermuda and in England, turning to more staid endeavors like sponsoring teas for a cricket team in Horsham.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Simon.         Neither Jane nor Mrs. Leighton-Porter was forgotten. The BBC developed a television show based on the ''Jane'' comic strip in the early 1980's, and Mrs. Leighton-Porter appeared at servicemen's reunions. In 1993, the Imperial War Museum displayed her 1940's frilly knickers in its exhibition ''Forces Sweethearts,'' the story of wartime romance from World War I to the gulf war. In June 1994, Mrs. Leighton-Porter attended ceremonies observing the 50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.         When she reflected on the comic strip's popularity, Mrs. Leighton-Porter chose not to dwell on the risque. ''I think it was because Jane was a bit girl-next-doorish, a bit of England for the boys,'' she said. ''Jane became a cult thing really, and I think wives and girlfriends were glad that their boys had something to get a kick out of.''       
         Rosemarie Kanzler, who rose from humble beginnings in the Swiss Alps to become one of the most glamorous figures in the international set for more than five decades, died Dec. 9 at her estate in Argentina. She was 85. Her butler found her in her swimming pool after she had suffered a stroke, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Kanzler, who was married five times, was said to have made the original introductions that led to several famous marriages. Henry Ford II met his second wife, the Italian-born Cristina Vettore Austin, at one of Mrs. Kanzler's homes. Mr. Ford's daughter, Charlotte Ford, met Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon whom she later married, at the Kanzler residence in St. Moritz. Over her lifetime, Mrs. Kanzler decorated and lived in 23 residences throughout the world.         Mrs. Kanzler was also credited with introducing Henry Fonda to his third wife, Countess Afdera Franchetti, and Oscar de la Renta to Francoise de Langlade, his first wife.         Born in Zurich on Jan. 24, 1915, to Giovanni Ravelli, an Italian construction worker, and his German wife, Rosemarie Ravelli was in her early 20's when she left Switzerland with Peter Kreuder, a German theater and film composer. Intent on a singing career, she joined Mr. Kreuder's traveling troupe of entertainers but within several years fled Europe.         She landed in Cuba and soon went on to Mexico City, where in 1944 she married Manuel Reachi, a film producer. They were divorced in 1948, and she moved on to Hollywood, Paris and the South of France. In 1953 she married Carlos Oriani, a Mexican entrepreneur. They were divorced the next year.         Within months she was married again, to Frederick Weicker, an uncle of the former Connecticut governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and an heir to the Squibb pharmaceutical empire. She was a widow four months later when Mr. Weicker died at his fishing camp. In 1955 she married Ernest Kanzler, a Detroit business executive who was head of the War Production Board during World War II. Mr. Kanzler, who died in 1967 and was an uncle by marriage of Henry Ford, was associated with the Ford company and was a director of the Detroit Lions football team.         A 1973 marriage to Jean Pierre Marcie-Riviere, a French banker, ended in divorce in 1989. Mrs. Kanzler went back to using the name of her fourth husband and will be buried next to him in Detroit.         Her survivors include a stepdaughter, Katrina Maxtone-Graham of Manhattan; a stepson, Ernest Kanzler Jr., of Arizona; and eight step-grandchildren.         ''I always knew what I wanted and figured out a way to get it,'' she told Kathryn Livingston, a New York writer who collaborated on her memoir, ''Yesterday Is Gone,'' recently published in Germany. But, she added, destiny also played a part, and it was important to know when to end a chapter, buy an airline ticket and get out and start a new life.         ''I always had a good nose for timing changes,'' she said.       
         Ilona Karmel Zucker, a Holocaust survivor who based much of her writing on her experiences in Nazi labor camps, died on Nov. 30 in Cambridge, Mass. She was 75.         Born in Krakow, Poland, Ms. Karmel endured the war years in the city's ghetto and in three nearby camps, where she composed her first literary work, ''Songs From Behind the Barbed Wire,'' a collection of poems written secretly on the backs of worksheets.         At Buchenwald, the last of the camps, both of her legs were crushed by a tank. During two years of postwar convalescence in a Swedish hospital, she learned to walk again and taught herself English by correspondence with Oxford University. She then immigrated to the United States in 1948, attending Hunter College before graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Radcliffe College, where she was a protegee of the poet Archibald MacLeish.         She began her career as a short-story writer, winning the Mademoiselle College Fiction Prize in 1951 for ''Fru Holm.'' Her first novel, ''Stephania,'' completed while she was at Radcliffe and published in 1953, drew on her experiences in Sweden.         Her 1969 novel, ''An Estate of Memory,'' based on life in a Polish camp and centering on four prisoners who conspire to save the life of a child, is considered by scholars to be among the most resonant accounts of the Holocaust.         A review in The New York Times called it ''a very good book,'' adding that ''like Solzhenitsyn, Ilona Karmel has succeeded in writing about life in the prison camps'' as ''plausible, possible human experience.''         The work, translated into German in 1997, was recently reissued in paperback.         While pursuing her writing, Ms. Karmel taught in day care schools in a career that spanned a 10-year stay in Germany, where she worked in an orphanage.         On returning to the United States in 1978 with her husband, the physicist and philosopher Francis Zucker, she was appointed to a senior lectureship in the writing program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she remained until her retirement in 1995.         In 1995 M.I.T. named the Ilona Karmel Writing Prizes in her honor.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Lori Ledis, an art dealer and producer of concerts and music documentaries, died on Saturday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 40.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Robert Flam.         Ms. Ledis was born in Flushing, Queens, and earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute. She started an art consulting business, Contemporary Emerging Artists, in 1983. She married Mr. Flam in 1985, and in 1986 they opened the LedisFlam Gallery, the first commercial gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which exhibited artists including Amy Sillman, Terry Adkins and David Mann.         The gallery moved to SoHo in 1990 and closed in 1995. Its final show was part of ''Art From Brazil in New York,'' a collaborative exhibition by 10 galleries, the Drawing Center and the New Museum that was organized by Ms. Ledis, Mr. Flam and Mary Sabbatino of Galerie Lelong after they visited the Sao Paulo Bienal in Brazil. The exhibitions established an American audience for many Brazilian artists. Afterward, Ms. Ledis and Mr. Flam decided to bring Brazilian musicians to New York and started NYC Entertainment.         With some sponsorship from the Brazilian government, along with the couple's own money, in 1996 the company produced concerts by two leading Brazilian songwriters, Caetano Veloso (with the Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto at Central Park Summerstage) and Milton Nascimento (at the Brooklyn Academy of Music). The 1997 festival included Chico Science, Mundo Livre, Lenine e Suzano, Cascabulho, Banda de Pifanos and Zelia Duncan at Celebrate Brooklyn and Central Park Summerstage. In 1998 the company presented the Brazilian groups Karnak and O Rappa and the Brazilian funk bandleader Ed Motta collaborating with the American vibraphonist Roy Ayers.         All the concerts were filmed. A documentary of the 1997 concerts, ''The Brazilian Muzic Festival,'' was broadcast on public television in the United States and HBO in Latin America.         Last summer, NYC Entertainment brought a full-scale Mexican cabaret revue to Central Park Summerstage, featuring Liliana Felipe, Astrid Hadad and Eugenia Leon, along with an orchestra and a mariachi band. Ms. Ledis was editing the film of that performance for DirecTV in Latin America.         NYC Entertainment had also been working with the piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons on a series of concerts and documentaries to be presented in 2001 at the Steinway factory in Queens.         Ms. Ledis is survived by her husband; her parents, Nathan Ledis and Joan Feldman; a brother, Stuart Ledis; and a sister, Holly Blumenstyk.       
         Peggy McMartin Buckey, a principal defendant in the Virginia McMartin Pre-School child-molestation case, who went free after a costly seven-year ordeal when prosecutors gave up, died on Friday in Torrance, Calif. She was 74 and lived in Torrance.         The local authorities said Mrs. Buckey was found unconscious in her home and was pronounced dead at a hospital.         Mrs. Buckey was the main administrator of the school that her family operated in Manhattan Beach, a Los Angeles suburb. The case turned into a legal and emotional crucible for her, her son and daughter, her mother and three teachers, as well as the accusing parents.         It started in August 1983 when a mother called the police to say that her 2 1/2-year-old son had been molested at the school.         In a case that many found reminiscent of the witchcraft trials of yore, the ensuing investigation soon received lurid reports of children being raped and sodomized, of dead rabbits, satanic rites and drinking blood. Eventually the case went through two trials, the last ending with a hung jury. The prosecution cost Los Angeles County at least $15 million.         On the basis of testimony from children and doctors but little corroborating evidence, a grand jury in March 1984 indicted Mrs. Buckey; her son, Raymond; her daughter, Peggy Ann Buckey; her mother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the school; and three teachers. After a lengthy preliminary hearing, the trial judge in January 1986 ordered all seven to stand trial on a total of 135 counts of molesting 14 children.         Days later, even the prosecution termed the evidence against all but Mrs. Buckey and her son ''incredibly weak.'' The charges against the five other defendants were dropped.         Mrs. Buckey and Raymond Buckey first went to trial in April 1987. Two years later the county jury voted acquittals on some charges and deadlocked on others. A second trial of Mr. Buckey alone ended in a hung jury, after which prosecutors chose to drop the matter.         ''I've gone through hell,'' Mrs. Buckey said at the time, ''and now we've lost everything.'' By then she had spent two years behind bars before raising bail and her son had spent five.         The case came to symbolize the hazards in abuse investigations.         Experts in the field held that children's accounts of abuse tended to have a basis of truth because they had no reason to invent such events.         But in the McMartin case and others like it, critics contended, zealous prosecutors and poorly trained social workers, faced with anxious parents, may unknowingly coach children to tell stories of abuse or embroider on them.         Mrs. Buckey's survivors include her husband, Charles, and her son and daughter. Her mother, Virginia McMartin, died in 1995.       
         Lily Carlson Schulte, one of the first models hired by the Ford agency and a favorite subject of photographers like Irving Penn and Richard Avedon, died on Dec. 14 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 85.         ''It's hard to explain to you what a star she was,'' said Eileen Ford, the agency's co-founder. ''Every great photographer wanted to work with her. In this business, there certainly has never been a bigger star. ''         Lily Carlson, as she was known professionally, stood 5 feet 11 inches tall. She stood out in a crowd, even of other models. She is the woman in the center of Irving Penn's famous photograph of the 12 most photographed women of the 1940's. She wears a white gown with a billowing skirt and gazes slightly upward.         Her face was more famous than her name, perhaps, but she was always famous to her photographers. George Hurrell, a distinguished fashion photographer, called her one of the three most beautiful women he ever photographed. The others were Joan Crawford and his wife, Phyllis Bounds, also a model. He called Miss Carlson ''perhaps the best fashion model in the entire country.''         In an interview in Cover Girl magazine, Mr. Hurrell said that some models are wooden and tend to simper, but that Miss Carlson was alive and vital. ''Equally good in sports clothes or evening gowns,'' he said.         She came along just as the whole business of modeling changed, Mrs. Ford said. In the immediate post-war years, models became the elegant emblems of a newly booming haute couture fashion business, perhaps epitomized by Christian Dior's romantic New Look of 1947. There was an explosion of photography, and models like Lisa Fonssagrives, famously photographed at the Eiffel Tower with her skirts billowing, elevated the model's role far beyond that of simple clothes hangers.         ''It was like a land rush,'' said Mrs. Ford, who with her husband, Jerry, opened Ford Models in 1946. They had hired only a couple of lesser-known models when Miss Carlson agreed to sign on. ''She was our seal of approval, the first really, really great star,'' said Mrs. Ford. (Her agency agreed this month to be bought by Magnum Sports Entertainment.)         Lily Viola Carlson was born in Sheridan, Iowa, on April 4, 1915, Easter Sunday. ''It was Bunny or Lily,'' said her daughter Christina Fleur, ''and they called her Lily. Thank goodness.''         Her father was a Lutheran minister who frequently conducted services in Swedish. Her son, William Dowell, said she hated both the plains and the plainness of the Midwest, greedily devouring The New Yorker magazine as if it were ''an escape manual.''         She attended the Art Institute of Chicago, specializing in watercolors and photography. She followed a fellow student, Julian C. Dowell, to New York and married him. Their honeymoon consisted of a nickel ride on the Fifth Avenue bus. They and their friends would hold spaghetti parties to which each person would bring a can of pasta to throw into the kettle.         With Mr. Dowell unemployed at the depths of the Depression, his wife looked in the mirror and saw what just might be a bankable asset. She flipped through a directory of fashion photographers and under the B's, spotted one named Erwin Blumenfeld. He shot some test pictures and sent them to Vogue, and Miss Carlson went to work.         ''It was so amazing,'' she later told Cover Girl. ''The first 28 days, I made $1,500,'' the equivalent of about $13,500 in today's money.         Mr. Blumenfeld said this was not all good news. He told her the pressures of the stratospheric career she could easily have might damage her marriage. Mr. Dowell, who envisioned her as a movie star, said she must do it, their son, William, said.         Soon they were living in different worlds. She was a regular at the Stork Club in a veiled hat and white gloves, while he found work as an art director. He moved to the suburbs, she stayed in Manhattan, and they were divorced.         She had not started modeling until her late 20's, but she quickly became a regular in both the fashion and general press. A picture in Life showed her striding down Park Avenue carrying a hatbox, then ''the symbol of the model's trade,'' as the caption read. An Avedon photograph in Vogue showed her ''wrapped in a cloud of red fox against black.''         She sometimes veered beyond fashion, once escorting a sheep around the country for a wool dealers' group. She was the Drene Girl, showing off her voluminous hair for Drene shampoo.         To enliven her expression, she always conversed with an imaginary friend as she was photographed. ''That way I just naturally warm up,'' she said.         Cover Girl reported, ''Photographers with whom Lily works tease her about this. 'Well, Lily,' they say, 'who will it be today . . . Julian, Joe or John?' '' Mrs. Ford said this is wrong. It was always John. She has no idea why.         In 1955, Miss Carlson married David A. Schulte, a financier who advised presidents on employment policy and still serves on the New York City Board of Corrections. Her new affluence allowed her to leave modeling and spend more time taking pictures herself. Her work appeared in Life, Look and other magazines.         The two would have been jet-setters had they not preferred the staterooms of luxury ocean liners. They spent almost half their lives in Europe, always staying at the Cipriani in Venice, the Ritz in Paris. At the Ritz several years ago, Mrs. Schulte spotted Richard Avedon and shyly approached to ask if he remembered her. He did.         But her son described a woman who furnished her elegant apartment with things she bought at flea markets.         In addition to her husband, her son and her daughter Christina, she is survived by another daughter, Holly Schulte Ellison, and four grandchildren, all of Manhattan.         At her funeral on Monday, there were mountains of white roses and white lilies. Ms. Fleur told of the time at age 8 or 9 that she was caught with her mother in a downpour. Yellow cabs were whizzing by, but you would have had a better chance of catching a snowball somewhere very hot. Suddenly, a cab screeched to a stop directly in front of Miss Carlson.         ''I saw you standing there,'' the driver said.       
         Libertad Lamarque Bouza, a singer and actress whose career ranged from the gritty days of early tango recordings in Argentina to the contemporary daily soap operas produced for mass audiences in the Spanish-speaking world, died on Dec. 12 in Mexico City. She was 92.         Ms. Lamarque gained renown after leaving Argentina for Mexico in 1946, following an incident on the Buenos Aires set of the 1944 movie ''The Circus Procession.'' She was said to have quarreled with a young actress named Eva Duarte.         The next year Duarte married Col. Juan Domingo Peron, and in 1946, Peron became president of Argentina. Exercising her power as first lady, Eva Duarte Peron effectively prevented any studio in Argentina from hiring Ms. Lamarque.         After she moved to Mexico City in the 1940's, during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, Ms. Lamarque's career blossomed. She acted in the first film that the Spanish director Luis Bunuel made in Mexico, ''The Great Casino,'' and appeared in some 60 other films.         ''Strangely, even with a strong Argentine accent that never quite went away, she became the darling of Mexican cinema,'' said Carl Mora, an expert on Latin American film at the University of New Mexico. ''Her magnetic presence made for quite a life trajectory.''         It was in Rosario, the provincial Argentine city where Ms. Lamarque was born, that she began her artistic career. Her father was Gaudencio Lamarque, a Uruguayan descendant of French immigrants and a militant anarchist. Because he was imprisoned at the time of her birth, his daughter was named Libertad, or Liberty. Together with six half-brothers and -sisters, she began acting as a child in plays inspired by anarchist ideas.         In 1926, when Ms. Lamarque turned 18, her family moved to Buenos Aires. She soon found work singing in comedy shows. Then a music studio hired her to record tango songs, and she began to attract attention. Ms. Lamarque also started acting, making her debut in the 1929 silent film ''Adios, Argentina,'' which was made by the Italian director Mario Parpagnoli in a single day. In 1932 she starred in ''Tango,'' Argentina's first sound film.         Ms. Lamarque's first marriage, to Emilio Romero, who worked as a prompter in the theater, turned sour shortly after they exchanged vows in 1928. Still, because divorce was illegal at the time in Argentina, it took Ms. Lamarque 12 years to become legally separated from him.         In 1935 she was reported to have attempted suicide while on tour in Chile. That same year her husband took their daughter, Mirtha, with him to live in neighboring Uruguay. After an effort involving a lawyer and several friends, including Hector Artola, her new romantic partner and future husband, Ms. Lamarque succeeded in gaining custody of her daughter.         While in Argentina, Ms. Lamarque acted in more than 20 movies, including ''Honeysuckle,'' ''When I Return to Your Side'' and ''In This Gray Afternoon.'' But it was in Mexico that she took her place as a leading figure in Latin American cinema, and later in the melodramatic world of daily telenovelas, or soap operas. In later years she divided her time between Mexico City and Miami, but refused to retire.         Earlier this year the Mexican Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences awarded her a lifetime achievement award. At the time of her death she was playing a Mother Superior in ''Angelface,'' a popular telenovela.         Ms. Lamarque is survived by her daughter, Mirtha Romero Lamarque, of Argentina.       
         Esther Bradford Aresty, a collector of rare books on etiquette and the culinary arts, subjects to which she added her own work as a noted author, died Saturday at a nursing home in Princeton, N.J. A former resident of Trenton and Princeton, she was 92.         Mrs. Aresty's shelf-lined home was the repository of a fabled trove of books and unpublished manuscripts of recipes, advice on etiquette and household hints. Spanning five centuries, they now fill the Esther B. Aresty Collection on the Culinary Arts at the University of Pennsylvania.         In a 1960 profile of Mrs. Aresty in The New York Times, Craig Claiborne acclaimed the trove as ''one of the finest collections of rare books ever assembled.'' Among its jewels is a Venetian manuscript from 1475, which, Mr. Claiborne wrote, ''is believed to be the first cookbook ever printed.''         There is a work by Platina, who established the Vatican Library. There is also an Elizabethan manuscript that Mrs. Aresty said ''belonged to a butcher in Cheapside.''         One of her proudest possessions held no recipes but instead contained an encomium in rhyme by Frederick the Great of Prussia, imprinted in 1772. Dedicated to his cook, it was so rare that even his bibliographers had missed it.         Mrs. Aresty began her collection after World War II when she frequently traveled overseas with her husband, Julian Aresty, a prosperous retail executive who shared her enthusiasm for history.         An accomplished cook herself, she began to write her own recipes. Some of them were modern adaptations of offerings from two volumes by J. Bedingfield of 1730 and 1744.         From cookery, it was just a short turn to table manners and etiquette in general. A former freelance writer, she wrote three books on food and etiquette.         ''The Delectable Past'' (1964) was a history of kitchens, recipes and culinary tastes starting with the Roman Empire. ''The Best Behavior'' (1970) traced what were deemed good manners from the ancient Egyptians to Emily Post. (The New York Post serialized it that year.) ''The Exquisite Table'' (1980) examined French cuisine.         She was born Esther Bradford, the daughter of Lithuanian immigrants, in Syracuse and grew up in Iowa. She dropped out of Purdue University while still in her teens and wrote advertising and radio copy in Chicago and radio scripts for ''The Elsa Maxwell Show'' in New York.         She also contributed articles to children's magazines and cookbooks and wrote a novel for young adults, ''The Great Venture'' (1963).         Mrs. Aresty is survived by a son, Robert, and a daughter, Jane Silverman, both of Princeton; and three grandchildren. Julian Aresty, known as Jules, died last year.         Her cookbook manuscript by Chr. Maddison, dated June 24, 1675, cautioned the user: ''Eschue lewd lust if thou be wise, hot spice and wines forebeare.''         ''Something happens to my nostrils in open-stack libraries,'' she confided in a 1970 interview. ''Book dust sets them quivering and sends me flipping.''         In fact, she once got a check from her husband to buy herself a mink jacket and returned home in triumph with a precious Elizabethan book.       
         Karen McCready, a print publisher, gallery owner and writer, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 54 and had homes in Manhattan and Warwick, N.Y.         The cause was colon cancer, said her husband, Jean Yves Noblet.         Ms. McCready was born in Beaver Falls, Pa., and grew up in Dallas. In 1968 she graduated from Austin College in Sherman, Tex., with a degree in art and worked in the window design department of Neiman Marcus. Moving to New York in the early 1970's she joined Pace Editions, the print-publishing arm of the Pace Gallery (now PaceWildenstein) in 1972.         In 1982 she became director of the New York branch of Crown Point Press, a San Francisco print publisher that has published prints by Wayne Thiebaud, John Cage, Pat Steir and Tom Marioni.         In 1989 Ms. McCready married Mr. Noblet, a fine-art printer, and in 1995 she opened a gallery, Karen McCready Fine Arts, in half of his print studio, Noblet Serigraphie, in a large second-floor loft on West 13th Street in Greenwich Village.         They often collaborated, inviting artists to make prints with Mr. Noblet. Ms. McCready would publish the prints and exhibit them in her gallery. The artists they worked with included Sandy Gellis, Julia Jacquette, Lorna Simpson and Georgia Marsh.         An avid collector of ceramics, especially white porcelain, Ms. McCready was widely knowledgeable in many areas of the fine and applied arts. Her books included ''Porcelain Traditions and New Visions,'' written with Jan Axel (Watson-Guptil, 1981) and ''Art Deco and Modernist Ceramics'' (Thames and Hudson, 1995).         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her brother, Robert McCready of Manhattan, and her mother, Ellen McCready of Dallas.       
         Jane Troxell Stark, a dealer in exotic fabrics and jewelry who was a fashion editor for magazines including Glamour, died last Saturday outside Mexico City. She was 86 and lived in Alexandria, Va., and San Miguel, Mexico.         Mrs. Stark honed her sense of fashion in the college shop at Lord & Taylor and as a fashion photographer for the B. Altman department store in New York.         In the 1950's and early 1960's, she edited fashion pages at Charm, Glamour and Look magazines. She returned to Lord & Taylor in 1963 as vice president for advertising and window display, a position from which she retired in 1971.         She then set up shop in Tangier, Morocco, to produce caftan dresses for the American market. She also pursued a venture in Mexico, where she designed jewelry of gold, silver and other local materials.         Jane Troxell was born in Bronxville, N.Y., and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1936.         Her husband, Col. Richard S. Stark, died in 1986 after 40 years of marriage. She is survived by her son from an earlier marriage, John P. Treadwell of Chevy Chase, Md.; a stepson, Morgan B. Stark of Manhattan; two sisters, Elizabeth T. Rice of La Canada Flintridge, Calif., and Nancy T. Shepard of St. Paul; and four grandchildren.       
         Marvel Jackson Cooke, who has been described as the first black woman to work for a white-owned mainstream newspaper, died on Nov. 29 in Manhattan. She was 99 and was a longtime resident of Sugar Hill, Harlem.         Born in Mankato, Minn., and a graduate of the University of Minnesota, Marvel Jackson moved to New York in 1926 and worked as secretary for W. E. B. DuBois, editor of The Crisis, the magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Later, she worked for The Amsterdam News and The People's Voice in Harlem.         At The Amsterdam News, she helped organize a unit of the American Newspaper Guild, which struck for 11 weeks in 1935. On the picket line, she met Benjamin J. Davis, later a New York City Council member, who invited her to join the Communist Party.         In 1949, she went to work for The Daily Compass, a successor to the experimental newspaper PM. ''There were no black workers there and no women,'' Ms. Cooke said in 1988. At the time of her hiring, The Chicago Defender, a black-owned paper, called Ms. Cooke the first black woman to get a job as a reporter on a mainstream white-owned paper.         Ms. Cooke's race helped her gain access to certain news events. On one occasion, she was assigned to write about killings committed by a young black man who had been sent home to Brownsville, Brooklyn, from a prison for the criminally insane. The family talked to her while the community barred The Compass's white reporter, Ms. Cooke told Kay Mills in an interview for a 1988 book, ''A Place in the News: From the Women's Pages to the Front Page.''         Ms. Cooke wrote a series about the exploitation of domestic workers. She went to a pickup point in the Bronx to be hired with others seeking work by the day. Some on the corner warned her about employers who turned clocks back so they could pay less, even though the pay was only 80 cents an hour. Sure enough, the woman who hired her tried this trick, but Ms. Cooke insisted on being paid for the full five hours of scrubbing and ironing.         The Compass promoted the series with truck signs that said: ''Read: I Was a Slave, by Marvel Cooke.''         After The Compass closed on Nov. 3, 1952, Ms. Cooke left journalism and worked for left-leaning organizations like the Committee for the Arts, Sciences and Professions and, later, the Angela Davis Defense Fund.         Ms. Cooke's husband, Cecil Cooke, died in 1978. She is survived by a sister, Helen Wilkins Claytor of Grand Rapids, Mich., a former national president of the Y.W.C.A.
