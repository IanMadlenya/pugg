         Peggy Lee, whose sultry singing style set standards for pop jazz sophistication for more than half a century, died on Monday night at her home in Los Angeles. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Nicki Lee Foster. Ms. Lee had surmounted many medical problems to continue performing until the last few years.         She was billed throughout most of her career as Miss Peggy Lee (and, in fact, she insisted on it). In the golden age of big bands she was a singer of renown with Benny Goodman's orchestra and she went on to become a top nightclub singer, a prolific recording artist, a successful songwriter and an actress skillful enough to be nominated for an Oscar.         Duke Ellington called her ''the Queen.'' She was a weaver of moods and colors, her misty voice conveying impeccable rhythmic subtlety and smoldering sexuality. In a world of belters, she was a minimalist who eliminated any hint of the extraneous in both her voice and gestures, and she could stir audiences with an understated phrase more than most singers could by shouting and stomping.         Stephen Holden, a movie and cabaret critic for The New York Times, described her image as ''Billie Holiday meets Mae West.''         Miss Lee made more than 700 recordings and more than 60 albums. Her own favorite album, ''The Man I Love,'' was recorded in 1957 with arrangements by Nelson Riddle and an orchestra conducted by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra was so intimately involved with the album that he obtained some menthol to make Miss Lee's eyes look properly misty for the cover photograph.         She is credited with having a hand in writing more than 200 songs, in most cases as a lyricist. Among the hits she wrote were ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me).'' Her name is indelibly linked with a number of songs, including ''Golden Earrings,'' ''Fever,'' ''Lover,'' ''Big Spender,'' ''You're My Thrill,'' ''I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' ''Them There Eyes'' and the haunting Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller tune that became her signature in later years, ''Is That All There Is?''         ''She makes her listeners feel cherished,'' Whitney Balliett wrote of her in The New Yorker. ''Her singing lulls you, and it is easy to forget how daring it is. Many singers confuse shouting with emotion. Peggy Lee sends her feelings down the quiet center of her notes.''         ''She is a subtle and brilliant showman,'' he added. ''She can slink, arch an eyebrow, pull out a hip and rest a hand on it, half smile, wave wandlike arms, bump, tilt her head and slouch -- all to dazzling, precise effect.''         Miss Lee was named Norma Deloris Egstrom at her birth on May 27, 1920, in Jamestown, N.D. She was the sixth of seven children of Marvin and Selma Egstrom. Her father was a railroad station agent who drank too much. His job kept the family moving from town to town in lonely parts of North Dakota. Her mother died when she was 4 and her father remarried. Five-year-old Norma was brutally abused by her stepmother, who would hit her over the head with an iron skillet, beat her with a razor strap and drag her around by her hair. By the age of 7, she was keeping house, baking, cooking, cleaning and milking cows.         There was never any doubt in her mind that she would become a singer. ''I had always sung -- I sang before I could talk,'' she reminisced in her 1989 autobiography, ''Miss Peggy Lee'' (Donald I. Fine). She was 14 when she made her professional debut at a local radio station in Jamestown and was still a teenager when a program director at a radio station in Fargo gave her a job and her stage name. The job paid $1.50 for each noonday show. To make ends meet, she worked a 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift in a bakery, slicing and wrapping bread for 35 cents an hour.         A friend who had gone to California suggested she join her. She sold the watch her father had given her at her high school graduation for $30, bought a train ticket and arrived in Hollywood with $18. She got a brief singing engagement in a supper club but mostly worked as a waitress before returning to North Dakota. She found work singing for a radio station in Fargo, then as a singer in Minneapolis with Will Osborne's band.         Miss Lee was discovered in Chicago in 1941 by Benny Goodman, who was looking for a replacement for his vocalist, Helen Forrest, who was leaving to join Artie Shaw's band. He heard her sing ''These Foolish Things'' at the Ambassador West Hotel and called the next day, offering her the job. She had a cold the first night she appeared, the critics were unkind, and she wanted to quit. Goodman refused to let her go and she stayed on, at $75 a week.         Later that year, the band played the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, and Miss Lee recalled in her autobiography how awed she had been to see Franchot Tone dancing by with Joan Crawford, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne chatting at their table with Katharine Cornell, and Gary Cooper joking with Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.         It was Miss Lee's sulky rendition of ''Why Don't You Do Right?'' with the Goodman band in 1942 that made her a star. She sang the Joe McCoy song in a voice that demonstrated she could sing of hard times as well as anybody; her version became one of the the biggest selling records in the country:         You had plenty money nineteen twen'y-two         You let other women make a fool of you         Why don't you do right         Like some other men do?         Get out of here and get me some money, too.         Peggy Lee's tour with the Goodman band lasted less than two years but the collaboration made her one of the most famous female vocalists of the time and put her on the road to fame.         In 1943, Miss Lee left Goodman to marry Dave Barbour, the band's guitarist, with whom she collaborated on a number of hits, including ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana,'' a 1948 blockbuster that sold more than two million records and began her long association with Latin-flavored music.         Her swirling 1952 version of the Richard Rodgers waltz ''Lover'' and her 1958 interpretation of ''Fever'' in six-eight time solidified her reputation as one of the most rhythmically inventive and versatile vocalists in pop.         She made her film debut in 1950, playing a minor role in ''Mr. Music,'' and went on, in 1953, to play a featured role opposite Danny Thomas in a remake of ''The Jazz Singer.'' Her performance as an alcoholic blues singer in ''Pete Kelly's Blues'' (1955) won her an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress.         In 1959 she wrote the lyrics for a Duke Ellington song, ''I'm Gonna Go Fishing,'' for the film ''Anatomy of a Murder.''         She also wrote theme music for the movies ''Johnny Guitar'' and ''About Mrs. Leslie,'' and supplied voices for several characters and sang three songs in the 1952 Walt Disney animated film ''Lady and the Tramp.'' She was paid $3,500 by Disney and no royalties. When Disney marketed a videocassette without her consent, she sued the company. In 1992, after a four-year court battle, she was awarded $2.3 million.         Another lawsuit over royalties neared an end last week in Los Angeles, when a superior court judge gave preliminary approval for a $4.75-million settlement between Universal Music Group and several hundred recording artists whose lead plaintiff was Miss Lee. Universal acquired Miss Lee's contract and many others through a series of record company mergers over the years. The suit asserted that Universal had cheated artists by underreporting sales figures and overcharging for services. The company has admitted no wrongdoing, and language in the settlement bars both sides from commenting.         Peggy Lee was a perfectionist who planned every aspect of her performances right down to her hairdos, her costly gowns, her lighting, her entrances and exits, even the movement of her hands. She always appeared with first-rate musicians, including the drummer Grady Tate. For decades, because of respiratory problems that began with a bout of viral pneumonia in 1958, she kept oxygen in her dressing room, and she used it between sets.         Miss Lee's performances at Basin Street East in Manhattan beginning in 1959 were credited by Newsweek with ''single-handedly reviving the supper club business.'' Count Basie, Tallulah Bankhead, Cary Grant, Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald were some of the notables who crowded in every night. With more than 600 people in a space meant for 450, a club representative recalled later, ''we had to hire only skinny waiters.''         Her appearances at the Ballroom, a club in Chelsea, were also treated as events.         Miss Lee was married five times, but her great love, she acknowledged, was her first husband and collaborator, Mr. Barbour. He was the father of her only child, Nicki Lee Foster, of Sun Valley, Idaho. In addition to Ms. Foster, she is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Miss Lee described Mr. Barbour in her autobiography as a self-destructive alcoholic. They were married in 1943 and she said in a 1982 interview that he asked her for a divorce in 1951, ''because he didn't want his daughter to see him with his problem.'' In 1965, after Mr. Barbour had been sober for many years, they decided to remarry, but a few days later he died.         Her second marriage, in 1955, to Brad Dexter, an actor, lasted less than a year, and her third, in 1956, to Dewey Martin, also an actor, ended in divorce in 1959. A fourth marriage, in 1964, to Jack Del Rio, a bandleader, also lasted less than a year.         Besides chronic respiratory problems, Miss Lee encountered a number of serious illnesses and accidents over the years.         Late in the 1970's, she returned to San Francisco from a European tour so ill she was immediately hospitalized. Doctors informed her she had a bad heart, diabetes and a disorder of the inner ear; she also went blind temporarily. She was told to retire but went to Australia on tour instead.         She had double-bypass heart surgery in 1985. Two years later she fell onstage at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and fractured her pelvis. When she recovered, she fell again in the marble bathroom of her home in Bel Air section of Los Angeles, injuring the vertebrae in her lower spine.         Still she performed.         ''Peg,'' her musical autobiography, had a hard time on Broadway in 1983, and closed after 13 previews and five performances. It was a rare failure.         She usually appeared in slinky satin or form-fitting glittering gowns, drop-dead dangling earrings and large round tinted glasses. Later, a shoulder length white-blond wig covered her champagne-blond hair. Still later, she used a jeweled cane and often performed sitting down like Mabel Mercer. She had more heart problems in the early 1990's, her daughter said, and suffered a stroke in 1998 that left her bedridden. In 1992, Mr. Holden reviewed a Peggy Lee performance in New York for The Times and wrote that ''her will power, musicality and professionalism enable her to project a fair degree of the old magic.''         In 1990, she received the Pied Piper Award of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers,  Ascap's highest accolade, given for lifetime achievement.         During her last decade, she tried to retire several times. She painted (one of her paintings hung on the wall of Les Célébrités, a former restaurant in the Essex House in Manhattan), grew roses, watched nature programs on television, was active in the Science of Mind spiritual group,  and listened to Ray Charles, Sinatra, Debussy and Chopin. But it wasn't enough. So she would reappear periodically in smaller settings, basking in the warmth of her audiences.         Obituary       
         Raji Jallepalli-Reiss, a chef credited with originating the fusion of classic French and Indian cuisines, died on Jan. 27 at her home in Memphis. She was 52.         The cause was cancer, according to The Commercial Appeal of Memphis.         As the executive chef of the Indian restaurant Tamarind on East 22nd Street in Manhattan, she combined essential elements of classic French cuisine with Indian ingredients and spices, thereby touching off what has been called the French-Indian fusion movement in gastronomy.         Tamarind opened on Jan. 1, 2001. Its owner, Avtar Walia, said that Ms. Jallepalli-Reiss came to Tamarind regularly from Memphis, where she owned Restaurant Raji.         The restaurant critic William Grimes gave Tamarind a rating of two stars in reviewing it in The New York Times in April 2001. He called the restaurant, with its multiregional menu, ''a clear-cut victory for the cause of Indian food.''         He said the chef had ''helped develop a menu that treats Indian cuisine as a genuine culinary language, like French, able to assimilate nontraditional ingredients and techniques.''         Ms. Jallepalli-Reiss was a co-author, with Judith Choate, of a cookbook, ''Raji Cuisine: Indian Flavors, French Passion'' (Harper Collins, 2000).         She was born in India, and came to the United States in 1969.         Her marriage to Dr. Panduranga Jallepalli ended in divorce. She is survived by her second husband, Dr. Louis Reiss; two sons, Dr. Prasad Jallepalli and Satish Jallepalli; two stepdaughters, Shauna and Stephanie Reiss; her mother, Radha Rampalli; and three sisters, Padma, Sita and Vijayanti Rampalli.       
         Mari Kajiwara, an American modern dancer of stunning quality who mesmerized audiences as a leading member of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Ohad Naharin Dance Company and the Batsheva Dance Company of Israel, died on Dec. 25 in Tel Aviv. She was 50 and had lived in Tel Aviv since Mr. Naharin, her husband and an internationally known choreographer, became artistic director of Batsheva 12 years ago.         The cause was cancer, said a company spokesman.         In the Ailey company, which she joined in 1970, Ms. Kajiwara made an immediate striking impression with technique that was both pure and powerful, enhanced by a luminous presence. Trained in both ballet and modern dance, especially Martha Graham's idiom, she combined an extended classical line with an extreme suppleness.         Ailey created ''Landscape'' (1981) as a vehicle for her. It was a theatricalized ritual in which Ms. Kajiwara was rightly the adored figure. In other Ailey works, she carved distinct shape out of space, describing the form of every movement as few others could. Her extended line made the most of Ailey's ''Streams'' and the ''Fix Me, Jesus'' duet in ''Revelations.''         Other choreographers for the company cast her eagerly in their works. She triumphed in Joyce Trisler's ''Journey,'' where she remained rooted to the spot, all the while spellbinding in her yearning gestures. She brought a similar poetry to the very different role of the idealized woman conjured up by a chain gang in Donald McKayle's ''Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder.''         Despite a natural reticence, she imbued other roles in the Ailey troupe with an emotional depth that seemed to grow out of the very depth of her consummate technique.         Ms. Kajiwara was born in New York City, where she attended the High School of Performing Arts and City College. She performed with the Glen Tetley Dance Company and the Norman Walker Dance Company before dancing with the Ailey troupe from 1970 to 1984. During that time, she became an assistant to Ailey, who sent her to stage his works for the Royal Danish Ballet, La Scala Ballet and other companies.         After Ms. Kajiwara and Mr. Naharin married in 1978, she appeared with him in a series of concerts. In  ''Haru No Umi,'' a duet choreographed by Mr. Naharin in 1982, Ms. Kajiwara embodied love lost, poignantly eluding her husband onstage. Together they formed the Ohad Naharin Dance Company in New York in 1984, performing with it until 1990.         When Mr. Naharin, who was born in Israel, became Batsheva's artistic director in 1990, Ms. Kajiwara joined the company as both dancer and rehearsal director. She staged her husband's works for the Netherlands Dance Theater, the Paris Opera Ballet, the Frankfurt Ballet, the Cullberg Ballet, the Lyons Opera Ballet and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens.         In Mr. Naharin's works, the eloquence of Ms. Kajiwara's humanity was seen within a more experimental style. In ''Sixty a Minute,'' she and Mr. Naharin acted out a battle of the sexes by falling against a piano keyboard. In ''Mabul,'' Mr. Naharin's turbulent signature piece at Batsheva, she dropped her reserve and danced up a storm.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Kajiwara is survived by a brother, John, of New York City.       
         Sylvia Rivera, who helped lead the charge -- in makeup and full voice -- at the birth of the modern gay liberation movement, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. She was 50 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was liver cancer, said the Rev. Pat Bumgardner of the Metropolitan Community Church of New York, where Ms. Rivera was coordinator of the food pantry.         ''I'm not missing a minute of this -- it's the revolution!'' Ms. Rivera shouted to her lover on the morning of June 28, 1969, when patrons of the Stonewall Inn violently rebuffed a police raid, setting a new militant tone for the gay rights movement.         Having been initiated into prostitution on 42nd Street as a boy (she was born Ray Rivera), she worried about ''kids who started to hustle on the streets, as she had, at age 10 or 11 and, within a few years, were dead from a stabbing or an overdose or were locked into dead-end lives,'' Martin Duberman wrote in ''Stonewall'' (Dutton, 1993).         With Marsha P. Johnson, Ms. Rivera opened a short-lived shelter on East Second Street called STAR House, for Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries.         Ms. Rivera often tangled with gay political leaders who favored a more conventional public front. When the Gay Activists Alliance eliminated transvestites from its civil rights agenda in the early 70's, she turned on the group, Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney wrote in ''Out for Good'' (Simon & Schuster, 1999). ''Hell hath no fury like a drag queen scorned,'' she warned.         But she became less of a force to be reckoned with as she slipped into drug addiction, hustling and homelessness. By the early 1990's, she was living on a pier in the West Village.         Five years ago, however, she found a home at Transy House, a private shelter for transgendered people in Park Slope, Brooklyn, patterned on STAR House. There, she met her partner, Julia Murray, who was with her yesterday at her death.         Over the years, there were reconciliations with the mainstream gay rights movement. In 1994, Ms. Rivera was given a place of honor in the march marking the 25th anniversary of Stonewall.         ''The movement had put me on the shelf, but they took me down and dusted me off,'' she said in a 1995 interview with The New York Times. ''Still, it was beautiful. I walked down 58th Street and the young ones were calling from the sidewalk, 'Sylvia, Sylvia, thank you, we know what you did.' After that I went back on the shelf. It would be wonderful if the movement took care of its own. But don't worry about Sylvia.''       
         Theresa Bernstein, who as a member of the Ash Can School of realistic painting was both hailed and flailed for ''painting like a man'' in the 1910's and then continued to generate vibrant canvases for eight more decades, died in Manhattan on Tuesday. She was generally believed to be 111 and lived in Manhattan and Gloucester, Mass.         She died at Mount Sinai Hospital, Suzanne Laurier, a friend for 23 years, said. Ms. Laurier said she had reason to believe Ms. Bernstein may have been as much as five years older, a view others echo.         Ms. Bernstein, who has no survivors, was never particularly helpful on the subject.         ''I'm old enough to keep it to myself,'' she said in an interview with The Boston Globe in 1998.         Her paintings now sell for $100,000  in galleries. She originally gained recognition as one of the first women to paint in the Realist style, favoring the informal composition and contemporary subject matter typical of the movement. She hardly advertised her sex: she signed her gritty paintings of urban scenes with her last name or ''T. Bernstein.''         Indeed, at the beginning of her career, the important thing to some seemed to be that she had somehow transcended being a woman.         ''It is with a man's vision that this artist looks at her subjects -- in the streets, the elevated trains, at the beaches, in the parks, the lobbies of theaters, in seaport places or in a church,'' Frederick James Gregg wrote in The New York Herald in a review of her first solo show in 1919.         ''Then having found what she wants, it is with a man's vigor that she gets it down to stay,'' he continued.         Writing in the American Art Review in April 2001, Patricia M. Burnham countered that Ms. Bernstein, for all her so-called ''masculine'' vigor, showed a decidedly feminine sensibility.         ''She saw as a woman, perceived the city and its hustle and bustle very much from a woman's point of view,'' she wrote. ''As a result, she incorporated into her art types and activities ignored by her male counterparts: women readers using the New York Public Library, traveling unchaperoned on the el, making hats, creating art in the company of other women, applying for jobs.''         Others insist that her work, as particularly evidenced by her forceful brush strokes, spoke for itself.         ''She was just a great painter, period,'' said Jan Ramirez, director of the New-York Historical Society's museum.         When Ms. Ramirez organized an exhibition of Ms. Bernstein's work in 1991, in her previous job as a curator at the Museum of the City of New York, it was Ms. Bernstein's first museum exhibition since 1948. There have since been museum exhibitions in Philadelphia, Boston and Stamford, Conn., and three one-person shows at Joan Whalen Fine Art in Manhattan.         Her paintings are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, the Chicago Art Institute, the New York Public Library and the Brooklyn Museum. She has had more than 40 solo exhibitions.         Ms. Bernstein admitted to being born on March 1, 1890, according to several published accounts. But Ms. Laurier, who knew Ms. Bernstein's husband of 62 years, the painter and etcher William Meyerowitz, said he told her and others that his wife was two years older than he was; if so, she would have turned 116 in two weeks.         Records of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women indicate, however, that Ms. Bernstein enrolled in 1907 at age 17, making her 111 at her death.         Her father was a textile manufacturer and her mother an accomplished pianist. As a girl, she made several trips to Europe with her mother and was impressed by Expressionist painters like Edvard Munch. After attending the Philadelphia art school, now the Moore College of Art and Design, she moved to New York and joined the Art Students League, where she studied portrait painting with William Merritt Chase.         She met Mr. Meyerowitz when he noticed one of her paintings at a show and dropped by to ask her for a donation to a charity that gave artworks to the poor.         ''Oh, I thought you were an older man,'' Mr. Meyerowitz said to Ms. Bernstein, who was then probably 29. She gave him several paintings, and their courtship started. Shortly after they were married, she had a baby girl named Isadora, who died two months later.         The two often painted side by side, but Mr. Meyerowitz was much more publicly prominent. Three years after his death, she revealed hundreds of her own paintings.         When she visited the Museum of the City of New York in the late 1980's to discuss a possible exhibition of her husband's work, curators decided to exhibit her work instead.         ''All told, his subject matter is not in any way revolutionary,'' Ms. Ramirez said. ''She was far more the iconoclast of the two.''         She loved to paint groups of people. Her studies of suffrage parades in 1912 led to a series of works from 1916 to 1919 that documented the patriotic displays of World War I. She became close to members of The Eight, as the Ashcan School was also called, and her urban landscapes reflected this influence.         She was also associated with the Philadelphia 10, a group of women who had studied art in Philadelphia.         Her early reputation was suggested by a review in The New York Times on March 13, 1927, comparing the emotions evoked by her art to ''this little cavorting fling that reminds one of colts in pasture.''         By the 1930's, she did not follow the art world toward greater abstraction, though her husband did. Even as her palate exploded with inspired colors -- salmon skies and chartreuse cheeks -- her mission became one of breaking down the barrier between high art and everyday people.         ''In some ways, Bernstein is a Thornton Wilder of the canvas, '' Ms. Burnham wrote, offering ''consoling and nostalgic images to viewers of the 21st century.''         Her determination was legendary. When she broke her right hand, she painted with her left. When she could no longer hold a brush, she painted by squirting paint from tubes.         And she never lost her eye for a touching scene. On a Valentine's Day several years ago, Ms. Laurier pushed her wheelchair past a store where a couple were kissing in the window as part of a promotion.         ''Get my sketch pad,'' Ms. Bernstein commanded.       
         Esther Afua Ocloo, who as a young woman turned a gift of less than a dollar into 12 jars of marmalade -- which she sold for a profit -- and went on to become one of Ghana's leading entrepreneurs and a prominent exponent of the role of women in economic development, died on Feb. 8 in Accra, Ghana. She was 83.         Her husband, Stephen, said she  died of pneumonia in Accra Military Hospital.         As the first chairwoman of Women's World Banking, Ms. Ocloo was one of the pioneers of microlending, the financing of homespun businesses, predominantly run by women, through very small loans, sometimes as little as $50. If a business prospers and the loan is repaid -- as more than 98 percent are -- then a larger loan is made available.         Large lending institutions give microlending institutions, like Women's World Banking, big loans of, say, $5 million. The money is then parceled out in small loans, at interest rates slightly higher than normal commercial bank rates, for enterprises as simple as drying fish.         Nancy Barry, president of Women's World Banking, said that 25 million people, three-quarters of them women, had received microloans in more than 40 less-developed countries. Half the loans are from Women's World Banking.         The idea was born at the 1975 Mexico City conference that proclaimed the United Nations Decade for Women. Ms. Ocloo found that ideas she had been developing with women in Ghana were also percolating elsewhere. The premise was simple: more than education, health care or family planning, women in poor countries need money in their pockets.         The other early leaders in the movement were Michaela Walsh, a New York investment banker, and Ela Bhatt, founder of a cooperative bank for illiterate women in India. They and several allies founded Women's World Banking in 1979 with Ms. Ocloo as chairwoman.         Ms. Barry said that concentrating on women made sense because they are discriminated against in borrowing; they do the majority of artisanal work and much of the farming, and they have a keener sense of the interdependence of generations.         Ms. Ocloo, in a speech in 1990, gave a starkly practical explanation.         ''Women must know that the strongest power in the world is economic power,'' she said. ''You cannot go and be begging to your husband for every little thing, but at the moment, that's what the majority of our women do.''         Esther Afua Nkulenu was born in  Peki-Dzake in the Volta region of Ghana on April 18, 1919. Her parents were poor farmers, but she was able to attend high school with the help of scholarships offered to young women by Cadbury, the chocolate company, which was a major buyer of Ghana's cocoa crop.         Her mother, with tears in her eyes, sent her off to Accra with just a sixpence. After graduating, she lived with relatives in the city. An aunt gave her 10 shillings, worth less than one United States dollar. She bought sugar, firewood, oranges and 12 jars, and made marmalade jam, which she sold for a shilling a jar.         ''I was ridiculed by all my classmates, who saw me hawking marmalade on the street like an uneducated street vendor,'' rather than seeking an office job, she said.         But she plowed her profits back into the business. She also took some of her marmalade to her old high school and won a contract to supply the entire school. Soon, school officials asked her to supply orange juice from orange trees on its grounds.         She next got a contract to supply juice to the military, but lacked the necessary funds to produce it. Though she had no collateral, she persuaded a bank to give her a loan on the basis of the contract. The result was her company, Nkulenu Industries, which grew to produce products like canned tomatoes and soup bases.         After six years, she had saved enough money to go to Britain to study food technology, preservation, nutrition and agriculture. She also learned leatherwork and lampshade-making in the hope of sharing the skills with rural women back home.         Even as she continued running her own company upon her return, she devoted more and more of her time to improving women's economic situation. For example, she established her own program on a farm to train women in agriculture, preparing and preserving food products and making handicrafts.         She paid for the program in part with her half of the Africa Prize, a $100,000 award she split with Olusegun Obasanjo, the current president of Nigeria, in 1990. It was presented by the Hunger Project for their leadership in working to end hunger in Africa.         She liked to keep things simple, as when she taught business management skills to women involved in cooking and selling food on the streets.         ''I have taught them to cost the things they sell and determine their profits,'' she said. ''You know what we found? We found that a woman selling rice and stew on the side of the street is making more money than most women in office jobs -- but they are not taken seriously.''         Ms. Ocloo, who always wore bright African clothes and loved to cook traditional meals, preferred to be known as Auntie Ocloo, in the Ghanaian tradition. She usually began meetings of bankers and others with a prayer, and often ended them with a song: ''We Are Wonderful.''         The day she entered the hospital she gave a speech urging women to carry on her campaign for micro-lending. Days before she died, she was on the phone from her hospital bed to governmental officials arguing that microloans, rather than grants, should be specified in Ghana's new budget.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her sister, Georgina Nkulenu; her daughter, Vincentia Canacco; her sons Vincent Malm, Christian Biassey and Stephen Jr., and six grandchildren.         She once said her children complained that the women she trained competed against her.         ''I don't listen,'' she said. ''My main goal is to help my fellow women. If they make better marmalade than me, I deserve the competition.''       
         Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, who emerged as a popular, prolific writer of keenly observed nonfiction with a 1978 book about the dozen years she spent as a Jehovah's Witness, died on Wednesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 67 and lived in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn.         The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said her daughter, Anna Harrison. She once wrote that for years she smoked six packs of cigarettes a day.         The turning point in her life and career was her decision, at 22, to leave the Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade a college education. What followed was a successful self-education and a blossoming into a multifaceted writer of literate travel books, many essays and reviews, and a novel.         With ''Visions of Glory: A History and a Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Simon & Schuster), she became nationally known; her later work, mostly nonfiction, usually received excellent reviews.         In The New York Times Book Review, Vivian Gornick said ''Visions of Glory'' was ''quite well written, contains a mass of absorbing information, and the personality of its author is extremely appealing.''         Ms. Harrison was converted to the Jehovah's Witnesses faith by her mother when she was 9; she went door to door carrying its message. At 19, she went to live and work at its world headquarters, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society in Brooklyn Heights.         After three years there, she renounced the faith and left.         ''Visions of Glory'' mixes her autobiography with detailed historical research. She portrays the religion as racist, sexist and totalitarian, but also details members' kindness to one another, their care for the elderly and their courage in the face of persecution.         Barbara Grizzuti was born in Jamaica, Queens, on Sept. 14, 1934. She grew up in various Brooklyn neighborhoods, mainly Bensonhurst. Her father, a printer, and her brother, Richard, did not become Jehovah's Witnesses, creating a deep fault line in the household. She wrote of an extremely disorganized family, and of a father who sexually abused her and once tried to kill her.         As a young teenager, Barbara already knew she wanted to be a writer. When asked in an interview in ''Contemporary Authors'' how she could reconcile this ambition with the tenets of the Jehovah's Witnesses, she suggested that the religion's images of the watery creation of the world and its imminent bloody destruction stimulated her imagination.         ''I think the two things were going on simultaneously: the religion encouraged something it was bound to squash,'' she said.         In her autobiography, ''An Accidental Autobiography'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1996), she wrote, ''I read Sartre in my late teens and made the mistake of taking him seriously.''         After leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses, she moved to the East Village and worked as a secretary at a publishing house and at the American Committee on Africa. There she met W. Dale Harrison, whom she married. He took a job with CARE, and they lived in Libya, India and Guatemala.         They returned to Brooklyn with their two children, and she wrote that she thought of herself as ''one of those furtive, silly housewives with a novel under her apron.''         Her first book, ''Unlearning the Lie: Sexism in School'' (Liveright, 1969), grew out of the children's experiences with efforts to quell sexism at what was then the Woodward Park School in Brooklyn.         The Harrisons divorced in 1968 after eight years of marriage.         Ms. Harrison was an early writer for Ms. Magazine. Often described as a gifted interviewer, she contributed to many other national magazines and newspapers. She was noted for her humor and her strong opinions; she once called the highly regarded novelist Joan Didion a ''neurasthenic Cher.''         Her other books included ''Italian Days'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1989), an impressionistic and literary travel book about Italy that won the American Book Award, and a novel, ''Foreign Bodies'' (Doubleday, 1984).         Ms. Harrison is survived by her daughter, who lives in Bethlehem, Conn., and her son, Josh Harrison of Manhattan.         Her daughter said her mother returned to the religion of her early childhood, Roman Catholicism, in her 40's, partly as a result of interviewing Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement and partly because she hoped to meet in heaven the high school English teacher who had first appreciated her writing.       
         Ruth Handler, creator of the Barbie doll, one of the world's best-selling toys and one that became an icon of American popular culture, an artistic muse and a lightning rod of feminist politics, died on Saturday at a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 85.         Mrs. Handler experienced complications after having colon surgery several months ago, said her husband, Elliot.         In 1959 when she invented Barbie, a busty figure with platinum-blond hair and piercing blue eyes, Mrs. Handler created the country's first mass-marketed adult-looking doll for girls -- and an image that would later be attacked by feminists as a symbol of objectification and repression. Critics said the doll gave girls misguided goals, whether for their careers or for their own physical development.         Mrs. Handler, though, seemed unmoved, her husband said. ''It really didn't bother her,'' he said. ''She thought they were wrong.''         Mrs. Handler named the doll after her daughter. Barbie's male counterpart, Ken, named after Mrs. Handler's son, soon followed. More than one billion Barbies have been sold in 150 countries.         Barbie was a particularly pioneering creation because in 1959 innocent, cherubic baby dolls dominated the toy market. And Barbie's fly-off-the-shelf popularity transformed the sleepy company that sold the doll, Mattel Inc., into a postwar success story.         Mrs. Handler was a founder of Mattel and helped run the company for 30 years, until she and her husband, then co-chairmen, resigned in 1975 amid a scandal.         ''Every little girl needed a doll through which to project herself into her dream of her future,'' Mrs. Handler said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. ''If she was going to do role playing of what she would be like when she was 16 or 17, it was a little stupid to play with a doll that had a flat chest. So I gave it beautiful breasts.''         Barbie was conceived as a teenage fashion model, and her first outfits were named for her various activities, according to M. G. Lord, author of ''Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll.'' Early outfits included ''Friday Night Date'' and ''Sorority Meeting.''         And Barbie kept pace with the times. During Camelot, she sported a Jacqueline Kennedy hairdo. During the civil rights movement, Mattel created Barbie's first black friend, ''Colored Francie.''         But not until the 1970's, as the criticism from feminists materialized, did her career choices -- and her outfits -- begin to change to include a doctor, astronaut and veterinarian, among others.         A chief objection of feminists, including the National Organization for Women, was that Barbie's figure created unrealistic expectations for young girls that could lead to low self-esteem. People often joked that Barbie's measurements were not humanly possible. But in fact it was determined that if the 11 1/2-inch doll were 5-foot-6, her measurements would be 39-21-33. One academic expert calculated that a woman's chances of having Barbie's figure were less than 1 in 100,000.         In her 1994 autobiography, ''Dream Doll: The Ruth Handler Story,'' Mrs. Handler wrote: ''My whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little girl could be anything she wanted to be. Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices.''         In 1978 Mrs. Handler and several other former officers of Mattel were indicted on charges of fraud and false reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. She pleaded no contest to the charges, which investigators said resulted from attempts to influence stock prices, and was fined and sentenced to community service.         Mrs. Handler, though, had already embarked on a second career, starting a company that made prosthetic breasts for cancer survivors. In talking about her two careers, Mrs. Handler was known to say, ''I've lived my life from breast to breast.''         She was found to have breast cancer in 1970 and had her left breast removed. She said it was impossible to find an acceptable replacement breast. ''Until now,'' she said in 1977, ''every breast that was sold was used interchangeably for the right or the left side. There has never been a shoemaker who made one shoe and forced you to put both your right and your left foot in it.''         After developing a line of artificial breasts made of foam and silicon that she called ''Nearly Me,'' she became a well-traveled advocate for early detection of breast cancer, at a time when there was little public discussion of the disease. Mrs. Handler, who once described herself as a ''marketing genius,'' was often known during those years to open her blouse at interviews and ask a reporter or photographer to feel her breasts to determine which was real.         She ran the breast prosthesis company, Ruthton Corporation, for 15 years, fitting women, including Betty Ford, for the artificial breasts herself, before selling it to a division of Kimberly-Clark, her husband said. But she never made much of a profit.         ''She was working on that from the heart,'' Mr. Handler said.         The youngest of 10 children of Polish immigrants, Ruth Mosko was the daughter of a blacksmith who had settled in Denver. She left Denver for Hollywood at 19 and stayed, marrying her high school boyfriend, Mr. Handler, who became a specialist in designing plastic products.         The two, along with a short-term partner, founded Mattel in 1945. Inspired by her daughter's fascination with paper dolls that looked like teenagers or adults and came with multiple outfits and accessories, Mrs. Handler decided to produce a doll that she described as looking more or less like a real teenager.         The doll she created resembled a sex toy called Lilli, which Mrs. Handler had seen on a trip to Germany. After she battled years of prudish resistance to the Barbie concept among the male executives at Mattel, the doll was finally cleared for production. And in 1959, wearing a zebra-striped maillot and tall stiletto heels, Barbie made her debut at the American Toy Fair in New York.         Long After Mrs. Handler left Mattel and turned away from toys, Barbie remained wildly popular, not only as a toy, but as a touchstone of American culture. Barbie, sometimes wearing outfits and hairdos that might send shudders up Mrs. Handler's spine, has been the subject of art exhibitions, an Andy Warhol painting, a television documentary, books and Web sites, including Barbie.com and AdiosBarbie.com, a site dedicated to improving women's body images.         Mrs. Handler's son, Ken, died of a brain tumor in 1994. She is survived by her husband of 63 years; a daughter, Barbara Segal of Los Angeles; a brother, Aaron Mosko of Denver; five grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.       
         Christa M. Gaehde, a pioneer in the United States of effective techniques for conserving prints and drawings, died on April 3 in Arlington, Mass. She was 79 and lived in Arlington.         She died after being hit by a car in the street, said her husband, Joachim Gaehde, a retired professor of art history at Brandeis.         When Ms. Gaehde (the name is pronounced GAY-duh) arrived in the United States from Germany with her husband in 1949, only a handful of Americans knew anything about her specialty, the repair and preservation of artistic works on paper.         The whole field of restoring and repairing damaged artworks then had a bad name, with some of the techniques causing as many problems over time as they corrected in the short term. It was for this reason that Ms. Gaehde, who used to say that preservation was the essence of repair, always called herself a conservator rather than a restorer or repairer.         As a freelance specialist, she became the leading American expert on conserving artworks on paper, inspiring a generation of American conservators and encouraging the teaching of art conservation as an academic discipline.         Partly as a result of her work, all serious museums and libraries now employ trained conservationists, including specialists in books and works on paper. Several institutions began formal programs in art conservation, including New York University, in 1960. The University of Delaware's program at Winterthur followed in the mid-1960's, and State University of New York at Buffalo started its program in 1970.         Jonathan Rendell, an old print expert at Christie's in New York, called her a ''miracle-worker who inspired a whole movement,'' adding, ''She could bring things back from beyond the grave.''         Ms. Gaehde worked for many American museums, including the Guggenheim and the Museum of Modern Art in New York; the Baltimore Museum of Art; the Library of Congress, the Dumbarton Oaks Garden Library and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington; and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. She also did work for many collectors, dealers and auction houses, including Christie's and Sotheby's.         In 1965, she published ''A Guide to the Collecting and Care of Original Prints'' (Crown), written with Carl Zigrosser.         Christa Maria Schelcher was born on June 21, 1922, in Dresden, Germany. After studying chemistry at Innsbruck University in Austria, she returned to Dresden to study the chemistry of paper, inks and colors at the Technische Hochschule while also working in the print room at the State Gallery.         In 1946, she married Joachim Gaehde, and the couple settled in Munich, where she worked as a conservationist and became a friend of Max Schweidler, a legendary German paper conservator.         In 1949 the couple moved to New York, where she began her American career.         Ms. Gaehde acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of old papers and inks and devised many new ways of removing marks and stains without damaging the stability of the basic materials. She also made cunning use of pieces of old paper to patch and repair torn and damaged artworks.         She is survived by her husband and by two sons, Stephan, of Brookline, Mass., and Nicholas, of Concord, Mass.       
         Dorothy Love Coates, a gospel singer whose gruff delivery and blazing theatrics made her one of the giants of the genre, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Birmingham, Ala., where she lived most of her life. She was 74.         The cause was heart disease, said Anthony Heilbut, a friend and gospel music scholar.         Ms. Coates's voice was rough and gravelly, and did not have the range or sweetness of Mahalia Jackson, Marion Williams and other leading gospel singers of her day.         But what Ms. Coates lacked in vocal purity she more than made up for in her impassioned delivery. She was one of gospel's great performers, regularly stirring crowds into a frenzy with her intense vocalizations and animated physical style.         She also had a subtle but substantial role in the civil rights movement. She sang at many benefit concerts and in her music alluded to current events. In her 1964 song ''The Hymn,'' she preached: ''When the president was assassinated, the nation said, 'Where is God?' When the little children lost their lives in the church bombing, the nation cried, 'Where is God?' I got the answer for you today: God is still on the throne.''         Born Dorothy McGriff in Birmingham, she was one of seven children of a minister who divorced when Ms. Coates was young. She sang in local churches and started a family group, the Royal Gospel Singers, as a teenager. She quit school after the 10th grade to support her family as a maid.         ''On weekdays I worked for the white man. On weekends I sang for the people,'' she told Mr. Heilbut in his 1971 book, ''The Gospel Sound: Good News and Bad Times.''         Ms. Coates joined the Gospel Harmonettes, a well-known Birmingham group, and in 1951 the group cut its first hit, ''I'm Sealed,'' and quickly rose to fame on the gospel circuit. She continued with the Harmonettes throughout the 50's and 60's on a variety of record labels, writing much of the group's material. Among its hits were ''You Must Be Born Again'' and ''That's Enough'' on the Specialty label, ''I Won't Let Go of My Faith'' on the Nashboro label and ''You've Been Good to Me'' on VeeJay. She also sang ''No Hiding Place'' and ''(You Can't Hurry God) He's Right On Time.''         The Harmonettes broke up in 1970, though Ms. Coates continued to perform with the Dorothy Love Coates Singers, featuring her sister Lillian and other singers from Birmingham. She sang at the Newport Jazz Festival several times, including in a 1975 tribute to Mahalia Jackson at Carnegie Hall.         She stopped recording in 1980, but appeared in two films, in ''The Long Walk Home'' (1990) and in ''Beloved'' (1998), in which she can be seen leading a chorus of ex-slaves in an inspirational song.         Ms. Coates married twice. Her first marriage, to Willie Love of the Fairfield Four, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Carl Coates of the Sensational Nightingales, died in 1999.         She is survived by her daughters, Cassandra Madison of Birmingham and Carletta Criss of Arlington, Tex.; a brother, Fred McGriff of Newark; a sister, Naomi Chambers of Plainfield, N.J.; and two granddaughters.         Ms. Coates's music influenced many pop and rhythm-and-blues singers, such as Mavis Staples of the Staple Singers, and Cissy Houston, and she was well aware of that. But she steadfastly refused to betray her calling by singing blues, jazz or any other secular idiom.         ''I can't sell out,'' she told Mr. Heilbut.       
         Niki de Saint Phalle, a Franco-American artist internationally known for her colorful, monumental, cartoonlike sculptures and environments, died on Tuesday in San Diego, Calif. She was 71.         The cause was pulmonary failure after an illness of several months, said Harry Mathews, the writer and her first husband.         A heroine to feminism before the modern movement even emerged, Ms. de Saint Phalle first made her mark in Paris in the early 60's when she was associated with the Nouveaux Réalistes, a group of avant-gardists that included the sculptors Christo, Arman and Jean Tinguely. Their antic, absurdist works challenged conventional ideas about art-making in ways that echoed the earlier Dada movement.         Ms. de Saint Phalle became notorious for what she called ''target paintings,'' at which darts were thrown, and then for actual ''shooting paintings'' and sculptures. In galleries, she would use a .22-caliber rifle to shoot at plaster sculptures in which she had embedded bags of paint, causing color to splatter all over.         Ms. de Saint Phalle went on to produce a far different kind of art, an amalgam of Pop, Surrealism, Folk and outsider art that she prolifically realized in sculptures, paintings, prints and large public installations. Inspired in the mid-60's by a visit from the wife of Larry Rivers, Clarice Rivers, who was then pregnant, Ms. de Saint Phalle created the first of what would become an extensive population of ''Nanas.'' (Nana is a mildly rude French term for woman, comparable to broad.) They were bulbous, archetypal maternal figures like Mexican piñatas painted in bold colors and decorated with crisp, cartoon outlines.         In contrast with the aggressive Conceptualism of her early performance works, the art for which she became best known seemed to flow from an endlessly fertile, visionary imagination.         The Nanas gave birth to legions of fanciful humanoids, animals, plants and monsters and a trend away from the refinement of individual objects toward the creation of whole, fantastic worlds that would be most fully achieved in ambitious public works like Surrealistic amusement parks. Made of cement and produced on a gigantic scale, the Nanas became houses that visitors could enter, and surrounding grounds became teeming, part-organic, part-architectural mazes. At once avant-garde and populist, Ms. de Saint Phalle's art had the unusual ability to appeal to a wide range of viewers, from art-world professionals to children.         In the late 1970's, on acreage in southwestern Tuscany made available by wealthy friends, Ms. de Saint Phalle began her most ambitious project, a sprawling sculpture garden featuring 22 large sculptures based on the fortune-telling Tarot cards. With its wildly grotesque forms decorated by ceramic tiles, glass and mirrors, it calls to mind the architecture of Antonio Gaudí, whose work made a lasting impression on Ms. de Saint Phalle when she first encountered it in the 1950's. Financing it in part through the sale of a perfume called Niki de Saint Phalle, which she created for the Jacqueline Cochran company, Ms. de Saint Phalle worked on the Tarot Garden for 20 years. It opened to the public in 1998.         Catherine Marie-Agnès Fal de Saint Phalle was born into a wealthy family on Oct. 29, 1930, at Neuilly-sur-Seine, a Paris suburb, but was partly raised in New York, where her parents moved after the crash of 1929, and educated at the Brearley School, among several others. She told of being thrown out of Brearley for painting the fig leaves on the school artworks red.         At 18 she eloped with Mr. Mathews, and two years later the couple moved to France, where she began to paint after a nervous breakdown at age 23. She was mostly a self-taught artist. Her first solo exhibition took place in St. Gallen, Switzerland, in 1956, but she did not begin to show her work regularly until 1961.         Divorced from Mr. Mathews in 1960, she began a relationship with Jean Tinguely, the Swiss sculptor known for his kinetic, mechanical sculptures. They were married in 1971 and she collaborated with him on many projects. Although they lived separately after their marriage, their partnership lasted until his death in 1991. Ms. de Saint Phalle returned to the United States in 1994 to settle in La Jolla, in San Diego, partly because of her frail health.         In addition to producing public works in cities from Jerusalem to San Diego, Ms. de Saint Phalle had many museum exhibitions. The Nassau County Museum of Fine Arts in New York assembled her first American retrospective in 1987, and a larger retrospective was organized by the Kunst und Austellunghalle in Bonn in 1992. In 1994, an institution dedicated to her work, the Niki Museum, opened in Nasu, Japan. In 2000 she won a $140,000 Praemium Imperiale Award given by the Japan Art Association.         Ms. de Saint Phalle is survived by a brother, John de Saint Phalle, of Florida; a daughter, Laura Duke, of Paris; a son, Philip Mathews, of New York; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Beverly Brown, a modern-dance choreographer and longtime lead performer with the Erick Hawkins Dance Company, died on May 17 in Kansas City, Mo. She was 61. A longtime resident of Manhattan, Ms. Brown moved to Kansas City two months before her death.         The cause was a stroke, her sister, Tracy Brown, said.         Born in Effingham, Ill., and reared in Venezuelan oil camps and in Arizona, Ms. Brown graduated from Carlton College in Northfield, Minn., then traveled east to New York City and a 40-year career in dance. She performed with Hawkins from 1967 to 1974.         At first she found herself in uncharted territory, as she put it in a 1996 interview. By the mid-1990's, Ms. Brown had been designated a senior repertory consultant to a new young generation of Hawkins dancers.         Ms. Brown stood out as a dancer for her blend of serenity, simplicity and quietly gutsy energy, a mix that made her an ideal interpreter of Hawkins's works and that permeated her own choreography. After leaving the company, she formed the Body Voice Theater and then the Beverly Brown Ensemble, where she experimented with dancers' performing not only movement but also the natural sounds that accompanied much of her choreography.         Ms. Brown taught dance at institutions like Colorado University at Boulder and the University of California at Santa Cruz. She also composed music for Siddha Yoga meditation communities in New York and Kansas City.         In addition to her sister Tracy, of San Francisco, she is survived by her mother, Frances Brown, of Grand Junction, Colo.; a brother, William, of Leawood, Kan.; and another sister, Jesslyn Brown Stevens, of Sioux Falls, S.D.       
         Josephine R. Abady, a theater director who staged plays on and off Broadway and was a leader in the nonprofit theater movement, died on Saturday in her home in Manhattan. She lived in Manhattan and Stockbridge, Mass. She was 52.         The cause was breast cancer, said her sister, the actress Caroline Aaron.         During her career, Ms. Abady was the artistic director of the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge and the Cleveland Playhouse. In the last years of Circle in the Square, she shared the artistic direction of that company with Theodore Mann, one of the company's founders, and Mr. Mann named her as his successor.         At Circle in the Square she directed a revival of ''Bus Stop,'' starring Billy Crudup and Mary-Louise Parker, and produced a revival of ''The Rose Tattoo,'' starring Mercedes Ruehl. In 1996, after the theater filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws, both Mr. Mann and Ms. Abady resigned their posts.         After directing Tom Griffin's play ''The Boys Next Door'' at the Berkshire theater, she brought it to New York where it had a successful run at the Lambs Theater. The play featured Josh Mostel, Joe Grifasi and Christine Estabrook as mentally handicapped residents of a cooperative apartment. She also directed the New York premiere of David Storey's ''March on Russia,'' an elegaic portrait of a family in Yorkshire, England. Under Ms. Abady's direction, the American cast exactingly delineated the regional English characters.         In 1991, while she was at the Cleveland Playhouse, she staged a Russian-language version of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' in Volgograd and then brought the play to Cleveland, where local audiences listened to the English translation over headphones.         Ms. Abady was born in Richmond, Va. She graduated from Syracuse University and received a master of fine arts from Florida State University. For several years she taught theater at Bennington College and was head of the theater program at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., before beginning her professional career at the Berkshire Theater Festival, where she specialized in revivals of American plays.         When she went to the Cleveland Playhouse, she opened the season with ''Born Yesterday,'' starring Ed Asner and Madeline Kahn, a production that moved to Broadway. Subsequently, she and David Esbjornson directed ''New Music,'' a trilogy by Reynolds Price, and she also presented plays by black and female authors. After six years as artistic director, she was fired by a board of directors that was apparently unhappy with her nontraditional choice of plays.         In 1994, with a grant from the American Film Institute, she made a short film, ''To Catch a Tiger,'' inspired by her mother's work as a civil rights activist in the South. The screenplay was written by Ms. Abady's husband, Michael Krawitz, and starred her sister as her mother.         In addition to her husband, who lives in Great Barrington, Mass., and her sister, of Los Angeles, she is survived by her brother, Samuel Abady of Bronxville, N.Y..         In spite of her illness, she was highly productive in the last year. She ran a lunchtime series of play readings at the National Arts Club in New York, and also directed plays in Texas and Florida. She returned to Richmond to stage Margaret Edson's ''Wit,'' about a woman who is dying of cancer. When interviewed by a local reporter, she said she had not seen the play before she directed it. ''I live 'Wit,' '' she said. ''I don't need to see it.''       
         Lois Gould, a best-selling novelist, essayist and memoirist known for her acutely observed portrayals of the emotional complexities of women's lives, died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.         She had fought cancer for some time, said her son, Anthony C. Gould.         Ms. Gould was perhaps best known for her debut novel, ''Such Good Friends'' (1970, Random House). Partly autobiographical, the book is about a woman who learns of her husband's wide-ranging infidelities only as he is dying in a hospital. It spent seven weeks on the New York Times best-seller list and was released as a film the next year.         Most recently, Ms. Gould published a critically praised memoir, ''Mommy Dressing: A Love Story, After a Fashion'' (Anchor/Doubleday, 1998), a cleareyed recollection of life with her glamorous, remote mother, the fashion designer Jo Copeland. Reviewing the memoir in The New York Times Book Review, Margo Jefferson wrote that ''dispassionate compassion is a very moving quality, and it marks 'Mommy Dressing' from beginning to end.''         As an essayist and critic, Ms. Gould was a frequent contributor to The Times, writing the inaugural Hers column in 1977 and many thereafter. Her subjects included sexual politics, family and the seemingly unbridgeable gulf between men's and women's attitudes toward emotionally laden topics like adultery, eroticism and divorce.         Ms. Gould was born Lois Regensburg to parents ensconced in the Stork Club set of Manhattan. Her father, Edward J. Regensburg Jr., a debonair cigar manufacturer, left the family, ''whistling,'' she would write, when Lois was 3. Her mother, whose designs were prized by the social lights of New York, Hollywood and Europe, was consumed by her passion for her work and her distaste for her children.         As parties rustled silkenly in Jo Copeland's Park Avenue living room -- guests might include Joan Crawford or Tyrone Power -- Lois and her brother were expected to remain in their rooms with their supper trays, blissfully unseen and unheard.         After graduating from Wellesley, Ms. Gould reported on the criminal courts for The Long Island Star-Journal, a newspaper in Long Island City, Queens, that has since folded. She became an editor on several national magazines and served as executive editor of Ladies' Home Journal. She married Philip Benjamin, a novelist and a reporter for The Times, in 1955.         In 1966 her husband died suddenly after surgery, leaving her with two boys. Among her husband's papers, Ms. Gould found a diary written in code. She cracked the code and discovered a catalog of his extramarital liaisons, many with her friends. The experience provided a foundation for her first novel.         In ''Such Good Friends,'' Julie Messinger, a young mother, uncovers a similar diary as her husband lies dying. Ms. Gould's novel offered a raw, darkly comic portrait of Julie's emotional life -- her grief, rage, amphetamine popping and suicidal depression -- along with frank depictions of her sexual life, which ran the gamut from quiet marital frustration to ardent masturbation.         The book caused a sensation in 1970, when Americans were still struggling to comprehend the social upheavals set in motion by the women's movement.         Likening Julie to a female Alex Portnoy, Saturday Review said: ''What some men find offensive in 'Such Good Friends' is just this kind of intimate disclosure'': the passage under critical scrutiny involved reading Krafft-Ebing in bed while eating Sara Lee fudge cake. The review continued, ''Women aren't supposed to have equal sexual and human rights -- and talk about them as openly as men.''         In 1967 Ms. Gould married the psychiatrist Robert E. Gould. (Her sons, whom Dr. Gould adopted, took his surname.) Dr. Gould died n 1998; Ms. Gould's son Roger V. Gould, a sociologist at Yale University, died of leukemia at 39 on April 29. Ms. Gould is survived by her son Anthony, of Manhattan, and her brother, Anthony Regensburg, of Camden, Me., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Among Ms. Gould's other books are the novels ''Necessary Objects'' (1972), ''Final Analysis'' (1974), ''A Sea Change'' (1976) and ''La Presidenta'' (1981) and the essay collection ''Not Responsible for Personal Articles'' (1978).         If Ms. Gould was known primarily for her knife-edged fictional depictions of marriage and its discontents, she was an equally incisive observer of human connection -- and disconnection -- in her nonfiction.         In an evocative passage about her mother, she recalled a bittersweet childhood ritual: watching Jo Copeland at her vanity table as she prepared for an evening out.         ''It seemed to me an ark of some covenant, with hidden doors that swung open to reveal fragrant jars and beautiful bottles, each of which held other secrets,'' she wrote.         ''Everything I knew about my mother, Jo Copeland, happened right there,'' Ms. Gould continued. ''For what I knew about her was only the dressing. Nothing of the rest of her life was visible to me. Unless the dressing was, in fact, the life.''       
         June Jordan, who came of age as a poet when the voices of black female writers were just beginning to be heard, died on June 14 at her home in Berkeley, Calif.         She was 65. The cause was breast cancer, which she fought for a decade, said Adrienne Torff, a friend.         Like the careers of Audre Lord and Alice Walker, Ms. Jordan's was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. Her poetry was imbued with advocacy for the poor, for women and the disenfranchised.         In an interview yesterday, Ms. Walker, a close friend, called the small, elegant but tough Ms. Jordan, ''unwillingly nonviolent.'' In ''Poem About Police Violence,'' she wrote about the so-called accidental death of a black man in police custody: ''Tell me something/ what you think would happen if/ everytime they kill a black boy/ then we kill a cop/ everytime they kill a black man/ then we kill a cop/ you think the accident rate would lower/ subsequently?''         Still, Ms. Jordan could be a poet of great delicacy, as in ''On a New Year's Eve,'' in which she describes watching a lover sleep: ''and/ as I watch your arm/ your/ brown arm/ just/ before it moves/ I know/ all things are dear/ that disappear/ all things are dear/ that disappear.''         She was the author or editor of 28 books, essays and novels for children and the libretto for the 1995 opera by John Adams ''I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.''         She was also a teacher. At the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a professor of African-American Studies, she founded Poetry for the People, which trains undergraduates to take poetry to community groups as a form of political empowerment.         Ms. Jordan was born in Harlem, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Granville Ivanhoe Jordan, a postal clerk, and Mildred, a nurse. Ms. Jordan's mother was deeply depressed and eventually committed suicide.         Her father had wanted a boy and referred to her as ''he.'' In ''Soldier: A Poet's Childhood'' (Basic Civitas Books, 1999) she described being brutally beaten by him: ''Like a growling beast, the roll-away mahogany doors rumble open, and the light snaps on and a fist smashes into the side of my head and I am screaming awake: 'Daddy! What did I do?!' '' Yet her father helped forge her identity as a writer, she said, giving her books by Paul Lawrence Dunbar and forcing her to memorize Shakespeare.         In a radio interview two years ago, Ms. Jordan appeared to have come to terms with her father. She said: ''He didn't know what to do to try to provide against the failure of his only child in this new land. I think that probably contributed to the violence of his frustration. But that he loved me and thought me capable of anything and everything there was never any doubt.''         After the family moved to Brooklyn, Ms. Jordan became the only black student at Midwood High School. Later, she won a scholarship to the Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts, now the coeducational Northfield-Mount Hermon School.         After Northfield she attended Barnard College in New York City where she met Michael Meyer, a white student. The couple married and had a son, Christopher, who lives in Montana.         In her book of essays, ''Civil Wars'' (Scribner's, 1996), Ms. Jordan wrote of the difficulties of an interracial marriage. In 1966 the couple divorced. She raised her son largely on her own, struggling to eke out a living as a freelance journalist. She was a researcher and writer for Mobilization for Youth in New York, and in 1967 she got a teaching job at City College. Two years later she published a children's book, ''Who Look at Me?''         To the end, she remained involved in politics. In September Basic Civitas books is scheduled to publish ''Some of Us Did Not Die,'' which contains essays on Israel, Islam and O. J. Simpson. The book's title is from a poem she read last year in a speech at Barnard. She spoke of her battle with breast cancer and about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which she said proved the need for a secular democracy that protects the rights of ''male/ female/Jew/ Gentile/ Muslim.''         She read from a poem in which she imagined her dying body and a predatory hawk gliding overhead: ''He makes that dive/ to savage/ me/ and inches/ from the blood flood lusty/ beak/ I roll away/ I speak/ I laugh out loud/ Not yet/ big bird of prey/ not yet.''         Correction:  June 20, 2002, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about the poet June Jordan misspelled the middle name of an author whose books she credited with having helped forge her identity as a writer. He was Paul Laurence Dunbar, not Lawrence.         Correction:  June 27, 2002, Thursday  An obituary of the poet June Jordan on June 18 misspelled the surname of a poet whose career, like Ms. Jordan's, was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. She was Audre Lorde, not Lord.       
         Representative Patsy T. Mink, a liberal Democrat from Hawaii who was likely to be elected to a 13th term in November, died Saturday at the Straub Clinic and Hospital in Honolulu. She was 74.         The cause was viral pneumonia brought on by chickenpox, said Andy Winer, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Hawaii.         As a member of Congress from 1965 until 1977, and again from 1990 until her death, Ms. Mink was a champion of women's rights, education, civil rights and labor unions.         One of her primary legislative achievements came in 1972, when she was one of the sponsors of Title IX of the federal Education Amendments, which mandates equal financing for women's athletics and academics at institutions receiving federal money.         ''It's rare as a legislator that you fight for legislation you believe in and stay around or live long enough to see it come to fruition,'' Ms. Mink said in 1995, in a meeting with some of the nation's top female basketball players.         Ms. Mink was known as articulate and strong-willed, and willing to fight for causes large and small.         In 1967, she and two other congresswomen tried to get into the House gym, after hearing about a form letter inviting members to use what was at the time an exclusively male preserve. They were turned away by the gym's director, who news reports said was ''horrified'' by their transgression.         Several years later, she took on Dr. Edgar F. Berman, a member of the Democratic Party's committee on national priorities, who claimed that women's ''raging hormonal imbalance'' made them unfit for executive positions in business and politics. Dr. Berman eventually resigned from the committee.         Ms. Mink, however, stopped short of associating herself with the women's liberation movement.         ''Just because I'm interested in women doesn't mean I'm for women's liberation,'' she told The New York Times in 1970. ''I support all groups when what they do coincides with what I believe in.''         Patsy Takemoto was born in Paia, a sugar plantation town on the island of Maui, on Dec. 6, 1927. As a senior at Maui High School she was elected student body president, and by the time she graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1948, her interests had shifted from medicine to the humanities.         In 1951, she graduated from the University of Chicago Law School. That same year, she married John F. Mink, a doctoral student in geology. The couple moved to Honolulu, where Ms. Mink opened a law office and became the first Japanese-American woman licensed to practice law in Hawaii, Mr. Winer said.         In 1956, Ms. Mink was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Legislature. In 1958, she was elected to the Hawaii Senate.         In her first period in Congress, Ms. Mink was an early critic of the Vietnam War, prompting some opponents to call her Patsy Pink.         In 1972 she and Representative Bella S. Abzug of New York traveled to Paris, where they met with North Vietnamese officials to discuss the prospects for peace.         In 1967, in a speech before the House of Representatives, Ms. Mink argued against harsh punishments for people who burned the American flag.         ''America is not a country which needs to punish its dissenters to preserve its honor,'' she said. ''America is not a country which needs to demand conformity of all its people, for its strength lies in all our diversities converging in one common belief, that of the importance of freedom as the essence of our country.''         In 1976, after 12 years in Congress, Ms. Mink sought a seat in the United States Senate. She lost the Democratic primary to Spark M. Matsunaga. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed her assistant secretary of state for oceans and international, environmental and scientific affairs.         Ms. Mink returned to Congress in 1990 after winning a special election for the seat vacated by Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat, who was appointed to the Senate after Mr. Matsunaga's death. She discovered that many of her fellow Democrats had shifted toward more centrist positions.         ''She saw it as an opportunity to teach lessons,'' said Representative Neil Abercrombie, Democrat of Hawaii. ''She never thought for a moment of not working with people who didn't agree with her ideologically.''         In her final term, Ms. Mink raised questions about the creation of the Homeland Security Department, saying she feared that the new legislation could be used to undermine civil rights.         ''She had already been through that as a Japanese-American, seeing people put into detention camps on the basis of what they supposedly were as opposed to what they had actually done,'' Mr. Abercrombie said.         Ms. Mink is survived by her husband; their daughter, Gwendolyn; and a brother, Eugene Takemoto.       
         Tatyana M. Velikanova, a Soviet human rights activist who was a leading editor of the most important samizdat journal of human rights abuses and spent nearly nine years in prison camp and exile, died of cancer on Sept. 19. She was 70 and lived in Moscow.         Ms. Velikanova, a mathematician by profession, became a dissident in 1968, when she went to Red Square with her husband, Konstantin Babitsky, who was one of only seven people to demonstrate openly against the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague Spring reforms.         Mr. Babitsky was arrested and banished for several years to the far north of Russia. The next year, Ms. Velikanova helped found the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the U.S.S.R., and became the backbone of the Chronicle of Current Events, a samizdat news bulletin, after the arrest of its founder, Natalya Gorbanevskaya. The chronicle was the main uncensored source of information about the dissident movement around the Soviet Union during the rule of Leonid I. Brezhnev.         At a time when photocopying machines were rare and kept literally under lock and key in Soviet offices, the compilers of the chronicle gathered information and then produced multiple copies by typing through layers of carbon paper.         The chronicle was written in a dry, telegraphic style, and defended all repressed groups, from Pentecostal believers to Jewish refuseniks, Russian Orthodox priests, Georgian nationalists, deported Crimean Tatars, and intellectuals and religious believers in the Baltic republics.         Ms. Velikanova herself was an observant Orthodox Christian.         She was arrested in 1979 on charges of ''anti-Soviet propaganda,'' and a report in the Chronicle around that time detailed official questioning of her sister about her ties to the West, as well as the interrogator's relaying his prisoner's request for a Bible and photographs of her grandchildren.         Ms. Velikanova received a nine-year sentence, serving four years in prison camp and then being exiled to a desolate part of Kazakhstan.         In a statement written during his own banishment from Moscow to the city of Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod), Andrei D. Sakharov lauded Ms. Velikanova for her dedication to the cause of the oppressed, regardless of whether she agreed with their views. ''Her only consideration was whether someone had suffered injustice,'' he wrote.         During the reforms of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Ms. Velikanova was allowed to return to Moscow before her nine-year term was fully served. In her final years, she lived out of the public eye, teaching math and Russian language and literature at a Moscow school until just months before her death.         She is survived by three children, Natalie Babitsky of France, Fyodor Babitsky of Moscow and Yulia Keidan of Italy; 13 grandchildren; two brothers, Andrew Velihan of Northport, N.Y., and Kirill Velikanov of Moscow; and two sisters, Yekaterina Velikanova of Moscow and Mary Velihan Grigorenko of New York City.       
         Alina Pienkowska, a shy and soft-spoken nurse whose impassioned words turned a shipyard strike in Gdansk, Poland, in 1980 into a nationwide and triumphant movement called Solidarity that ultimately helped to bring down Communism, died on Oct. 17 in Gdansk. She was 50. The cause was cancer, friends said.         Ms. Pienkowska spent much of her life in and around the giant shipyard on the Baltic shore. Her father worked there and had joined in protests in 1970 that led to army shootings in which dozens of workers were killed. A decade later, the young woman, widowed and with a young child, was working as a nurse at the yard.         By then she had become involved with a very small circle of activists who distributed a clandestine journal called The Coastal Worker, organized by Bogdan Borusiewicz, a passionate proponent of independent labor unions who was later to become Ms. Pienkowska's husband. Mr. Borusiewicz is currently a candidate for mayor of Gdansk.         In August 1980, Ms. Pienkowska was a withdrawn, single mother with prematurely gray hair who contributed articles to The Coastal Worker on health-related subjects like the rising rate of industrial accidents. That month, Anna Walentynowicz, a decorated crane operator at the shipyard and another member of Mr. Borusiewicz's circle, was fired. On Aug. 14, leaflets protesting her dismissal were distributed, and a dismissed welder named Lech Walesa, also in the group, climbed into the shipyard and proclaimed a strike.         From the windows of her apartment, Ms. Pienkowska saw that a strike had begun. Rightly assuming that state security agencies would have cut phone lines from the yard in the hope of keeping the strike secret from the nation and the world, she called friends in Warsaw, who alerted Western reporters, making sure the news would spread through Poland over Radio Free Europe.         But her greater contribution came two days later when she was with her fellow strikers in the shipyard. By then, many smaller factories and government establishments in the region had been struck, with their workers composing lists of demands. On Aug. 16, the shipyard management offered strikers there a considerable raise. The strike committee agreed, and Mr. Walesa announced that the strike had ended. Thousands of jubilant workers headed for the gates and home.         Ms. Pienkowska was enraged, realizing that as a result of the agreement tens of thousands of strikers at plants throughout the region were being left in the lurch. She found the voice and courage to attack Mr. Walesa.         ''You betrayed them,'' she said of the strikers beyond the shipyard walls. ''Now the authorities will crush us like bedbugs.''         She managed to shut one gate and pleaded for the strikers to stay and maintain the strike. Some lingered, but most rushed home to their families. But Ms. Pienkowska's message got through, and in many cases wives sent their husbands back; by nightfall the shipyard was filling up once more.         The strike had been salvaged in the spirit of solidarity, a word that would soon provide the free trade union movement with its name.         Among those who praised Ms. Pienkowska after her death was Andrzej Wajda, who said that she had been the model for a character in his film ''Man of Iron,'' which was based on events in the shipyard.         He said the actress who played the role spoke Ms. Pienkowska's words: ''Here in the shipyard I stopped being afraid, stopped running away, and became a real person.''         Immediately after her intervention, she was elected to a new strike committee that was able to negotiate the historic agreement guaranteeing workers the right to form unions independent of the government or the ruling Communist Party.         For the next decade she worked for Solidarity, both when it was legal and when it was outlawed in 1981. At the outset of the martial law period, she was detained and held for more than a year.         In 1983 she married Mr. Borusiewicz, who was in hiding, in a secret ceremony. A year later her husband, still a fugitive, attended the baptism of their son while disguised as an old woman. Mr. Walesa, a guest, unsuspectingly kissed his hand.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her daughter, Kinga; and her son, Sebastian.       
         Vinnette Carroll, the trailblazing actress, director and playwright who was the first African-American woman to direct a production on Broadway, died Tuesday at her home in Fort Lauderhill, Fla. She was 80.         The cause was complications from diabetes and heart disease, said Anita MacShane, a friend.         A black woman in a business often dominated by white men, Ms. Carroll's career included several theatrical milestones and a consistent sense of activity and ambition.         As a director, she was not only the first black woman to direct on Broadway -- the musical revue ''Don't Bother Me I Can't Cope,'' in 1972 -- but she also brought her best-known show, the gospel-infused ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,'' to Broadway on three separate occasions. As an actress, Ms. Carroll won an Emmy (''Beyond the Blues,'' in 1964), an Obie (''Moon on a Rainbow Shawl,'' in 1962) and was nominated for three Tony awards.         Ms. Carroll was also the founder and artistic director of the Urban Arts Corps, a New York-based training and producing organization devoted to supporting black and Hispanic theater and actors. The group fostered the careers of hundreds of performers, including Cicely Tyson and Sherman Hemsley, as well as presenting ''Don't Bother Me'' and ''Your Arms Too Short.'' The onetime director of the New York State Ghetto Arts Program, which brought theater and dance to poor neighborhoods, Ms. Carroll also worked in Los Angeles at the Inner City Repertory in the Watts district, presenting classical and modern works.         Born into a well-off Jamaican family, Ms. Carroll moved to Harlem when she was 10 and found an instant affinity for the arts, playing viola with the Dean Dixon Symphony when in high school. Her father, however, who was a dentist, had medical plans for her. After graduating from Long Island University, Ms. Carroll received a master's degree in psychology from New York University and worked briefly as a clinical psychologist in the New York City schools.         At the same time, though, she was moonlighting in acting classes; drama soon won her over. In 1948, she was accepted to the Erwin Pescator dramatic workshop at the New School, where she studied with Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler.         A tall woman with with round cheeks and a high brow, Ms. Carroll was not classified as beautiful in the traditional sense, but still she impressed her teachers with her expressive eyes and resonant voice.         After honing her craft by acting at the Harlem Y.M.C.A., Ms. Carroll found some work in the theater in the 1950's, and also toured extensively with a one-woman show that she wrote. Her Broadway debut came in a short-lived revival of ''A Small War on Murray Hill,'' open for a single week in January 1957.         It was during the 1960's and 70's, the height the national black theater movement, that Ms. Carroll's talents came into full bloom.         In 1962, she won her Obie in ''Moon Over a Rainbow Shawl'' Off Broadway, stealing scenes from her castmate James Earl Jones. A year later, ''Trumpets of the Lord,'' Ms. Carroll's musical adaptation of seven sermons, became a runaway Off Broadway hit. In 1964, she won her Emmy. In 1966, she garnered more praise for directing and starring in the Langston Hughes play ''Prodigal Son,'' a production that toured Europe.         In 1967, she founded the Urban Arts Corps, which produced dozens of shows out of a space on West 20th Street. In 1969, another production of ''Trumpets of the Lord'' opened on Broadway, but closed in less than a week.         Ms. Carroll more than made up for the brevity of that run with two enormous success during the 1970's. The first was ''Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,'' a roof-raising gospel revue with songs by Micki Grant, which Ms. Carroll conceived, produced and directed at the Urban Arts Corps in 1970 and later took to Broadway, where it ran for 1,065 performances. Ms. Carroll's direction was nominated for a Tony, making her the first black woman ever to win that nomination. (She lost to Bob Fosse for ''Pippin.'')         Shortly after ''I Can't Cope'' closed, in 1974, Ms. Carroll began conceiving a followup, a gospel celebration of the Gospel of St. Matthew. That show, ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,'' with music and lyrics by Alex Bradford and Micki Grant, turned out to be a big success, spawning several national tours and two return trips to Broadway, including a 1982 version starred Patti LaBelle and Al Green. A fourth trip to Broadway is being planned for next year.         Not all of Ms. Carroll's efforts were as successful. A pricey adaptation of ''Alice in Wonderland,'' titled ''But Never Jam Today,'' had a tortured route to Broadway, only to close within a week, in 1979.         Ms. Carroll divided her time between New York and Florida, where she bought a house in the 1980's. She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Carroll Hudgins, of Manhattan.         In the late 1980's, she founded a theater in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., devoted to featuring work by minority playwrights and actors. Throughout her life, Ms. Carroll was an eloquent speaker about the challenges of being black and female.         ''I have had a great deal of hurt in the theater both as a Negro and as a woman, but I don't get immobilized by it,'' she said an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1967. ''I tell myself that no one individual is going to make it impossible for me.''       
         Hilary Bader, an award-winning television scriptwriter, died on Thursday in Duarte, Calif. She was 50 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was metastasized breast cancer, said her husband, Jay Broad.         She wrote for both animated and live-action programs and was nominated seven times for a daytime Emmy Award, winning twice, for ''Batman Beyond'' and earlier for ''The New Batman/Superman Adventures,'' two animated series shown on Warner Brothers Television.         Ms. Bader was born in Brooklyn. She attended the State University of New York at Stony Brook as a mathematics major but spent the early 1970's in Paris studying movement and mime. In the 1980's she toured the United States with Edmond Felix, a writer, dancer and costume designer, in ''African Folk Tales,'' a blend of stories, dance and mime.         A fan of the ''Star Trek'' television series in her youth, she settled in Los Angeles and became a freelance writer for its first sequel, ''Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' She also wrote episodes for ''Star Trek: Voyager,'' ''Xena: Warrior Princess,'' ''Silk Stalkings,'' and ''Lois and Clark,'' among other shows.         Besides her husband, Ms. Bader is survived by her mother, Evelyn Bader of Brooklyn; and her sister, Stephanie Bader of Manhattan.       
         Ellen Straus, a passionate environmentalist and co-owner of the first organic dairy farm west of the Mississippi River, died on Saturday at her home in Marshall, Calif., north of San Francisco. She was 75.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         A pioneer in the purchase of development rights from farmers to save the land from being turned into tract housing and shopping malls, Ms. Straus was a founder of the Marin Agricultural Land Trust in 1980. But she is probably best known outside the Bay Area for the rich, thick milk produced on the family farm, which her son Albert turned into high-quality cheese, yogurt and butter at the Straus Family Creamery.         Ellen Tirza Lotte Prins was born on Feb. 21, 1927, in Amsterdam. Her family fled the country just ahead of the Nazi invasion in 1940. She graduated from Bard College in New York in 1948, but instead of fulfilling her dream of studying medicine, she married William Straus, a German Jewish immigrant 12 years her senior, who had come to study agriculture at the University of California.         It took him only 16 days to persuade her to abandon further studies and move to what was then a small farm on the shores of Tomales Bay in Marin County, Calif. There they brought up four children, Albert, Vivien, Miriam and Michael, who survive her, along with her husband, four grandsons and a sister, Anneke Prins Simons of Jersey City.         Inspired by Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring,'' Ms. Straus turned her attention to the environmental movement when she learned of plans to build hundreds of homes along the Marin County coast as well as a resort at Tomales Bay. She was instrumental in the creation of the Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, preserving 17 ranches. Along with other environmentalists, she persuaded the county supervisors to pass strict zoning laws.         But just to make certain the restrictions could not be changed she helped found the Marin Agricultural Land Trust, or MALT, which now has 47 ranches and dairies covering 32,000 acres. It represents 30 percent of the private farmland in Marin County, and the owners have granted easements saying it must remain agricultural land. Ms. Straus served on its board until 1990 and was its chairwoman from 1999 to 2001.         Today there are 1,000 land trusts throughout the country, and the trust was the model for scores of them.         The Straus family used the money it received for its own conservation easement to convert its farm into an organic operation, a move that saved it from the unprofitable co-op milk market and made it possible for the Strauses to stay in business by selling more profitable products.         Those products, unhomogenized milk with a thick layer of cream on the top, bottled in glass; cream that almost whips itself; and Monterey Jack and white cheddar, are sold throughout California. The farm's Holstein cows also produce all the milk used by the acclaimed Cow Girl Creamery of Point Reyes, for crème fraîche, fromage blanc and Mount Tam triple cream cheese.         Ms. Straus was a hands-on farmer. On the first night of the farm's organic operation, she individually stamped the expiration dates on glass milk bottles as they rolled off the conveyor. Three or four times a year, she led educational tours of the dairy for the agricultural land trust, preparing the lunch for the 50 or so people who attended.         In 1998, the American Farmland Trust in Washington, D.C., presented Ms. Straus with the annual Steward of the Land Award in recognition of her lifelong struggle for family farms. The White House made her a Points of Light winner in 2001 for her lifetime of volunteer work.         When she was honored by the American Farmland Trust, Ms. Straus said World War II had taught her a lifelong lesson about standing for one's beliefs: ''That we, as individuals, are responsible for what is happening in our communities, and that we must become activists.''
