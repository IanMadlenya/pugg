        Mary Ann Unger, a sculptor and curator, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan.
''She was incredibly important,'' said Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
''She did forward-looking active sports clothes, sundresses, trousers, bathing suits and evening sweaters,'' said Valerie Steele, the chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
''It was a country-girl-come-to-the-city kind of column,'' said Bill Kovach, a former editor of The Journal-Constitution, who is curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University.

        Monique Beudert, a museum curator who worked in New York and London, died last Saturday at her home in London.
In 1994 she joined the Tate Gallery in London as an associate curator.
She died of cancer, said Aldo Mancusi, curator of the Caruso Museum in Brooklyn.
