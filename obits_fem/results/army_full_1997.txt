         Mollie Panter-Downes, whose quiet, compelling accounts of everyday British life brought England alive for two generations of readers of The New Yorker, died on Jan. 22 in a nursing home near her longtime home in Surrey. She was 90 and had written The New Yorker's ''Letter from London'' from 1939 to 1984.         Although she wrote verses, stories, plays and several well-received novels, Miss Panter-Downes considered herself more journalist than novelist. In fact she was neither. She was, rather, just what her column's title proclaimed: a letter writer, albeit one with a remarkable eye for detail and a talent for the telling observation.         Indeed, she could have been any American's English cousin writing chatty but shrewdly observant letters that illuminated passing political foibles and great events alike through their reflection in the lives of bus drivers, housewives, shop girls and farmers.         From the time her first ''Letter from London,'' appeared in The New Yorker in the first week of World War II in September 1939, Miss Panter-Downes gave Americans a ground zero view of world events, sometimes with a folksy blend of  American reference points and British nomenclature.         Describing the first jittery days of the war, for example, when sirens often sounded in shrill false alarm, all London, she wrote, ''felt like a little boy who stuffs his fingers in his ears on the Fourth of July only to discover that the cannon cracker has not gone off after all.''         Her expertise in ordinary life was not feigned. Shunning the literary life of London, she lived with her husband and two daughters in a 15th century Tudor house on a pig farm 40 miles south of London. And for all her literary output she was something close to a typical country housewife, one who did her own shopping, cooking and canning.         She made weekly visits to London, but believed that living at a certain distance from the city gave her letters a beneficial perspective.         Her letters, which appeared weekly during the first years and at irregular but frequent intervals from then on, began almost by accident. As the war loomed, Miss Panter-Downes later recalled, The New Yorker's Paris correspondent, Janet Flanner, was ''trapped in New York.'' Desperate for an on-scene voice from Europe, Harold Ross, the magazine's editor, recalling that Miss Panter-Downes had submitted a piece the year before about English families taking in Jewish refugee children, asked her to fill the gap, and she obliged.         Her letters were so well received that her first year's correspondence was published as a collection, ''Letter From England,'' in October 1940.         With only about 5,000 of the New Yorker's half-million or so readers living in England, Miss Panter-Downes became more famous in the United States than in her own homeland, although in England she was far from unknown.         The daughter of an Army officer who was killed in World War I when she was 8, Miss Panter-Downes was born in London and grew up in Essex. She burst on the literary scene at the age of 16, when her first novel, ''The Shoreless Sea,'' was published to generally admiring, if somewhat startled, reviews.         She later wrote several other novels, including ''One Fine Day,'' typically, about an ordinary midlands family, which was published in 1947 and reissued by Virago in 1986.         In addition to her letters, Miss Panter-Downes took on occasional other assignments for The New Yorker, including one, about an English settlement in India, that led to a book, ''Ooty Preserved: A Victorian Hill Station in India,'' published in 1967.         Miss Panter-Downes, whose letters were discontinued as a regular New Yorker feature in 1984, continued writing for the magazine until 1986.         She is survived by her husband of 70 years, Clare Robinson, 93; two daughters, Virginia and Diana Baer; five grandchildren, and four great grand-children.       
         Dr. Chien-Shiung Wu, a physicist who performed a historic experiment overturning what had been considered a fundamental law of nature, died on Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said her husband, Dr. Luke C. L. Yuan, a retired experimental physicist.         Dr. Wu, the Michael I. Pupin Professor Emeritus of Physics at Columbia University, where she carried out research and taught for 37 years, was known throughout her career as a meticulously accurate experimental physicist who was in demand to put new theories to the test.         In her most famous experiment, announced in 1957, she and her colleagues overthrew a law of symmetry in physics called the principle of conservation of parity that had been considered incontrovertible for 30 years. It held that in nuclear reactions, nature in effect does not differentiate between left and right. At one time, physicists were so certain of the validity of the law that they tried to make all of their observations fit it.         But Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee, also of Columbia, and Dr. Chen Ning Yang of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., suggested that conservation of parity did not hold for interactions between subatomic particles involving the so-called weak force. (One of the four basic forces of nature, along with gravity, electromagnetism and the strong force, the weak force plays a role in radioactive decay.)         Dr. Lee consulted with Dr. Wu, an expert in radioactive beta decay, in which an atom emits electrons. Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang suggested an experiment, but Dr. Wu had to find a way to carry it out, an extremely difficult challenge with the technology available at the time.         The experiment used cobalt 60 cooled to 0.01 degree above absolute zero (or minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit). Dr. Wu joined forces with a research team at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, which had one of the few laboratories in the country that could chill materials to extremely low temperatures.         The cobalt 60, a radioactive isotope, was placed in a strong electromagnetic field, which made all the cobalt nuclei line up so they spun along the same axis.         Dr. Wu measured what happened when the cobalt nuclei broke down, giving off electrons. She used a device that counted the number of particles that shot out in the direction of the spin and those that did not.         If the law of conservation of parity was correct, the nuclei would give off equal numbers of particles in each direction. But Dr. Wu found that far more particles flew off in the direction opposite the spin of the nuclei, proving that nature differentiates between left and right.         The results were confirmed by other experiments.         Dr. Isador I. Rabi, a Nobel laureate in physics at Columbia, said at the time, ''In a certain sense, a rather complete theoretical structure has been shattered at the base, and we are not sure how the pieces will be put together.''         Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their theoretical work in this area. Dr. Wu did not share the prize, but the playwright Clare Boothe Luce said at the time, ''When Dr. Wu knocked out that principle of parity, she established the principle of parity between men and women.''         Dr. Lee said yesterday, ''C. S. Wu was one of the giants of physics.''         Dr. Wu was born on May 29, 1912, near Shanghai. She received a bachelor's degree from National Central University in Nanjing in 1936 and a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in 1940.         She taught at Smith College and Princeton University before being asked to join the Manhattan Project, the Army's secret project to develop the atomic bomb in World War II. She helped develop a process to enrich uranium ore that produced large quantities of uranium 235, a fuel for the bomb.         As part of the project, an atomic pile was built at Hanford, Wash., in 1942, but its chain reaction stopped a few hours after it was started. The physicist Enrico Fermi suspected that a substance produced by nuclear fission was halting the reaction by capturing most of the neutrons.         He was reportedly told, ''Ask Miss Wu.'' It turned out that a rare gas that she had studied in graduate school was responsible, and the problem was cleared up.         After the war Dr. Wu joined Columbia as a research associate. She was named a full professor in 1958 and was appointed the first Pupin Professor of Physics in 1973.         In her research, she obtained the first successful measurements of low-energy electrons emitted by beta decay, providing experimental evidence for Fermi's theory of weak interactions in the nucleus. She was an author of ''Beta Decay,'' published in 1965, a standard reference for nuclear physicists.         In 1975 Dr. Wu became the first woman to be elected president of the American Physical Society, the chief organization of physicists in the United States. She was also the first woman to receive the Cyrus B. Comstock Award of the National Academy of Sciences and the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate in science from Princeton. The university's president, Robert F. Goheen, said in presenting it in 1958 that Dr. Wu had ''richly earned the right to be called the world's foremost female experimental physicist.''         She also received the National Medal of Science, the nation's highest award for achievement in science, and the Wolf Prize in physics. Dr. Wu was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh as an honorary fellow.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Vincent Yuan, of Albuquerque, N.M., who is a research scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory.       
         Pamela Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, a leading figure in the Democratic Party and for decades one of the most vivacious women on the international scene, died yesterday at the American Hospital in Paris of complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 76.         Mrs. Harriman, who was preparing to relinquish her post and return to Washington, suffered the hemorrhage on Monday at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, where she had gone for her usual swim.         She devoted her later years to helping to rebuild the Democratic Party in the 1980's, raising millions of dollars. She was appointed Ambassador by President Clinton in 1993, and was well regarded as a diplomat.         The President yesterday called her an ''extraordinary U.S. ambassador,'' adding, ''She was a source of judgment and inspiration to me, a source of constant good humor and charm and real friendship, and we will miss her very, very much.''         However great her accomplishments, she could never put to rest the legend of the captivating woman who snared some of the world's richest and most attractive men on two continents, marrying three of them.         Along the way she was trailed by a chorus of angry women who repeated tales of her escapades for decades.         Born in England in 1920 into an old aristocracy that no longer counted for much, she ultimately made her way into a new aristocracy of the wealthy and powerful that counted a great deal. She was 19 when she married Randolph Churchill. Within months he went off to war and she found herself at the center of London as a confidante and hostess for her new father-in-law, Winston Churchill. She called him Papa, and he reveled in her company.         Through Winston Churchill she met Max Beaverbrook, the press baron, who became her mentor; Harry Hopkins, Franklin D. Roosevelt's envoy, who became her friend, and W. Averell Harriman, the lend-lease administrator, who became her lover, and, 30 years later, her third husband.         With expenses underwritten by Mr. Harriman, she took up wartime residence in Grosvenor Square, a small parcel of London that became so filled with Americans that she remembered it as Eisenhowerplatz. There she brought prominent Americans and their British allies together for small dinners and raised eyebrows with her numerous liaisons. The most prominent among them were her London neighbor, John Hay (Jock) Whitney, who became the United States Ambassador to Britain, and Edward R. Murrow, the wartime voice of CBS in London.         After the war, divorced and the mother of a son, Winston Spencer Churchill, she moved to Paris where, with her customary energy and resourcefulness, and with the cachet and connections of the Churchill name, she established a glittering place for herself in international high society.         Later she moved on to America, where she charmed, and married, Leland Hayward, the renowned Broadway agent and producer. After Hayward's death Averell Harriman reappeared, and after a brief courtship they married and became the couple that helped reinvigorate the Democratic Party.         As a girl, Pamela Digby was peaches-and-cream pretty, but no great beauty. Taught, as were most girls of her class, that her goal was to marry well, she developed an exceptional ability to beguile men. She enveloped them in her attention, anticipated their every need and locked on them with adoring eyes that suggested genuine interest in their every word. When it was mentioned to one acquaintance that she was lacking a sense of humor, he shrugged and replied, ''Maybe, but she makes you feel you have the best sense of humor in the world.''         One of her biographers, Christopher Ogden, was beguiled himself when he described her on the night in November 1992 when she welcomed Bill Clinton, the new President she had helped to elect, to a dinner reception at her Georgetown house.         ''She looked fabulous, almost breathtaking,'' he wrote in his book ''Life of the Party.''         ''Her smile can appear too practiced but tonight it was wonderfully wise and guileless,'' he wrote. ''Her voice was low with a sexy, croacky catch.''         Not everyone agreed. Sally Bedell Smith, the author of another biography, ''Reflected Glory,'' said in 1996: ''She wanted great wealth and power. These were big ambitions for a person with little to say and no wit, but she had unflagging determination and ruthlessness.''         Mrs. Harriman was quick to deny that she had ever had an agenda. In 1996, in an interview in the Embassy residence in Paris, she said: ''My life, for me, has been free-flowing. I never thought, 'Now I'm here, I want to go there or do that.' I've taken life as it has presented itself to me.''         She bristled at the way she was characterized in the press and said she should not be faulted if the succession of men in her life happened to be rich and influential. ''Those were the people I met,'' she said. ''Everything in life, I believe, is luck and timing.''         Her first bit of luck was to be born, on March 20, 1920, to Edward Kenelm Digby, soon to become the 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, the former Constance Pamela Alice Bruce. She grew up at Minterne Magna, a 50-room stone mansion in Dorset, where despite severe financial pressures, the family's four children were tended to by maids, governesses and tutors.         She grew up in what she called ''a very small, closed society, the last of really 19th-century culture.''         The Startling Remaking Of a Country Girl         ''It's almost incredible to people I work with today,'' she said last year, ''to realize I was born in a world where a woman was totally controlled by men. I mean, you got married and there was kind of no alternative. The boys were allowed to go off to school. The girls were kept home, educated by governesses. It never sort of occurred to me in the first, I suppose, 20 years of my life that a woman could move from the position that pre-World War II women like me were in.''         She received a certificate in domestic science in 1936 from the Downham School in Hertfordshire. Then she was sent to Paris and Munich for ''finishing.'' As she approached the social season of 1938, when she was presented at court, she was still considered an unfashionable country girl.         Then Winston Churchill's only son, Randolph, well educated but spoiled and trailing a reputation for brilliance, arrogance, extravagance and drunkenness, took her to dinner and proposed on their first date, having already been turned down, according to the London gossips, by a number of other women. He was going off to war, told friends he was sure he would die, and wanted to produce an heir.         They were married on Oct. 4, 1939. ''I was absolutely sincere in wanting it to work,'' she said, ''and I still believe that if it hadn't been wartime, that marriage probably would have worked. I mean there's been too much exaggeration about Randolph being a drunk and Randolph being this and Randolph being that. He was his own worst enemy and very difficult to be his father's son and all that, but he had many, many admirable qualities.''         After following her husband to a succession of army camps, Pamela Churchill was taken under her father-in-law's wing. The Prime Minister found her enchanting. She brought him the London gossip and played the card game bezique with him into the early hours of the morning when he couldn't sleep. And he was elated that she was bearing his grandchild and namesake.         ''Nobody in today's generation can fully understand what it was like to be part of the last probably great war,'' she said, and years later she remembered it as the most exciting time of her life.         During bombing raids she shared the shelter under 10 Downing Street with the Prime Minister and his wife, Clementine. Above ground there were dinners and weekends with world leaders at Chequers or at Lord Beaverbrook's, tea dances at Claridges and the Dorchester, officers to entertain at the Churchill Club and Roosevelt's envoy, Harry Hopkins, to look after.         A Fling With Aly Khan, And Other Romances         After the war she became a reporter for Lord Beaverbrook's Daily Express and Evening Standard, cabling news about politics, the arts and the social scene from London, New York, Palm Beach, Montego Bay, Paris and the south of France.         She looked back at those postwar years as a time to ''catch up on all the things that I might have done if I hadn't had those six years of war,'' she said. ''I wanted to discover a lot of things that I had not done at the age of 19.''         She had a fling with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the Aga Kahn, and after the breakup of her marriage to Randolph Churchill she began her new life in Paris. There she met the Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli and fell in love, and during their five-year romance provided him with connections in England and America. She converted to Catholicism in what some said was an effort to be a more acceptable bride to the heir to the Fiat fortune. But that was not to be.         After their breakup there were five years as mistress to Baron Elie de Rothschild of the French banking family. Because he was married to one of the most well-liked women in Paris society, Mrs. Churchill made enemies. But she had admirers, too, among them Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon.         ''I'm censured for having had friends,'' Mrs. Harriman said in 1996, assailing the many books and articles written about her, ''and, of course, more friends than I've ever really had. Men friends. The amount of people that I read about that I've slept with that I've never slept with -- I mean it's extraordinary!''         She insisted that she was not looking for a rich husband, saying of her biographers and detractors: ''The one thing that they've all missed is the fact that having once been married I said to myself, 'I don't have to get married again.' I was bruised. What annoys me, especially in this world where women are equal with men, why do they all take the same tack, that people didn't marry me? Nobody's ever thought that I didn't want to marry.''         But then she did marry, in 1960. During a visit to New York she was introduced to Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer of such hit musicals as ''South Pacific'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' A friend asked her to go to the theater with Hayward, whose wife, Slim, later known in New York society as Lady Keith, was in Europe. It was not long before Hayward proposed.         She showered him with what Sally Bedell Smith characterized as ''geisha-like devotion.'' She cooked chicken hash on a hot plate when they were out on the road and organized splendid houses in New York and Westchester, but theirs was a complicated marriage. Hayward had three children from his marriage to the actress Margaret Sullavan, who committed suicide in 1960, 11 years after their divorce. The children loved their mother and their first stepmother, but not their father's new wife.         When Hayward died of a stroke in 1971, there was a feud over his will. His daughter Brooke Hayward even suggested in her book, ''Haywire,'' that her last stepmother absconded with a string of pearls her mother had left to her. Pamela Harriman insisted that she knew nothing about the pearls.         As the Wife of Harriman, She Buoys the Democrats         Five months after Hayward's death, at a dinner party given by Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, there was a serendipitous reunion with W. Averell Harriman, who had been widowed the year before. A month later Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward, 51, married the 79-year-old former Governor of New York, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Harry Truman's choice to be President of the United States.         Although Harriman was the heir to the Union Pacific Railroad fortune, he was famously parsimonious. With his new wife, however, he was generous, and began to live up to his means. She fixed up his houses. She became an American citizen and adopted his interests in the Soviet Union and, more exuberantly, in the Democratic Party.         As Mrs. Averell Harriman, she gave fund-raising dinners for Democratic candidates in the 1970's. But it was the election of Ronald Reagan and the big Republican gains in Congress in the 1980 election that galvanized both Harrimans to action. To resuscitate the Democratic Party, they agreed to form their own political action committee, which quickly became known as PamPAC. Mrs. Harriman surrounded herself with advisers and learned quickly. She built up her political curriculum vitae, giving speeches and, with the help of friends, writing Op-Ed pieces for The New York Times and The Washington Post.         The Harriman house in Georgetown, with its fine collection of Impressionist works,  became a headquarters of sorts for the party in exile. Contributors paid thousands of dollars to be invited to Mrs. Harriman's receptions and dinners, where they were given briefings and allowed to rub shoulders with party nabobs like Clark Clifford and Robert Strauss and any number of Presidential candidates and senators, current and past.         When Harriman's health deteriorated, his wife worked assiduously to keep him occupied, making sure he had visitors to keep him company when she was away. By then Mrs. Harriman had her own airplane, so she was able to return to him in the evenings. He died in 1986 at the age of 94.         A $100 Million Fortune, And a Family Feud         There were two funeral services, one in New York and one in Washington, and two burials. Mourners thought they were witnessing his burial in the family plot next to his previous wife, Marie. In fact, The Washington Post later reported, Mrs. Harriman had postponed the actual interment for two months while another burial plot was prepared at his estate in Arden, N.Y. Pamela Harriman will be buried at his side, after a funeral service in Washington next Thursday and a memorial service in Paris.         In addition to her son, Mrs. Harriman is survived by her sisters, Sheila Moore of Atlanta and Ireland, and Jaquetta James of the Isle of Mull, Scotland; her brother, Edward, Lord Digby, of Minterne Magna; four grandchildren and three great grandchildren.         Harriman left his widow most of his fortune, more than $100 million, and designated her an executor and trustee of his estate and their charitable trusts. His daughters and their children were to share in the remains of a trust after Pamela Harriman's death. The financial arrangement set the stage for another family feud.         At about the time of their marriage, Harriman put his investments in the hands of William Rich, a man he believed to be a careful and conservative investor, and he engaged his old friend Clark Clifford and his partner Paul Warnke as his lawyers.         He told his wife to follow their advice, but Mr. Clifford soon became preoccupied with defending himself against charges growing out of allegations that he was involved in the huge B.C.C.I. bank and money-laundering scandal, and Mr. Warnke moved to another law firm. Mr. Rich proceeded to make what the Harriman heirs have charged were highly speculative and unwise investments that resulted in huge losses.         The heirs turned to her to make good on those losses. In 1994 they sued her in Federal court in Manhattan. Family members suggested she had pushed Mr. Rich into making risky investments to maintain her expensive habits. She denied it.         ''I never got involved in finances,'' she said. ''It is totally absurd to think that I had any influence, or tried to have any influence, on the running of the office or the management of the money. Never. There was no reason.''         Mrs. Harriman sold some property as well as a Picasso, a Matisse and a Renoir during that time. The two sides reached a settlement in 1995, agreeing not to divulge the terms, then joined forces to file a civil suit against Mr. Rich in Virginia.         Clinton's Her Candidate And Is Duly Grateful         In 1988 Mrs. Harriman's choice for President was Al Gore, not Michael Dukakis. For the 1992 election she considered a number of candidates before settling on Bill Clinton. She committed herself wholeheartedly to raising money for his campaign and he showed his gratitude by choosing her house for his first triumphal victory dinner in Washington. Later he named her Ambassador to France.         That was how Mrs. Harriman came to preside over the palatial residence of American ambassadors on the Rue du Faubourg-St.-Honore, not far on a Paris street map but a world away from the Avenue de New York and the apartment she occupied in the 1950's as Pamela Churchill.         That she was a woman with a past enhanced her standing with the French. Her energy went into 16-hour days dealing with questions of international trade, NATO expansion and the war in Bosnia, and working the telephone to Washinton late into the night, trying to forestall cuts in the Foreign Service budget. She loved every minute of it.         Remembering Mrs. Harriman yesterday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called her a ''central figure in the history of this century.''         ''America has lost a remarkable representative, the State Department has lost one of its most effective diplomats and I have lost a friend,'' she said.         That Sunday morning in late 1996, as she sat in the living room of her private apartment in the Embassy residence, Mrs. Harriman was asked if there was anything she wished she had done differently.         ''No,'' she said.         ''Really, no regrets?''         ''I consider I have had a very fortunate life.''         ''A happy life?''         ''Very, very. I drank deep of the well.''       
         Constance D. Gibson, an elegant dowager who spent half her life regally overseeing one of Manhattan's crown jewels as the acknowledged queen of Gramercy Park, died on Monday at her home overlooking the park she had nurtured and cherished for more than 50 years. She was 94.         To those who stumble unawares upon the two acres of tree-shaded greenery surrounded by a tall iron fence at the foot of Lexington Avenue, Gramercy Park is an urban wonder, a surprising and soothing respite from the bustling worlds of Third Avenue between 20th and 21st Streets to the east and Park Avenue South to the west.         Yet for all its natural appeal, Gramercy Park is not an accidental wonder. Created by a real estate developer in 1831, it is at once the city's only private park and one whose gardens and greenswards are maintained by unpaid trustees.         An Army general's widow with a commanding presence, Mrs. Gibson, who was the head trustee from 1980 to 1992, took her job so seriously that she supervised the planting of hundreds of tulip bulbs every fall. She kept an eagle eye on the staff of professional gardeners and had such an obsessive interest in the good order of the park that she seemed to know where and when each leaf would fall. From her second-floor bedroom window, she once told a friend, she could see ''that the gardeners are doing exactly what I told them to do.''         Herself an accomplished gardener who raised holly behind her house and tended flowers at her summer home in Massachusetts, Mrs. Gibson was a fixture at the New York Horticultural Society, or ''the Hort,'' as she called it, and was running flower exhibitions in the park long before she became a trustee in 1964.         By the time she moved into a town house on Gramercy Park South in 1940, Mrs. Gibson had established herself as something of a purposeful free spirit.         A native of Liverpool, England, whose father came to the United States when she was 2, Mrs. Gibson, grew up in New Dorp, S. I., in a house whose spacious, English-style garden appealed to her mother and gave Mrs. Gibson a lifelong love of flowers.         After graduating from Bryn Mawr with a degree in fine arts in 1924, she was so disappointed that her father would not let her continue her studies abroad that when she saw an advertisement in The New York Times seeking a French-speaking woman with a size 4B foot, she answered it.         Her father was scandalized, but with the approval of her mother, Mrs. Gibson, who took such pride in her shapely feet that she had her toenails painted even in her 90's, became a foot model in Paris, where she also studied at the Sorbonne and met a self-effacing American Army captain from Poultney, Vt., named Herbert Daskum Gibson.         By the time they were married in 1931, Mrs. Gibson had obtained a master's degree from Columbia, but her husband was still a captain, a circumstance his wife set out to rectify in posts in the Philippines and the United States.         Never mind that he was decorated for valor in World War I and that he performed such distinguished service in the Pacific in World War II that he was promoted to Brigadier General. As Mrs. Gibson later confided to a friend, her husband, who died at 88 in 1980, ''would never have made general without me.''         With her husband at war, Mrs. Gibson moved in with her brother in the Gramercy Park house and became a leader of the New York society home front, throwing herself into a whirlwind of volunteer efforts for organizations like Bundles for Britain and the American Red Cross, serving as an Air Raid warden and even becoming a defense industry expediter.         A petite woman whose elegant clothes were handmade, Mrs. Gibson became a beloved figure in the Gramercy Park neighborhood, where she was seen as a link to the genteel 19th-century era of Edith Wharton and Henry James.         Beneath the surface of her impeccable manners, there was a playfulness that could sometimes startle those who mistook her refined manner and upper-class British accent as a sign of stodgy reserve.         ''How are you today, Mrs. Gibson?'' someone would ask. ''Full of beans,'' she would reply.         In recent years when the decorum of the park's affairs was marred by a sometimes rancorous squabble over the removal of some trees, Mrs. Gibson, who retained the admiration and respect of both factions, generally remained above the fray.         But a chorus of chortles echoed through the park when a newspaper account of the dispute quoted Mrs. Gibson (who could not believe that the perfectly nice reporter she had chatted with would repeat her exact words) as describing one of the disputants as ''a son of a bitch.''         Yet to those who knew her best, she remained such a model of gentle graciousness that the young women who took care of her marveled that even in her final days, when she barely had breath to speak after suffering a stroke, they never placed  her in her bed at night without hearing the labored, whispery words: ''Thank you, very much.''         She leaves no survivors.       
         Dorothy Frooks, who stumped for women's suffrage as a child, recruited thousands of men to World War I service as a teen-ager, and then spent most of the century as a lawyer and political gadfly, died on Sunday at Veterans Hospital in Manhattan. She was about 100 and lived in Manhattan and Peekskill, N.Y.         Among her many achievements were laying the groundwork for aid to dependent children and for small claims courts.         She served as chief yeoman in the Navy in World War I and as a judge advocate in the Army in World War II, taught school in Puerto Rico, ran a flying school, turned out columns for The New York World, wrote half a dozen books, founded The Murray Hills News, represented celebrated murder defendants, ran repeatedly for Congress, corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, feuded with Eleanor Roosevelt, hobnobbed with the King of Greece, turned down marriage proposals from Harry K. Thaw and Fiorello H. La Guardia, and so clouded the issue of her age that even her own family is not sure if she was 99 or 103.         But whether she was ''almost 17,'' in January 1918, as she put it in her her book ''Lady Lawyer,'' or 20, as a contemporaneous newspaper article reported, Miss Frooks, who received a gold medal from President Woodrow Wilson that month, was surely one of the last living Americans to have had a formal audience with Wilson in his White House office (and seen the evangelist Billy Sunday clap him on the back with such gusto that the President's top hat went flying.)         Whatever her age, by then she had a national reputation as ''the infant prodigy,'' ''the baby orator,'' and the girl who had made speeches for women's suffrage from Union Square to Hyde Park before turning her attention to military recruitment and Liberty Bonds.         The daughter of a prosperous businessman and an international society figure, Miss Frooks was born on a 400-acre Hudson Valley farm near Saugerties, N.Y., and grew up there and at the family's winter residence at the Waldorf Hotel.         As the seventh of nine highly articulate children, five of whom became lawyers, Miss Frooks recalled that she was holding her own in animated dinner table conversations on international affairs by the time she was 8 -- two years after she had decided on a legal career.         It was one of her mother's London society friends who spotted her talent for oratory and recruited her for the suffrage movement. Miss Frooks, who recalled making her first street-corner speech when she was 11, cut such a winsome figure in her little girl's bows and frills and spoke with such startling eloquence that she was always the first speaker at curbside rallies. The speakers who followed had learned they were less likely to be stoned or pelted with tomatoes when Miss Frooks led off.         She was even more impressive as an unofficial military recruiter, and after she had talked an estimated 30,000 men into signing up, primarily for the Navy, President Wilson not only presented her with a medal but recruited her for the Navy. As the highest-ranking woman in the service, Miss Frooks continued and expanded her recruitment activities and later organized a women's veterans organization.         Miss Frooks, who received a degree from the old Hamilton Law School in Chicago and then a master's from New York University, was a lawyer at 21, by her account.         By the early 1920's, at least, she was well known in New York as the first full-time lawyer for the Salvation Army. After setting up free legal clinics and discovering that poor people were often frustrated by their inability to collect small debts, she conceived the idea of a small claims court and lobbied hard until the first was signed into law by her old friend and suitor, Mayor La Guardia.         Thaw, the man who had killed the celebrated architect Stanford White 20 years earlier, hired Miss Frooks in 1926 to defend a 16-year-old girl who had killed the man who raped her when she was 12.         Miss Frooks, who eventually won a suspended sentence for her client,  became so incensed that the girl's widowed mother had been forced to neglect her children while struggling to eke out a living that she helped prod the legislature into establishing aid to dependent children.         The case also led to a ''My Day,'' column in The World, which lasted until 1932, when she was told that she was being replaced by Mrs. Roosevelt, a circumstance that may have contributed to her animosity toward the First Lady.         For all her childhood support of women's suffrage and her own legal career, Miss Frooks was no ordinary feminist. She made fiery speeches against the proposed equal rights amendment in 1975. As she had put it in 1922, ''Women should be in the home, have adorable husbands, and be the only wife.''         Miss Frooks, who was married in 1986, is survived by her husband, Jay P. Vanderbilt.       
         Dr. Jenny R. Bramley, the first woman to receive a doctorate in physics in the United States, died on May 26 at the Manor Care Health Facility in Lancaster, Pa., where she was a resident. She was 87.         Dr. Bramley, born Jenny Rosenthal in Moscow, earned a bachelor's degree at 16 at the University of Paris. She promptly sailed to New York, where she began her graduate studies at New York University.         She earned a doctorate in 1929 at 19, and university officials said she became the first woman to receive that degree in physics from an American institution.         She did research at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Michigan and taught at Brooklyn College and New York University.         Dr. Bramley was a physicist at the United States Army Signal Corps Engineering Laboratory in Belmar, N.J. While there, she met her husband, Dr. Arthur Bramley. He was a physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, which led to the development of the atomic bomb. He died in 1971. Later, Dr. Jenny Bramley worked for the Navy designing cathode ray tubes.         Dr. Bramley held patents for a number of devices, including color-television tubes and the early tubes used in computer terminals.         Survivors include a daughter, Nora Poling of Mountville, Pa.; a son, Alan Bramley of North Attleboro, Mass.; 11 grandchildren, and 1 great-granddaughter.         Correction:  July 9, 1997, Wednesday         An obituary of Dr. Jenny R. Bramley on June 2 incorrectly described the doctorate in physics she received at New York University in 1929. It was not the first awarded to a woman by an American university. (One compilation lists 26 women who earned doctorates in physics before 1929.)       
         Mary Opal Wolanin, a nurse who did research on long-term care for the elderly, died on May 22 at Methodist Hospital in San Antonio. She was 86 and lived in San Antonio.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her brother, Calvin Borror of Wichita, Kan.         Ms. Wolanin, who was inducted into the American Nurses Association Hall of Fame last year, began her career as a nurse in 1935 at Kansas City General Hospital in Missouri. From 1941 to 1943, she was a second lieutenant in the Army Nurses Corps.         Later, she joined the faculty of the University of Arizona School of Nursing. She eventually became an associate professor and worked to establish one of the first gerontological nursing programs in the country. She began to study nursing homes in 1972 after receiving an appointment with the Regional Medical Program in Arizona. Throughout her career, Ms. Wolanin focused on improving nursing care for patients suffering from dementia.         A native of Chrisney, Ind., Ms. Wolanin graduated from the University of Arizona and received a master's degree from the University of Arizona School of Nursing.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by her husband of 54 years, Maj. H. J. Wolanin; another brother, Martin Borror of Tucson, Ariz., and a sister, Florence Lewis of Quenemo, Kan.       
         Denise Browne Hare, who photographed many leading painters and sculptors of the mid-20th century, died on Wednesday at Sharon Hospital in Sharon, Conn. She was 73 and lived in Amenia, N.Y.         The cause was cancer, said her son Morgan Hare.         Ms. Hare was born in Manhattan. During World War II, she worked as an analyst for Army Intelligence in Washington.         Ms. Hare and her first husband, Edmund Delaney, moved to New York City in the 1940's, where she became friends with artists including Mark Rothko. After her divorce from Mr. Delaney, she married the sculptor David Hare in 1962, and the Hare household became a favorite haunt of still other artists.         Her photographs of Joseph Cornell and Philip Guston appeared in books by Dore Ashton in 1974 and 1976.         Ms. Hare's marriage ended in divorce in 1986.         In addition to her son Morgan of Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Nick Delaney of Seattle; a daughter, Topher Delaney of San Francisco; two sisters, Eliane Koevas of Chester, Conn., and Jenny de Kergolay of Paris, and six grandchildren.       
         Maria Rosa Henson, the first of a growing number of Philippine women to break a long silence and announce that she had been systematically raped by Japanese soldiers during World War II, has died at age 69.         Her family said she died of a heart attack last week in the small home she had built in Manila using part of a $19,000 settlement she received from a specially created Japanese fund a year ago.         Mrs. Henson, who married after the war and supported a family as a worker at a cigarette factory, embarked in her 60's on a new life as a symbolic representative of as many as 200,000 women who had been forced to work in Japanese Army brothels.         In recent years, since Mrs. Henson's announcement in 1992, the issue has drawn wide attention, and victims have banded together to protest in the Philippines and Korea.         Last year Mrs. Henson published a stark account of her ordeal titled ''Comfort Woman: Slave of Destiny'' (Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism). A film about her life is being prepared in the Philippines.  She had planned to travel to Vienna next March to speak about her experiences and to open an exhibit of autobiographical drawings.         Mrs. Henson was also the lead plaintiff in a class action suit against the Japanese Government seeking damages for forced prostitution, and shortly before she died she was interviewed by a team of lawyers visiting from Tokyo.         In an interview last November, Mrs. Henson said she had fought against her trauma by clinging to the memory of every detail of her abuse, which began when she was 15 and lasted for nine months. ''I learned to remember everything, to remember always, so that I will not go mad,'' she said.         ''I am telling my story so that they will feel humiliated,'' she said of her tormentors. ''It is true: I am an avenger of the dead.''         Since Mrs. Henson stepped forward to reveal what she had felt was a shameful secret about her past, 168 other women in the Philippines have followed her lead.         But her acceptance last year of compensation prompted controversy because it came from the Asian Women's Fund -- a private fund organized by the Japanese Government -- rather than from the Government itself.         Some local women's groups opposed this form of compensation, calling it an attempt by the Japanese Government to shirk official responsibility and to avoid opening the door to lawsuits from other war victims.         Along with her compensation from the private fund, Mrs. Henson received a letter of apology from the Japanese Government. She then became the lead plaintiff in the class-action suit.         But her strongest indictment came in her book, a blunt and graphic account, which she wrote in longhand on sheets of lined paper and which has been published in the Philippines and Japan.         ''As I was writing, I was crying,'' Mrs. Henson said in the interview.         In her account of her daily routine, she said soldiers had lined up outside a small building to wait their turns with one of a half dozen imprisoned women or teen-age girls.         ''My work began, and I lay down as one by one the soldiers raped me,'' Mrs. Henson wrote. ''Every day, anywhere from 12 to over 20 soldiers assaulted me. There were times when there were as many as 30. They came to the garrison in truckloads.         ''I lay on the bed with my knees up and my feet on the mat, as if I were giving birth. Whenever the soldiers did not feel satisfied they vented their anger on me. When the soldiers raped me, I felt like a pig. I was angry all the time.''         Mrs. Henson is survived by a son and a daughter as well as by several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.       
         Nancy Dickerson, who in the 1950's and 60's combined network television reporting with her role as a sought-after Washington partygiver and insider, died yesterday in New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and maintained homes for many years both in Washington and New York.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke she suffered in January 1996, said a son, John Dickerson. Ms. Dickerson suffered from declining health after being stricken by a heart attack, and then the stroke. She seemed to be making progress but then began to regress, said her husband, John C. Whitehead. Ms. Dickerson was given final rites of the Roman Catholic Church last Thursday.         In 1960, as Nancy Hanschman, she became the first woman to be hired as a network correspondent by CBS News and was a mainstay there and in the Washington bureau of NBC, in which she worked from 1963 to 1970. After that, she formed her own company and devoted herself to producing and appearing in syndicated television productions. One project was ''784 Days That Changed America -- From Watergate to Resignation,'' which won the Peabody Award. Another of her programs was ''Being With John F. Kennedy,'' a documentary co-produced with Robert Drew. She also served as a commentator for Fox News.         Among the stories of which she was most proud were her 1980 interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The interviews were presented by the Public Broadcasting System.         She also produced for PBS a documentary on the role of women in the Arab world titled, ''Islam: The Veil and the Future.''         Ms. Dickerson often acknowledged over the years that her success came partly from knowing people.         ''My social life always seems to revolve around business,'' she said.         The people on her ''A'' list who attended her parties included Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Averell and Pamela Harriman, Walter Annenberg, Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Edward Bennett Williams, Joseph Califano, Elliot Richardson and other prominent figures in administrations from John F. Kennedy's to Mr. Reagan's.         She entertained them at her townhouse in Washington's Kalorama Triangle or at Merrywood in McLean, Va., the estate where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Princess Lee Radziwill grew up. Merrywood was acquired in 1965 by her husband then, C. Wyatt Dickerson, a real-estate investor, and it was where some of Ms. Dickerson's most lavish parties were held.         It was an indication of her place in the capital's social firmament that when she married Mr. Dickerson in 1962, a party was given in her honor, hosted by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Justice Arthur Goldberg of the Supreme Court and Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut.         In her memoirs, published as ''Among Those Present'' by Random House in 1976, Ms. Dickerson revealed that in the 1950's, she had dated John F. Kennedy when he was a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York and had been propositioned at least once by Lyndon B. Johnson. (She turned him down, she said.) Left unfinished at the time of her death was a sequel to this book.         Ms. Dickerson used her contacts to get many scoops in Washington. One of them was Mr. Johnson's decision, in 1964, to ask Senator Hubert H. Humphrey to be his running mate. Another was a rare interview with Speaker Sam Rayburn (who did not like to be interviewed on camera) and an exclusive interview with Senator Barry Goldwater, who wanted to explain to her why he had voted against the Civil Rights Bill.         Not all her exclusives came from Washington. In 1963, she was first to learn that an airline crash near San Francisco had been caused because a deranged passenger had shot the pilot.         She was born Nancy Conners Hanschman to Frederick R. and Florence Conners Hanschman on Jan. 27, 1927, in Wauwatosa, Wisc., a suburb of Milwaukee. She attended Clark College, then a Catholic school for women in Dubuque, Iowa, then entered the University of Wisconsin, where she concentrated in English, Spanish and Portuguese, earning her bachelor's degree in 1948.         She taught school for a time in Milwaukee but in 1951, came to New York in search, she said, of an interesting job. When she could not find something suitable, she went to Washington, where she became a registrar in the Institute of Languages at Georgetown University. She soon found a more desirable job, doing research for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.         She heard that CBS was looking for somebody to produce a radio show about the political scene in Washington called ''The Leading Question,'' and talked her way into it. She did well as a producer, although she had never done it before, and as a result was named associate producer of ''Face The Nation,'' when CBS started that successful interview program in the middle 50's. One of her coups was to persuade the Speaker of the House, Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, to make his television debut on CBS.         She wanted to be on the air herself but in those days, the national reporting staff of CBS was a male preserve. In order to break into it, she used her 1959 vacation to go to Europe to do a radio feature on the peacetime activities of the Women's Army Corps. CBS officials liked it so much, they used it on ''The World Tonight,'' then a mainstay of CBS Radio.         In 1960, CBS decided it would expand its staff to cover the Presidential elections and named her its first woman correspondent in February of that year. The other two networks, NBC and ABC, already had named women to their news staffs, but Miss Hanschman was certainly in the vanguard of women in the ranks of network correspondents. She first covered Senator Humphrey's campaign, but when he lost the West Virginia primary to Mr. Kennedy and dropped out of the primary, she covered Senator Lyndon Johnson all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in July of 1960, where he became Mr. Kennedy's running mate,         Later that year, CBS gave her own weekday radio show, ''One Woman's Washington,'' in which she discussed Washington topics that she thought might be of interest to women around the country. But she did not want to be involved only in women's programming and in the next few years, covered Mr. Kennedy's funeral and the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington.  In 1963, she left CBS and joined NBC News in Washington, where she remained until 1970, covering general national news and politics.         She married C. Wyatt Dickerson,  in 1962. That union ended in divorce in 1983. In 1989, she married John C. Whitehead, chairman of AEA Investors, an investment concern in New York, and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He is also a former senior partner and co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and was a Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. She maintained a home in New York on Sutton Place and was active in various philanthropic efforts, including serving on the boards of Covenant House, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the New York Public Library. She was also a member of the Central Park Conservancy. In Washington she was active in the White House Endowment Fund, among other causes.         Survivors in addition to her husband include three daughters, Elizabeth Earls and Jane Dickerson, both of Washington, and Ann Pullion of Villanova, Pa.; and two sons, Michael Dickerson of Atlanta, Ga., and John Dickerson of Washington, and a sister, Mary Ellen Phillip of Milwaukee.         Correction:  October 20, 1997, Monday         An obituary yesterday about Nancy Dickerson referred incorrectly to Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a host at a party for her when she was married in 1962. Johnson was Vice President, not President, at the time.       
         Rosemary R. Gunning, who led fights against school busing in New York City in the 1960's and went on to become one of the first female Assembly members, died on Saturday night at the home of a niece in Roslyn, N.Y. She was 92.         The cause was liver cancer, said a grandniece, Patricia Gunning.         Ms. Gunning was known for her strong speaking style, clear arguments and intense community involvement as she became a founder of the state Conservative Party and the first woman to run for citywide office, in 1965, for City Council President on a ticket headed by William F. Buckley Jr. in the mayoral slot.         Beginning in 1968, she served four terms in the Assembly, becoming the first Conservative to win state office.         She was a leader in organizing Housing Court in New York and was an outspoken proponent of landlords' rights.         But she often took unexpected positions, favoring the proposed equal rights amendment as she opposed abortion. But Ms. Gunning became known as a leader of the fight against forced busing, a battle that she never defined in terms of race, but always as an issue of neighborhood control.         The effort thrust her to the forefront of one of the most tumultuous bitter battles in the city's history, with frequent picketing and racial epithets. Almost one-quarter of the students in the city stayed out of school one day in a protest that Ms. Gunning helped organize.         ''Integration is a fine thing,'' she said at the time. ''From the beginning, one of the things we wanted was to have no racial disputes, no lining of whites up against Negroes.''         However, she was not a parent. ''If I had children, I wouldn't have time for all this,'' she said.         In those battles, Ms. Gunning, who was shorter than 5 feet and often needed platforms to reach the microphones in front of her, became known as Grandma Gunning, for her middle-class appearance and sometimes stern demeanor.         It was her clarity of mind that most impressed Mr. Buckley, he said, adding, ''What was special about her was her facility in taking complicated matters and putting them in very clear negotiable form.''         But others described her as a dangerous force in 1964, particularly her urgings to keep children out of school as a protest. The president of the Board of Education, James Donovan, called that reprehensible, saying the move was a ''conspiracy to destroy'' public education.         Ms. Gunning's allies strenuously argue that time has vindicated her position. ''History has proven her right,'' Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party, said. ''Forced school busing ultimately ended up being a total failure in New York, ripping up neighborhood after neighborhood.''         Indeed, school busing was replaced by neighborhood control of schools and local school boards, a change that recently gave way to greater central control by the Board of Education.         Ms. Gunning was born in Brooklyn and moved to Queens at an early age. She entered the Brooklyn Law School directly from high school, one of the last students to do so. She was one of 10 women in a class of 600 and was admitted to the bar in 1930. After entering private practice, she later  worked 11 years as a private lawyer with the Army.         From her early youth until she died, she lived in the house in which her grandparents had lived, a white clapboard at 1867 Grove Street in Ridgewood, Queens. Her husband, Lester Moffett, had various jobs, including working as a guard at the 1964-65 World's Fair.         For all her accomplishments, people seem to remember her as the woman next door. Assemblyman Robert Werts, a Republican with whom she served, remembered an event at Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's estate to entertain legislators, recalling, ''I looked over, and she was hitting her husband over the head with a pocketbook to straighten him out.''         She worked as a private lawyer until she was 90, her grandniece said. She also continued to lobby on behalf of property owners, though she sometimes forgot to collect the $200-a-month rent that she charged a tenant for a room in her house. She also volunteered to help immigrants with  legal problems.         Surviving are a nephew, John, of Islip, N.Y.; 2 nieces, Marie and Ann, of Roslyn; 13 grandnieces and nephews, and a cousin, Sylvia Boyland of Fresh Meadows, Queens.       
         Helen Stevenson Meyner, a liberal Democrat who was elected to two terms in Congress by a heavily Republican district in New Jersey, died yesterday after a long illness at the Heartland Health Care Center, a nursing home in Fort Myers, Fla. She was 69.         Mrs. Meyner was born into a prominent Democratic family in New York City in 1928. Her parents, William E. and Eleanor B. Stevenson, set up American Red Cross units in England and North Africa during World War II. Her father, who founded the law firm that became Debevoise & Plimpton, was president of Oberlin College in Ohio after the war and Ambassador to the Philippines from 1961 to 1964.         A graduate of Colorado College in Colorado Springs, Mrs. Meyner was a field worker for the Red Cross in Korea from 1950 to 1952, then a tour guide at the United Nations. There, she met an executive of Trans World Airlines, who hired her to travel the world promoting T.W.A. under the name Mary Gordon.         In 1956, she volunteered for the Presidential campaign of Adlai E. Stevenson, a distant cousin of her mother's, and met Gov. Robert B. Meyner of New Jersey, who was visiting Oberlin College. They were married the following year.         At Morven, the governor's mansion in Princeton, Mrs. Meyner welcomed visitors like Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. She also served on the boards of the Newark Museum, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra and Rider College. As a member of a panel of the Kennedy Administration, Mrs. Meyner studied the problems of the United States Foreign Service corps in Eastern Europe.         Because of a two-term limit, the Meyners left Morven in 1962 and bought a home in Princeton. Mr. Meyner began a law practice, and Mrs. Meyner continued her community service.         After four years of fertility treatment in the late 1960's, Mrs. Meyner became pregnant for the first time and gave an interview to The Ladies' Home Journal for an article titled ''My Miracle Baby.'' But in February 1970, the month the article was published, her baby, a full-term boy, was born dead. Mrs. Meyner is survived by a sister, Priscilla Hunt, of Cambridge, Mass.         In 1972, Democratic Party leaders asked her to run for Congress from the Meyner family home in Phillipsburg, in the heavily Republican 13th Congressional District in Sussex and Morris Counties. She lost that election to Joseph J. Maraziti, a Republican, but defeated him in 1974, the same year that Representative Millicent Fenwick, a Republican, was elected. Only two other women had represented New Jersey on Capitol Hill before.         Overshadowed somewhat by Representative Fenwick, Mrs. Meyner, who established a solidly liberal voting record, was sometimes referred to as New Jersey's ''other Congresswoman.''         During her two terms in office, Mrs. Meyner served on the Committee on International Relations, but turned down an invitation to join the powerful Ways and Means Committee, saying she feared stretching herself too thin. As a member of International Relations, she fought to stop the nuclear arms race, but she  helped prevent the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County from closing in 1976 by having the Armament Research and Development Command transferred there.         Mrs. Meyner also pressed for women's rights while in Congress. In 1978, she was defeated by the Republican candidate, Jim Courter.         After leaving Washington, Mrs. Meyner served on the boards of directors of Allied Chemical, Girard Trust and Prudential Insurance, and through her work in these companies, she continued to advocate for women. In 1990, Governor Meyner died and Mrs. Meyner retired to Captiva Island, Fla. She and her family established the Robert B. Meyner and Helen S. Meyner Center for the Study of State and Local Government at her husband's alma mater, Lafayette College in Easton, Pa.       
         Veronica Geng, an accomplished parodist who spun out biting pieces for The New Yorker based on chance remarks by hapless politicians and the banalities of wedding announcements, died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, said a friend, Barbara Epstein, editor of The New York Review of Books. She was 56.         The cause was a brain tumor, said  Philip Roth, the novelist, who was also a friend.         As a writer of ''casuals,'' the short articles that appear in The New Yorker, she carried on in the tradition of S. J. Perelman. A typical Geng piece was a crazed amalgam of stock phrases, as in an imaginary wedding announcement reprinted in her 1984 collection, ''Partners'': ''The bride, married at the Presbyterian Church and Trust, is an alumna of the Royal Doulton School and Loot University.  Her father is retired from the family consortium. She is also a descendant of Bergdorf Goodman of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Her previous marriage ended in pharmaceuticals.''         Her 1988 collection, ''Love Trouble Is My Business,'' included a ''letter'' from the proprietor of a dog kennel to ''Secretary Weinberger'' about a defense contractor's $87.25 bill for dog boarding: ''I wear the key to the pantry around my neck on a platinum chain, and not only is the level of the kibble bin measured twice a day but the bin itself is equipped with a state-of-the art laser lock, which cannot be opened without a microcoded propylene wafer.''         Ms. Geng was also an unofficial editor of Mr. Roth's novels. ''I always gave Veronica my books,'' he said shortly before she died.         Ms. Geng was born in 1941 in Atlanta. Her father was a career Army officer. She once told The Christian Science Monitor that she traced her humor to ''Alice in Wonderland,'' read to her from the age of 2. In it, she said, she discovered ''a sense of illogic and how funny illogic is.''         That book ''and the paperback collection of the Watergate transcripts are my two favorite books.'' Ms. Geng said. ''They're not unlike each other.''         She attended the University of Pennsylvania. In the mid-1970's her short parody of the film critic Pauline Kael, published in The New York Review of Books, caught the eye of Roger Angell, a fiction editor at The New Yorker. Mr. Angell gave her a tryout and she went on to become his  assistant.         Mr. Roth credits Ms. Geng with persuading William Shawn, then The New Yorker's editor, to publish his 1979 novella, ''The Ghost Writer,'' in two parts. From then on, he said, he  came to depend on her.         Charles McGrath, a friend and colleague at The New Yorker who is now editor of The New York Times Book Review, said: ''Her thing was high, intellectual comedy.''         In 1992, after Tina Brown took over as editor of The New Yorker, Ms. Geng and Ms. Brown had a falling out. Ms. Geng said she was dismissed; Ms. Brown said she resigned.         Ms. Geng had no immediate survivors.         Correction:  January 1, 1998, Thursday  An obituary of the parodist and editor Veronica Geng on Friday omitted a survivor. He is her brother, Steve Geng of Manhattan.
