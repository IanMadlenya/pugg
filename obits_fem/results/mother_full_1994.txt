         Lynne Murray Johnson, the wife of Belton Kleberg Johnson, an heir to the King Ranch in Kingsville, Tex., died on Sunday at her home in San Antonio. She was 50.         The cause was cancer, said Janette Ganster, a spokeswoman for the Johnson family.         Mrs. Johnson was born in Narromine, Australia, and moved to Mexico, where she was married to Ricardo Penafiel, an industrialist, who is deceased. She moved to San Antonio in the mid-1980's and married Mr. Johnson in 1990.         She is survived by her husband; her mother, Sadie Murray, and her brother, Paul Murray, both of Newport Beach, Australia.       
         Esther Ralston, a silent-screen actress and vaudeville star who was known for a time as "the American Venus" for her starring role in the 1926 film of that name, died on Jan. 14 at her home in Ventura, Calif. She was 91.         The cause was a heart attack, said Jess L. Hoaglin, a friend.         Miss Ralston, who appeared in more than 150 films before and after the silent era, was born in Bar Harbor, Me., and came to Hollywood in 1916 with her parents. She was soon taking bit parts in Western films. An early appearance with Jackie Coogan in Charlie Chaplin's 1921 film "The Kid" won her the role of Mrs. Darling in a 1924 film adaptation of "Peter Pan." 'American Venus'         In "The American Venus," directed by Frank Tuttle, Ms. Ralston played a star-crossed contestant in the Miss America Pageant who is unable to compete after an automobile accident. Among her other films were "Beggars on Horseback" (1925), "Old Ironsides" (1926), "Children of Divorce" (1927) and "Betrayal" (1929), with Emil Jannings.         In the early 1930's, she made several pictures in Britain, including "Rome Express," opposite Conrad Veidt, and "After the Ball," with Basil Rathbone.         In 1933, she returned to Hollywood, and she acted in films for the rest of the 1930's. One of her last appearances was in "Tin Pan Alley" (1940), which starred Alice Faye. Ms. Ralston came out of retirement in 1961 to play the mother in a daytime soap opera on NBC, "Our Five Daughters." Later, she worked as an actor's agent and as a consultant for a lighting studio in Glens Falls, N.Y.         Ms. Ralston's three marriages ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son, Ted Lloyd of Phoenix; a brother, Carleton Ralston of Los Angeles; two daughters, Judy Richmond of Mill Valley, Calif., and Mary Baxter of Phoenix; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Sherry Mathis, an actress who performed on Broadway and in the daytime soap opera "Search for Tomorrow," died on Jan. 23 in Memphis. She was 44.         The cause was cancer, said her brother William A. Mathis.         Ms. Mathis was a graduate of Memphis State University. She came to New York in 1971 and made her Broadway debut in the Stephen Sondheim musical "A Little Night Music." She also appeared in "Music Is," a 1976 musical by George Abbott, Richard Adler and Will Holt, which was based on Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night."         For seven years, Ms. Mathis appeared in the role of Lisa Sentel on NBC's "Search for Tomorrow."         In addition to her brother William, of Memphis, she is survived by another brother, Charles M. Mathis Jr. of Salt Lake City, and her mother, Laura Mathis.       
         Natalie Molostwoff, a former executive director of the School of American Ballet, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         The cause was cancer, said Nathalie Gleboff, the current executive director of the school, which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet.         Ms. Molostwoff, whose original name was Natalie Merimanova, was a native of Baku, Azerbaijan, and emigrated to New York City with her mother when she was a girl. In later years, she became a secretary and was hired by the School of American Ballet in 1938.         Eugenie Ouroussow, the school's director at the time, soon discovered that Ms. Molostwoff possessed administrative skills. She became Ms. Ouroussow's assistant. When Ms. Ouroussow died in 1976, Ms. Molostwoff succeeded her as executive director, holding that post until she retired in 1991.         Ms. Molostwoff's first marriage ended in divorce, but she continued to use her married surname professionally.         She is survived by her second husband, the choreographer John Taras.       
         Sonny Sloan, a driving force behind several philanthropic programs at the New York Public Library, died on Saturday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68.         The cause was cancer, said her former husband, Howard Sloan.         A lifelong resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Sloan was a trustee of the New York Public Library. She started the library's Adopt-a-School program, which sends library volunteers into public elementary schools. She was also instrumental in starting the annual library luncheon, in 1981, and an advisory committee of people from the publishing industry.         She was born Irvil June Lawson in Manhattan. After graduating from Colby Junior College, she opened an art gallery in Manhattan, the Barone Gallery. When Mrs. Sloan retired from her gallery work in the 1960's, she started her philanthropic work for the library.         Mrs. Sloan was chairwoman of the library volunteers from 1984 until 1988, and was co-chairwoman of the library's council of conservators. She was also a board member of the Citizens Committee for Children and the Dance Theater Foundation at New York City Center.         She is survived by her mother, Florence Lawson of Florida; a brother, Thomas Lawson of Sandy Hook, Conn.; three children, Douglas Sloan of Manhattan, Kathryn Roth of Weston, Mass., and Gillis Bolton of Roxbury, Conn., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  January 11, 1994, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about a trustee of the New York Public Library who died on Saturday misspelled her first name in some copies. She was Sonny Sloan, not Sunny.       
         Emily Taft Douglas, a former United States Representative from Illinois, died on Friday at a nursing home in White Plains. She was 94 and had lived in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., since moving from Washington in 1986.         Mrs. Douglas was the widow of former Senator Paul H. Douglas, who represented Illinois from 1949 to 1966. But having served in the House from 1945 to 1947, she was the first American woman to precede a husband to Congress. Both were Democrats.         In the House, Mrs. Douglas became a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and campaigned for the fledgling United Nations. She traveled in war-ravaged Europe and backed the relief efforts of the United Nations.         She introduced legislation for bookmobiles to bring library services to rural America, and such a bill eventually passed after her husband's election as the Hill-Douglas Act. Marched for Civil Rights         Mrs. Douglas was elected in 1944 after a campaign against isolationism and went to Washington as Representative-at-Large, representing Illinois as a whole. By 1946, the political climate had changed and her support of the Truman Administration's policies sank her bid for re-election.         During her husband's 18 years on Capitol Hill, Mrs. Douglas was an advocate of civil rights and marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Alabama. She was a representative to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other United Nations conferences. A Unitarian, she was also a moderator of the American Unitarian Association.         Mrs. Douglas was the author of "Appleseed Farm" (1948), a children's book; "Remember the Ladies" (1966), the story of women who helped shape America, and "Margaret Sanger" (1970), about the pioneer in family planning.         A native of Chicago, she was the daughter of Lorado Taft, the sculptor, and Ada Bartless Taft. After graduating from the University of Chicago, she studied acting.         Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, yesterday called the Douglases good partners and said, "Together, Emily and Paul Douglas contributed immensely to Illinois and the nation."         Paul Douglas died in 1976. Mrs. Douglas is survived by a daughter, Dr. Jean Taft Douglas Bandler of Manhattan, and two grandsons.         Correction:  February 3, 1994, Thursday         An obituary on Tuesday about Emily Taft Douglas, a former Democratic Representive from Illinois, misstated the middle name of her mother, who died before her. She was Ada Bartlett Taft.       
         Jarmila Novotna, a Czech-born lyric soprano who sang major roles at the Metropolitan Opera from 1940 to 1956, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         She died of natural causes, said her daughter, Jarmila Packard.         Miss Novotna was widely considered one of the finest singing actresses of her time. Her interpretations of such roles as Donna Elvira, Euridice, Manon, Melisande, Antonia and Marenka were praised for their intelligence and lyrical grace. She also excelled in trouser roles, particularly Orlofsky in "Die Fledermaus," Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Octavian in "Der Rosenkavalier." On hearing her American debut in San Francisco in "Madama Butterfly" in 1939, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times: "There is grace, warmth, communicative feeling in all that she does."  'Charming Simplicity'         She made her Metropolitan debut in "La Boheme" in 1940, singing with Jussi Bjoerling. The Times review noted her "charming simplicity, feeling and high artistic intelligence." That year Downes also praised her "great" Violetta at the Met: "She conceived the music, from first note to last, dramatically, and portrayed the character with an aristocratic sensibility and simplicity.         "The word and the tone were indissoluble; the phrasing was that of the finest musician."         In her years at the Metropolitan Opera, Miss Novotna sang 193 performances -- 142 in the opera house, the rest on tour -- and won consistent praise for her expressiveness and musicianship.         Her acting abilities and regal appearance also led to other offers: the director Max Reinhardt urged her to devote herself to the theater; the studio head Louis B. Mayer asked her to become a film star. During the course of her career, she appeared in Hollywood films ("The Great Caruso," "The Search"), on Broadway (as an unscrupulous concert singer in the 1953 drama "Sherlock Holmes") and on television (as Kim Stanley's mother in a postwar drama set in France). But she resisted all attempts to steer her away from singing, which was her first love.  Art as Beauty         "Of course there are many important things in life besides music," she said in a 1989 interview in Opera News, "but that doesn't make music unimportant. If you love music, what would life be without it -- can you imagine? Art is what brings beauty into life."         Miss Novotna studied with Emmy Destinn and made her debut at the age of 17 with the Prague National Opera. She continued her studies in Milan and became a member of the Vienna State Opera from 1933 to 1938, eventually singing opera and concerts in most of the major houses of Europe. The Met invited her to sing in 1928, but she did not want to be separated from her future husband, the Baron George Daubek, whom she married in 1931.         Toscanini brought her to the attention of the Met again after she sang Pamina under his direction in Salzburg in 1937. She came to New York in 1940, arriving, she noted years later, the day Hitler marched into Prague.  A Recording Re-released         During the war years she recorded "Songs of Lidice," in memory of the victims of the Nazi massacre. The recording, recently rereleased on CD by Supraphon, presents folk songs of her native land; the piano accompaniments are by Jan Masaryk, the son of the former president of Czechoslovakia.         Masaryk died in 1948, and the loss of his protection led to the nationalization of the Daubeks' 3,700-acre estate and castle. That same year, Miss Novotna appeared in Fred Zinnemann's film "The Search," as a mother seeking her lost son at the end of World War II.         Miss Novotna moved from Vienna to New York after her husband's death in 1981. She was frequently seen at opera performances and at events celebrating the art of singing.         In addition to her daughter, of New York City, she is survived by a son, George Daubek of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Ann M. Sperber, whose biography of Edward R. Murrow was a best-seller in 1986, died on Friday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 58.         The cause was an apparent heart attack, said her brother, Dr. Alan Sperber.         Miss Sperber's book, "Murrow: His Life and Times" (Freundlich Books), was a well-received biography that was republished in paperback in 1987. She had spent over a decade writing the work and had first collected research material for it in Berlin while a Fulbright Scholar there in 1956-57.         Before writing the book about Mr. Murrow, Miss Sperber was an editor of children's books for Putnam and McGraw-Hill. She graduated from Barnard College in 1956.         She is survived by her mother, Lisa Sperber, and her brother, both of Manhattan.       
         Maria St. Just, an actress and longtime friend of Tennessee Williams, died on Tuesday at her home in London. She was in her late 60's or early 70's, her family said.         The cause was heart failure brought on by severe rheumatoid arthritis, said her daughter Natasha Grenfell.         Lady St. Just was born in Petrograd but was taken by her mother to London when she was an infant. Her father, a doctor, remained in the Soviet Union and was later executed. She studied ballet as a young girl, but a leg operation when she was 14 put an end to her plans for a dancing career.         She won a scholarship to study at the Old Vic, after which she joined John Gielgud's company.         In 1948, before the company embarked on a foreign tour, she attended a party given by Mr. Gielgud in honor of Williams. A lifelong friendship with the playwright ensued. Lady St. Just was a co-executor of Williams's estate, and in 1990 she published "Five O'Clock Angel: Letters of Tennessee Williams to Maria St. Just, 1948-1982" (Alfred A. Knopf).         She appeared in the film "Room With a View" (1985) and in "Maurice" (1987), which was filmed at her estate near Salisbury.         In 1956 she married Peter Grenfell, the son of a British partner of J. P. Morgan. In 1973 Grenfell became a peer. He died in 1984.         In addition to her daughter Natasha, of London, she is survived by another daughter, Pulcheria, of Orleans, France, and two granddaughters.       
         Willie Mae Ford Smith, a pioneering gospel singer, died on Wednesday at the Tower Village Nursing Home in St. Louis. She was 89.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Anthony Heilbut, a friend and her recording producer.         Mother Smith, as she was widely known, was one of the first singers to perform in the blues-influenced gospel style created by Thomas A. Dorsey in the 1920's and 30's. Her deep contralto and flamboyant vocal flights made her a leading performer of the 1930's and 40's, and she was a major influence on singers like Mahalia Jackson.         Willie Mae Ford was born in Rolling Fork, Miss., 1 of 14 children in a musical family. She moved to St. Louis at the age of 12, and sang with family members in the Ford Sisters. In 1927, she married James Peter Smith and began a career as a soloist.         She started working with Dorsey's National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses in the early 1930's, and she became the director of the convention's Soloist's Bureau, evaluating and training gospel singers until the late 1980's. During the 1930's and 40's, she constantly toured the Midwest with her adopted daughter, Bertha, as accompanist. But while her style and showmanship were widely imitated, she did not make her first recording until 1950. She later recorded albums for the Nashboro, Savoy and Spirit Feel labels.         In 1972 she began to receive national recognition after an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival. She appeared in the 1981 gospel documentary film "Say Amen, Somebody," and received a National Heritage Award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1988. She continued to perform regularly at the Lively Stone Apostolic Church in St. Louis until the early 1990's.         She is survived by her sisters Emma, Geneva and Georgie; a daughter, Jacqueline; a son, William; four grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren, all of St. Louis.       
         Sally Belfrage, who wrote nonfiction books about life in an Indian ashram and about the civil rights movement in Mississippi in 1964, died yesterday at Middlesex Hospital in London. She was 57 and lived in London.         The cause was cancer, said her literary agent, Irene Skolnick.         Ms. Belfrage (pronounced BELL-fridge) spent a month studying under an Indian spiritual leader to gather material for "Flowers of Emptiness: Reflections on an Ashram" (1981). The book won her praise as an intelligent and humorous journalist and critic who ardently searched for the truth.         Her Mississippi memoir, "Freedom Summer" (1965), based on her experience as a civil rights volunteer, was lauded for freshness and forcefulness.         Her other books are "A Room in Moscow" (1959), about a sojourn in the Soviet Union and "Living With War: A Belfast Year" (1987). "Un-American Activities," a memoir of her adolescence, is to be published in June by HarperCollins. Youth in Hollywood and London         Ms. Belfrage was born in Hollywood, the daughter of Cedric Belfrage and Molly Castle, Britons who were then correspondents for London newspapers. In "Un-American Activities" she wrote, "My mother was a mere English eccentric, but my father was a Red and so in trouble all the time."         After her family moved east, she attended Bronx High School of Science, Hunter College and, after moving to London when she was 18, the London School of Economics. In 1957, she worked for the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow.         Her 1965 marriage to Bernard Pomerance, who wrote the play "The Elephant Man," ended in divorce in 1976.         She is survived by a daughter, Eve Pomerance of London; a son, Moby Pomerance of Manhattan; a brother, Nicholas, of London, and a sister, Anne Zribi of Paris.       
         Helen Wolff, an American editor and publisher whose taste and talents led to the acquisition and publication of major works of literature, died yesterday at her home in Hanover, N.H. She was 88.         The cause was apparently a heart attack, said her son, Christian.         Mrs. Wolff, who was regarded by her colleagues in the international book world as the grande dame of letters, published greatly acclaimed and successful works under the imprint "A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book," which she established with her husband at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1961. The Wolffs were particularly respected for bringing out translations of distinguished European authors.         After her husband's death in a traffic accident in West Germany in 1963, she remained as the imprint's sole publisher at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich without losing any authors to other publishing houses. Mrs. Wolff retired in 1986, but was regularly consulted about acquisitions and translations. The Wolff imprint has continued to flourish at Harcourt Brace. The Merits of Literature         "The joy of publishing is to see good works become generally recognized," Mrs. Wolff once said. "Literature can do surprisingly well."         Among the authors with whom she worked closely were Gunter Grass, Umberto Eco, Max Frisch, Georges Simenon, Stanislaw Lem and Amos Oz. She also published Anne Morrow Lindbergh's best-selling "Gift From the Sea."         "I don't plan to write my memoirs, and I will tell you why," Mrs. Wolff said in 1982 when she was the subject of a profile in The New Yorker. "If one writes oneself, one closes out the writing of others. I've never been able to understand editors who could also write. You have to keep yourself open for the creative efforts of authors; you must be totally receptive. It's like being a priest, and I don't think priests should be married. Nor do I think editors should write. Kurt and I found our creativity and our life in editing and publishing."         The Wolffs brought to publishing a European sensibility that went beyond the demands and vagaries of the marketplace. Early in this century, Kurt Wolff was Franz Kafka's first publisher, at Kurt Wolff Verlag in Germany. The couple left Germany in the 1930's and lived in Italy and France before immigrating to the United States in 1941 to escape the Nazis. A Founder of Pantheon Books         The Wolffs founded Pantheon Books in New York in 1942 and went on to publish works that included Boris Pasternak's "Doctor Zhivago." They nurtured that company and remained with it until 1961, when they resigned and moved to Europe. Shortly thereafter, Pantheon was acquired by Random House. The couple's next venture, the Helen and Kurt Wolff imprint, began at the invitation of the publisher William Jovanovich.         Mrs. Wolff was a step ahead of rival American publishers in acquiring important foreign books because of her fluency in several languages. At the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, for example, she could read a manuscript in its original German, French or Italian and make a decision about it overnight.         Mrs. Wolff, whose name was originally Helen Mosel, was born in 1906 in Macedonia. Her father was German and her mother was of Hungarian and Austrian parentage. At home, Helen, her sister and her parents spoke German, Turkish and Serbian. Arriving Poor in New York         After World War I, she attended boarding schools in Vienna and discovered that she had a gift for languages, including English. In 1927, she went to Munich as a trainee at Kurt Wolff Verlag, where she became a full-time employee in charge of art books. She and Mr. Wolff, who was 20 years her senior and divorced, were married in London in 1933. Their son was born the next year.         When the Wolffs arrived in New York, they were nearly penniless. In 1942, they persuaded three investors to contribute a total of $7,500, which enabled the creation of Pantheon Books. Mrs. Wolff recalled that her personal budget at that time was a dollar a day. The next year, they were joined by Jacques Schiffrin, who had founded Editions Pleiade in Paris and who brought many fine books to Pantheon.         The Wolffs' first success in the United States was a new edition of the Grimm fairy tales, in 1944. Under their own imprint, they published a number of important works, both fiction and nonfiction. After her husband's death, Mrs. Wolff was responsible for such notable novels as Italo Calvino's "Invisible Cities," a retranslated edition of Giorgio Bassani's "Garden of the Finzi-Continis," Mr. Grass's "Flounder," Mr. Oz's "My Michael" and Mr. Eco's "Name of the Rose."         In 1981, for her contributions to international publishing, Mrs. Wolff was awarded the Inter Nationes Award for Literature and the Arts by the West German Government. In 1985, she was given the Goethe Medal by Goethe House, the German cultural institute in New York City.         In addition to her son, a professor of music and classics at Dartmouth College, she is survived by a stepson, Nikolaus Wolff of Norwich, Vt.; a stepdaughter, Maria Stadelmayer of Hamburg, Germany; a brother, George Mosel of Santiago, Chile; a sister, Elizabeth Steinbeis of Brannenburg, Germany, and 10 grandchildren.       
         Melina Mercouri, the vivacious actress with a husky laugh who went on to become Greece's Minister of Culture, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Miss Mercouri, whose greatest screen success was her role as a flamboyant prostitute in the 1960 film "Never on Sunday," was 68, her family said, although references disagree on the year of her birth.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Patricia Turi, a hospital spokeswoman. Miss Mercouri was hospitalized in early February and underwent surgery on Feb. 23 to remove cancerous tissue, but her conditioned deteriorated on Saturday because of an infection, Ms. Turi said.         Coming from a politically prominent family, the actress was a passionate anti-Fascist who lost her citizenship and property in 1967 for her aggressive opposition to the junta that held power in Athens for seven years, until 1974. She then speedily returned home and entered politics, winning election to Parliament in 1977 as a Socialist. Miss Mercouri was appointed Culture Minister in 1981 after the Socialists won a landslide victory. She served in the post until 1989, when her party lost power, and then returned when the party was re-elected in October.         "Never on Sunday," the story of a nurturing trollop who refused to work more than six nights a week, established Miss Mercouri as an international star. The movie was directed by Jules Dassin, her close companion and later her husband. Mr. Dassin, the son of a New York barber, fled to Europe after being blacklisted in Hollywood in the 1950's.         Mr. Dassin directed, and often wrote and produced, most of Miss Mercouri's nearly 20 other movies, including "He Who Must Die" (1957), about life overtaking a Passion play in a primitive village on Crete; Mr. Dassin co-adapted the story from the novel "The Greek Passion," by Nikos Kazantzakis. Other joint efforts included "Phaedra," a 1961 tale of a woman lusting for her stepson, and "A Dream of Passion," a 1978 variation of Medea's child-murders. Both were based on, or inspired by, ancient Greek dramas.         Their other team efforts included "Topkapi," a well-regarded 1964 museum-theft caper; "10:30 P.M. Summer," a 1966 story of a descent into alcoholism, and "Promise at Dawn" (1970), from a memoir by Romain Gary about his unconventional mother.         Miss Mercouri conquered Broadway in a 1967 musical adaptation of "Never on Sunday" titled "Illya Darling," prompting Walter Kerr of The New York Times to hail her as "a creature you'd be happy to take home to mother, if mother was out." Politics and Pacifism         The outspoken actress and politician with a flashing smile and feline movements was a favorite of interviewers, who called her a charming, forceful and quotable woman very much in love with life. She spoke French, German and English, as well as Greek.         Of her return from exile, she remarked in 1988: "It became impossible not to interfere in politics. When you are born Greek, you are always in a state of alert about social things." She was also a pacifist, declaring in her 1971 autobiography, "I Was Born Greek," that the "quickest way to get disarmament is if John and Jean and Ivan refuse to pay one penny's tax" for weapons.         Asked about feminism, she replied: "I have never been discriminated against. I have made my life as a woman, and that's not bad." Of marriage, she remarked: "If you take a European woman's husband, she has nothing. But if you take an American husband, you make the wife rich." As for love, she commented: "All any woman wants is to sleep with a man. It is simple. Life is simple."         Maria Amalia Mercouri was born in Athens on Oct. 18, 1925, the daughter of a longtime Minister of the Interior and the granddaughter of a much-admired, longtime Mayor of Athens, who nicknamed her Melina, meaning honey, the usual color of her hair in later years.         Her family's home was open to people from all classes, from scholars to beggars, and meals were shared by up to 100 guests. The wide-ranging contacts and conviviality made her an egalitarian and gave her a liberal education while she resolved to be an actress.         Her parents opposed her acting, so, at 17, she eloped with Panayiotis Characopos, an elderly, wealthy Athenian sympathetic to her study of classical Greek tragedy at the National Theater Academy. After three years of preparation, she went on the Athens stage, won increasingly big parts and was acclaimed in the leading roles in "Mourning Becomes Electra" and "A Streetcar Named Desire." She also starred on the Paris stage and made her film debut as a doomed cabaret entertainer in "Stella," a 1955 melodrama directed by Michael Cacoyannis.         A major turning point occurred at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival, where she met Mr. Dassin. Though married to others, they immediately forged a deep personal and professional partnership. They were married a decade later.         Miss Mercouri was widely praised for her Madonna-prostitute role in "He Who Must Die" and, three years later, for her hedonistic prostitute in "Never on Sunday," for which she won an award as best actress at Cannes and an Academy Award nomination.         Her other films included "The Gypsy and the Gentleman" (1958), "Where the Hot Wind Blows" (1959), "The Victors" (1963), "A Man Could Get Killed" (1966), "Gaily Gaily" (1969) and "Nasty Habits" (1976). Reviewers repeatedly hailed her performances as exuberant, but sometimes extravagant and overwrought.         In her political career, she represented the working-class district of Piraeus, the port of Athens, which had been the setting for "Never on Sunday." She kept an office there, meeting with constituents twice a week and discussing problems dealing with Government services and women's issues. "I like myself better now," she said in 1978. "It feels better to care about other people's interests -- to be involved."         Through the 1980's, Miss Mercouri often made headlines because of her obsessive effort to regain for Greece the Elgin Marbles of the Acropolis. The sculptures were bought from the Turkish ruler of Greece in the early 1800's by a British ambassador, Lord Elgin, and later placed in the British Museum. As Minister of Culture, she also strove to revive classical Greek culture by increasing Government subsidies for the arts, building provincial libraries and pressing for the preservation of historic monuments.         In exile, Miss Mercouri and her husband lived mainly in Paris. In later years, their main home was in Athens, and they had a vacation home on the Greek island of Spetsai.         She is survived by her husband and by a brother, Spiros Mercouris.       
         Judith Schwartz, a designer of commercial and residential interiors in New York, died last Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 51 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Schwartz was active in community affairs as a trustee of the Park East Synagogue and a board member of the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation. She established a Judith Schwartz scholarship fund at the Rabbi Arthur Schneier Park East Day School and served as a representative of the Women's International Zionist Organization to the United Nations.         A native of Manhattan, she graduated from Finch College, trained at New York School of Interior Design and received a degree in decorative arts at Parsons School of Design. She headed Better Home Furnishing Company from 1965 to 1981, when she established J.R.S. Interiors Inc., her current firm in Manhattan.         Mrs. Schwartz is survived by her husband of 30 years, Stanley; two daughters, Blair and Kim; her mother, Blanche Rosenzweig Levine of Bal Harbour, Fla.; a sister, Carol Nussbaum of Charleston, S.C., and a brother, Lawrence Rosenzweig of Manhattan and Bal Harbour.       
         Suzy Strain, a leading dancer with the Ballet Chicago, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 35.         The cause is being investigated, said Colleen Lober, the general manager of Ballet Chicago.         Ms. Strain had danced with the company since its founding and was a featured soloist in works that included "Steadfast Tin Soldier" and "Apollo," both by George Balanchine, and works by Daniel Duell, the director of the company, and Gordon Peirce Schmidt. She trained at the Washington Academy of Ballet and the School of American Ballet, which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet.         Ms. Strain also danced with the National Ballet Company; the Eglevsky Ballet; the Kansas City Ballet; Eliot Feld, and Pierre Bonnefoux and Patricia McBride.         She is survived by her mother, Janet Strain; a brother, Bob, and a sister, Terri Sullivan, all of Cliffside Park, N.J.       
         Aida Anthony Whedon, an artist and a teacher to generations of children, died yesterday at her home in Port Washington, L.I. She was 78.         Her New Orleans accent unaltered despite half a century in New York, Mrs. Whedon was a bustling mother hen for thousands of children at the Whedon School of Art, which she and her husband, Daniel Whedon, a sculptor, operated.         Mrs. Whedon's works are in many collections, including the North Shore Unitarian Church of Plandome, L.I., the universities of Maine, Chicago and Rutgers, and many banks and corporations. After her first show at the Walker Gallery in New York in 1937, she had one-person shows at the South Street Museum, the Graphic Eye Gallery in Port Washington, and galleries in England, Maine, New York and Long Island.         She is survived by her husband; two children, Roger Anthony Whedon and Susan Whedon, and two grandchildren, Arie Daniel Whedon and Amelia Whedon.       
         Luba Potamkin, a broadcasting spokeswoman in the 1970's for her family's Cadillac auto dealerships on the East Coast, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 73.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said her husband, Victor Potamkin.         Three years after her husband founded Potamkin Cadillac in 1972, Mrs. Potamkin and other members of her family appeared in television commercials that featured the line: "If this nameplate isn't on the back of your car, you probably paid too much."         The ebullient commercials, which were also broadcast by Potamkin dealerships on television stations in Pennsylvania and Florida, were noticed. Mr. Potamkin said his forceful merchandising in New York helped his sales.         Mrs. Potamkin, the former Luba Chalken, was born in Philadelphia. She was married to Victor for 52 years and for a large part of that time was content to be a wife and mother to her two sons.  Fighting Against Alzheimer's         She said of her career as a Cadillac spokeswoman on television, which she amplified to include health and fashion tips, that she never studied a script in advance. She told an interviewer in 1977, "To me, it's easy because it's my business and I'm thrilled to say, 'Buy a Cadillac.' "         Her son Alan recalled yesterday that the ad campaign was hatched by his father, who convinced his wife, who was at first reluctant, to do it.         The Potamkin family relinquished the dealership in 1987, selling the assets and leasing the company's Manhattan real estate to General Motors.  For several years the dealership fell into decline under new operators with a more muted television campaign.         Two years ago the Potamkin family resumed operations under the name Potamkin Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet.         Mrs. Potamkin then became a symbol of the fight against Alzheimer's disease, which she was diagnosed as having in the late 1970's. She and her husband made major donations to research into the disease, and in 1987 the Potamkin family created the Potamkin Prize for Alzheimer Research, an annual award of $100,000. They were also active in sponsoring fund-raising events for medical research.         In addition to her husband, who maintains homes in New York, Philadelphia and Miami, she is survived by two sons, Robert, of Philadelphia and Alan, of Miami; a sister, Florence Jans of Miami; a brother, Marvin Chaiken of Tucson, Ariz., and three grandchildren.       
         Melba Johnson Kgositsile, a civil rights and anti-apartheid advocate, died on Saturday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 54.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Ipeleng Kgositsile.         Mrs. Kgositsile was the executive director of the Council on Interracial Books for Children in New York where she directed the production of documentaries and books. In 1992 she coordinated a Manhattan conference in support of the African National Congress.         She is survived by her daughter, of Manhattan; her mother, Queen Esther Johnson of Oakland, Calif.; three brothers, Thomas W. Jr. of Manhattan, William of Oakland, and Ronald of Sacramento, Calif., and a sister, Rose Johnson of San Jose, Calif.       
         Jean Brown, a collector of Dada, Surrealism and Fluxus, died on Sunday at the Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 82 and lived in Tyringham, Mass.         She died of natural causes, said her son, Jonathan, of Princeton, N.J.         Sometimes called the den mother of Fluxus, Mrs. Brown possessed a natural openness to new art and counted among her friends such avant-gardists as Marcel Duchamp, John Cage and George Maciunas, the leader of the Fluxus movement.  Going to Museums         Mrs. Brown, whose maiden name was Levy, was born in 1911 in Brooklyn. Her father was a rare-book dealer who enjoyed taking his daughter to museums. She briefly attended Columbia University. In 1936, she married Leonard Brown, an insurance agent. They settled in Springfield, Mass., where Mrs. Brown worked as a librarian.         In the late 1950's, after collecting Abstract Expressionist paintings, the Browns began to acquire Dadaist and Surrealist art, manifestoes and periodicals. They soon moved on to Fluxus, a new, irreverent art movement that stressed multiples, printed ephemera, posters, newspapers and mail art.         After Mr. Brown's death in 1971, Mrs. Brown moved to Tyringham, and expanded into areas adjacent to Fluxus, including artists' books, concrete poetry, happenings and performance art. Her home, originally a Shaker seed house, became an important center for both Fluxus artists and scholars, with Mrs. Brown alternately cooking meals and showing her guests her collection. Activities centered on a large attic archive built by Mr. Maciunas.  A 20th-Century Collection         In 1985, as the Jean Brown Archive approached 6,000 items, it was bought by the J. Paul Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities in Santa Monica, Calif. This was among the first collections of 20th-century material acquired by the center.         In addition to her son, an art historian at the Institute of Fine Arts in Manhattan, Mrs. Brown is survived by another son, Robert, of Manhattan, a partner in the Reinhold Brown Gallery.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Sondra B. Gair, a veteran broadcast journalist best known for her public-affairs talk show on Chicago radio, died on Wednesday in Northwestern Memorial Hospital. She was 70 and lived in Chicago.         She died of complications from breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Gair was the executive producer of an hourlong program of world news and public affairs on WBEZ-FM, the National Public Radio affiliate in Chicago. Airing weekdays since 1986, "Midday with Sondra Gair" was conceived by her as a way to cover breaking news as she interviewed political leaders and journalists and encouraged callers to give their views.         Her topics ranged as widely as her selection of guests. She interviewed correspondents, policy experts and government leaders by telephone. She was respected for her fairness, for letting all sides have their say.         "She had a particular gift of intimacy with her listeners," said Carole Nolan, general manager of WBEZ and a longtime friend. "Sondra called the world, from the king of Greece to cabdrivers."         "Midday with Sondra Gair" went off the air in mid-March. In tribute, WBEZ fell silent for an hour yesterday after a brief eulogy by Ms. Nolan.         Sondra Gair was born in Cicero, Ill., and grew up in Chicago. She studied speech, acting and journalism at Northwestern University, which proclaimed her "Alumna of the Year" in 1992.         She began her radio career in the 1940's, appearing regularly in soap operas, dramas and comedy shows. But her interest in news reporting eventually made her to turn to broadcast journalism with on-site reports on the arts, politics and mores of England, China, the Netherlands, Mexico and Israel.         She joined WBEZ in 1975 and conducted various interview shows before beginning the midday program for which she was best known.         Ms. Gair is survived by a daughter, Patricia Sweeney of Kingston upon Thames, England; two sons, Judd Rose of Manhattan and Roger Rose of Los Angeles; her mother, Rose Gair of Chicago; a brother, Seymour Gair of suburban Chicago, and three grandchildren.       
         Harriet Gans, a photographer who showed her work in New York galleries and museums, died on Wednesday at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A native of Manhattan, Ms. Gans was a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, and held a master's in psychology from Columbia University. At her death she was a professor of photography at Pace University.         She had solo exhibitions at the Julie Saul and Pindar Galleries in New York. She contributed studies of flowers to the In Bloom Traveling Exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in 1990.         She was a regular contributor to magazines and The New York Times.         She is survived by her husband, Walter Gans; two sons, David of Scarsdale and Erik of Cambridge, Mass., and her mother, Mildred Goldhagen of Deerfield Beach, Fla.       
         Patricia Miller King, director of the Radcliffe College library devoted to the history of women, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. Dr. King, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., was 56.         The cause was lung cancer, a Radcliffe announcement said.         In 1973 she became director of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe. In her 21-year tenure the library evolved into one of the nation's foremost centers for women's history. In 1993 the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation donated $2 million to endow the libarary's directorship.         Dr. King was also an officer of the National Council for Research on Women, the American Antiquarian Society and the Massachusetts Historical Society.         She graduated from Radcliffe in 1959 and received a doctorate in medieval history from Harvard University in 1970. As a graduate student she worked at the Women's Archives, a resource center that preceded the Schlesinger Library.         She is survived by three daughters, Victoria King of Minneapolis, Ellen Stein-Samel of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Amy Stein of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Mark Stein of Hamilton, Mass.; her mother, Amy Miller, and a brother, Donald Miller, both of New Port Richey, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
         Fredi Washington, one of the first black actresses to gain recognition for her work on stage and in film, died on Tuesday at St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford, Conn., where she lived. She was 90.         The cause was pneumonia, which developed after a stroke, said her sister, Isabel Powell.         Miss Washington's best-known performance was as the young mulatto who passes for white in the 1934 film "Imitation of Life." Her performance was so convincing that she was accused of denying her heritage in her private life.         "She did pass for white when she was traveling in the South with Duke Ellington and his band," said Jean-Claude Baker, a restaurateur and author and a friend of Ms. Washington's. "They could not go into ice-cream parlors, so she would go in and buy the ice cream, then go outside and give it to Ellington and the band. Whites screamed at her, 'Nigger lover!' " Danced With Josephine Baker         Miss Washington, whose given name was Fredricka, was born in Savannah, Ga., on Dec. 23, 1903. She made her first cabaret appearance in New York at 16 as a member of the Happy Honeysuckles hired by Josephine Baker, Mr. Baker's foster mother, and was a chorus girl in the musical "Shuffle Along" in 1921. While performing at the Club Alabam in Manhattan, she was noticed by the producer Lee Shubert, who recommended her for the co-starring role opposite Paul Robeson in the play "Black Boy" (she played the role under the stage name Edith Warren).         At the end of the run, with no serious productions for black actors in view, she turned to dancing and toured Europe with her dance partner, Al Moiret.         When she returned to the United States, she appeared in such stage productions as "Run, Little Chillun," "Great Day," "Singing the Blues," "Mamba's Daughters," "Lysistrata" and "A Long Way From Home" (an all-black production of Gorky's "Lower Depths"). Her film work included roles in "The Emperor Jones," "Black and Tan Fantasy," "Drums in the Night" and "One Mile From Heaven."         Miss Washington worked for equal rights for blacks in the theater and film industry and was a founder of the Negro Actors Guild. She also was a drama editor and columnist for The People's Voice, a New York weekly newspaper published by Adam Clayton Powell Jr., her sister's husband at the time.         Miss Washington's marriage to Lawrence Brown, a trombonist in the Duke Ellington Orchestra, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Dr. Anthony H. Bell, died in the early 1980's. In addition to Mrs. Powell, of New York City, she is survived by two other sisters, Rosebud Smith of Jamaica, Queens, and Gertrude Penna of Orlando, Fla., and a brother, Floyd Washington of Hempstead, L.I.       
         Marion Williams, a pioneering gospel singer, died on Saturday at the Albert Einstein Medical Institute in Philadelphia. She was 66 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was vascular disease, said her record producer, Anthony Heilbut.         Miss Williams was a flamboyant singer who put her songs across with pure sustained tones, swooping phrases and deep growls. Her influence was heard throughout gospel music and in secular music as well. Little Richard has said her octave-leaping high whoops were the source for his vocals in "Tutti Frutti" and other songs, and Aretha Franklin recorded Miss Williams's two biggest hits, "Packin' Up" and "Surely God Is Able." Miss Williams performed in churches, at concerts and in nightclubs, and in 1993 she received a MacArthur Foundation grant and was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors.         "When I'm singing, I get inspired by God," she said in a 1980 interview with The New York Times. "I call it 'the anointing.' It's an extra-special thing. When the inspiration of God is missing, I just rely on talent." In Church and on Broadway         Miss Williams was born in Miami in 1927 and grew up singing in sanctified churches, although she was also exposed to blues and jazz. In 1947 she joined the Clara Ward Singers, the preeminent gospel group of the 1950's, and soon became the lead singer. In 1958 she and other members of the Ward Singers started their own group, the Stars of Faith, and in 1961 they appeared on Broadway in "Black Nativity," a gospel musical by Langston Hughes.         Miss Williams began performing as a soloist in the mid-1960's, appearing at churches and colleges and touring the world. In 1966 the State Department sponsored her tour of Africa. She recorded for Savoy, Vee Jay, Columbia and Atlantic Records from the 1950's through the 1970's. In 1976, her album "Prayer Changes Things" won a Grand Prix du Disque in France.         In 1980, she made her first appearance in a club serving alcohol, singing a celebrated long engagement at the Cookery in Greenwich Village. From the mid-1980's onward, she made albums for Spirit Feel Records. She was active at the B. M. Oakley Memorial Church of God in Christ, in Philadelphia, as both a church mother and an occasional performer.         Miss Williams began to undergo dialysis regularly in 1988, but she continued to perform. In December 1991 she sang "Amazing Grace" in a Public Broadcasting Service program about the song. She appeared in the 1992 film "Fried Green Tomatoes," which was dedicated to her, and was the guest soloist in 1992 for the premiere of Wynton Marsalis's gospel-influenced jazz suite "In This House/On This Morning." On April 28 this year, she was inducted into the Philadelphia Walk of Fame.         Miss Williams is survived by her son, Robin, of Philadelphia; a brother, Isaac, of Miami, and three grandchildren.       
         Christy Henrich, a former gymnast of near-Olympic caliber who had eating disorders, died on Tuesday in Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo., near her hometown, Independence, Mo. She was 22.         The cause of death was multiple organ system failure, the hospital said. A spokeswoman, Clara Scott, said that "basically, everything shut down." Ms. Henrich had long suffered from two eating disorders, anorexia nervosa and bulimia.         After narrowly failing to make the 1988 United States Olympic gymnastics team, Ms. Henrich, a hard-driving competitor who was only 4 feet 10 inches tall, placed fourth in the unequal parallel bars event in the 1989 world championships. Forced to Retire         At that time, she weighed 93 pounds, but then she grew frailer and thinner. Weakness forced her to retire from her sport in 1991, and in mid-1993 she was down to 60 pounds.         Ms. Henrich's death came after a week in the medical center following 10 days in critical condition in a hospital in Independence, Mo.         Anorexia nervosa is an illness of deliberate self-starvation, found chiefly in young women. Bulimia is marked by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by self-induced-vomiting. An Intense Athlete         Ms. Henrich, whose father, Paul, was a bowler in past years, was intense about exercise and fitness from an early age. As a teen-ager, she said of competing in the Olympics: "It's what I want to do. I want it so bad."         She attended Fort Osage High School in Independence and turned down college scholarship offers while training in hopes of making the 1992 Olympics. But she did not, and in 1993 she was hospitalized for a time at a Kansas City clinic, also because of her eating problems.         At the time, her mother said: "I would say 99 percent of what has happened to Christy is because of the sport.         Besides her parents, Ms. Henrich's survivors include a brother, Paul.       
         Helen F. Cserr, a professor of physiology at Brown University in Providence, R.I., whose research focused on the anatomy and mechanism of the human brain, died on Aug. 11 at her home in North Dighton, Mass. She was 57.         She died of a brain tumor, said her daughter, Ruth, of Princeton, N.J.         Dr. Cserr joined the Brown faculty in 1970 after serving as a researcher at Harvard University, where she received a Ph.D. in physiology. She was also a graduate of Middlebury College in Vermont.         Besides her daughter, Dr. Cserr is survived by her husband, Dr. Robert Cserr of North Dighton; her mother, Ruth FitzGerald of Missoula, Mont.; two sisters, Jean Seglie of Washington and Susan Othmer of Los Angeles, and a brother, Joseph K. FitzGerald of San Francisco.       
         Danitra Vance, an actress and performance artist who appeared in "The Colored Museum" and "Spunk" at the New York Shakespeare Festival, died on Sunday at the home of her grandfather, Clarence M. Edwards, in Markham, Ill. She was 35 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was breast cancer, said her companion, Jones Miller.         Once described as a cross between Laurie Anderson and Little Richard, Ms. Vance appeared in feature films and in 1985 became the first black woman to join the regular cast of "Saturday Night Live."         But it was through her association with George C. Wolfe, the playwright and director who is now the producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival, that Ms. Vance was best known to theatergoers. In "Spunk," Mr. Wolfe's 1990 adaptation of stories by Zora Neale Hurston, she demonstrated "exceptional range in playing a trio of women who are in turn worn to the bone, full of sass and aglow with innocence," wrote Frank Rich in The New York Times. Ms. Vance received an Obie Award for her performance.         Ms. Vance was born in Chicago. She attended the National College of Education in Evanston, Ill.; Roosevelt College in Chicago, from which she graduated with honors, and the Webber-Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After performing with the Second City comedy troupe in Chicago, she moved to New York in 1981, where she became an Off Broadway success with her 1985 revue "Danitra Vance and the Mell-o White Boys." In it, she created a range of comic characters including a ghetto Shakespearean actress, a feminist stripper and a genteel "lesbian recruiter."         Ms. Vance last appeared at the Public in the spring as the guardian angel in Jose Rivera's "Marisol." After breast cancer was diagnosed in 1990, she used her experience of the illness in a performance piece called "The Radical Girl's Guide to Radical Mastectomy." "Pre-Shrunk," an autobiographical show in which she expanded on this material, was scheduled at the Public Theater last season, but Ms. Vance was unable to perform.         In addition to Ms. Miller and Mr. Edwards, Ms. Vance is survived by her mother, Laura Vance of Chicago, and a sister, Latrice Lee, of Markham.       
         Rildia Bee O'Bryan Cliburn, the mother of Van Cliburn and his only piano teacher until he was 17, died yesterday at All Saints Episcopal Hospital in Fort Worth. She was 97 and lived in Fort Worth.         The cause was a stroke that occurred last Thursday, said Mary Lou Falcone, Mr. Cliburn's spokeswoman.         Mrs. Cliburn's mother was an actress and her father was a judge and adviser to state officials. She studied music from an early age in Texas, then at the Cincinnati Conservatory and at the New York School of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard School.         She returned to Texas in the 1920's to marry Harvey Levan Cliburn, an oil-company executive. She gave piano lessons, and discovered her son's ability when at the age of 3 he went to the piano after one of her students left and played by ear the piece that had just been taught.         Mrs. Cliburn served as her son's adviser, manager and inspiration throughout his career. She was also active in the arts, and established a foundation to help young performers.         Her husband died in 1974. She is survived by her son, of Fort Worth.       
         Dolly Haas, a petite and vivacious actress on stage and screen, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 84.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the Broadway artist Al Hirschfeld. For many decades the two were an elegant couple on the aisle at all Broadway opening nights, watching the actors and actresses whom Mr. Hirschfeld would sketch for The New York Times.         Before their marriage in 1943, Miss Haas was a celebrated movie star in Germany and had a brief Hollywood career. She also played leading roles in plays on and Off Broadway. When Miss Haas made her New York stage debut in 1941 in Erwin Piscator's production of the Chinese fantasy "The Circle of Chalk," Brooks Atkinson, the drama critic of The Times, wrote that she was "an exquisitely beautiful actress, with the limpid grace of a Chinese poem or print."         She was born in Hamburg, Germany, the daughter of a German mother and an English father. As a child, she studied ballet and, before she was 20, was acting in cabaret and musical comedy. She easily made the transition to films, in 1929 in "One Summer of Happiness," playing a department store doll that came to life. In this and other romantic movies, written or directed by Billy Wilder, Anatol Litvak and Fritz Kortner, among others, she often portrayed figures of innocence.         With the rise of Hitler, she left her native country and her growing career and went to London, playing the Lillian Gish role in the sound movie version of D. W. Griffith's "Broken Blossoms." The film was directed by Hans Brahm, who became Miss Haas's first husband. Whisked off to Hollywood, she languished for a time as producers looked for suitable roles and tried to persuade her to change her name to Lilli Marlowe. Soon she left for New York and a life on the stage.         After "The Circle of Chalk," she was in Piscator's version of "War and Peace" and in 1946 replaced Mary Martin opposite Yul Brynner in the musical "Lute Song," which she and Mr. Brynner later took on tour to London. In 1947 she acted with John Gielgud and Miss Gish in "Crime and Punishment" on Broadway. She was also in the Off Broadway productions of "The Threepenny Opera" and "Brecht on Brecht." In 1953 she returned to the movies, appearing notably in Alfred Hitchcock's "I Confess."         Miss Haas and Mr. Hirschfeld met when the artist was on assignment to draw a sketch of a summer theater company for The Times. On occasion, Miss Haas's portrait appeared in the background in her husband's drawings. In 1975, she returned to Germany, where she was honored with a retrospective of her films at the 25th annual Berlin International Film Festival.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Nina, and two grandchildren.         Services will be at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Maddison Avenue, at 81st Street, Manhattan, at 4 P.M. on Sunday.       
         Ann Schreiber, a regional administrator in the Northeast United States and the Caribbean for the Department of Health and Human Services, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 58 and lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Sol Schreiber, a former Federal magistrate in Manhattan.         As administrator for Region 2, consisting of New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Mrs. Schreiber headed a staff of 100 and was responsible for distributing $4 billion a year.         An alumna of Brooklyn College, Mrs. Schreiber attended graduate school at Columbia University and was a midcareer fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School of Princeton University.         Also surviving are her mother, Helen, and a sister, Carol Martini of Philadelphia.       
         Sandra Fisher, a figurative painter and printmaker who was also the wife of the painter R. B. Kitaj, died on Monday at the National Hospital for Nervous Disorders in London. She was 47 and lived in London.         The cause has not been determined, Marilyn McCully, a family friend, said yesterday.         Ms. Fisher, who was born in New York City and brought up in Florida and California, studied art at the Chouinard Institute in Los Angeles. She met Mr. Kitaj in 1970 while working for the Los Angeles art-print publisher Gemini G.E.L. She and Mr. Kitaj were married in 1983.         Although Ms. Fisher's work tended to be small, she was beginning to enjoy success for her public commissions. At the time of her death, two posters she designed for the London Transport's Art on the Underground series had brought her wide attention in London and she was at work on a series of paintings for the reconstruction of the Globe Theater.         Ms. Fisher's most recent show was at the Lefevre Gallery in London in 1993.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by their son, Max; a stepson, Lem Dobbs of Los Angeles; a stepdaughter, Dominie Kitaj of London; her father, Gene, of Tucson, Ariz.; her mother, Ethel, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a sister, Margaret, of Emeryville, Calif., and a stepgrandson, Joe Kitaj of Los Angeles.       
         Sister Parish, the acclaimed and enduring American interior decorator who began her career when she was a young Depression-era mother and later came to redesign rooms of the White House during the Kennedy Administration, died on Thursday at her home in Dark Harbor, Maine. She was 84 and also had a home in New York City.         She had suffered a lengthy illness, said Dorothy B. Gilbert, one of her daughters.         Mrs. Parish's six decades of decorating epitomized the rise of women in her own and other professions in 20th-century America. The one-room business she founded in 1933 in Far Hills, N.J., evolved into the noted decorating firm of Parish-Hadley Associates, based in Manhattan, whose designs consistently exuded quality.         The anxious 23-year-old of 1933 -- whose nursery nickname had replaced her seldom-used given name, Dorothy -- went on to become a force in forming and articulating tastes in interior design. Vogue magazine once said she was "the most famous of all living women interior designers, whose ideas have influenced life styles all over America." 'Patrician Aplomb'         John Richardson, an art historian, wrote in 1989, "No one else in America does a room with such patrician aplomb, such life-enhancing charm, such a lack of gimmickry or trendiness."         With a profile that seemed carved from the Maine coastline, her longtime home and design influence, Mrs. Parish was a strong traditionalist. "What seems important to me is permanence, comfort and a look of continuity in the design and decoration of a house," she once observed. "The happiest times of my life are associated with beautiful, familiar things and family."         She and her firm became known for the low-keyed handsomeness of their work and for their well-heeled and relatively conservative clientele. It included President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy; the philanthropists Brooke Astor and Enid Annenberg Haupt; William S. Paley, the chairman of CBS, and members of the Bronfman, Getty, Mellon, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney clans.         In 1988, one of Queen Elizabeth II's daughters-in-law, the Duchess of York, asked the firm to design the interior of the ducal couple's new house near Windsor Castle. But the assignment was eventually switched to a British designer, and the British press reported that the Queen thought the Americans' plans were too expensive. Still Working in Her 80's         Mrs. Parish stayed on as a partner in the firm into her 80's, proving to be a notably durable member of a pioneer cohort of American women who came to prominence as interior decorators between the two world wars.         Mrs. Parish is widely considered to have originated, in the 1960's, the decorating idiom that became known as American country style: she was an early and influential champion of the humble striped cloth called mattress ticking, which had traditionally covered mattresses, using it for slipcovers and on throw pillows.         She saw no conflict between innovation and traditionalism. As she wrote in HG magazine in 1990, "Years ago, my partner, Albert Hadley, and I were delighted when patchwork quilts, four-poster beds, painted floors, knitted throws, rag rugs and hand-woven bedsteads were first listed among the 'innovations' of our firm."         "The list sounds old-fashioned, and no decorator wants to be that," she continued, "but Albert and I understood that innovation is often the ability to reach into the past and bring back what is good, what is beautiful, what is lasting." Father Collected Antiques         Mrs. Parish's own girlhood was, if not regal, at least baronial. She was born Dorothy May Kinnicutt in July 15, 1910, in Morristown, N.J., the daughter of G. Hermann Kinnicutt and the former May Appleton Tuckerman, who had homes in Manhattan, Maine and Paris, as well as New Jersey.         Mrs. Parish's father was a collector of antiques (as was a cousin, Dorothy Draper, who also became a renowned decorator). Much later she would recall the distaste she felt as a child for the furniture her father collected, "that awful English brown," as she put it.         As a teen-ager, she saw painted French furniture in Paris -- and experienced a revelation.         She went to the Chapin School in Manhattan and to the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., made her debut and was married to Mr. Parish in 1930 in Manhattan with, as The New York Times reported at the time, "a representative gathering of old New York families on hand." Decorating a Farmhouse         After her marriage, she and her husband had a home on East End Avenue in Manhattan -- which had been done by a decorator -- and a farmhouse in Far Hills, N.J., which Mrs. Parish herself decorated, with gusto.         Her handiwork was admired, friends began coming to her for help with decorating, and she later confidently recalled that "it never occurred to me that I wasn't qualified to give it."         It was four years after the Wall Street crash of 1929 that Mrs. Parish, who had never received a high school diploma, opened her first office. Hard times were coming upon her husband and her father, both blue-blooded stockbrokers. She called her business "Mrs. Henry Parish 2d Interiors" and placed it in Far Hills.         The success that followed was fueled by her taste, talent and strength of will. Mr. Hadley, who joined forces with her in 1962, said in 1991 that "Sis always knows when a room is right and a room is not." She was famed for creating a homey "undecorated look."  'Money, Big Money'         In some ways, Mrs. Parish's rise was made easier by her upper-crust roots, and her earliest work was decorating the houses of friends.         Decorating by Mrs. Parish and her firm also acquired a reputation for being expensive. The New York Times columnist Charlotte Curtis wrote in 1985 that Parish-Hadley work "costs money, big money."         But Mrs. Parish also had an economical streak. In the mid-1960's, she acquired a batch of turn-of-the-century golden oak furniture at a bargain basement price, the story goes, then painted it white and used it in decorating a house that she and her husband had bought in Maine.         As the design editor Elaine Greene wrote later in The New York Times, "when shown in the January 1967 issue of House & Garden, the house dazzled decorators the way Christian Dior's 1947 New Look did the fashion world."         The white furniture and other furnishings in the house -- including soft-hued chintz, needlework, hand-crafted cotton rugs and paintings of dogs -- became staples of the style. Decorating for the Kennedys         Mrs. Parish met Jacqueline Kennedy socially in the late 1950's and helped her decorate the house in the Georgetown section of Washington where she and her husband, John F. Kennedy, lived while he was a Senator. After Mr. Kennedy was elected President, his wife made Mrs. Parish a consultant in her redecorating of the White House.         Mrs. Kennedy also named her to a committee that was formed to help furnish the White House with authentic pieces from a century and a half earlier.         Speaking of Mrs. Kennedy's plans for redoing the family quarters in the building, Mrs. Parish said early in 1961 that the nation's new First Lady was a person of "simple tastes who wants to create a home."         The walls of the family quarters were done in pastel tones -- the private drawing room was eventually done in yellow and white.         In the years since, there have been persistent reports that Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Parish -- who could be blunt and acerbic -- had a falling-out over the White House. As Town & Country magazine recounted it in 1988, the First Lady "fired Sister for telling little Caroline to keep her feet off the upholstery. Sister would later describe the experience in explicit, harsh terms."         But Mrs. Parish could go to enormous lengths to please a client. Sally Bedell Smith wrote in her 1990 book "In All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley" that in a single bedroom Mrs. Parish and Mr. Hadley did in the 1960's in Mr. Paley's Fifth Avenue duplex, "a painter worked for five months applying 18 coats of paint -- six different shadings just for the base, plus glazing."         Mr. Parish died in 1977, having spent 34 years with the Wall Street securities firm of Loeb Rhoades & Company.         Mrs. Parish is survived by her daughters, Mrs. Gilbert of Hot Springs, Ark., and May Appleton Bartlett of Boston; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Jessica Tandy, who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have, died yesterday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 85.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the actor Hume Cronyn.         Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film "Driving Miss Daisy." In the years between, she and Mr. Cronyn, played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day.         With the role of Blanche Dubois, Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood's leading ladies, to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage. The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance, which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called "incredibly true." Almost four decades later, another New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of her, "Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should be allowed to write about her."         When she was 80 years old, she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in "Driving Miss Daisy." It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and, at last, an Academy Award. When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one. She vowed to go on working, although she said she hoped she would know when to stop, "before they have to get the hook." The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of "Foxfire," of which her husband was was a co-writer. Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work, completing three films and two television dramas. A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs         When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together, in "The Fourposter" in 1951, audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater. One triumph followed another, culminating in "The Gin Game" in 1977 and "Foxfire" in 1982.         By 1986, when they appeared in "The Petition," Mr. Rich was writing of "their legendary theatrical relationship" and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as "an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again." Mel Gussow, another drama critic for The Times, called them "two actors at their summit." He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together, it was "a matter of hearts, minds and bodies in creative harmony."         One of their last projects together was "To Dance With the White Dog," a television movie that had its premiere last year. At last night'a Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Cronyn was named best actor in a mini-series or special for his performance as a recently widowed man mourning his wife. Miss Tandy was nominated for best actress but did not win. A clip from the movie was shown during the awards ceremony in a brief tribute to her.         When they took "The Gin Game" to Moscow in 1979, they won the accolade that Mr. Cronyn treasures above all others. Oleg N. Yefremov, the director of the renowned Moscow Art Theater, wrote in his review, "It takes a couple of actors from America to remind us what Stanislavsky was talking about."         Miss Tandy was nominated five times for a Tony and won three: in 1948 for her role as Blanche Dubois, for "The Gin Game" in 1978, and for "Foxfire" in 1983. Mr. Cronyn was also nominated for "The Gin Game" but did not win. "I was bitterly disappointed," Miss Tandy said. "His performance is part of mine. I think he's very proud when I win, and vice versa."         In July 1994 they were honored with a special Tony for their life's work in the theater. They had already received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal, in December 1986, and the National Medal of Art, from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature         Miss Tandy acted in more than 100 stage productions during her 67-year career, which began in England and encompassed the West End in London as well as the British provinces, Broadway, and the regional theaters that were once so important to the American stage. She appeared in more than 25 movies and played the leading role in a number of television programs, developing from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft, a star adored by directors for her serenity. There was no temperament; there were no tantrums. Elia Kazan, her director in "Streetcar" said: "She's absolutely sweet-natured. She does her job; she has a sense of humor."         With each performance her reviews got better. "I think I've gotten better," she said when she was 77. "I've gotten more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrusted myself. I'd be in things I felt weren't being done right and I didn't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me."         Miss Tandy, who became an American citizen in 1954, was born in London on June 7, 1909. Her father died when she was 12 and her mother took clerical and teaching jobs at night to supplement her regular income as headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two older brothers were read to a lot, Miss Tandy recalled in 1986: "good stuff, poetry."         "I had an appreciation of the words. We were also taken to theater. I sat in a lot of galleries. It was a magical time, but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never wanted it to end." She also grew to love Shakespeare, one of the few in her class who did. "Almost everyone would say, 'Oh, God, it's Shakespeare this afternoon.' To me it was heaven."         Her brothers would stage family theatricals in their five-room flat in northeast London, but she said she did not show any promise. "I was a graceless lump," she recalled. "My brothers would always say, 'Oh, Mummy, do we really have to have her in it?' "         Nevertheless, her love of the theater led her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where, in 1924, she began three years of dramatic training. She was 18 when she made her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in "The Manderson Girls." The salary was $:2 a week, out of which she somehow had to pay for the five elegant costumes her part required. She managed by sewing them herself.  Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling         She was convinced that she was plain and that there was nothing to be done about it. "I had absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I did," she said. Her self-confidence was not enhanced by her many letters of recommendation. She remembered that each one of them said, "Don't be put off by how she looks." But if she ever was an ugly duckling -- and there are many photographs that suggest she was not -- a swan finally emerged, for in her later years she was a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkling eyes of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically, saying: "In a way it was rather good. I didn't get the part of the young ingenue. I got more interesting parts."         In 1929 she made her West End debut in "The Rumor," by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro, but it was in 1932, in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe's "Children in Uniform," that she became recognized as a gifted actress. It was a role that also afforded her one of her most treasured moments in the theater. "There was one performance when the audience didn't clap at all, they were so moved," she recalled.         During the 1930's she appeared in more than two dozen contemporary plays, but in the English tradition honed her skill on the classics, especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she was Ophelia to John Gielgud's legendary Hamlet. She was Viola in Tyrone Guthrie's 1937 production of "Twelfth Night" at the Old Vic in London, where she twice shared the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940, she returned to the Old Vic as Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear.         The offer of a role in "The Matriarch" brought her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten years later, when the war in Europe had begun and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins was ending, she settled in the United States. There was the lure of Hollywood, and there was the need to support her 6-year-old daughter, Susan. She was allowed to take only $:10 out of the country, and despite her long list of credits, it was such a struggle to make ends meet that she almost abandoned the stage.         In 1940, while she was appearing in A. J. Cronin's "Jupiter Laughs," a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn called on her backstage. Two years later they moved to Hollywood and were married. A son, Chris, was born in 1943 and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. They, her daughter Susan, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive her, in addition to her husband. Maids' Roles Ended, Thanks to Cronyn         In Hollywood, Mr. Cronyn landed some interesting roles in the movies, but Miss Tandy's career languished. At one point she even told friends she was thinking of giving up acting. She appeared with Mr. Cronyn in "The Seventh Cross" (1944) and played bit parts in several other movies, including the role of a ladies' maid in "Forever Amber" (1947), but having to say lines like "Yes, Mum" and 'No, Mum" in yet another movie became very discouraging, she recalled many years later. "I'd had a good start and I was in the doldrums in Hollywood," she said. "It was not a happy position. I began to feel I had no talent and it was all a pipe dream. It was Hume who got me out of it."         He got her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in "Portrait of a Madonna," a play by Tennessee Williams that he was directing in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave reviews brought Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York, where he was casting his new play, "A Streetcar Named Desire." He wrote in his "Memoirs," "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche."         The play, co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter as Blanche's sister, Stella, won rapturous reviews, a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and ran for more than two years on Broadway before going on a national tour. Years later, Mr. Kazan remembered the joy of directing Miss Tandy. "She's perfect," he said. "She never stops working and she's always full of little surprises. She always does things a little better than you think she will."         Mr. Atkinson, writing about Miss Tandy's performance in The New York Times, said, "It does seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, revealing and true."         A contrary view was expressed by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently published autobiography. In "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the actor wrote: "I think Jessica and I were both miscast, and between us we threw the play out of balance. Jessica is a very good actress, but I never thought she was believable as Blanche. I didn't think she had the finesse or cultivated femininity that the part required, nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned."         When "Streetcar" was filmed, the part of Blanche went to Vivien Leigh; it was the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script         She said that in creating a character, "You have to get over 'how' you're doing it and know 'why' you're doing it. Once you forget about the 'how' you get the appearance of reality." She believed the secret to a character was in the script and that it was the actor's duty to "dig it out." She said: "I'm slow about it. I keep going back to the script, the script, the script."         To Miss Tandy, audience reaction was part of a play. She said, "It's not a matter of whether they're laughing or not but whether they're breathing or not." But audiences, like the theater itself, underwent profound changes during Miss Tandy's years on the stage. "The trouble with the theater," she said in 1986, "is that it's no longer a way of life for an audience. It's just a way to kill an evening." One of the theater's problems, she said, was "we are so inundated with entertainment."         "Now you flick a switch," she continued. "It's not the event it used to be."         She said theater people had contributed to the problem by removing the curtain. "People come into the theater and they sit there watching the first scene and talking about what they've bought in Bloomingdale's that day. When you had a curtain, when the footlights went up on the curtain, and then the curtain itself went up, you were part of an experience."         As for the actors, Miss Tandy said she hated to have to grope her way across a dark stage, stumbling into the furniture, "instead of getting on stage and having a moment to think about what you're going to do." Joe Mankiewicz, the film director who was a longtime friend, said that while Lynn Fontanne always had to make an entrance, "to Jessie the way she was when she got there was what was important."  Loved to Play In the Classics         Miss Tandy was always eager to perform in regional theaters and, with Mr. Cronyn, was among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launched his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of stars of their magnitude helped put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who followed was the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie's first season in 1963, for example, Miss Tandy played Gertrude in Hamlet, Olga in "The Three Sisters" and the wife of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman." She also acted in the Shakespeare festivals in Stratford, Conn., and Stratford, Ontario. In 1983 she starred in a revival of an American classic, Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie." Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "You pass up Miss Tandy's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril."         She hated the experience of seeing herself in the movies. "It's a very humbling experience to watch yourself," she said. But while the satisfaction of film never came close to the joy of a live performance, she said she felt it was important to accept roles that were offered to her; it helped pay expenses when she took parts at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She played Mr. Cronyn's wife in four of her most recent films, "Honky Tonk Freeway," (1981) "Cocoon," (1984), "Batteries Not Included" (1987) and "Cocoon: The Return" (1988). In 1991, Miss Tandy, then 82, played an indomitable 82-year-old woman in "Fried Green Tomatoes."         Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 plays on Broadway and dozens of Off Broadway and regional productions during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they went they were asked how they tolerated so much togetherness. "It's hard sometimes," she acknowledged, "but we always manage to give ourselves space. We don't live in each other's pockets. We don't take the play home with us. We do make suggestions to each other, and if we don't agree we respect each other's views." She burst out laughing and recalled Dame Sybil Thorndike's response when asked whether she ever considered divorcing her husband, with whom she had long shared the stage. "Divorce? Never. Murder? Frequently."         In her 70's and even into her 80's, Miss Tandy continued to take on strenuous parts, despite increased difficulty with memorization and stage fright that had got worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that caused her collapse onstage during a performance of "Foxfire" in Los Angeles in 1985 did not slow her down. Nor did major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appeared in the television movies "The Story Lady" (1991) and "To Dance With the White Dog" (1993) and completed three more feature films: "Used People" (1992) and "Camilla" and "Nobody's Fool," which are to be released this fall.         "Jessie adores working," Mr. Cronyn said in 1986. "She's more fully alive when she's working." As she got older she seemed to be in ever greater demand, but over the years she took good parts and she took bad parts. "You are richer for doing things," she said. "If you wait for the perfect part or for what sends you, you will have long waits, and you deteriorate. You can't be an actor without acting." A DEDICATED LIFE IN THE PUBLIC EYE         During a 67-year acting career in Britain and the United States, Jessica Tandy appeared in more than 100 plays, more than 25 movies and numerous television shows. Here is a sampling.

The year was 1989. In some editions the obituary also misstated the year for the film "Fried Green Tomatoes." It was 1991.       
         Martha Raye, the big-mouthed, big-hearted entertainer whose career spanned the decades from vaudeville to videos, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         In recent years, she had suffered a serious of ailments, including a stroke and circulatory difficulties. Ron Wise, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai, said, "Her death was an aggregate of that and other problems."         Miss Raye sang, she danced, she acted on Broadway, in Hollywood and on television, but the knockabout comic won perhaps her greatest renown as an indefatigable trouper who traveled thousands of miles through three wars to lift the morale of America's fighting forces.         "They ask so little and give so much," she said during the Vietnam War. "The least we can do back home here is give them the love, the respect and the dignity that they, our flag and our country deserve."         Her real name was Margie Yvonne Reed. She was born on Aug. 27, 1916, into a show-business family in the charity ward of a hospital in Butte, Mont. Her father and mother, Pete Reed and the former Peggy Hooper, were Irish immigrants whose song-and-dance routine, under the name Reed and Hooper, took them to carnivals and vaudeville houses around the United States.         "I didn't work until I was 3," Miss Raye was to say years later. "But after that, I never stopped."         Her mother taught her to read and write while the family, which also included her sister and brother, crisscrossed the country. From time to time, she attended schools in Montana, Chicago and New York.         "Our home was in an old, broken down Pierce Arrow auto which my father drove," Miss Raye remembered. "We put the scenery in the back seat and that was where we slept at night. We cooked on Sterno. And we went from town to town, looking for bookings."         She played burlesque houses, nightclubs and saloons, where she said she worked for tips only. "On a good night, I made a dollar," she said. "On a bad one, 25 cents."         At 15, she was singing, dancing and clowning in a children's act. She picked the name Martha Raye from a phone book and piled up the credits. She was a member of the Benny Davis Revue and the Ben Blue Company, a trouper on the Loew's vaudeville circuit, a member of the Will Morrisey act and a feature performer in "Earl Carroll's Sketchbook" and "Calling All Stars."         Eventually she made her way to Hollywood. And on one of the Sunday nights when stars gathered and entertained one another at the Trocadero nightclub, she got a couple of her friends to play straightmen to her comedy. Their names were Jimmy Durante and Joe E. Lewis. The producer Norman Taurog saw her perform, and the next day she was working with Bing Crosby on the 1936 film "Rhythm on the Range." She did a slapstick drunk scene and sang a song called "Mr. Paganini," and became a star overnight.         Miss Raye appeared in films like "Waikiki Wedding," "College Holiday," "Give Me a Sailor," "Keep 'em Flying" and "Hellzapoppin." In 1940, she starred on Broadway opposite Al Jolson in the revue "Hold Onto Your Hats." She appeared on his radio show and the programs of Eddie Cantor and Bob Hope.         During World War II, she began entertaining troops, and the 1944 film "Four Jills in a Jeep" was based on a U.S.O. tour of bases in England and Africa she made in the company of Kay Francis, Carole Landis and Mitzi Mayfair.         In 1969, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Miss Raye the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her wartime efforts, and she was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993.         She was not happy about her Hollywood career, except for "Monsieur Verdoux," Charlie Chaplin's controversial 1947 black comedy about a Parisian Bluebeard who marries and kills for money. "I must have made 35 or 40 movies and most of them were mindless," Miss Raye said. "But in those days actors didn't fight the system; then we thought we were lucky to be under contract."         Her performance in "Verdoux," in which she portrayed Annabella Bonheur, a raucous, indestructible wife of the killer, was praised as brilliant by Bosley Crowther of The New York Times. "Do you know," she recalled in 1972, "that when Chaplin called to offer me the part, I hung up on him; I thought it was a joke."         She blamed her decline in Hollywood on executives who focused on her shapely legs and ability to fill out a sweater. "They tried to make a glamour girl out of me," the brown-haired, blue-eyed actress complained. "Let's face it, I'm not a glamour girl. I'm a clown."         Despite her setbacks in Hollywood, she was far from finished. Milton Berle gave her a start in television, and by 1954, she was the medium's reigning female comedian. Ahead of her was more success in nightclubs, cabaret and theater.         Offstage, life was darker. "As an entertainer, she's a genius," one of her colleagues once said. "Socially, she's completely unsure of herself."         She married again and again. Among her husbands were the makeup artist Buddy Westmore, the composer David Rose, the businessman Neal Lang, the dancers Nick Condos and Edward Begley and the policeman Robert O'Shea. Her last marriage was in 1991, to 42-year-old Mark Harris, her manager.         She had a daughter, Melody, by Mr. Condos. After Miss Raye suffered a stroke in 1991, she and Melody battled in court over control of the actress's money. In July 1992, Miss Raye filed a lawsuit alleging that the 1991 Bette Midler-James Caan film "For the Boys" wrongfully appropriated her life story. A judge dismissed the $5 million complaint earlier this year.         In her later years, many people knew Miss Raye as the star of Polident commercials.         She is survived by her husband and her daughter.       
         Kaleria Fedicheva, a former ballerina with the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad who taught and staged the classics in the United States, died on Sept. 13 in Maribor, Slovenia, where she had been seeking medical treatment. She was 58 years old and lived in Glen Cove, L.I.         Ms. Fedicheva died of cancer, said Martin Fredmann, her former husband and the artistic director of the Colorado Ballet in Denver.         Ms. Fedicheva belonged to the generation of Kirov stars, including Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova, Yuri Soloviev and Alla Sizova, who created a sensation in the West in the 1960's. After graduating from the Kirov school in 1955, Ms. Fedicheva excelled in 19th-century classics that showed off her dynamism, like "Raymonda," and she drew immediate acclaim during the Kirov's first seasons in New York in 1961 and 1964. Unlike her younger partner Mikhail Baryshnikov and Mr. Nureyev and Ms. Makarova, Ms. Fedicheva did not defect while touring abroad.         But after she married Mr. Fredmann, an American dancer studying at the Kirov, in 1974, Soviet authorities, saying she was not divorced from her first husband, blocked her exit visa to the United States for a year. Her case received international attention after she was beaten by two men outside her apartment in what was then Leningrad, in what she said was an attempt to intimidate her. The Soviet Government permitted her to leave in February 1975 with her son, Ivan.         Ms. Fedicheva and Mr. Fredmann were divorced four years later but remained good friends, and she staged an acclaimed production of "Giselle" for the Colorado Ballet last year.         Ms. Fedicheva staged other works from the Russian repertory and choreographed new ones in the United States and abroad after she opened the New Russian School in Sea Cliff, L.I., after her arrival. She also directed her students and professional guest artists in the Fedicheva Ballet Company of Glen Cove, which was founded in 1982. The group's annual production of "The Nutcracker" was seen in New York City and on Long Island.         As a dancer, Ms. Fedicheva was at her best when her technical brilliance came to the fore in ballets like "Laurencia" and "Don Quixote." Yet she also excelled in "La Bayadere" and performed regularly in classics like "Swan Lake" and in contemporary Soviet ballets.         In addition to her son, Ms. Fedicheva is survived by her mother in St. Petersburg, Russia.       
         Mildred Natwick, a versatile actress who created an engaging gallery of eccentric, whimsical and spunky characters in plays, films and television for more than 60 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Miss Natwick, a small woman with sharp features and a mischievous manner, was a familiar figure on the Broadway stage, where she appeared in some 40 productions. Among other roles, she played an idiosyncratic secretary in George Bernard Shaw's "Candida," an extroverted medium in Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit" and a shrewish wife in Jean Anouilh's "Waltz of the Toreadors."         The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson, in his review of the Anouilh play in 1957, characterized her performance as "protean" and one that "rides the whirlwind with a great sweep of venomous extravagance."         Miss Natwick's comic brilliance in Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park" prompted Walter Kerr to acclaim her in 1963 as "the most hilarious woman in the Western hemisphere." She further confirmed her versatility in 1970 in Harold Pinter's "Landscape" and in 1971 when, at the age of 62, she made her debut in a singing role in a John Kander-Fred Ebb musical, "70, Girls, 70," as the disarming leader of a circle of elderly people seeking self-esteem by stealing furs.         Among Miss Natwick's films were four directed by John Ford. She appeared as a prostitute in "The Long Voyage Home," a doomed mother in "The Three Godfathers," a hard-bitten Army wife in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" and a sly widow in "The Quiet Man."         In a 1990 interview, she praised Ford as a masterly director who needed just a few words to inspire actors and give them the right clue or insight for a scene. In contrast, she said, Alfred Hitchcock, in directing the comedy "The Trouble With Harry," told her and the other actors precisely what he wanted.         Miss Natwick concentrated her career on Broadway, saying she had always preferred plays to movies because "on the stage, you're in control for two hours, while in a film, you do bits and pieces, usually out of sequence."         She received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her work in the 1967 film version of "Barefoot in the Park." She also received several Tony and Emmy nominations and was awarded an Emmy for "The Snoop Sisters," a 1973-74 television series in which she and Helen Hayes played successful mystery writers who were obsessed with solving real crimes.         In an interview in her Park Avenue apartment, she said her main criterion for creating a role was to make a character as inseparable from herself as possible. Nearly everything, she remarked, "is hit or miss for a while, until it all comes together." She said her advice to young performers was: "Act every time you get a chance. At least in the beginning, go wherever acting is."         Miss Natwick, who was called Milly by friends and associates, was born in Baltimore on June 19, 1905, to Joseph Natwick, a businessman, and the former Mildred Marion Dawes. She graduated from the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore and also from Bennett Junior College in Dutchess County, N.Y., where she majored in drama.         She began performing at the age of 21 with the Vagabonds, a nonprofessional group in Baltimore. She soon joined the celebrated University Players on Cape Cod, trading lines with such other young performers as Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan and Joshua Logan. She made her Broadway debut in the melodrama "Carry Nation" in 1932.         Among her films were "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945), "The Late George Apley" (1947), "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950), "The Court Jester" (1956), "If It's Tuesday This Must Be Belgium" (1967), "Daisy Miller" (1974) and "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988)         No immediate family members survive.         Correction:  November 8, 1994, Tuesday         An obituary on Oct. 26 about the actress Mildred Natwick referred incorrectly to her debut in a singing role in a musical. It was in "Stars in Your Eyes" in 1939, not in "70, Girls, 70" in 1971.       
         Virginia E. Montes, a former national secretary and lobbyist for the National Organization for Women, died Thursday at her home in Atlanta. She was 50.         The cause was a stroke, the Atlanta medical examiner's office said.         Ms. Montes, a native of Honduras, had been active in NOW for 13 years and was the first Latin American woman to serve as a national officer of the organization.         She was elected secretary of NOW and of its national political action committee in 1991 and served until last year. In the spring of 1993 she led the organization's defense of Lani Guinier, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was nominated by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division. The President withdrew the nomination after conservatives criticized Ms. Guinier for papers she had written on ways for blacks to increase their influence in elections.         Earlier, Ms. Montes was involved in NOW's lobbying efforts while serving as its government liaison officer. In two terms on the organization's national board she headed the committee for racial diversity.         Ms. Montes, who was known as Ginny, came to the United States when she was 10 years old. She was a delegate to three Democratic national conventions and frequently lobbied for civil rights groups in the halls of Southern state legislatures. One cause she advocated was the redrawing of election districts to strengthen minority representation.         In 1980 she became director of legislative research for the Southern Regional Council, based in Georgia. For a time she directed the Georgia Housing Coalition, but later returned to the council, where she was a senior consultant.         She also conducted leadership training activities for NOW, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Women's Political Caucus and other groups.         Ms. Montes is survived by a daughter, Rebecca Albury of Atlanta; her mother, Greta Hyde Montes of Tampa, Fla.; two sisters, Greta Montes of Wayne, Pa., and Jacqueline Zaborski of West Palm Beach, Fla., and three brothers, Robert, of Clearwater, Fla., and Ronald and Hiram, both of Tampa.       
         Arlene Carmen, a church administrator whose ministry sought out society's castoffs in the streets of Greenwich Village and midtown Manhattan, died on Sunday in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. A Village resident, she was 58.         The cause was complications from congestive heart failure, according to Judson Memorial Church, where she was program associate and church administrator.         Ms. Carmen spent 28 years on the staff of Judson, on Washington Square. She became widely known in the late 1970's when she began to minister to a substratum of prostitutes, prisoners and rebellious artists, and later, to people with AIDS.         She opened a clinic at the church, but soon realized that mistrust kept away street people. That led her to roam Eighth Avenue in a church van offering counsel and referrals as well as lemonade and clothing. At times, she was accompanied by the Rev. Howard Moody, then the senior minister, who acted as the driver.         Once, in 1978, Ms. Carmen was arrested in a "sweep" of Times Square prostitutes and spent almost 22 hours in custody. She went to court with the New York Civil Liberties Union and won an $8,500 award. A jury found that the arrest was legal but the long detention was not.         She was born and raised in the Bronx and graduated from City College. She worked with Mr. Moody, running a Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion, a nationwide referral network for safe abortions, before the advent of legalized abortion in 1973. Together they wrote two books, one on abortion counseling and one on prostitution. Ms. Carmen also helped stage arts events and campaigned against censorship.         She stopped her runs in the van some years ago, but continued to aid prostitutes, whom she called "sex workers," most recently as a consultant to Manhattan's Midtown Community Court. Ms. Carmen was an organizer of the People With AIDS Health Group.         Ms. Carmen is survived by her mother, Mina Carmen of Freehold, N.J., and two sisters, Andrea Carmen of Freehold, and Jewel DeRoy of Los Angeles.       
         Wilma Rudolph, who grew from a sickly child unable to walk into a statuesque athlete of 20 who won three gold medals as a sprinter in the 1960 Olympics in Rome, died yesterday at her home in Brentwood, Tenn., near Nashville. She was 54.         Her sister, Charlene Rudolph, said Rudolph learned in July that she had a malignant brain tumor.         Rudolph was a handsome, regal woman, 6 feet tall, charming, graceful and gracious. Over seven days, she became the first woman to win three gold medals in track and field in one Olympics. She also became America's greatest female sports hero since Babe Didrikson Zaharias a generation earlier.         She competed in an era in which Olympic sports such as track and field were completely amateur, and for years later, as a frequent spokeswoman for Olympic-family organizations and causes, she preached the idealism of that bygone era.         "I love what the Olympics stand for," she said. "They'll always be a part of me."         As Barbara Heilman wrote in Sports Illustrated, "She can command a look of mingled graciousness and hauteur that suggests a duchess, but in a crowd that is one part Skeeter and 5,000 parts people, young men and babies will come to her in 30 seconds."         Skeeter was the nickname bestowed by her high school basketball coach, Clinton Gray, who considered her more mosquito than basketball player. "You're just like a skeeter," he said. "You're little, you're fast and you always get in my way."         Her life story was so dramatic that in 1977 it became a two-hour prime-time television movie. The movie was written, produced and directed by her friend Bud Greenspan, the Olympic historian.         "She was the Jesse Owens of women's track and field, and like Jesse, she changed the sport for all time," he said. "She became the benchmark for little black girls to aspire."         Wilma Glodean Rudolph was born on June 23, 1940, in the St. Bethlehem section of Clarksville, Tenn., 45 miles north of Nashville, and grew up in Clarksville. She was the 20th of 22 children of Ed Rudolph, a railroad porter, from two marriages. Her mother, Blanche, was a domestic.         The child weighed four and a half pounds at birth. At age 4, she contracted double pneumonia and scarlet fever simultaneously and almost died. The illnesses left her left leg paralyzed, and once a week, on her mother's day off, the mother made a 90-mile round trip with her to Nashville for heat and water treatment on the leg.         At 6, she started to hop on one leg. At 8, she started to walk with a leg brace. Later, an orthopedic shoe replaced the brace. One day, when she was 11, her mother found her playing basketball in her bare feet. That was the end of the special shoe and the beginning of a fabled sports career.         "My father pushed me to become competitive," she wrote in a 1978 autobiography, "Wilma." "With so many children, when you did something with one, you always had another along. He felt that sports would help me overcome the problems."         At 13, she went out for the high school basketball team and twice made the all-state team. She would sometimes skip school to run on a track across the street. Her talent intrigued Ed Temple, the renowned coach at Tennessee State University in Nashville, and at his invitation she attended his summer track camps.         In 1956, a 16-year-old stringbean of 89 pounds, she ran in the Melbourne Olympics. To her dismay, she was eliminated in the 200-meter heats. She did win a bronze medal in the 400-meter relay.         Then she returned to high school. When she graduated, Temple gave her an athletic scholarship at Tennessee State. Bulked up to 130 pounds, she made the 1960 Olympic team. Temple was the women's coach.         The day before the 100 meters in the Rome Olympics, she stepped into a hole in the infield of the practice track and twisted an ankle. It became swollen and discolored. The next day, the ankle held up, and with her fluid running style she won her semifinal in 11.3 seconds, equaling the world record. She won the final easily in 11.0 seconds, but the following wind of 6.15 miles an hour (the allowable limit is 4.47) precluded recognition as a world record.         In the 200 meters, she set an Olympic record of 23.2 seconds in the heats and won the final easily in 24.0 seconds into a stiff wind. In the 400-meter relay, with college teammates running the first three legs, she helped set a world record of 44.4 seconds in a heat. In the final, after a bad baton pass to her, she turned a two-yard deficit into a three-yard victory in 44.5 seconds.         "After the playing of 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' " she wrote in her autobiography, "I came away from the victory stand and I was mobbed. People were jumping all over me, putting microphones into my face, pounding my back, and I couldn't believe it."         She returned to college and earned a degree in education in 1961. She was voted the 1961 Sullivan Award as America's outstanding amateur athlete, male or female.         But there was no money for amateurs then and no professional track, so she set out to make a living. She taught second grade and coached high school basketball and track in Tennessee, all for $400 a month. Then she ran a community center in Indiana for $600 a month.         She last raced in 1962. She quit, she said, because "I couldn't top what I did, so I'll be remembered for when I was at my best."         In time, she became a spokeswoman for a movie studio, a baking company and other businesses. At DePauw University in Indiana, she coached briefly and recruited minority-group students. She established the Wilma Rudolph Foundation, working with youngsters and sending tutors to schools with books on American heros.         "If I have anything to leave," she said, "the foundation is my legacy."         She was voted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, the Helms Hall of Fame, the Women's Sports Foundation Hall of Fame and the Black Athletes Hall of Fame. In 1988, Tennessee State named an indoor track in her honor. In 1990, she became the first woman to receive the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Silver Anniversary Award, even though she competed before the N.C.A.A. sponsored women's championships in any sport.         Once, when she was asked how certain other runners compared with her, she declined to answer.  "I'm selfish," she said. "I think I was in a class all by myself."         She married William Ward in 1961 and was divorced the next year. In 1963, she married Robert Eldridge, whom she had known since second grade. They were divorced in 1976.         Her father died in 1961 and her mother died in May. She is survived by her four children with Mr. Eldridge -- daughters Yolanda Jones and Djuana Bowers and sons Robert and Xurry -- five sisters and two brothers, and seven grandchildren.         Correction:  November 25, 1994, Friday         An obituary of Wilma Rudolph on Nov. 13, as well as a Sports of The Times column that day, misstated her accomplishment in winning three gold medals in track and field at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. She was the first American woman to win three or more medals in one Olympics, not the first woman; Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands won four gold medals at the 1948 Games in London.       
         Evelyn Anderson, believed to be the last surviving member of the troupe that danced with Josephine Baker in "La Revue Negre" in Paris in the 1920's, died on Oct. 29 at Misericordia Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 87.         The cause was pneumonia, her family said.         Miss Anderson was 18 and had worked as a dancer in several shows produced by Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake when she was recruited to join a revue, as yet unnamed, going to Paris.         The troupe was formed by a wealthy Chicago woman, Caroline Dudley, who had backed other shows featuring black artists. The star of the revue was to have been a singer and dancer named Maude de Forest. Miss Baker came to the fore when an artist named Paul Colin featured her in a now-famous poster for the show, which the French producers decided to call "La Revue Negre." The show became an instant success and made Miss Baker an international star.         The revue was scheduled to go to Berlin and Moscow after the Paris engagement, but when Miss Baker broke her contract and went to the Folies Bergere, the company broke up. Miss Anderson was among those who chose to remain in Europe, and for the next 15 years she performed in revues and night clubs on the Continent.         When World War II broke out, she was working in the Netherlands, dancing in a cabaret in The Hague, according to Jean-Claude Baker's book about his adoptive mother, "Josephine: The Hungry Heart." When the Germans conquered the Netherlands, they deported her, her partner Harry Watkins and several of her friends.         They were interned first in the Netherlands and later moved to a camp in Germany. In 1943, they were released in a prisoner exchange and made their way back to the United States. In 1944, Miss Anderson married Robert Robbins, an orchestra leader in the Philadelphia area.         She is survived by two brothers, John and Thomas Anderson.       
         Viola Spolin, who as a teacher and author was an inspiration for the improvisational theater movement, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 88.         Her sister, Beatrice Lees, said Mrs. Spolin had three strokes in recent years.         Through her theater games and her book "Improvisations for the Theater" as well as the subsequent work of her son Paul Sills at the Compass and Second City in Chicago and with Story Theater, Mrs. Spolin influenced several generations of actors and directors, including Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Alan Arkin, Severn Darden, Barbara Harris, Anthony Holland, Paul Sand and Avery Schreiber. Although she did not have a career as a professional director, her guidance as a vital and highly demonstrative teacher was to indispensable as actors increasingly responded to the idea of improv.         Various comic techniques came later, but she was a primary source of the practical mechanics of theater games, exercises designed to free actors. Explaining her approach, she once said, "My vision is a world of accessible intuition." Mr. Sills said his mother wanted "to help players hit their intuition" and become more spontaneous.         Most of Mrs. Spolin's theater work was with children. She was born in Chicago, where she trained with Neva Boyd, an educator who used games to help children adjust to life in the city. Mrs. Spolin added the idea of theater games, exercises that led to role-playing. Later she worked for the W.P.A. When Mr. Sills joined David Shepherd in creating the Compass improvisational theater, his mother's games became part of the work process.         Since 1945 Mrs. Spolin had lived in Los Angeles, where she founded the Young Actors Company, which is both a school and theater. She retired in 1980. "Improvisations for the Theater," her best-known book (published by Northwestern University Press) remains a standard theatrical text.         In addition to her sister, of New York City, and her son Paul, of Baileys Harbor, Wis., she is survived by her third husband, Robert Kolmus Greene; another son, William Sills of Oakland, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         By all appearances, this was a great year for Alix Gres, the French fashion designer. There was a retrospective of her work held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in September, attended by Yuzo Yagi, the chairman of Yagi Tsusho Ltd., the Japanese company that had bought the rights to her name in 1988 and had sponsored the exhibition. In Japan, the company was promoting her name anew.         And she was being heralded by fellow couturiers like Yves Saint Laurent, who marveled at the show in an interview in Women's Wear Daily. Her daughter, Anne Gres (the name is pronounced greh), provided the fashion industry newspaper with a response she said her mother had dictated on Oct. 9. "Coming from an artist and colleague whom I admire," said an excerpt published on Nov. 1, "I'm greatly touched."         So the fashion world was startled to learn yesterday that Mme. Gres, as she is always called by those in her trade, had been dead for more than a year. Born on Nov. 30, 1903, she died on Nov. 24, 1993, in a retirement home in the south of France, a fact that was carefully hidden by her daughter.         In a front-page story in the French newspaper Le Monde, Anne Gres said she had disguised the death of her mother for the last 13 months for two reasons. "First of all, I looked to protect her," she said. "All those who have profited from her would again find the means to draw on her money." The second reason she gave was respect for the older sister of Mme. Gres, who is still alive. She added that she did not yet have the money to buy the sort of tomb that would dignify her mother's memory. "It made me suffer more," she said about hiding the news. "It is like it didn't happen."         No one knew about Mme. Gres's death until the article appeared. Not her closest friends and peers, Pierre Cardin and Hubert de Givenchy. Not Jacques Mouclier, the head of the Chambre Syndicale, the governing body of French fashion, where she held the title of honorary president for life. Not Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute exhibition, and not even Mr. Yagi, the owner of the rights to her name.         Those interviewed in Paris as the news spread expressed confusion at the charade, which was revealed when Le Monde uncovered a document in a district mayor's office in Paris confirming her death. It was verified in interviews with residents of the home in St.-Paul-de-Vence where Mme. Gres had lived.         For the French fashion industry, where designer names are often bought and sold without consulting the founders, it is an eerie illustration of how a design house can continue on without its progenitor.         Mme. Gres was the last survivor of her generation of couturiers, which included Madeleine Vionnet, Jeanne Lanvin, Elsa Schiaparelli and Gabrielle Chanel. Although some have asked whether there could have been a commercial reason for her daughter's actions, it seems unlikely, given the number of houses in Paris that continue after the designer has died, from Balenciaga to Chanel and Christian Dior, where big-name designers took over the workrooms.         "It is very difficult to express oneself on hearing such a frightening piece of news," Mr. de Givenchy said in a fax. "I was very shocked to learn of the passing of such a 'grande dame' like this one a year too late. Mme. Gres was a person who was very discreet and very humble, and maybe this was her decision."         Her clients, often the people closest to designers who work in couture, as Mme. Gres did, were especially shocked at the news. Sao Schlumberger, who donated a dress to the Costume Institute for the exhibition, said: "It is quite strange. Some time ago I talked with the Duchess of Orleans, who was a customer of hers and a close friend, and she said she went to visit her in an old people's home. And the first time she recognized her, but the last time she didn't recognize her at all."         One reason Mme. Gres was able to fade away was that she was no longer active in her house, which she sold in 1984 to the French industrialist Bernard Tapie. She later told Mr. Cardin that the decision was the worst she had ever made, recalled Bernard Danillon, the communications director for Pierre Cardin. Mr. Cardin had tried to stay in touch with Mme. Gres, Mr. Danillon said, but "every time that anyone asks about Mme. Gres to Jacques Mouclier, the answer was given by her daughter, and she said always, 'Mme. Gres wants to be quiet, she doesn't want to be disturbed, she doesn't want to talk to anybody.' "         "After years and years of getting this answer, you don't call again," Mr. Danillon said. "You respect someone's wish."         At the Costume Institute, Mr. Martin said he had made two attempts to contact Mme. Gres, one when the show was in the planning stage, the other when it was ready to open, inviting her to come. "We took the Women's Wear Daily response as being the sure indication that Mme. Gres was aware of the show," Mr. Martin said. "Maybe you wouldn't have told people if you were reclusive, but to create a fiction, a fabrication of her being alive? I don't even understand what the purpose would be."         Everyone who wrote about the exhibition discussed the designer in the present tense. Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times: "A nonagenarian, she is one of the great female designers who dominated haute couture in Paris until after World War II, when the men took over."         Those who admire her work are feeling haunted, having missed a long mourning period.         "It gives me goose bumps," said Susan Gutfreund, a client of Mme.  Gres who also shared a Paris hairdresser with her. She last saw her four years ago. "Her daughter must have had a reason to hide it, but I find it very sad," she said.         One of the reasons for the deception may have been the resentment that Anne Gres indicated to Le Monde over the way the French fashion industry had reacted in 1987, when her mother's couture house was liquidated after rent on her atelier went unpaid for two years. "No one did anything," Anne Gres said, when wooden mannequins, toiles and partly finished dresses were thrown into trash bags.         The house was emptied in a day. "That day there, she had paid in full, because they had stolen her life," she said.         In 1988, the house was bought by Mr. Yagi. Her daughter condemned the fashion professionals yesterday in Le Monde. "Mme. Gres is the Bosnia of couture," she said, always speaking in the present tense. "Except for Pierre Cardin and Hubert de Givenchy, who has tried to help her?"         Mme. Gres's death is remarkable in the way its secrecy mirrors her life. In interviews throughout her career, she refused to reveal her age, her parents' backgrounds (her grandparents were said to be Italian and German) or even her real name. Gres was the name taken by her husband, Serge Czerefkow, a Russian painter she married in the 30's. She was born Germaine Krebs, then changed her name to Alix Barton. The Metropolitan Museum's catalogue told her life story simply: "Mme. Gres is a creation," it said.         Trained as a sculptor, she began designing clothes in 1930 after learning sketching and cutting at the house of Premet. She then worked for a house called, coincidentally, Alix. During World War II, she started her own house, called Gres, one of only 20 that stayed open throughout the war.         By the 1950's, Mme. Gres had fully developed what became her signature. She devoted herself early on to draping, and even her name began to evoke images of Grecian dress. Soon she was dressing the society women who became devoted to her, and wives of heads of state, including Princess Grace, Jacqueline Kennedy and Danielle Mitterrand.         "Mme. Gres is one of the most important 20th-century designers," Mr. Martin said of his decision to hold a retrospective of her work. "Along with Vionnet and Chanel, Mme. Gres was making the most advanced clothing in Paris in the 1930's."         It was not until 1980 that Mme. Gres showed a ready-to-wear line, 10 years after her peers had done so.         In an interview with Women's Wear Daily in 1975, she said: "From the beginning, I didn't want to do what others were doing in any way. I wasn't able to, because I didn't have the knowledge. That was one reason I took the material and worked directly on it. I used the knowledge I had, which was sculpture."       
         Lilia Skala, a stage and screen actress best known for her portrayal of the headstrong Mother Superior in the 1963 film "Lilies of the Field," died on Sunday at her home in Bay Shore, L.I. She was in her 90's, but her exact date of birth was unknown, her family said.         Miss Skala's performance in "Lilies of the Field," which also starred Sidney Poitier, earned her an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe Award. She appeared in numerous other movies, including "Call Me Madam" with Ethel Merman (both in roles they had in the original Broadway stage version), "Ship of Fools," "Roseland," "Flashdance," "Heartland" and "House of Games." Her last screen appearance was in the 1991 film "Men of Respect."         She was born in Vienna around the turn of the century and graduated from the University of Dresden with a degree in architecture. She was the first female member of the Austrian Association of Engineers and Architects and helped design several buildings in Vienna. But her love for the theater gradually took precedence over architecture. She joined the Max Reinhardt Repertory Theater and eventually became an Austrian stage and screen star.         In 1939, fleeing Hitler, her family immigrated to the United States where her acting career came to a temporary halt until she landed the part of a Swiss housekeeper in the 1941 Broadway production "Letters to Lucerne." Soon, offers of other roles began coming in. She was seen in many Broadway and Off Broadway productions, including "With a Silk Thread," "Arms and the Man," "The Survivors" and a 1986 musical version of "The Shop on Main Street" at the Jewish Repertory Theater.         She also sang the role of Mrs. Peachum in the New York City Opera's 1965 production of "The Threepenny Opera," and appeared on television in shows like "The Goldbergs," "Kraft Theater," "I Remember Mama" and "Search for Tomorrow."         She is survived by two sons, Martin, of Darien, Conn., and Peter, of London; and five grandchildren, Elizabeth, Emily, Justin, Katri and Christopher.       
         Frances T. Freeman Jalet-Cruz, a legal-aid lawyer who fought for more humane conditions in the Texas prison system, died on Tuesday at St. Joseph's Manor in Trumbull, Conn. She was 84.         She had suffered a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Jalet (pronounced ja-LAY) was trained in international law but spent much of her career defending prisoners and the indigent. In Texas, newspapers came to label her "St. Frances of Houston" and "Portia of the Poor."         She arrived in the state in 1967 fresh from a course in poverty law at the University of Pennsylvania -- 57 years old and a white-haired mother of five grown children. Supported by a fellowship, she joined the Legal Aid and Defender Society of Travis County in Austin to defend the poor.         A newspaper article about her prompted a Mexican-American inmate and jailhouse lawyer named Fred Arispe Cruz to call her for assistance in appealing his robbery conviction. Hearing of inmates' complaints about what she considered harsh and often illegal treatment from the Texas Department of Corrections, she mounted a campaign on behalf of the prisoners.         She was in the thick of a stormy debate and bitter, costly litigation in the state's prison system in the 1960's and 1970's. She also caused a sensation in 1972 when, at the age of 61, she married Mr. Cruz, 32, after his release from prison. The marriage lasted six years.         The attention eventually led to a broader movement focusing on prison reform, and in the 1980's the Federal courts ordered sweeping changes in prisons statewide.         Her exploits and battle were chronicled in "Texas Prisons: The Walls Came Tumbling Down," by Steve J. Martin and Sheldon Ekland-Olson (Texas Monthly Press, 1987). The book's dedication cited "her unwavering belief in the rule of law."         She was born in Boston and graduated from Radcliffe College before earning advanced degrees at Columbia University Law School, Teachers College and Georgetown Law Center. She worked for the American Association of University Women and in various legal positions in Washington before moving to Texas.         Mrs. Jalet is survived by a son, Tuckerman S. Jalet of Westport, Conn.; four daughters, Jacqueline J. Gordon of Greenwich, Conn., Vanessa Jalet-Stanescu of Manhattan, Roberta J. Kurland of State College, Pa., and Frances Jalet-Miller of Queens, and eight grandchildren.       
         Julie Haydon, the actress who created the role of the fragile Laura Wingfield in the original production of "The Glass Menagerie," died on Saturday in La Crosse, Wis. She was 84.         The cause was abdominal cancer, said Patricia Angelin, the executor of the estate of George Jean Nathan. Miss Haydon was the widow of Nathan, the drama critic.         When "The Glass Menagerie" opened on Broadway in 1945, it immediately established Tennessee Williams's reputation and represented an important return to the theater for Laurette Taylor, who played Amanda Wingfield, a fictional representation of the playwright's mother. Though overshadowed by Miss Taylor, Miss Haydon, as the young girl who cherished her collection of glass figurines, shared in the praise. In his review in The New York Times, Lewis Nichols wrote that she brought "a shy helplessness, a desire to be liked" to a role that was based on Williams's sister.         Miss Haydon was born in Oak Park, Ill. When she was 19, she toured with Minnie Maddern Fiske in "Mrs. Bumpstead Leigh." Two years later, she played Ophelia in a production of "Hamlet" at the Hollywood Playhouse. Among her films were "Age of Innocence" (with Irene Dunne), "The Scoundrel" (with Noel Coward) and "A Family Affair," the first in the Andy Hardy series. While appearing on the stage in California in "Autumn Crocus" (with Frances Lederer) she met Nathan.         She made her Broadway debut in 1935 in Philip Barry's "Bright Star," which closed after seven performances. Several subsequent plays were successes, including Paul Vincent Carroll's "Shadow and Substance," in which she played a saintly maid, and William Saroyan's Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Time of Your Life," in which she created the role of the prostitute Kitty Duval.         Also in the cast of "The Time of Your Life" were Gene Kelly and Eddie Dowling. Later she appeared in Saroyan's "Sweeney in the Trees" and "Hello, Out There," opposite Dowling. Reviewing "Hello, Out There," Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times that together they gave "a lyrical performance of great enchantment."         Dowling was the director as well as a star of "The Glass Menagerie" (in the role based on the author). After that historic production, Miss Haydon acted in several other Broadway plays, including Ferenc Molnar's "Miracle in the Mountains." Her performance in "The Glass Menagerie" remained the high point of her career.         She married Nathan in 1955. After his death in 1958, she made guest appearances in various plays often in community theaters and on college campuses. She also lectured in programs drawn from her husband's many books. In 1962 she left New York and returned to the Midwest. For 10 years she was actress in residence at the College of St. Teresa in Winona, Minn.         She played the mother in revivals of "The Glass Menagerie," and in 1980, still petite with a cameo face, she returned to the New York theater to do the role off Broadway, opposite Ms. Angelin as the daughter.         She is survived by her sister, Miriam Donaldson Ziegler of Los Angeles.       
         Elizabeth Glaser, who waged a tireless campaign to draw attention to pediatric AIDS after she unknowingly passed the disease on to her daughter and son, died yesterday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said Josh Baran, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Glaser, the wife of Paul Michael Glaser, a director and actor who starred in the "Starsky and Hutch" television series, was one of several public figures to bring AIDS to the forefront of the 1992 Presidential campaign. She had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion in 1981.         Thousands of delegates, dignitaries and guests stood frozen in place at the Democratic National Convention in New York City as she told of the death of her 7-year-old daughter, Ariel, in 1988 from AIDS.         "She taught me to love when all I wanted to do was hate," Mrs. Glaser said. "She taught me to help others when all I wanted to do was help myself."         In a statement yesterday, President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, said they were deeply saddened by her death. "Elizabeth confronted the challenge of AIDS in her own life and lost her beloved daughter to AIDS at a time when our Government and our country were too indifferent to this illness and the people who had it," he said.         Mrs. Glaser, a former teacher, was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus when she was nine months pregnant with Ariel, her first child. She began bleeding and was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she received seven pints of blood in a transfusion.         The baby was delivered successfully but four years later, became seriously ill. Hospital tests found her red blood count low, and she was later tested with the other members of the family for H.I.V.         Mrs. Glaser tested positive, and doctors found she had passed the virus to Ariel through her breast milk. She had also given the virus to her son, Jake, during pregnancy. Mr. Glaser remained uninfected.         Jake, now 10, has shown no signs that he has developed AIDS.         In 1988, drawing on connections made through her husband, Mrs. Glaser helped to found the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with two friends, Susan DeLaurentis and Susan Zeegen.         The foundation, working out of a donated room with 14 desks and 12 employees, has raised more than $30 million for pediatric education and research, much of it for the Ariel Project, which is searching for ways to block transmission of AIDS from a mother to her fetus.         The foundation is also studying why some children infected with H.I.V. live longer than others.         After she and her husband first described the family's fight with the virus in a magazine story in 1989, Mrs. Glaser became a public crusader for more Government involvement in AIDS research and prevention. She appeared on "60 Minutes" and on the cover of People magazine. She also testified before Congress.         In 1991, she wrote an autobiography, "In The Absence of Angels" (G. P. Putnam's Sons), with Laura Palmer, describing her frustration with the dearth of information on children suffering from AIDS. The book, which was called "a handbook on how the connected make waves in America" in a review in The New York Times, also detailed how she was able to mobilize legislators like Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who sponsored a benefit in Washington for Mrs. Glaser's fledgling foundation.         While she used her celebrity status to further her work, she also promoted her cause through sheer force of will. She was chosen to speak at the 1992 convention only after confronting Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, Mickey Kantor, now the United States Trade Representative, at a Los Angeles picnic, and telling him, "I have words inside me that I have to share."         Elizabeth Glaser was born in New York City and raised in Hewlett Harbor, L.I. She was educated at the University of Wisconsin and at Boston University and worked as a teacher and as a director at the Los Angeles Children's Museum.         She is survived by her husband and son; by her parents, Edith and Max Meyer of Sarasota, Fla., and by a brother, Peter, of Worcester, Mass.

         Janet Oppenheim, a historian on aspects of 19th-century British life like psychological depression, the condition of women and sex roles and stereotypes, died on Friday at Bryn Mawr Hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 46 and lived in Villanova, Pa.         The cause was cancer, said her mother, Elaine Oppenheim.         At her death, Dr. Oppenheim was a professor of history at American University in Washington, where she had taught since 1975.         Her latest book is "Shattered Nerves: Doctors, Patients and Depression in Victorian England" (Oxford, 1991). Praising the work in The New Republic, the author Alfred Kazin wrote, "The scholarship is remarkably full, meticulous and far-reaching." And the Stanford University historian Peter Stansky called it "a fascinating study" that "tells us much about the age itself, its preoccupations and obsessions."         In a 1987 interview, Professor Oppenheim said some feminist historians had suggested that Victorian women had been especially prone to mental and emotional illness because of the confining nature of their lives. But, she said, "for every woman who collapsed in such an illness, there were scores, maybe even hundreds, who soldiered on against the same restrictions and the same limitations on their lives."         Among Professor Oppenheim's other books was "The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914" (Cambridge, 1985), which the journal Victorian Studies called "a major contribution to the history of ideas."         Courses that Professor Oppenheim taught at American University included "Men and Women in Victorian Culture: Gender Roles and Stereotypes" and "Selected Topics on the Condition of Women in Victorian England." She was a visiting professor at Princeton University in 1979 and Bryn Mawr College in 1986, and a Guggenheim Fellow in 1988.         Professor Oppenheim was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Brearley School there and, in 1970, from Bryn Mawr College, where she was summa cum laude. She received a Ph.D. in history from Columbia University in 1975.         In addition to her mother, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, John Salmon, a retired Bryn Mawr history professor; a daughter by a previous marriage, Ashley Minihan of Villanova, and a sister, Barbara Berresford of Manhattan.
