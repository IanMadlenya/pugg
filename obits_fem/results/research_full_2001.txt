         Dr. Dorothy M. Horstmann, an epidemiologist, virologist, polio pioneer and the first woman appointed as a professor at the Yale School of Medicine, died on Jan. 11 in New Haven. She was 89.         She had Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. I. George Miller, a colleague and professor of virology at Yale.         Dr. Horstmann died as the World Health Organization was on the verge of eradicating polio and four days after the death of Dr. Joseph L. Melnick of Houston, another polio pioneer with whom she worked and wrote scholarly papers.         Dr. Horstmann made significant scientific, educational and public health contributions, and her major scientific achievement was showing that the polio virus reached the brain by way of the blood, a finding that upset dogma and helped make polio vaccines possible.         ''The widely held feeling that the virus grew solely in nerve cells had to be set aside,'' said Dr. John F. Enders, who won a Nobel Prize for developing a technique that allowed the polio virus to be grown in cells.         At the time, scientists believed that the polio virus directly attacked the nervous system because efforts to isolate the virus from the blood of paralyzed patients had failed. The reason they failed became apparent when Dr. Horstmann's team detected the polio virus in the blood of infected monkeys and chimpanzees before signs of paralysis appeared. They found that by the time paralysis developed, antibodies had eliminated the polio virus from the blood.         At Dr. Horstmann's 70th birthday party, Dr. Enders said that ''obviously, the disease behaved like many viral infections'' and that ''everyone was relieved to find that poliomyelitis was not an exceptionally bizarre disease, but similar to others.''         Dr. Horstmann's work contributed to the licensing of an oral polio vaccine developed by Dr. Albert B. Sabin from live, weakened virus. The vaccine was tested among millions of people in what was then the Soviet Union. But in 1959, Western scientists were skeptical about the favorable findings reported by Russian, Polish and Czech health workers.         The World Health Organization then asked Dr. Horstmann to study the incidence of polio in the vaccinated areas. She guardedly concluded that the findings were reliable and that the Sabin vaccine was safe and effective. The United States and other countries then licensed it.         Dorothy Millicent Horstmann was born in Spokane, Wash., on July 2, 1911. She earned her undergraduate degree from the University of California at Berkeley and her medical degree in 1940 from the University of California at San Francisco.         It was a time when doctors were first using sulfa drugs to cure pneumonia. Dr. Horstmann said that the combination of that drug advance, lectures by the renowned microbiologist Dr. Karl F. Meyer and her experience with patients during her internship and residency at San Francisco County Hospital piqued her interest in infectious diseases.         Dr. Horstmann spent an additional year training at Vanderbilt University in Nashville and, in 1942, she went to Yale to perform research under Dr. John R. Paul for a year before becoming a specialist in internal medicine. During a polio epidemic in New Haven in 1943, Dr. Horstmann pitched in. She joined the Yale poliomyelitis unit, and soon decided to devote her career to various aspects of infectious agents.         Dr. Horstmann became a pediatrician at midcareer. In 1961 she received her professorship at Yale, and in 1969 she became the first woman to receive an endowed chair there. It was in epidemiology and pediatrics and named for her mentor, Dr. Paul.         She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and was the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.         Dr. Horstmann is survived by a nephew, Paul Rooney, of Ashland, Ore.       
         Helen Coley Nauts, who devoted her life to championing the once-neglected cancer-treatment discoveries of her father and founded a cancer institute, died at home last Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 93.         Mrs. Nauts was the daughter of Dr. William B. Coley, a surgeon and cancer specialist who, trying to help seriously ill patients for whom he had been able to do nothing, hit on the idea of injecting them with a mixture of live bacteria. The goal was to goad the body into producing its own defenses against cancer.         Dr. Coley, who practiced at what became the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, recorded many cures with bacteria injection, but his successes were not easily replicated and could not be explained. The method came to be dismissed by much of the medical establishment as unproven, even quackery, and was eventually overshadowed by radiation and chemotherapy.         After her father died in 1936, Mrs. Nauts, who was at home raising two daughters, decided to go through his papers to write his biography. As she did, she came across many records of seriously ill cancer patients who, after being injected with what are still referred to as ''Coley's toxins,'' appeared to have recovered.         Convinced that medicine was overlooking a powerful tool -- and, perhaps more important, her associates say, incensed at the aspersions the medical establishment had cast on her father and his work -- Mrs. Nauts embarked on a crusade. In 1953, she established the Cancer Research Institute, which now has an annual budget of $14 million and provides support for scientists around the world. She eventually succeeded in returning her father's work to the attention of oncologists.         ''She was inflamed,'' said Dr. Lloyd J. Old, an immunotherapy expert at Sloan-Kettering and a longtime friend. ''She was absolutely inflamed by a grand idea.''         Dr. Coley is now often described as the founder of modern immunotherapy, a major cancer treatment. Although Coley's toxins are rarely used, his discoveries of the late 19th century are credited with helping researchers develop more modern therapies. And Mrs. Nauts has received many awards for her work.         The theory that the body's defenses can be brought to bear in the fight against disease was not new when William Coley began putting them into practice. The concept dates to antiquity. But Dr. Coley was one of the first to use bacteria to fight cancer systematically and, at least by the medical standards of his day, methodically.         He got the idea after learning of a cancer patient with a sometimes fatal skin infection, not uncommon among surgery patients then. The patient survived the infection but his cancer had fared less well; it seemed to have disappeared. After finding similar cases in the records, Dr. Coley set out to develop a cancer vaccine made from bacteria.         Despite his successes and initially positive reactions from colleagues, Dr. Coley was never able to win broad support for his treatment and, according to a 1984 article in Science magazine, died a disappointed man.         Helen Lancaster Coley, his daughter with his wife, the former Alice Lancaster, was born Sept. 2, 1907, in Sharon, Conn., and was raised in New York City. She attended the Brearley School in Manhattan and Miss Porter's in Farmington, Conn., then studied landscape architecture for a time at Columbia. But she came from a milieu and a time in which she was not expected to pursue a career. Her husband, William Boone Nauts, who died about a decade ago, was a banker, and Mrs. Nauts raised her children, did volunteer work and some landscape design.         All that changed after her father's death, when she began poring over 15,000 letters and other records stored in a barn in Sharon. Dr. Coley had been a clinician, not a researcher, and the task of giving order to the papers was monumental.         About two years later, Mrs. Nauts went to the medical director of Dr. Coley's hospital and said she thought that her father's work deserved reappraisal. Her best course of action, she was told, was to put together 100 or so case histories; she eventually produced 1,000, along the way educating herself about cancer. She was so precise that cancer researchers today still examine the monographs she published for clues about the disease, Dr. Old said.         In an interview with Science, Mrs. Nauts described a meeting with a Mount Sinai Hospital bacteriologist, Dr. Gregory Shwartzman, with whom her father had corresponded.         ''I had read Shwartzman's book on the reaction of tumors to bacteria, and had prepared 13 pages of questions based on it,'' Mrs. Nauts recalled. ''During the interview, I took 80 pages of notes. Shwartzman couldn't believe anyone could be that thorough. But because I had no medical education, I had to be that way.''         In the years that followed, Mrs. Nauts wrote thousands of letters to doctors and patients who had used her husband's methods, seeking specifics about their cases. Her efforts were not always welcomed by the medical establishment.         ''At times the response to her could be described as vitriolic,'' said Dr. Alan M. Houghton, chairman of immunotherapy at Sloan-Kettering. But Mrs. Nauts was unyielding, and as the field of immunotherapy grew, researchers recognized the value of Dr. Coley's once-ignored work.         Even some admirers say she may have lost perspective at times. And family members -- Mrs. Nauts is survived by two daughters, Phyllis Lancaster Nauts of Cornwall, Conn., and New York, and Nancy Nauts Dobbs of the British Virgin Islands and Bali, Indonesia -- said her crusade could be hard on her family.         ''We felt she spent much too much time,'' Mrs. Dobbs said. ''I remember once saying to her, 'Mommy, let's play.' And she said, 'I can't play, because people are dying when I'm not working.' ''       
         G. E. M. Anscombe, a British moral and analytic philosopher as well as one of Wittgenstein's literary executors, died on Jan. 5 in Cambridge, England. She was 81 and had chronic heart disease, said her husband, Peter Geach.         Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe -- known by her initials or as Elizabeth -- was a dry, fresh and formidable thinker, one of the foremost philosophers of mind, language, ethics and action. She fused Wittgenstein's philosophy of language and Aristotle's philosophy of ethics, framing an original theory of action.         Her work was tightly linked with Wittgenstein's. She was Wittgenstein's student and friend during World War II.         In 1951, when Wittgenstein died, Miss Anscombe, along with Wittgenstein's two other executors, Rush Rhees and G.H. von Wright, began the task of getting his work into print. (''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,'' which came out in 1921, was Wittgenstein's only book published in his lifetime.)         Miss Anscombe translated Wittgenstein's ''Philosophical Investigations'' from German into English, and had it published in 1953. Her translation of his work called ''Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics'' came out in 1956. With Mr. von Wright, she assembled little bits of Wittgenstein's writings that had been cut up and stuffed in a box, and published them under the title ''Zettel'' (''Snippets'') in 1967.         Miss Anscombe and Mr. von Wright also put together ''Notebooks, 1914-1916.'' Editions of Wittgenstein's ''On Certainty,'' ''Remarks on Colour'' and ''Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology'' followed.         In 1959, Miss Anscombe wrote ''An Introduction to Wittgenstein's ''Tractatus,'' which traced his work to Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. The book is viewed as a classic by philosophers.         A. J. Ayer, in his book ''Wittgenstein,'' wrote, ''I can think of no one but Elizabeth Anscombe who has made an original contribution to philosophy on the basis of Wittgenstein's teaching.'' In 1980, Miss Anscombe even inherited Wittgenstein's former position, the chair of philosophy at Cambridge University.         Wittgenstein was not her sole influence. She also wrote about Plato. And in the field of ethics, Miss Anscombe looked especially to Aristotle. Like Aristotle, she believed that ethics must be tied to the idea of what it means to flourish as a human being. Mr. Geach, her husband and sometime collaborator, a professor of philosophy at the University of Birmingham and University of Leeds, put it this way: ''She thought that a theory of ethics without a theory of mind was bound to be bogus.''         In 1957 she wrote ''Intention,'' a blend of Aristotle's and Wittgenstein's philosophy, linking ethical ideas and behavior to a theory of intention and action. The philosopher Donald Davidson recently called the work ''the most important treatment of action since Aristotle.'' Her husband said that may have been an overstatement.         The next year she wrote an influential essay on morality, ''Modern Moral Philosophy,'' which was later published in her three-volume ''Collected Philosophical Papers'' (1981). In that essay, as Cora Diamond, a professor at the University of Virginia, explained, Miss Anscombe argued that the concepts of moral obligation and moral beauty were legalistic and should be abandoned. Right and wrong actions, Miss Anscombe said, cannot be determined by their consequences but rather are absolutes. She recommended Aristotle's concept of virtue instead.         In 1940, Miss Anscombe converted to Catholicism, and many of her writings reflected her moral and religious stance. In a 1939 pamphlet, ''The Justice of the Present War Examined,'' she had argued that Britain was entering an unjust war.         In ''Mr. Truman's Degree,'' she fought Oxford's decision to give an honorary degree to Harry S. Truman, accusing him of murdering innocents in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.         She condemned contraception in a pamphlet called ''Contraception and Chastity'' (1975), saying ''you might as well accept any sexual goings-on, if you accept contraceptive intercourse.''         In 1957, in an anti-Cartesian paper called ''The First Person,'' she said that ''I'' does not refer to anything.  And in 1985 she resurrected St. Anselm's 900-year-old argument for the existence of God.         G. E. M. Anscombe was born March 18, 1919, the daughter of Allen Wells Anscombe and Gertrude Elizabeth Thomas Anscombe. One of her two brothers was killed in the war. His twin, Thomas, survives Miss Anscombe. She was educated at Sydenham School and St. Hugh's College, Oxford.         At Newnham College, Cambridge, she was a research student from 1941 to 1944. That was where she first met Wittgenstein. She taught at Somerville College, Oxford, from 1946 to 1970. From 1970 to 1986, she was a professor of philosophy at Cambridge. She became a fellow of the British Academy in 1967 and an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.         Miss Anscombe and her husband were a well-known philosophical duo. They met while studying Catholic doctrine at Blackfriars College, Oxford. They were married in 1941 and had seven children, all of whom survive her: three sons (John, Charles and More) and four daughters (Barbara, Mary, Jennifer and Tamsin). Miss Anscombe and Mr. Geach also produced a book together, ''Three Philosophers''; he wrote on Aquinas and Frege, she on Aristotle.         Miss Anscombe, who did not like to be called Mrs. Geach, smoked cigars, wore trousers when they were considered improper for women and was said sometimes to eat beans from a tin can while lecturing.         Her philosophy was bold and noncomplacent too. In the Times Literary Supplement, the critic Mary Tiles wrote, ''Anscombe's willingness to question what many have taken for granted . . . can induce a feeling of intellectual disorientation.''       
         Dr. Donella Hager Meadows, an author, educator and advocate for the environment, died Tuesday at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. She was 59 and lived in Hartland Four Corners, N.H.         The cause was bacterial meningitis, said Prof. Jack E. Shepherd Jr., a friend and colleague at Dartmouth, where she was an adjunct professor of environmental sciences.         Dr. Meadows, known as Dana, was a MacArthur Fellow and the lead author of ''The Limits of Growth: A Report for the Club of Rome's Project on the Predicament of Mankind,'' published in 1972. The book delivered a simple message: either civilization or growth must end.         The book stated that continued population and industrial growth would exhaust the world's minerals and steep the planet in lethal levels of pollution.         If trends continued unchanged, the authors said, the limits of growth would be reached within 100 years. They urged ''deliberate checks'' on economic and population growth.         Their thesis was sharply disputed at the time, but the book sold nine million copies and was translated into 28 languages. It was produced by an interdisciplinary team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and financed by the Club of Rome, an international research organization that studies ''the complex of problems troubling men of all nations,'' like poverty, alienated youth and monetary disruptions.         In 1992, she and her co-authors, Jorgen Randers and Dr. Dennis L. Meadows, her former husband, published an update, ''Beyond the Limits: Confronting Global Collapse, Envisioning a Sustainable Future.''         Based partly on new computer simulations, the book warned that unless human activity changed, humans would ''overshoot'' the carrying capacity of the planet in decades.         Both books remain in print, as does a selection from ''The Global Citizen,'' the weekly syndicated column she wrote.         Dana Meadows was born in Elgin, Ill., and graduated from Carleton College in Minnesota in 1963. She received a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard University in 1968.         She was a researcher in the Department of Nutrition at M.I.T. when ''The Limits of Growth'' report was written.         She later taught and researched at centers in Hawaii, Austria and Norway. In 1972, she joined an interdisciplinary program at Dartmouth, the Resource Policy Center, rising to associate professor.         She and her former husband founded the International Network of Research Information Centers, in which they organized training programs and workshops in resource management in Europe, Central America, Africa, Asia and the United States. In 1994, the John D. and Catherine MacArthur Foundation, known for its ''genius grants,'' selected her for a fellowship and awarded her  $320,000 over five years.         Dr. Meadows is survived by her parents, Phebe Quist of Tahlequah, Okla., and Don Hager of Palatine, Ill.; and a brother, Jason Hager of Waterford, Wis. Her former husband lives in Durham, N.H.         Correction:  March 17, 2001, Saturday  An obituary of the author and environmentalist Donella Meadows on Feb. 22 misidentified her home state. Her town, Hartland Four Corners, is in Vermont, not New Hampshire.       
         Sylvia Lawry, whose brother's incurable multiple sclerosis prompted her to found national and international organizations to fight the disease, died on Saturday at Bird S. Coler Hospital on Roosevelt Island. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Lawry founded both the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the United States, in 1946, and the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, in 1967. She was also one of the leaders of the effort to establish the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, in 1950.         It all began with a classified advertisement in 1945 in which Ms. Lawry beseeched readers to write her of any cures for multiple sclerosis. Instead, she got more than 50 replies asking for the same thing. Her life's mission was the result.         Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system. Its onslaught is signaled by sudden neurological symptoms, including loss of vision, paralysis, numbness and difficulties in walking, as nerves lose their sheathing and are unable to conduct signals.         Partly as a result of research financed by the societies started by Ms. Lawry, scientists now suspect that the disease may be caused by a viral infection on top of an inherited genetic susceptibility, though the specific triggering mechanism remains unknown.         The national society has also helped develop medicines to alleviate symptoms and prolong life expectancy, essentially offering a normal life span to many with multiple sclerosis. In 1890, when multiple sclerosis was treated with herbs and bed rest, life expectancy was five years.  But there is still no cure for the disease, which the society says strikes another adult each hour, leaving the most afflicted paralyzed.         ''Sylvia's uncompromising battle for more than a half century to solve the mystery of multiple sclerosis made her a hero to anyone touched by this devastating disease,'' said Richard Slifka, chairman of the society.         The national society credited her with the first use of the abbreviation M.S. for the disease. The Oxford English Dictionary cites as the first use of the term a 1955 article in Science News Letter discussing work by the society.         Sylvia Friedman was born in Brooklyn on June 28, 1915. Her father manufactured Venetian blinds. She graduated from Hunter College in 1936 and went to work in the office of her father's attorney as a receptionist. She hoped to go to law school and took a job in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.         In 1944, she married Michael Lawry; they were divorced two years later. She used the last name Lawry for the rest of her life, though she married Stanley Englander, who was in the wholesale meat business, in 1957. He died in 1968.         When Ms. Lawry's brother, Bernard, was stricken with multiple sclerosis in 1945, she and her sister Alice placed a classified advertisement in The New York Times: ''Multiple sclerosis. Will anyone recovered from it please communicate with patient. T272 Times.''         The sisters received 54 replies from people as desperate as they were. Most asked to be informed if the two heard anything promising.         ''I was looking for medical clues that might have helped my brother,'' Ms. Lawry said in an interview with The New York Post in 1959. ''But when the responses started to snowball and come from all over the country, I decided to give up the law and let my creative energies spill over into helping M.S. victims.''         Starting with family and friends, Ms. Lawry built a network. Her sister Alice helped. Her other sister, Lillian, and her husband, Stanley Wilson, founded one of the first local chapters, in the Bronx.         Ms. Lawry is survived by Lillian Wilson, who lives in Spring Valley, N.Y.; two sons, Frank Englander of Manhattan, and Steven Englander of Montgomery, N.Y., and two grandchildren.         The fight against multiple sclerosis grew. A tiny office was found. The doctors whom Ms. Lawry first consulted about her brother became interested in the effort.         Dee Sammak, the accounts payable manager who has worked for the society since 1954, said she has stayed all these years because of the inspiration of Ms. Lawry. ''Don't forget,'' Ms. Sammak said, ''when she started the society, women were not doing these things -- to start a society in a man's world.''         On March 11, 1946, Ms. Lawry assembled 20 prominent research scientists to found the Association for Advancement of Research in Multiple Sclerosis, which was renamed the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1947. Its first research grant went toward studying the relationship between the body's immune system and the effects of multiple sclerosis on the central nervous system.         Though her brother's health progressively weakened until his death in 1973, the organization Ms. Lawry founded gathered momentum. In 1950, she teamed up with Senator Charles Tobey of New Hampshire, whose daughter had multiple sclerosis, to lobby Congress for what is now the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.         The law creating the institute passed on Aug. 15, 1950. At that time, total federal appropriations for research on multiple sclerosis were $14,000. They now total $100 million a year, the society said.         Ms. Lawry's political skills were evident throughout her career. A frequent tactic, she told CNN in 1995, was to lobby people who had relatives or acquaintances with the disease. She mentioned winning support from President John F. Kennedy, who had a cousin with the disease, and Grace Kelly, whose first fiancé had it.         The international organization was born after the national society realized it was giving almost one-third of its research grants to foreigners. There are now 38 societies around the world.         Ms. Lawry, who worked 12-hour days, said she would never retire until multiple sclerosis retired. The disease still affects 1 in 1,000 people in the United States.         ''There was a continuing pain in her heart, because what she really wanted to see was M.S. go the way of polio,'' said Arney Rosenblat, a society spokeswoman.       
         Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the lyrical author and aviator whose marriage to Charles A. Lindbergh brought her both joy and tragedy, died yesterday at her home in Passumpsic, Vt. She was 94.         Their daughter Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her 1998 memoir ''Under a Wing'' (Simon & Schuster) that her mother had suffered adverse effects from her advancing age and from strokes and was ''often confused in her mind, and in fragile health.''         Anne Morrow Lindbergh scored an immense literary success in midlife with her 1955 book ''Gift From the Sea'' ( Pantheon), which was a philosophical meditation on women's lives in this century. It was on the nonfiction best-seller list of The New York Times for 80 weeks and was No. 1 for 47 of those weeks. In the book's first 20 years in print, more than five million copies were sold in hard-cover and paperback editions.         Mrs. Lindbergh was the author of more than two dozen books of prose and poetry, including five volumes of diaries; her work was often acclaimed by critics and popular with readers. Despite the literary distinction that she achieved, her life was largely shaped by two dramatic experiences when she was in her 20's. One was blissful, one was anguished. They were reflected in the title of a volume of her diaries: ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead'' (1973, Harcourt, Brace).         The first experience came in 1927 when Anne Morrow, then a 21-year-old senior at Smith College, arrived for the Christmas holidays in Mexico City, where her well-to-do father, Dwight W. Morrow, was the American ambassador.         'He Is Taller Than Anyone Else'         There she met Charles Lindbergh, whose courageous solo flight across the Atlantic had made him a hero of mythic proportions and the most famous man in the world. He was staying with her family, and the sight of the boyish aviator tugged at her heartstrings.         ''He is taller than anyone else,'' she wrote in her diary. ''You see his head in a moving crowd, and you notice his glance, where it turns, as though it were keener, clearer and brighter than anyone else's, lit with a more intense fire. What could I say to this boy? Anything I might say would be trivial and superficial, like pink frosting flowers. I felt the whole world before this to be frivolous, superficial, ephemeral.''         Two years later the man known as Lucky Lindy married the shy, literary Miss Morrow. The glamorous Lindberghs were seldom out of the news as they made pioneering flights to Latin America and Asia, becoming ''the First Couple of the Skies.'' As the critic Alfred Kazin observed, ''To millions around the world -- reading of the Lindberghs flying everywhere in their own Lockheed Sirius seaplane, looking at photographs of the 'perfect'-looking couple ('the Lone Eagle and his mate') landing in Siberia, China, Japan -- the Lindberghs seemed to enjoy the greatest possible good fortune that a young couple could have.''         But that second experience came four years later, on the evening of March 1, 1932, in Hopewell, N.J., where the Lindberghs were at home with their 20-month-old son, Charles Jr., and a nurse, Betty Gow. The nurse looked in now and then on Charlie as he slept in his crib.         ''At 10 Betty went in to the baby, shut the window, then lit the electric stove, then turned to the bed; it was empty, and the sides still up,'' Mrs. Lindbergh wrote later in a letter to her mother-in-law. At first Miss Gow  thought Lindbergh had taken his son from the crib for a joke, Mrs. Lindbergh continued, adding poignantly, ''I did, until I saw his face.'' Lindbergh, looking down at his diminutive wife, said, ''Anne, they have stolen our baby.''         The Lindberghs were soon enveloped in the horror of the kidnapping, the discovery of the child's body on May 12, more than 10 weeks later, and the subsequent arrest, trial, conviction and execution of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a carpenter, for Charlie's murder in 1936.         They had always been ''intensely private persons with an austere, restrained, glowingly creative sense of life,'' Mr. Kazin wrote. Both had a fear of crowds and nothing, even Lindbergh's 1927 landing in Paris, had prepared them for the carnival of reporters, photographers, con artists, curiosity-seekers, vandals and  crazy people who had invaded their lives after their baby was kidnapped. Americans would not experience a similar flood of publicity until the O. J. Simpson murder trial of the 1990's.         The Literary Career She Always Wanted         Mrs. Lindbergh would never get over her child's death but she went on to bear five more children and to have the literary career she had dreamed of. The historian Geoffrey C. Ward wrote in 1998 that '''Gift From the Sea' became a source of inspiration for a whole generation of wives and mothers -- 'the great vacationless class,' she called them -- who, like herself, were beginning to search for more fulfilling lives once their children had grown and moved away.''         Mrs. Lindbergh echoed many women's concerns with observations like this: ''What a circus act we women perform every day of our lives. Look at us. We run a tightrope daily, balancing a pile of books on the head. Baby-carriage, parasol, kitchen chair, still under control. Steady now! This is not the life of simplicity but the life of multiplicity that the wise men warn us of. It leads not to unification but to fragmentation. It does not bring grace; it destroys the soul.''         Lewis Gannett wrote that her 1938 best seller, ''Listen! The Wind,'' had ''caught the poetry of flight in a web of words as no other book on flying has yet contrived to do.'' Alfred Kazin admired her as ''a lyricist of action.''         Millions of Americans respected  Mrs. Lindbergh,too. The readers of Good Housekeeping magazine voted her one of their 10 most admired women in 1975, when she was 69 and had a flock of grandchildren . This admiration was expressed over and over during her long life -- notably by letter-writers at the time of the kidnapping. And after the poet John Ciardi reviewed ''The Unicorn and Other Poems'' (Random House) in The Saturday Review and called her poetry ''inept, jingling, slovenly, illiterate,'' the magazine was soon rocked by what its editor, Norman Cousins, called ''the biggest storm of reader protest in our 33-year history'' -- most of it from Mrs. Lindbergh's female admirers.         The respect for Mrs. Lindbergh also survived bitter controversy over her 1940 book ''The Wave of the Future,'' a short, hazy manifesto, written while World War II raged in Europe. She wrote that she did not endorse communism or fascism, but that she saw them as inevitable effects of what she called the ''wave of the future.'' She also said she hoped the United States could avoid entering the conflict. And, in a letter, she wrote that she was beginning to feel that Hitler was ''a very great man, like an inspired religious leader -- and as such rather fanatical -- but not scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power.''         'Both Very Blind In the Beginning         ''The Wave of the Future'' was widely criticized when it appeared. Rabbi Abraham D. Shaw of Baltimore, for example, said in a speech in 1941 to a gathering of the Union of American of American Hebrew Congregations that it was the epitome of defeatism, and that in it Mrs. Lindbergh had counseled surrender to what he called the ''anti-religious, anti-ethical hordes.''         In later years, Walter S. Ross wrote in his 1967 biography ''The Last Hero: Charles A. Lindbergh'' that the book ''took so astral a view of the world that it made the crimes of the Nazis seem to bulk no larger than the inadequacies'' of the democracies.'' Some friends said they thought Mrs. Lindbergh had written the book at least partly to please her husband, who at that time was an ardent advocate of the United States' staying out of the war.         Mrs. Lindbergh herself later acknowledged that she and her husband had been ''both very blind, especially in the beginning, to the worst evils of the Nazi system.'' But she said that she had warned him that he would offend many Americans with an isolationist speech that he prepared to give in September 1941 in Des Moines, in which he warned Jews of retribution for being among the leading ''war agitators'' along with the British and the Roosevelt Administration. Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her book that years later her mother told her: ''If only he had listened to me. I told him what would happen if he listed 'interventionist' groups in that way . . . 'the British,' 'the Roosevelt Administration,' and 'the Jews.' I told him he would be called anti-Semitic.''         Mrs. Lindbergh recalled that he replied, ''But I'm not!'' and that she said: '' 'It doesn't matter. That's what will happen.' But he didn't believe me.''         When he gave the speech, he said: ''The leaders of both the British and Jewish races, for reasons which are understandable from their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the war. We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to be their own interests, but we also must look out for ours. We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of other peoples to lead our country to destruction.''         Later Mrs. Lindbergh wrote in her diary: ''He is attacked on all sides, Administration, pressure groups, and Jews, as now openly a Nazi, following a Nazi doctrine.''         In her diary volume called ''War Within and Without'' (1980), she said she experienced a ''profound feeling of grief'' over what her husband had said and decided it was ''at best unconsciously a bid for anti-Semitism. It is a match lit near a pile of excelsior.''         Some friends said that the above-the-battle stance that she evidenced in ''The Last Wave'' and in other writing -- her diaries during the mid-'30's made scant mention of the large political and social questions of the day -- was a reflection, in part, of her privileged, sheltered upbringing.         Anne Spencer Morrow was born on June 22, 1906, in Englewood, N.J. Her father became a multimillionaire partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company, who went on to become a Republican Senator from New Jersey. Her mother was Elizabeth Reeve Cutter Morrow, an educator and poet who was Smith College's acting president in 1939 and 1940 and who publicly criticized her daughter and son-in-law for their America First views.         Young Anne attended Miss Chapin's School in Manhattan, where her family maintained an apartment, and went on to Smith, where she won two literary prizes before she graduated in 1928. When she met Lindbergh, she was an intensely shy and romantic woman, only a bit over 5 feet tall, with grave blue eyes and a demure, schoolgirlish manner.         ''To be deeply in love is, of course, a great liberating force,'' she observed in the introduction to ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead.'' ''The sheer fact of finding myself loved was unbelievable and changed my world, my feelings about life and myself. I was given confidence, strength and almost a new character. The man I was to marry believed in me and what I could do, and consequently I found I could do more than I realized, even in that mysterious outer world that fascinated me but seemed unattainable. He opened the door to 'real life,' and though it frightened me, it also beckoned. I had to go.''         Mrs. Lindbergh wrote that before her marriage she had seen her husband-to-be more or less as ''a knight in shining armor, with myself as his devoted page.''         Was this a good basis for marriage? ''Hardly,'' she concluded. ''But it was a role I could play until I grew up. It was not a bad beginning.''         In 1929 the young couple were wed in a simple Protestant service in the drawing room of the Morrow family's hilltop manor in Englewood.  Just before the wedding began, Lindbergh strode out into the garden and picked a bouquet of larkspur and columbine for his bride to carry. Their marriage was the lead story on the front page of The New York Times and newspapers all over the world.         For their honeymoon the couple cruised to Maine in Lindbergh's motor launch, and the traveling continued in the first years of their marriage. Mrs. Lindbergh went with her husband, who was active in commercial aviation and scientific research, on many aerial journeys to Europe, to Asia, and to the Caribbean, where he was charting airplane routes.         She learned to navigate, to operate a radio, to pilot a plane. In 1930 she became the first woman to get a glider pilot's license in the United States. That same year she was co-pilot and navigator when her husband broke the transatlantic speed record. In 1934 she became the first woman to to receive the Hubbard Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society. Her first book, ''North to the Orient'' (Harcourt Brace), which became a best seller in 1935, was an account of one of their aerial voyages.         After living in a farmhouse in Princeton, the Lindberghs moved into a house that they had built on a 400-acre tract of land in the remote borough of Hopewell, near Trenton. It was there that their child was kidnapped. ''Everything is telescoped now into one moment, one of those eternal moments -- the moment when I realized that the baby had been taken,'' she wrote in her diary. In that ''first flash of horror,'' she wrote, she had seen in her mind's eye ''the baby dead, killed violently.''         ''Everything since then has been unreal,'' she continued. ''It has all vanished like smoke. Only that eternal moment remains. I feel strangely a sense of peace -- not peace, but an end to restlessness, a finality, as though I were sleeping in a grave.''         The hysteria and confusion attached to ''the Crime of the Century''  included weeks of negotiation with the kidnapper, the unavailing delivery of $50,000 in ransom money at a Bronx cemetery and many sensations and false leads. The baby's body was discovered in some nearby woods; he had been killed by a blow on the head soon after the kidnapping. Eventually, Mr. Hauptmann was traced through a banknote that had been part of the ransom. He was put on trial in Flemington, N.J., and Mrs. Lindbergh went on the witness stand for the prosecution to identify a flannel shirt -- made from an old petticoat of hers -- that had been found on the murdered baby. Tears brimmed in her eyes, but she never lost her composure.         After the trial, the Lindberghs tried to go on living in the United States, but there were threats on the life of their second child, a son named Jon, who was born on Aug. 16, 1932, and other harassments, largely from cranks and aggressive reporters. Late in 1935 the Lindberghs moved to England to seek escape from what Lindbergh called the ''tremendous public hysteria'' that surrounded him in the United States. On May 12, 1937, their third child, a boy named Land was born in a London nursing home, where Mrs. Lindbergh had registered under an assumed name.         She accompanied her husband on his visits to aviation-industry plants in France and in Nazi Germany. But she was not present at a stag dinner in 1938 at the American Embassy in Berlin, when Hermann Göring, whom Hitler had named Air Minister in 1933, presented Lindbergh with a high German decoration.         Mr. Ross, the Lindbergh biographer, wrote that when, after the dinner, Lindbergh showed the medal-box to his wife, ''she opened it and glanced at the medal and looked away. Then she said, without the slightest trace of emotion, 'the Albatross.''' She was right. Lindbergh was widely criticized in the United States for having accepted a medal from the Nazi Government.         In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the Lindberghs moved back to the United States, where Lindbergh's isolationist pronouncements made him widely unpopular. Mrs. Lindbergh accompanied her husband to gatherings of isolationists and did not take public exception to his views. She said later that he had been ''used'' by the Nazis but that he had been genuinely ''astonished and impressed by the rapid growth of German air power,'' while also recognizing the danger it posed.         A. Scott Berg's 1998 biography of her husband, ''Lindbergh'' (Putnam), which drew on previously inaccessible family papers provided by Mrs. Lindbergh, showed that she was more aware of the flaws in Charles Lindbergh's character than had been thought. Mr. Berg reported problems in Mrs. Lindbergh's marriage that were painful for her, among them her husband's frequent absences, his bossiness, argumentativeness and emotional remoteness. After the birth of each of their six children, Mr. Berg wrote, Lindbergh would take his wife away on long plane journeys, some lasting weeks, as a way of ''weaning'' her from her children. He was angry at her displays of emotion (even after the kidnapping and murder of their child), and he would scold her if she complained she was having trouble with her writing.         Summing up, Mr. Berg wrote that the couple's relationship was ''a complex case history of control and repression, filled with joy and passion and grief and rage.'' He said in a 1998 interview that there was no doubt that Lindbergh ''deeply loved his wife and children, but that love manifested itself in unusual ways. It's ironic that it was Lindbergh who fostered his own wife's feminism. He very much wanted her to stand on her own two feet and, in helping her do so, created so much independence that it almost separated them.''         Falling in Love With Other Men         In the summer of 1939, Mr. Berg wrote, Mrs. Lindbergh, ''living less with Charles than through him, only knew that she was feeling incomplete and unfulfilled -- and mildly depressed.'' And then she, ''most unexpectedly, found inspiration, and even more, as she fell in love with another man.'' The man was Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the renowned French aviator-author, who visited the Lindberghs at their house in Lloyd Neck, N.Y. Mrs. Lindbergh and Saint-Exupéry talked in French, just the two of them, for hours. She was thrilled and bewitched when he spoke to her about her writing.         But she did not leave her husband for Saint-Exupéry, who already had both a wife and a paramour. He vanished in 1944 on a reconnaissance mission.         Charles Lindbergh's abhorrence of any display of emotion or weakness took a toll on his family. Mrs. Lindbergh suffered from depression and in defiance of her husband had daily psychotherapy sessions for a time, wrote Susan Hertog, a freelance journalist and photographer, in her biography ''Anne Morrow Lindbergh'' (Doubleday, 1999).         In ''Lindbergh'' Mr. Berg wrote that she became close to Dr. Dana W. Atchley, an internist affiliated with Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, who also had a difficult marriage. ''The friendship of these two longing souls blossomed into a love affair in 1956,'' Mr. Berg wrote, ''and continued for the next few years.''         Mrs. Lindbergh discussed with friends the possibility of a divorce, Mr. Berg reported, but she realized that she did not want one.         They continued to lead lives that were largely sheltered and secretive until Charles Lindbergh, suffering from cancer, died in 1974 at age 72 on the Hawaiian island of Maui. He and his wife were married for 45 years and it was the only enduring relationship of his life. In her later years Mrs. Lindbergh spent much of her time in her secluded house in Darien, Conn., where she edited her diaries and letters for publication. Mrs. Lindbergh's elder daughter, Anne Spencer Lindbergh, who was also a writer, died in 1993. In addition to her daughter Reeve, Mrs. Lindbergh  is survived by her sons Jon, Land and Scott.         Reeve Lindbergh had a baby son who died in 1985 at almost exactly the same age as Anne Morrow Lindbergh's firstborn. Reeve's baby was known as Jonny, and she wrote in her book: ''Jonny too died in the night, and I, like my mother before me, was apart from my son during his last moments. I too thought that the baby was safely asleep in his crib.''         Jonny's death, while he and his mother were staying with Anne Morrow Lindbergh in Connecticut, was caused by ''a seizure related to infant encephalitis,'' his mother wrote. When she went to wake him the next morning, he was dead. His body was already stiff and blue.         Reeve recalled that she and her mother made the necessary emergency telephone calls, and ''Then, because she insisted upon it, my mother and I went and sat together with Jonny's body, in two chairs, next to the crib where he had gone to sleep the night before.''         As they sat, Anne Morrow Lindbergh said: ''I never saw my child's body after he died. I never sat with my son this way.''         Seeking Balance Between Solitude and Communion         Here are some excerpts from Anne Morrow Lindbergh's books ''North to the Orient'' and ''Gift From the Sea'':         All afternoon we had flown over miles and miles of perfectly flat treeless land, mottled with lakes and marshes. Toward evening we came upon a gray glassy lake, bounded by gray bleak shores a little higher than the marshes. And on shore, the only points of accent in that monotonous landscape, stood three or four white houses. This was Baker Lake. We circled over the flagpole . . . the church steeple, and cut across the dull satin water of the lake to the little group of people on shore. As we pushed near the sandy bank I had a closer view of the land, gray again -- no trees, no hills, nothing but gray moss, gray water, and a gray sky. How could anything live there, even animals? For this was the trading post. . . .         My husband switched off the motor. The propeller clicked around idly and stopped. There was no noise except the lapping of our wash against the sand. The group of men on shore, a few white men, and Eskimos in pointed Santa Claus hoods, came forward. The Canadian mounted officer, tall and handsome in his red coat, put out a hand to us. ''We've reserved tickets for the show tonight. I hope you'll come!''         ''What's that?'' said my husband, not knowing whether to laugh or not, as he looked at the four lone houses. Great guffaws from the group.         When I jumped out, the three or four Eskimos drew back. Then two little Eskimo boys came up shyly and followed me about. Their bright eyes shone under their caps as they searched my face and costume curiously.         ''You see,'' explained one of the traders, ''you're the first white woman they've ever seen. There's never been one here before.''  -- From ''North to the Orient''  (1935, Harcourt, Brace)         To be a woman is to have interests and duties, raying out in all directions from the central mother-core, like spokes from the hub of a wheel. The pattern of our lives is essentially circular. We must be open to all points of the compass: husband, children, friends, home, community; stretched out, exposed, sensitive like a spider's web to each breeze that blows, to each call that comes. How difficult for us, then, to achieve a balance in the midst of these contradictory tensions, and yet how necessary for the proper functioning of our lives. How much we need, and how arduous of attainment is that steadiness preached in all rules for holy living. How desirable and how distant is the ideal of the contemplative, artist, or saint -- the inner inviolable core, the single eye.         With a new awareness, both painful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women. I am convinced it has nothing inherently to do, as I once supposed, with chastity or children. It has to do primarily with distractions. The bearing, rearing, feeding and educating of children; the running of a house with its thousand details; human relationships with their myriad pulls -- woman's normal occupations in general run counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life. The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel.         What is the answer? There is no easy answer, no complete answer. I have only clues, shells from the sea. The bare beauty of the channelled whelk tells me that one answer, and perhaps a first step, is in simplification of life, in cutting out some of the distractions. But how? Total retirement is not possible, I cannot shed my responsiblities. I cannot permanently inhabit a desert island. I cannot be a nun in the midst of family life. I would not want to be. The solution for me, surely, is neither in total renunciation of the world, nor in total acceptance of it. I must find a balance somewhere, or an alternating rhythm between these two extremes; a swinging of the pendulum between solitude and communion, between retreat and return. In my periods of retreat, perhaps I can learn something to carry back into my worldly life. I can at least practice for these two weeks the simplification of outward life, as a beginning.  -- From ''Gift From the Sea''  (1955, Pantheon)       
         Debra E. Bernhardt, a labor historian who spearheaded a successful three-year drive to obtain landmark status for Union Square Park in Manhattan, died on Thursday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, said her sister, Andra Bernhardt Ladd.         The head of the Tamiment Library and the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University, Dr. Bernhardt devoted her career to documenting the lives of the largely unsung men and women who built New York City and, day in and day out, nudged it along: sandhogs and seamstresses, pipe fitters and child welfare workers, secretaries and short-order cooks.         She was the author, with Rachel Bernstein, of ''Ordinary People, Extraordinary Lives'' (New York University Press, 2000), a book of photographs and oral histories of working New Yorkers that grew out of an exhibition of the same name at the Museum of the City of New York.         At her death, Dr. Bernhardt was at work on Labor Arts, a Web site devoted to the art and artifacts of working people, scheduled to make its debut in May.         As a public historian, Dr. Bernhardt immersed herself in the kinds of workaday narratives that traditional academic historians, with their eyes trained on the powerful, often overlook. She described her work as ''documenting the undocumented,'' a phrase that neatly encapsulated the particular challenge of public history: how to chronicle the lives of people not in the habit of generating collections of personal papers, boxed and ready for posterity.         But what these people did have was stuff -- leaflets, lapel buttons, picket signs and photographs -- and part of Dr. Bernhardt's job was to persuade them that each of these dusty artifacts was a window on a bygone union election, organizing drive or strike; she would acquire many of them for the Tamiment Library, a research collection devoted to radical movements in the United States from the Civil War onward, as well as for the Wagner Archives, dedicated to labor studies.         ''The dustbin of history is lighter because of her,'' said Miriam Frank, a colleague at N.Y.U.         Debra Ellen Bernhardt was born on May 9, 1953, in Nuremberg, West Germany, where her parents were civilian employees of the United States Army; she was raised in Iron River, Mich., where several members of her Danish-American family worked in the iron mines. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan, a master's from Wayne State University and, in 1988, one of the first doctorates from N.Y.U. in public history.         In conjunction with her dissertation, she produced ''New Yorkers at Work,'' an eight-part series broadcast on National Public Radio. In 1995, Dr. Bernhardt received the John Commerford Award, the highest honor of the New York Labor History Association, and, this year, the Distinguished Service Award from the New York City Central Labor Council.         Dr. Bernhardt is survived by her sister, of Lafayette, La.; her parents, Harold and Marcia Bernhardt, of Iron River; and by her husband, Jonathan Bloom, and her children, Alexander and Sonia, all of Brooklyn.         Despite her professional prominence, Dr. Bernhardt remained intensely proud of her own working-class roots. She sang in the New York City Labor Chorus; her business cards bore the logo of the union shop that printed them, as did her son's bar mitzvah invitations. She was known to her friends as Debs -- shorthand not only for Debra, but also for Eugene V.         And it was largely as a result of Dr. Bernhardt's efforts that in September 1998, Union Square Park was declared a national historic landmark by the National Park Service. The square was the cradle of American labor history -- a perennial home to anarchists, Communists, socialists, unionists and assorted rabble-rousing orators, and the site, in 1882, of what was later recognized as the first Labor Day parade.         ''No one realizes that the eight-hour day was won by working people on these streets, in this park,'' Dr. Bernhardt told The New York Times in 1998, as she sat in Union Square, once ringed by union halls and threadbare left-wing publishers and now by upscale restaurants and chain retailers. ''We wanted to celebrate the fact that ordinary people were able to express their rights to free speech and assembly on this spot.''       
         Ellen J. Hammer, a historian who wrote an influential book about Indochina and Vietnam before the Vietnam War, died on Jan. 28 in New York City. She was 79 and lived in New York City. The cause was lymphoma, the journal Indochina Chronology reported.         Dr. Hammer received a bachelor's degree from Barnard in 1941 and worked for several years on the research staff of the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan.         She earned a doctorate in public law and government from Columbia, where she specialized in international relations. She became known in the early 1950's as an authority on French colonial rule in Indochina. By the mid-60's, she had studied Vietnamese problems in a number of long stays in Vietnam.         As a scholar, ''she was one of the few Americans that got into Vietnam before the American buildup there'' in the mid-60's, said Douglas Pike, a historian and director of research at the Vietnam Center at Texas Tech University.         Mr. Pike, who went to South Vietnam in 1960 as a Foreign Service officer, said Dr. Hammer wrote one of the few books that people arriving in that era found valuable: ''The Struggle for Indochina'' (1954), which examined the struggle for freedom from France.         In a review of a book she wrote in 1987, ''A Death in November: America in Vietnam, 1963,'' Thomas Omestad wrote in The New York Times Book Review, ''The title of this carefully researched book refers to the death of Ngo Dinh Diem, president of South Vietnam from 1955 to 1963, and that of his brother and adviser, Ngo Dinh Nhu.'' The book wove together ''dozens of classified government cables detailing the manipulations of men who held a Kipling-like faith that Vietnam was theirs for the shaping.''         She was ''very loyal personally to Diem,'' Mr. Pike said, and she was bitter about his downfall. Afterward she moved to France and resolved to have nothing to do with the subject. But that did not keep her from writing ''A Death in November.''       
         Wendy A. Rives, director of the often tumultuous psychiatric emergency room at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, died on March 24 at New York University Medical Center. She was 39.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, said her partne, Dr. JoAnn Difede.         As director of the comprehensive psychiatric emergency program at Bellevue, she oversaw the initial evaluation of 7,000 patients a year, about half of whom were admitted for treatment. Dr. Manuel Trujillo, Bellevue's director of psychiatry, said that many of those admitted suffered from two major psychiatric disorders and were among ''the most severely mentally ill patients in the city.''         Dr. Rives was shown in a recent television documentary on HBO, ''Bellevue: Inside/Out.'' It showed her diligence and persistent wit as she continued working despite her worsening condition.         She used her own experience in the treatment of others, said Maryann De Leo, the documentary maker, who spent months watching her work. ''When a medical emergency room nurse asked Wendy to do a consultation on a wman who had breast cancer, Wendy told the nurse: 'Of course she's depressed; that's a healthy response. She's not a psych case; she's got breast cancer.' ''         In 1998, emergency room doctors and nurses signed a petition urging her appointment as head of the section. The housekeeping workers submitted their own petition for her.         Wendy Ann Rives was born on Nov. 1, 1961, in Decatur, Ga. She graduated from the University of Georgia and the Medical College of Georgia, and was trained in psychiatry at Temple University. After service as a chief resident in psychiatry in Philadelphia, she joined Bellevue in 1996.         Her major research interest was suicide prevention. In articles, lectures and expert testimony in court, she asserted that suicide was inherently unpredictable, even if the patient's depression was being treated.         ''The assessment of suicidal patients remains an art and cannot be reduced to a checklist,'' she wrote in 1999 in the journal The Psychiatric Clinics of North America.         Dr. Rives is survived by Dr. Difede and their son, Hal Difede Rives; her parents, Barbara and Hal Rives of Tucker, Ga.; a brother, Jack Rives of Roswell, Ga.; and a sister, Dr. Cathy Rives.       
         Dr. Rosa Susan Penelope Beddington, an experimental biologist whose research produced insights into the way an embryo becomes a fetus in mammals, died on May 18 in Great Tew, Oxfordshire, England. She was 45 and had formerly lived in Edinburgh and London.         The cause was cancer, according to British press reports.         Dr. Beddington, a skilled microsurgeon, was among the first women to be admitted to Brasenose College at Oxford to study medicine, and she soon made embryology her career. Most recently she headed the mammalian development section of the National Institute for Medical Research in London.         Her skill in working on the tiniest embryonic cell structures under the microscope advanced scientific understanding of mammalian development. Dr. Beddington observed how such a cell determines what to grow into and what governs the process that follows.         Dr. Beddington's survivors include her husband, the Rev. Robin A. Denniston.       
         Lillian R. Berkman, a pioneering businesswoman, a collector of Renaissance art and an arts patron involved with many of New York's cultural institutions, died on May 1 at her home in Manhattan. She was 79.         The cause was liver failure.         Ms. Berkman founded the American Tractor Corporation with her first husband, Marc. B. Rojtman, and became one of the first female executives in heavy-equipment manufacturing. She later served on the boards of many corporations, including Allied Stores Corporation and Sterling National Bank. Mr. Rojtman died in 1967.         She was a member of the dean's advisory board at the Harvard Law School, where she established, with her second husband, Jack N. Berkman, the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, a research center on legal issues in the online era.         Her art collection included significant Italian Renaissance paintings as well as 18th- and 19th-century woodblock prints once owned by Frank Lloyd Wright. Among her cultural affiliations, she was a fellow at the Morgan Library, the Frick Collection and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was an advisory director of the Metropolitan Opera.         Mr. Berkman died in 1995. She is survived by two brothers, William Dubois of Brookville, N.Y., and Harold Winters of Manhattan; a sister, Barbara Hagani of Kings Point, N.Y.; and three stepsons.       
         Marie Jahoda, one of the world's foremost social psychologists and an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex, died on April 28 at her home in Keymer, in southeast England. Dr. Jahoda, who taught at New York University in the 1950's, was 94.         In a long career as a researcher, teacher and writer, Dr. Jahoda, known as Mitzi, examined social issues in the field well beyond the realm of dry statistics, and in her classes emphasized a humanistic approach and adherence to scientific rigor in social research.         In New York from 1949 to 1958, she was a professor of social psychology at N.Y.U. and was a founding director of its Research Center for Human Relations. She was the source of a steady stream of surveys and reports on the social fabric of the city and the country.         Her topics included anti-Semitism and ethnic and religious prejudice in the work place and in intergroup relations. In one report she found that opinion researchers must sometimes resort to biased questions to detect bias on the respondent's part.         ''People with prejudices,'' she concluded, ''seldom like to admit it.''         On behalf of the federal Public Health Service, she investigated the effect of conditions in a wartime boom town on the mental health of workers. For this, she documented overcrowded living quarters and a dearth of education, health and recreation centers.         She tackled the delicate issue of loyalty in the political atmosphere of the 1950's by studying the impact of federal security measures on government employees.         In 1954 she assessed the role of women in America and wrote that women seeking to combine marriage with a career need strong mental health and an ability to solve problems.         Her investigation of conformity in America in the 1950's found the issue to be oversimplified. There were several basic types of conformers, she said. The most common type she called drifters, people who willingly changed their beliefs because they lacked adequate knowledge of the arguments pro or con. Another category she characterized as people who had definite and unpopular beliefs that they kept to themselves for fear of the consequences of speaking out.         Born in Vienna, Marie Jahoda absorbed the teachings of Freud and Jung and received her doctorate at the University of Vienna. She gained early recognition with a sociological study conducted in Marienthal, near Vienna, with Hans Zeisel and her first husband, Paul Lazarsfeld.         Marienthal, an industrial district, was racked by unemployment in the 1920's and 1930's. Working unobtrusively, the researchers measured the psychological consequences. For Dr. Jahoda the project demonstrated that work met a basic need for most people, giving them personal worth, social coherence and structured time.         As a Social Democrat opposed to the Austrian government even before Hitler annexed the country, she was imprisoned in 1936 but managed to reach England. There her research took on topics like unemployment in the coal mines and the transition from the classroom to the work place.         She came to the United States after World War II and worked as a researcher for the American Jewish Committee and at Columbia University before moving to N.Y.U.         She returned to Britain in 1958 to marry Austen Albu, a Labor member of Parliament. She worked as a researcher and teacher at the University of Sussex from 1965.         Mr. Albu died in 1994. Dr. Jahoda is survived by a daughter from her first marriage, Lotte Bailyn of Belmont, Mass., a professor of management at M.I.T.; and two grandsons. Dr. Jahoda and Dr. Lazarsfeld divorced in the 1930's. He became a professor of sociology at Columbia University and died in 1976.         Correction:  May 18, 2001, Friday  An obituary on May 10 about Dr. Marie Jahoda, a social psychologist, omitted two survivors. They are a sister, Rosi Kuerti of Cleveland, and a brother, Fritz Jahoda of Concord, Mass.       
         Erin O'Reilly, a New York City police sergeant who helped orchestrate the downfall of two entrenched Harlem drug gangs by using a new legal approach, died last Sunday at a Long Island hospital. She was 41 and lived in North Babylon, N.Y.         The Suffolk County medical examiner's office did not release the cause of death, but a New York City Police Department spokesman said it was nothing suspicious. Sergeant O'Reilly had a history of high blood pressure.         In January, Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik named Sergeant O'Reilly head of a new conspiracy unit in recognition of her leadership in making arrests on a novel legal premise: that local gangs operate shrewdly managed, almost corporate operations to sell drugs in thousands of transactions so small that individually they constitute only minor felonies, but that taken together they amount to a criminal conspiracy.         She and the officers and prosecutors working with her combined extensive research from official records, interviews and other sources to bring charges against gang kingpins who had proved invulnerable to the standard tactic of arresting street dealers and persuading them to betray their bosses, and so on up the ladder.         These more sophisticated drug operations were conducted indoors, not on street corners, and the thousands of street dealers making small sales were deliberately given no information to trade for lighter sentences. ''You'd just keep arresting them forever,'' said Bridget G. Brennan, the city's special narcotics prosecutor.         In an interview in the June 11 issue of New York magazine, Sergeant O'Reilly said: ''They knew the law as well as we knew the law. They were not greedy. We like people to get greedy, because greedy people make mistakes. And that's one of the things with this group: They don't make mistakes.''         But the dealers made the mistake of offending Sergeant O'Reilly. She told The Daily News in April: ''They'd taunt us, they'd smirk, they would think they were untouchable. But I'm stubborn.''         In June 1998, after earlier success in dismantling a drug operation at the Castle Hotel at 106th Street and Central Park West, she was assigned to take on the Black Top gang, named for the color of the caps on their crack vials.         Black Top worked out of two connected apartment houses at 12-14 and 16-18 Old Broadway, which is between 125th and 126th Streets. The gang effectively sealed the building from the police by dead-bolting entrances and posting lookouts. The building overlooked the precinct house, which further aided the criminals.         Inside, dealers on the higher floors sat on milk crates selling crack. During police raids, they disappeared into apartments they had either rented or commandeered.         After aborted raids and other stops and starts, last July Sergeant O'Reilly called together a group that included members of several police units and prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office. The group decided to take the novel step of applying conspiracy laws previously used mainly against the Mafia.         In the drug operations, Sergeant O'Reilly saw what clearly seemed a structured business.         ''They had shifts, there was a set scale of who got paid what whenever you were a lookout, whether you were an actual dealer that handed drugs to people, whether you were a runner, whether you were a cooker,'' she said in the New York interview.         Last Nov. 2, nearly 140 officers converged on the Black Top stronghold, making 24 arrests. Using the same strategy, Sergeant O'Reilly dismantled another organization, the Watson Gang, which had overrun two buildings on West 129th Street. Two charged as leaders and 21 said to be underlings were arrested. Those cases have not yet gone to trial.         Commissioner Kerik, who named Sergeant O'Reilly to head the new conspiracy unit in January, said in a statement after her death, ''Fighting drug traffickers demands courage, dedication and tenacity, and in Sgt. Erin O'Reilly, you had all three qualities.''         Erin O'Reilly was born on Feb. 27, 1960, in the Bronx and was raised in Bergen County, N.J. Her father, John J. O'Reilly Sr., was a New York State highway patrolman who did ''everything to keep me from becoming a police officer,'' Sergeant O'Reilly recalled, adding, ''I'm sure he saw his share of things he didn't want his daughter to see.''         But she said she wanted to make a difference, and joined the force. Her first assignment was in Washington Heights, at the height of the crack epidemic. ''New York was the O.K. Corral,'' she said. But she loved being a police officer, and liked to pepper her speech with expressions from the television show ''Dragnet.'' Ms. Brennan said she sometimes worked 36 hours straight.         Ms. O'Reilly is survived by her father, who lives in Jackson, Miss.; her brother, John J. O'Reilly Jr., of Mahwah, N.J.; and her companion, Andrea Abruzzo.       
         Dr. Bernice L. Neugarten, an authority on aging who identified a growing trend among older people to pursue more active lives and introduced the concept of the young-old and the old-old, died on July 22 at her home in Chicago. She was 85.         When Dr. Neugarten began her research on aging at the University of Chicago in the 1940's, she discovered little scientific literature in the field, but many stereotypes, which she proceeded to shatter.         ''A set of stereotypes has grown up that older persons are sick, poor, enfeebled, isolated and desolated,'' she wrote much later, in 1975, in an article for The New York Times.         Arguing against such ideas, she pointed to a steadily declining retirement age and explained that people 55 and older were quitting work, once they were financially secure, to seek more healthful and more active lives. A new generation of older people, whom she called the young-old, could be distinguished from the middle-aged primarily by retirement and from the old-old by vigor and social involvement, she wrote.         Dr. Bertram Cohler, director of Chicago's psychology department, said: ''While much of her work focused on the second half of life, she viewed older lives in terms of both earlier life experiences and social context, which led to her interest in emphasizing that social policy must be based in terms of need, not age.  Her contributions were important in defining the study of adult lives.''         Dr. Neugarten's work showed that instead of retiring and stagnating, older people had become more likely to move from the suburbs back to the city in search of opportunities, self-enhancement and more education.         Older people should not be seen as the expendables of society but instead as the social contributors as well as the self-fulfilled, she wrote in The Times. ''They may become the first age group that on a large scale creates new service roles and gives service to the community without direct financial remuneration.''         In her later work, she wrote of an increasing antagonism toward older people for occupying ''a growing number of power positions,'' and she urged fellow social scientists to explore ways to avoid such resentment.         Dr. Neugarten completed her bachelor's degree at the University of Chicago in 1936 and received her doctorate there in 1943. Before joining the Chicago faculty in 1953, she took 10 years off to start a family.         Then the university asked her to teach a course on aging -- one of the first at the university level -- and to work on a study of middle-aged and older people in the Midwest. In 1958, she became director of Chicago's graduate training program in aging.         She wrote many papers and books about adult development and the relations between age groups, including the widely recognized ''Personality in Middle and Late Life,'' published in 1964.         In 1971, Dr. Neugarten was named to the Technical Committee on Research and Demonstration for the White House Conference on Aging. She was also a member of the National Advisory Council of the National Institute on Aging and helped organize the 1982 White House Conference on Aging.         She was an emeritus professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago's Center on Aging, Health and Society.         She received several awards from the American Psychological Association, including its annual Gold Medal Award for life contributions.         Her husband, Fritz Neugarten, died in 1990. She is survived by a brother, Jack Levin of Omaha; a daughter, Dail Neugarten of Denver; a son, Jerrold, of Hannacroix, N.Y.; and three grandchildren.       
         Dr. Ruth Ann Sanger, a blood researcher and a co-author of a blood-group manual that helped make transfusions safer, died on June 4 in Britain. She was 82.         Dr. Sanger was an internationally known expert in blood grouping, having worked for many years at the Medical Research Council in London.  In 1950, she published, with Dr. Robert Russell Race, ''Blood Groups in Man,'' a reference book for nearly 30 years. The sixth and final edition came out in 1975.         She also contributed papers to medical and genetics journals.         Dr. Sanger was born in Australia. She graduated from the University of Sydney in 1938 and joined the staff of the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service there. She received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1948, two years after she went to work as a researcher in the blood group unit of the Medical Research Council.         The unit had an important part in defining blood groups and their complexity. Dr. Sanger collaborated with its director, Dr. Race, on ''Blood Groups in Man,'' which became known as ''Race and Sanger'' and something of a bible for transfusion specialists.         She was a member of the International Society of Blood Transfusion and an affiliate of similar groups in Canada, Germany, Mexico and Norway.         Drs. Sanger and Race married in 1956. She succeeded him as director of the blood group unit in 1973 and retired 10 years later. Dr. Race died in 1984. They had no children.       
         Henrietta Milstein, who bought a clothing factory in Burlington, N.J., with her husband, Monroe, and helped to build it into a chain of retail stores, died yesterday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She was 72.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Mr. Milstein, who is president and chief executive of the chain, Burlington Coat Factory.         Mrs. Milstein was born on June 9, 1929, in Vienna. When Mrs. Milstein was 10, she boarded a ship to New York with her mother and younger brother to escape Nazi persecution. She studied retailing at New York University, and earned a master's degree in library science and education from C. W. Post College on Long Island.         Mrs. Milstein worked as a homemaker until 1966, when she became a librarian at an elementary school in Long Beach, N.Y.         In 1972, Mrs. Milstein advised her husband to buy a former coat factory outlet in Burlington. But, Mr. Milstein's father, a Russian immigrant who began wholesaling coats in 1924, urged him to avoid retail and refused to give them money to buy it. Mrs. Milstein offered her savings from the school job to cover most of the $75,000 down payment, and Mr. Milstein bought the business.         Mrs. Milstein continued as a librarian until 1973, helping her husband with the business on weekends. Then she began working full time as a general manager.         In 1974, Mrs. Milstein expanded the business to include children's clothing. In 1982, the Milsteins sublet store space to an outside seller of juvenile furniture. The enterprise inspired Mrs. Milstein to add a department for baby furniture and accessories, now known as Baby Depot.         The business, which went public in 1983, later added a men's division as well as linen and sportswear divisions. There are now about 300 Burlington Coat factory stores.         Mrs. Milstein served as vice president of children's wear and juvenile products from 1974 to 1997. She then retired but continued to serve on the company's board.         Mrs. Milstein established a fellowship for medical research at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.         In addition to her husband, who lives in Princeton, N.J., Mrs. Milstein is survived by three sons, Lazer, of Monsey, N.Y.; and Andrew and Steven, of Princeton.       
         Maureen Reagan, the outspoken daughter of former President Ronald Reagan who was often at odds with her father's policies, died yesterday at her home in Sacramento. She was 60, and had suffered a recurrence of melanoma, a skin cancer with which she was first diagnosed in 1996 and that, after some years in remission, recurred last fall.         Ms. Reagan was a politically active feminist who worked to support the proposed equal rights amendment, lobbied for abortion rights and helped elect women to public office.  She had a distant relationship with her father for decades after he and  her mother, the actress Jane Wyman, divorced in 1948.         Although Ms. Reagan volunteered her services in 1966 when her father  ran for governor of California, his consultants rejected her offer on the ground that her participation would again bring Mr. Reagan's divorce to the attention of the public. She recalled a news release at the time that said Mr. Reagan and his wife Nancy, whom he married in 1952, had had two children, Patti and Ronnie, and did not mention her or her brother Michael.         A thaw between father and daughter began when Mr. Reagan ran for president in 1980.         ''When he was elected president, she had more communication and involvement with her father than she had had for the rest of her life,'' her friend Judy Carter, the daughter-in-law of former President Jimmy Carter, said in 1989.         Ms. Reagan, too, tried her hand at politics. She was twice defeated in Republican primary races in California, for the United States Senate in 1982 and for a Southern California Congressional seat in 1992. Her first campaign was undermined by reports that her father, then president, did not want her involved in the race, but a decade later he endorsed her Congressional run.         To accusations that she was trading on the Reagan name, she said, ''I don't run because of my name but I don't run from it.'' She noted that people who accused her of exploiting family ties ''forget I was a Republican before the president was.''         ''I licked my first envelope in 1960,'' Ms. Reagan said, ''and I've never stopped working.''         She said that as an 11-year-old watching television coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions, she preferred the Republicans ''because they were better organized.''         At an even younger age, she exhibited the traits for which she was known throughout her life: strong will and impatience. As one of her critics once said, she was ''simply not schooled in the ways of holding her tongue.''         In 1987, after the Iran-contra affair, when Ms. Reagan asserted that Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, President Reagan's national security aides,  should be court-martialed for their actions, Mr. Reagan told Republican leaders, ''I gave up arguing with my daughter long ago.''         Maureen Elizabeth Reagan was born on Jan. 4, 1941, and in her early school years attended the Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., as a boarder. She went to Emerson Junior High School in Los Angeles and to high school at Immaculate Heart in Hollywood. After a year at Marymount College of Virginia in Arlington she dropped out because, she said, ''I wanted to do something, be somewhere, I wanted to be an actress, and to be one, you had to know something of the world.''         When she left school, her father  told her, ''Well, write if you get work.''         The work she got was as a secretary in Washington, where she also took part in local theater. She soon returned to the West, to Las Vegas and California, where she sang in nightclubs, did a few commercials (Duncan Hines and Crisco) and had bit parts in television shows (''The Partridge Family'' and ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'') and in the 1964 Elvis Presley movie ''Kissin' Cousins.'' In her 1989 book, ''First Father, First Daughter,'' (Little, Brown & Company), Ms. Reagan recalled, ''I went out on so many auditions I began to think of changing my middle name to Rejection.''         Her brief television and movie career was followed by a stint as a talk show host on KABC Radio in Los Angeles, and in 1969 she joined a U.S.O. tour of Vietnam.         By 1980, Ms. Reagan was director of an organization called Sell Overseas America, which promoted American products abroad, a position she resigned two years later to pursue her Senate campaign.         Ms. Reagan's book revealed that she had been the victim of domestic  violence in her first marriage, in 1960, to John Filippone, a Washington policeman. The marriage lasted barely a year. A 1964 marriage to David Sills, a Marine lieutenant, ended in divorce in 1968.         Her husband of 20 years, Dennis Revell, a public relations executive in Sacramento, survives her as does a daughter, Rita, whom the couple adopted from Uganda in 1994. In addition to her father, stepmother and siblings, she is also survived by her mother.         Although she was an ardent Republican, Ms. Reagan angered many members of the party by her refusal to compromise and for stepping on toes. In 1983, she was given the title of special consultant to the Republican National Committee and moved to the family quarters in the White House.         When asked if she had been happy with her father's record on women's issues , she said: ''No, I haven't. I think there could be a much better record and I would certainly place the blame, I think, where it belongs. That's in the hands of certain people on the senior staff, who have never really accepted that there is a political power of women and that has to be addressed.''         Larry Speakes, a White House spokesman in the Reagan administration, noted in his book ''Speaking Out,'' that the president's aides, including Secretary of State George P. Shultz, were afraid of Ms. Reagan, known to many as Big Mo.         ''You would avoid her if possible and agree with her if you had to deal with her,'' Mr. Speakes wrote.         Ms. Reagan's most active political years were in the 1980's, when she was a member of the California World Trade Commission, chairwoman of the United States delegation to the United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Kenya, in 1985; co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and chairwoman of the Republican Women's Political Action League.         As Ms. Reagan became more influential, she worked to increase Republican fund-raising for women running for office.         Ms. Reagan said she first recognized the symptoms of Alzheimer's in her father in 1994 when he was unable to recall the part he had played in a movie. ''Actors always remember the roles they played,'' she said. She joined the Alzheimer's Association board and began traveling the country to raise research money.         Her personal and political creed was perhaps best summed up in a 1982 interview. ''People who hurt my friends I have a lot of trouble forgiving,'' she said. ''People who hurt me I tend to forgive but I never forget.''       
         Catherine G. Fabricant, an early proponent of the theory that herpes infections can lay the groundwork for a common form of heart disease, died Sept. 13 at a nursing home in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 81.         The cause of death was kidney failure, her family said.         The theory that some strains of herpes, as well as other viruses, play a role in atherosclerosis -- the life-threatening condition in which the arteries clog with plaque, reducing blood flow -- has not been confirmed.  But several studies have lent support to it, and it is the focus of many current research projects.         ''It is clearly a hot area right now,'' said Dr. Sidney C. Smith, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the chief science officer for the American Heart Association.         The notion received a cooler response in the late 1970's, when Mrs. Fabricant, a researcher at Cornell University, began making a case for it along with a few other scientists.         Mrs. Fabricant had several strikes against her. She was a woman, still a rarity among researchers at the time; she had never quite finished her doctorate (she put it aside to raise her children); and when she published her first findings, the wisdom taking hold was that atherosclerosis was simply the result of high cholesterol. It probably did not help that she did her work not in the field of human sciences but at Cornell's veterinary school.         ''People with little or no knowledge of virology did not want to give up pet theories,'' she said in a Cornell newsletter in 1997. ''Especially not to a veterinary medical researcher, and especially not to a woman.''         Although she was not the first researcher to suggest a link between infection and blocked arteries -- the theory was first proposed in the early 20th century -- she was among the first to provide evidence for it in the lab.         Mrs. Fabricant's interest began in the late 1960's, associates said, when she discovered that a herpes virus was linked to urinary obstruction in cats. She later determined that the blockage was formed by cholesterol and, aware of cholesterol's role in heart disease, wondered if herpes was playing a role in that disease. Herpes takes many forms, infecting large numbers of people but often causing no discernible health problems.         In the 1970's, working with her husband, Dr. Julius Fabricant, a microbiologist and bird disease expert at Cornell, Mrs. Fabricant began using chickens to test her theory. She infected one group with an avian herpes virus, while giving an uninfected group a diet high in cholesterol.         Within a year, she reported, she had found clear evidence of a herpes link. The chickens that were infected had a much higher rate of lesions in their heart arteries, and the lesions resembled those seen in human heart disease, she said.         Later studies by others found that cytomegalovirus, a herpes-related virus, is found in the fatty plaque of heart disease patients. Other studies have found similar links.         Even if herpes is definitively established as a factor in heart disease, experts say, it would not mean that cholesterol levels play no role or that people should stop paying attention to their diets. Among the infected chickens Mrs. Fabricant studied, those given high-cholesterol diets had more blockages. Many experts believe that heart disease results from a complex interplay among infection, inherited traits, diet and other factors.         Catherine Grenci Fabricant was born Sept. 24, 1919, in Davoli, Italy. Her family moved soon after to Rochester, where she grew up. In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Barbara L. Fabricant of New Albany, Ind.; a son, Daniel, of Melrose, Mass.; and two sisters, Carmella Arico of Rochester and Sue Ciulla of Phoenix.         Mrs. Fabricant retired about 15 years ago, and she never achieved an academic rank higher than acting assistant professor. But many of her peers did not realize this.         ''When we went to meetings,'' her husband recalled, ''practically everybody called her 'doctor' because, I guess, they assumed that nobody else could have done that sort of thing.''       
         Doris Howes Calloway, a nutritionist whose studies helped set standards for the dietary needs of people, died Aug. 31 at a nursing home in Seattle. She was 78.         Dr. Calloway had Parkinson's disease, said the University of California at Berkeley, where she was a professor and a provost emeritus.         In her 27 years at Berkeley, Dr. Calloway earned international renown as a scientist. She also was the first woman to enter the ranks of the university's top administrators, becoming provost of its 13 professional schools and colleges in 1981.         Her work nearly 40 years ago influenced dietary research. Especially influential were her classic Penthouse studies, begun in 1963. They recorded in detail the food and energy needs of six volunteers who lived in isolation for weeks in a campus apartment, known as the Penthouse. Among Dr. Calloway's conclusions was that Americans did not need as much protein as had been thought. The body uses only so much and eliminates the rest, she found.         She also studied the special nutritional requirements of women during menstruation and pregnancy, as well as the needs of the elderly and other groups.         The Penthouse studies continued  until 1981 and influenced national norms for recommended daily allowances of nutrients. They were directed by Dr. Calloway with Dr. Sheldon Margen, now an emeritus professor of public health.         The university created a laboratory for them on the fourth floor of Morgan Hall. There, six volunteers at a time lived in a three-bedroom apartment for up to three months on a minutely monitored diet.         They were allowed out for exercise under strict supervision. Every particle of protein that went into and out of their bodies was tracked, including in sweat and tears and hair and skin loss.         In the late 1980's, during and after her tenure as a provost, Dr. Calloway led a nine-university research project in Kenya, Egypt and Mexico to measure the causes and effects of moderate malnutrition. Besides assessing its consequences, the study identified the poor education and low status of women as being among its causes.         Born Doris Howes in Canton, Ohio, she graduated from Ohio State University in 1943. She received her Ph.D. in nutrition at the University of Chicago in 1947.         Her career started at the Quartermaster Food and Container Institute of the Armed Forces, in Chicago, where she worked until 1961 and became chief of the nutrition branch.         After a job at the Stanford Research Institute, she was appointed a professor of nutrition at Berkeley in 1963. She formally retired in 1990 but continued her work until her health failed well into the 1990's.         Dr. Calloway is survived by her husband of 20 years, Robert Nesheim of Seattle; a son, David, of Woodland Hills, Calif.; a daughter, Candace Calloway Whiting of Seattle; two stepdaughters, Sandra Rankin of Danbury, Conn., and Barbara Mowry of Denver; and nine grandchildren. Her first marriage, to Nathaniel O. Calloway, ended in divorce.         One of the many honors Dr. Calloway received came from the Quartermaster Institute in Chicago, which named her Man of the Year in 1959. She displayed the plaque prominently in her office and delighted in drawing attention to it.       
         Prof. Millie Almy, a psychologist and author who was among the first to advocate special training for teachers in early childhood education, died on Aug. 15 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 86.         Dr. Almy's early research convinced her that play was essential to healthy development and an ideal way for children to start learning the ways of the world around them. Previously, nursery school had been seen as a place to address a tot's safety and grooming, with few toys or challenging activities.         Dr. Almy was widely known for her studies of the mental, emotional and social development of the very young. Starting in the 1950's, she studied how they came to understand subjects like science and literature.         She principally taught at Teachers College of Columbia University and at the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, from which she retired in 1980.         Afterward, she was a Fulbright fellow at Macquarie University in New South Wales, Australia, and a visiting professor at Mills College in Oakland, Calif.         She wrote extensively in journals and books, some of which remain in print as classic textbooks. These include ''Children's Experiences Prior to First Grade and Success in Beginning Reading,'' ''Young Children's Thinking: Studies of Some Aspects of Piaget's Theory'' and, with Celia Genishi, ''Ways of Studying Children: An Observation Manual for Early Childhood Teachers.''         Millie Corinne Almy was born on a farm in Clymer, N.Y., and graduated from Vassar College in 1936. She received a master's in early childhood education and child development in 1945 and a doctorate in curriculum and teaching in 1948, both at Columbia Teachers College.         She started teaching at the University of Cincinnati. She returned to Columbia in 1952 and was a professor of psychology and education until 1971, the year she joined the faculty at Berkeley.         She left no immediate survivors.       
         Eileen Shanahan, a reporter for The New York Times who broke ground in the male-dominated world of economic news and later a news executive at other papers, died here today. She was 77.         She had been suffering from heart problems and rheumatoid arthritis, her daughter Mary Beth Waits said.         In 1971, The Washington Post reported an incident involving Ms. Shanahan and Maurice Stans, then head of the Department of Commerce, which Ms. Shanahan covered as a leading economic reporter for The Times. Mr. Stans had invited Ms. Shanahan to a reporters' lunch and, when she arrived, she found that the men who worked her beat were not there and that all the other reporters at the lunch were women.         ''Is this a ladies' luncheon?'' The Post quoted her as having asked loudly. Told that it was, she said: ''Then, in that case, I can't stay. I hope you will tell the secretary my reason for leaving. I consider it insulting to lump all women reporters together in a separate class.''         In addition to her work at The Times, from 1962 to 1977, Ms. Shanahan was an assistant managing editor at The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Washington Star, and she was a reporter for The United Press, the Research Institute of America and The Journal of Commerce.         She was a speechwriter for the Treasury Department in the Kennedy administration and assistant secretary for public affairs in the Health, Education and Welfare Department under Jimmy Carter.         Ms. Shanahan left The Times in anger in 1977 after she found that, although she was regarded as one of the leading reporters in the Washington bureau, her salary ranked halfway down the list, according to an account by a Times colleague, Nan Robertson. Every reporter who was paid more was a man.         In her book ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men and The New York Times'' (Random House, 1992),  Ms. Robertson described Ms. Shanahan's reaction.         Ms. Shanahan said: ''I had always assumed that I was the victim of a degree of salary discrimination, probably on the unjust rationale that I didn't need the money because I had a husband with a good job.''         ''But in my darkest hour,'' she continued, ''I never imagined that my pay would place me in the lower half of the bureau's reporters.''         During this period, a group of women at The Times filed a discrimination suit against the newspaper. Ms. Shanahan was one of the original plaintiffs, but she had left the paper by the time it was settled in 1978. The Times paid $350,000 to settle the lawsuit and agreed to place significant numbers of women in all levels in every department. Later, efforts were made to equalize men's and women's salaries.         Ms. Shanahan was single-minded on the trail of a story and had a reputation for being sharp-tongued  with officials. ''She yelled at bureaucrats who were uncooperative,'' said Richard E. Mooney, who covered economics with her at The Times. A 1966 profile in Forbes magazine, headlined ''Eileen, the Giant Killer,'' described how she decided to write groundbreaking articles about abuses in the mutual fund industry.         She said that she had gotten the idea after noticing the way mutual fund companies entertained their regulators at a convention of the state commissioners who help to regulate the securities markets.         ''I'm not easily shocked,'' she told Forbes. ''I've been in Washington all my life. I was a Washington correspondent for The Journal of Commerce and a tax information officer for Douglas Dillon before I joined The Times. I've seen lobbyists entertain. I tell you this was shocking. They smelled up the hotel. I said to myself, If they feel they have to entertain the commissioners in this way to protect themselves against regulation, there must be something wrong.''         Ms. Shanahan grew up in Washington and received a bachelor's degree  from George Washington University in 1944. While in college, where she studied political science, she worked one summer as a clerk at The Washington Post. There, she met another George Washington student, John V. Waits Jr., whom she married in 1944. He died in 1995.         In addition to Ms. Waits, of Silver Spring, Md., Ms. Shanahan is survived by another daughter, Kathleen Waits of Tulsa, Okla.; a sister, Dr. Kathleen Shanahan Cohen of Teaneck, N.J.; and three grandchildren.         Mary Beth Waits related a technique her mother suggested she follow. ''If you're going in to a meeting with some man who you think is going to try to intimidate you,'' she had said, ''go in chewing gum. He may think you're crude, but he sure won't think you're intimidated.''       
         Marian Fischman, a scientist who explored narcotics addiction by paying addicts to take heroin, cocaine and other drugs, died on Oct. 23 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 62 and lived in Manhattan.         Her husband, Dr. Herbert Kleber, said she died of complications of colon cancer.         Dr. Kleber, a psychiatrist who is the director of the Division on Substance Abuse at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, said his wife was the first research scientist since Freud to use controlled scientific experiments with humans to directly examine cocaine's effects. Past experiments were limited to animals.         His wife, who as co-director of the division directed five separate laboratories, studied how people changed physiologically and behaviorally when under the influence of drugs. The models she established  became a basis for studying potential medications to treat drug abuse.         Among other things, she tested drugs that appeared to thwart the effects of heroin and cocaine, and devised ways to study what were believed to be the greatly disparate effects of snorting cocaine versus smoking it in the form of crack. In 1996, this led her to publicly advocate more equitable prison sentences for possessing either form of cocaine. Despite the efforts of Dr. Fischman and others, possessing five grams of crack is still punishable by the same five-year sentence as possessing 500 grams of powdered cocaine.         ''The important issue is when possible to try to have science inform public policy,'' she said. ''Cocaine is cocaine. Regardless of whether you shoot it up or smoke it or snort it, it has the same effect.''         Addicts recruited to participate in her experiments received free drugs, meals, a comfortable hospital room with a VCR and a stereo, and a paycheck. ''This is a fine time in America to be a drug addict,'' the New York Post columnist Andrea Peyser wrote about the program in 1999.         Dr. Fischman's answer was that she continually offered to help participants get into treatment programs, even if their departure would harm her experiments. Nobody ever took the offer, however.         Marian Rita Weinbaum was born in Queens on Oct. 13, 1939, and grew up in an apartment above her father's drugstore. She graduated from Barnard College, earned a master's degree in psychology from Columbia and went to the University of Chicago to pursue her doctorate. She began studying how the brain learns, and wrote her thesis on the effects of methamphetamine on rhesus monkeys.         Dr. Fischman shifted her research focus to humans and from methamphetamine to cocaine. She began to examine, in physiology, how cocaine users become psychologically tolerant to larger and larger doses.         In 1984, she moved to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where she continued her cocaine work, setting up a residential laboratory where users could live for up to four weeks at a time.         She also studied other drugs, and proved that weekend users of alcohol were less effective on Monday mornings, and that marijuana smokers indeed developed appetites for snacks. She adapted her methods to study legal drugs for drug companies, but lost interest even though that attracted considerable financial support.         ''Her interest was not in repeating the same thing,'' said Dr. Kleber, who met his wife at a scientific meeting in Washington in 1987. Dr. Kleber served as deputy drug czar in the first Bush administration, and was a leader of Yale's drug research program.         The two moved to New York in 1992 to head Columbia's new substance abuse program, which was created for them. ''A lot of what we know about how cocaine affects humans is the result of her work,'' said  David M. McDowell, a Columbia University scientist who is one of many young researchers she mentored.         Dr. McDowell called Dr. Fischman ''the exact opposite'' of what one would expect from a researcher, recalling her love of walking, baking and single-malt Scotch. ''There was an elegance about her,'' he said.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Eric Fischman of Boston; two daughters, Sharon Fischman of Bethesda, Md., and Amanda Fischman Henshon of Boston; a stepson, Marc Kleber of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Elizabeth Kleber of Philadelphia and Pamela Shad of Greenwich, N.Y.; her mother, Sarah Weinbaum of Philadelphia; a brother, George Weinbaum of Philadelphia; four grandchildren; and four step-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Limmer, an authority on the poet Louise Bogan, died on Oct. 31 at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was a brain inflammation, said David Bauer, a friend.         Ms. Limmer edited three volumes of Bogan's writing, including her autobiographical ''Journey Around My Room.'' She was the executor of Bogan's literary estate and a consultant to the Louise Bogan Charitable Trust.         Ms. Limmer also helped to develop the Lower East Side Tenement Museum on Orchard Street and edited its research newsletter, Tenement Times, for several years.         Born in Manhattan, Ms. Limmer received a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and a master's degree in English and writing from Mills College in Oakland, Calif.         She became a professor of English and writing at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio, where she taught for 20 years. In 1974 she became the chairwoman of the English department at Goucher College in Towson, Md.         Later she moved to Washington to work at the Office of Policy Analysis at the invitation of Donna E. Shalala, then an assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development. When Ms. Shalala was named president of Hunter College in New York, she brought Ms. Limmer to her staff.         After her retirement, Ms. Limmer continued to work as a freelance editor. Her projects included ''Six Heritage Tours of the Lower East Side,'' published by the New York University Press in 1997.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Dorothy Dunnett, a Scottish historical novelist whose weighty works about Renaissance life attracted swarms of devoted fans in the United States, died on Friday in Edinburgh. She was 78.         Her best-known works, ''The Lymond Chronicles'' in six books and ''The House of Niccolò'' in eight, have inspired conventions, fan magazines, among them a quarterly called Kisses and Marzipan, and several Internet forums packed with lively speculation ranging from points of history to the pedigrees of her characters and the subtly wrought links between the heroes of the two series.         Mrs. Dunnett, more properly Dorothy, Lady Dunnett, tempted her fans with buried clues and red herrings that keep them reading and rereading the books.         Anne Malcolm, writing in the The New York Times Book Review last year, said the chronicles, although not widely known nearly 40 years after the first volume appeared, ''are almost certainly destined to be counted among the classics of popular fiction.''         ''Identifying just what it is that sets them apart from other works of historical romance is difficult,'' Ms. Malcolm wrote, although she cited a ''painter's eye for gorgeous detail'' and a ''vocabulary that sometimes outstrips the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.''         Ms. Malcolm described the protagonist of the first series, the fictional Francis Crawford of Lymond, a 16th-century Scot, as the perfect romantic hero, ''impossibly charming, elegant and accomplished; a brilliant swordsman; an inspired leader of men'' who was ''also highhanded, cynical and dangerous'' and not above employing a bit of violence when it suits his often veiled purposes.         For the uninitiated, the uncomprehending or those whose linguistic spectrum spans fewer than half a dozen languages, there is a guide to the minutiae of Mrs. Dunnett's work, ''The Dorothy Dunnett Companion'' by Elspeth Morrison, (Vintage Books, 2001), from which the reader can learn the common punishment for adultery (removal of the nose, by biting or other means) or a simple formula for hair dye involving leeches marinated in vinegar.         The companion offers a glimpse of the laborious process of writing the many-layered historical novels, which delve into the art, culture, manners and science of the times. Although Mrs. Dunnett said the novels drew on her own background in music, art and sailing, they also involved a great deal of travel in search of authentic detail as well as dizzying amounts of library research.         Until shortly before her death she was helping Ms. Morrison complete a second companion volume.         Mrs. Dunnett was born Dorothy Halliday on Aug. 25, 1923, in Dunfermline, Scotland. She grew up largely in Edinburgh and was at school at the same time as Muriel Spark at James Gillespie's School for Girls, the model for the academy in Ms. Spark's ''Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.''         She said it had never been her intention to become a writer of fiction. She studied music and art and took a job in Britain's Ministry of Information.         In 1946 she married her boss, Alastair Dunnett, and the couple moved to Glasgow, where Mrs. Dunnett was employed by the Board of Trade and continued her studies in singing and painting.         She had become a professional portrait painter when her husband, a banker, author, journalist and eventually an oil company executive, suggested she write a novel. He said: ''Make it a series. They're popular at the moment,'' she wrote. ''So (always cooperative) I did.''         Her first novel was rejected by five publishers in Britain, leading her husband to suggest she seek publication in the United States. ''They like long books in America,'' she quoted him as saying. The book was accepted with the proviso that it be cut, and ''The Game of Kings,'' the opening book of ''The Lymond Chronicles,'' was published by Putnam in 1961.         The other books in the Lymond series are ''Queen's Play,'' 1964, ''The Disorderly Knights,'' 1966, ''Pawn in Frankincense,'' 1969, ''The Ringed Castle,'' 1971, and ''Checkmate,'' 1975.         An idea of the complexity of Mrs. Dunnett's books can be seen in the list of characters, which, in ''Niccolò Rising,'' 1986, the first book in that series, takes up four pages peppered with historical kings, their mistresses, Medicis and merchants as well as invented characters.         The Niccolò series, about Nicholas de Fleury of Burgundy, a merchant, also includes ''The Spring of the Ram,'' 1987, ''Race of Scorpions,'' 1989, ''Scales of Gold,'' 1991, ''The Unicorn Hunt,'' 1993, ''To Lie With Lions,'' 1995, ''Caprice and Rondo,'' 1997, and ''Gemini,'' 2000.         She was also the author of a historical novel about Macbeth, ''King Hereafter,'' published in 1982, and seven mystery novels featuring Johnson Johnson, an agent in the guise of a portrait-painting yachtsman. The Johnson Johnson books, some published under the name Dorothy Halliday and released under varying titles, were originally known as ''Dolly and the Singing Bird,'' 1968, ''Dolly and the Cookie Bird,'' 1970, ''Dolly and the Doctor Bird,'' 1971, ''Dolly and the Starry Bird,'' 1973, ''Dolly and the Nanny Bird.'' 1976, and ''Dolly and the Bird of Paradise.'' 1983.         She collaborated with her husband and David Paterson on a work of nonfiction, ''The Scottish Highlands,'' published in 1988.         Mrs. Dunnett's husband died in 1998. She is survived by her sons, Ninian and Mungo, and two grandchildren.       
         Erica Van Acker, whose experience was the basis of a pioneering public television documentary on rape in 1971 and who became an early public spokeswoman for those who had been raped, died on Sept. 11 in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. She was 62 and lived in Manhattan and Sag Harbor, N.Y.         Details of her life came to light in research for a biographical sketch.         Ms. Van Acker, who was 30 when she was attacked in the hallway of her apartment building, became pregnant and had an abortion. The documentary, ''No Tears for Rachel,'' was made for Channel 13/ WNET and was broadcast nationally on ''Bill Moyers' Journal.'' After the showing of the documentary, she became an advocate. She would visit hospital emergency rooms to work with doctors to sensitize them to the feelings of those who had been raped.         Mr. Moyers said Ms. Van Acker ''took the chance because she really did want the public to know that rape is a crime where the victim is often made to feel guilty of the crime and to encourage others not to let the imposed sense of shame prevent them from talking to the police or the press.''         The documentary appeared not long before the rape law in New York State was changed to ease the requirement for corroborating evidence to prove a rape. Before the change, legal experts had argued that it was nearly impossible to convict someone of rape, because each aspect of the crime had to be corroborated by evidence other than the victim's testimony.         Though she acted as a child and trained in drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, Ms. Van Acker made her career in business. She was involved in training and automation, often working in the early days of office computers to introduce top and middle-level executives to their unwanted desktops. She worked at Ticketron, then at the Off-Track Betting Corporation and at Citibank, before starting her own consulting firm, called VASA, with Gail Soltysik, whom Ms. Van Acker had hired at Citibank.         ''Rape and its aftermath take away any sense of control,'' she said in an article by Erika Duncan about ''No Tears for Rachel'' in 1995. ''But everything that I did afterward was about taking control. Every transition workshop, every seminar I conducted was somehow deeply out of that experience.''         When Ms. Soltysik left the consulting business, she and Ms. Van Acker bought the old train station in Water Mill, on Long Island, and eventually turned it into a restaurant, the Station Bistro. It was known for its food and its all-female staff. Ms. Van Acker planned the menus and did some of the cooking, including soups and her well-known lentil loaf. The restaurant was sold a year and a half ago.         Ms. Van Acker was working as a senior consultant on compensation at Aon Consulting when she died.         Ms. Van Acker was born in Manhattan. Her father was French, her mother English. She moved to England when she was 8. She has no immediate survivors. A memorial service was held Sept. 29 with a reception afterward at her former restaurant, now called Station Road.       
         Naomi Schor, a literary critic and theorist who combined psychoanalytic theory, avant-garde philosophy and feminism to come up with quirky, often startling insights into 19th-century French authors including Flaubert and Zola, died on Dec. 2 at a New Haven hospital. She was 58 and lived in Hamden, Conn.         The cause was a brain hemorrhage, said her sister, Mira Schor.         Dr. Schor, the Benjamin F. Barge professor of French at Yale University, brought French psychoanalytic and deconstructive theory to French studies in the United States, said Joan W. Scott, a professor of social science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.         As one example of how this worked, she cited Dr. Schor's essay on fetishism in the novels of George Sand, the cigar-smoking, cross-dressing novelist who was the most widely celebrated female writer in France in the 1800's. Dr. Schor found many ways that women in Sand's novels used fetishes, which are usually considered a male preoccupation.         Dr. Schor also used unconventional approaches to discover atypical ways in which the female body was represented in 19th-century French literature. She argued that when Zola depicted the uncontrollable passions of crowds, he used feminine means to express them.         Dr. Schor, who once wrote that she hoped to become ''an intellectual bad girl,'' delighted in controversy. For example, in an article published last January in GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, she explored the notion of male lesbianism, suggesting ways that Flaubert and other male authors seemed to speak from a lesbian perspective.         In her book ''Reading in Detail: Aesthetics and the Feminine'' (Methuen, 1987), she argued that men, in taking the universal view, have historically tended to de-emphasize the importance of details. She suggested that details were considered ornamental or mundane, and as such, were deemed women's stuff.         But at the same time, theorists like Jacques Derrida, the French philosopher whom Dr. Schor knew and interpreted in her writings, were coming to consider traditional visions of universal truth irrelevant. To them, the truth was in the meaning of details.         ''Does the triumph of detail signify a triumph of the feminine with which it has long been linked?'' she asked. ''Or has the detail achieved new prestige by being taken over by the masculine, triumphing at the very moment when it ceases to be associated with the feminine?''         She relentlessly challenged conventional understanding in her teaching and writing as well as in a feminist journal she helped found in 1989 at the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women at Brown University. Even the name of the journal -- ''differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies'' -- reflects her idiosyncratic outlook. She suggested putting the ''s'' in italics to make people think. (The lowercase ''d'' was chosen by graphic designers.)         ''She had this amazing way of making the familiar look unfamiliar,'' said Elizabeth Weed, the other founding editor.         Dr. Schor was born on Oct. 10, 1943, in Manhattan. Her father, Ilya, was a painter, goldsmith and artist of Judaica. Her mother, Resia, was also an artist. They had fled from Poland to Paris to escape the Nazis, eventually reaching New York, by way of Lisbon, on Dec. 3, 1941.         Her parents moved in a cosmopolitan circle of intellectuals and artists in New York and spoke French, which was Dr. Schor's first language, at home.         Her public school teachers told her parents they doubted she would be able to read, a problem solved when her parents bought her eyeglasses. They placed her at the Lycée Français, where she remained through high school.         Her sister said she devoured books and seldom went outdoors, leading neighbors to think that the family had only one daughter. Already, she was aspiring to lead a life of the mind. She wrote in an essay for The Los Angeles Times in 1986 that this was not easy.         ''For a girl it was an act of courage, not to say folly,'' she wrote. ''It meant certain unpopularity, even ostracism.''         She graduated from Barnard College, where she majored in English, and received her doctorate in French at Yale, where her first published articles were written not only on French but also in French.         ''I knew that my advantage really lay in French,'' she said. ''When I went to graduate school, it never occurred to me to do anything else.''         Her literary and philosophical interests always seemed to be slightly ahead of the newest academic currents, said Sharon Marcus, an English professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a former student of Dr. Schor's.         ''She was always interested in charting the territory that was just a little more complicated than what everyone else was saying,'' Dr. Marcus said.         Her 5 books and more than 50 academic articles made her the sort of star that prestigious universities compete to recruit. She taught at Brown, Duke and Harvard.         In 1999 she joined the faculty at Yale, where her husband, Howard Bloch, teaches in the French department. In addition to her husband and sister, she is survived by her mother, who lives in Manhattan.         Dr. Schor once said she had love affairs with intellectual ''ism's,'' including fetishism, realism, idealism, universalism and feminism, her favorite.         She organized a symposium titled ''Man and Beast,'' which was to have taken place the weekend after she died. Scholars from many disciplines had planned to examine similarities and differences between humans and animals, perhaps under the rubric of speciesism.       
         Catherine Voorsanger, an associate curator of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Monday in New York City. She was 51 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of melanoma, said her family.         Ms. Voorsanger worked at the Met since 1983, contributing actively to the increasingly visible field of post-Federal American decorative arts. Her main area of concentration was 19th- and early-20th century American furniture, but she arrived there after studying American 19th-century painting and architecture and, at the Met, conducting extensive research on John LaFarge's stained glass and the American Aesthetic Movement. These subjects seemed to make her unusually well equipped to help shatter the prevailing stereotype of 19th-century American furniture as uniformly dark, heavy and ornate, not only in her curatorial work but also in scholarly writing, lecturing and postgraduate teaching.         A prime example of her work was ''Herter Brothers: Furniture and Interiors for a Gilded Age,'' an exhibition organized in 1994 with Alice Cooney Freilinghuysen of the Met's decorative arts department, and Katherine S. Howe of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. She also oversaw research, helped select the objects and contributed to the catalogs for ''In Pursuit of Beauty: Americans and the Aesthetic Movement'' (1987) and ''American Paradise: The World of the Hudson River School'' (1988). Her 88-page ''Dictionary of Architects, Artisans, Artists and Manufacturers'' in the ''Aesthetic Movement'' catalog has become a standard reference in the field.         With John K. Howat, former chairman of the department of decorative arts at the Met, Ms. Voorsanger organized last year's ''Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-1861,'' which traced the beginning of New York's ascendancy as a cultural capital. The exhibition's catalog won the New-York Historical Society's Henry Allen Moe Award for art-historical writing, and was also the first exhibition catalog to make the New York Public Library's annual Books to Remember list of 25 outstanding publications.         At the Met she also coordinated the updating and computerizing of the documentation for the thousands of decorative objects in the Henry R. Luce Center for the Study of American Art, a vast open-storage display that opened in 1989, and organized the 1994 exhibition ''The Decorative Arts of Frank Lloyd Wright in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.''         Ms. Voorsanger was born Catherine Hoover in Oakland, Calif., in 1950. She earned a B.A. in art history from Smith College in 1972, and, later, a master's and a doctorate from the City University of New York. From 1972 to 1979 she worked as assistant curator and then curator at the California Historical Society in San Francisco. During this time she was a protégé of Alfred Frankenstein, a well-known San Francisco art critic.         In 1979 she returned to New York to become a senior researcher for the painting collection of New York City, initiating a site review and conservation inspection of some 300 19th-century works in public buildings throughout the five boroughs.         Ms. Voorsanger is survived by her husband, Bartholomew Voorsanger, an architect who designed the renovation of the Asia Society and the expansion of the Morgan Library; her mother, Beatrice Slater, of San Rafael, Calif.; and her sister, Holly de Montmarin, of Paris.         Correction:  December 29, 2001, Saturday  A obituary on Dec. 14 about Catherine Voorsanger, an associate curator of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, omitted several survivors. They are her father, Robert C. Hoover of Piedmont, Calif.; her brother Robert C. Hoover II of Alameda, Calif.; her half-sister, Whitney Hoover of Piedmont, Calif.; and her half-brothers, John S. Hoover of Los Angeles and Samuel S. Slater of Ketchum, Idaho.
