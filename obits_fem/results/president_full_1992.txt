         Dora R. Inselbuch, a longtime national board member of Hadassah, the women's Zionist and charitable organization, died on Thursday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale. She was 93 years old and had lived in Manhattan until eight years ago.         Her family said she died of natural causes in her sleep.         During her 16 years on the national board, Mrs. Inselbuch served in several capacities. In the 1940's, she was chairman of the Jewish National Fund department, Hadassah's official Zionist land-buying agency in what was then Palestine. The fund raised money for colonization and land-reclamation work, including reforestation.         She also was a past national Hadassah chairman for young people pioneering in Palestine and helped found Kibbutz Hasollelim to train young Zionists. It remains an operating kibbutz today in Israel. Daughter of a Rabbi         Mrs. Inselbuch, the daughter of a rabbi, was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, then part of czarist Russia. She came to the United States as a 5-year-old and grew up in Denver.         While attending Hunter College, she became one of the first recipients of a Hebrew teacher's certificate from the Teachers Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary. As Jewish education chairman for Hadassah, she later was an organizer of the seminary's School for Jewish Women.         Mrs. Inselbuch began her community work as a leader in Young Judaea, the national Zionist youth movement supported by Hadassah. She was a past vice president of the Brooklyn and New York chapters of Hadassah and founder of its Jersey City chapter. She also was a founding member of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism in New York.         She is survived by two daughters, Hadassah Tannor of Manhattan and Froma Zeitlin of Princeton, N.J.; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Evelyn Tennyson Openhym, a book collector and benefactor of Alfred University in western New York, died on Jan. 13 at her home in Wellsville, N.Y. She was 89 years old.         She died of cancer, said Edward G. Coll Jr., president of the university, where she was a trustee.         Mrs. Openhym, who had a lifelong interest in Britain, started her collection while on her honeymoon in London in 1924. Over 60 years, she amassed some 7,000 books by and about British authors, about British literature and British social history. She compiled and wrote a 566-page bibliography for her collection, which she donated to the university in 1981.         Included in the book collection are signed first editions by D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, John Galsworthy and others. The books are available to visitors but may not be removed from the library.         Mrs. Openhym had a family connection to Alfred University dating to the mid-1840's. She graduated in 1924 from Alfred, where she met her husband, George J. Openhym, a fellow student. He died in 1954.         She is survived by a son, Alexander, of New Rochelle, N.Y.

         Mary Virginia Gaver, who championed the cause of school libraries in America, died Tuesday at the Roman Eagle Memorial Home in Danville, Va. She was 85 years old and died of Parkinson's disease, her family said.         Miss Gaver helped develop national school library standards in 1960 and headed a $1.1 million campaign promoting their adoption nationwide and creating eight model libraries.         She served as president of the American Library Association in 1966-67, the American Association of School Librarians in 1959-60 and the New Jersey School Library Association in 1954-55. Taught Librarians         She was also an educator of librarians at several universities. Her longest tenure was at Rutgers University, where she taught from 1954 to 1971.         Growing up in the cotton mill town of Schoolfield, Va., she accompanied her mother, a teacher, as she went door-to-door collecting $100 to start a school library. Mill company executives matched the donations.         Decades later Miss Gaver summarized what she saw as her mission in the title of a pamphlet she wrote: "Every Child Needs a School Library."         She earned a bachelor of arts degree from Randolph-Macon Women's College and bachelor of science and master's degrees from Columbia University, where she studied under a Carnegie fellowship. High School English Teacher         In the 1920's and 1930's she worked as a high school English teacher and librarian in Danville and served as technical director of a Federal Works Project Administration library program for Virginia.         She moved to New York to be a school librarian in Scarsdale from 1939 to 1942. She was a librarian and professor of library service at New Jersey State Teachers College in Trenton from 1942-54, with a two-year leave as a visiting professor at the University of Teheran and library adviser to Iran. She also taught at the University of Virginia and Emory University.         After her retirement from Rutgers, she served as a library consultant and later vice president of Bro-Dart Inc., a wholesale book supplier. She wrote and edited numerous articles and books on libraries.         Her survivors include a sister, Lydia Harvey, also of Danville.       
         Sally Mugabe, an anti-colonialist and the wife of President Robert Mugabe, died Monday. She was 60 years old and had suffered from a kidney disease, the Government announced.         Mrs. Mugabe, who was born in Ghana, met Mr. Mugabe when he was teaching there in the 1950's. They married in 1961.         She was often arrested by colonial police in what was previously called Southern Rhodesia for campaigning with her husband against white rule and spent six weeks in prison in 1961.         President Mugabe is expected to cancel scheduled visits to a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York and talks in London with British Prime Minister John Major.         The Mugabes' only child, a boy named Nhanodzenyika, which means "our country has problems" in the their tribal Shona language, died of cerebral malaria at the age of 3.       
         Elizabeth Coykendall Chase, a former campaign adviser to United States Senator Jacob K. Javits, died on Sunday at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut. She was 77 years old and lived in Stamford.         Mrs. Chase, a writer and public relations specialist, counseled Mr. Javits in his first successful race for the House of Representatives in 1946. She also was public relations adviser to the New York Citizens Budget Commission, a private organization, in the 1950's.         Mrs. Chase, a native of Iowa, attended Iowa State College and graduated from Wellesley College in 1936.         Before moving to Stamford, she lived in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J., for 25 years. She was president of the New York and Ridgewood Wellesley Clubs, a founder of the West Bergen Mental Health Center and president of the Ridgewood College Club and of the Ho-Ho-Kus Garden Club. Her interests in Stamford included the Friends of Ferguson Library, the Stamford Garden Club and the Easter Seal Rehabilitation Center.         She was a Time magazine researcher in Washington in the 1930's. In the 1950's and 60's, she was a founder and president of a New York public relations firm, Attitudes Inc. She was also a speech writer for corporate executives and a book and newsletter editor.         She is survived by her husband, W. Howard Chase; two daughters, Anne, of Glen Rock, N.J., and Alison, of Kinnelon, N.J.; one son, Thomas, of North Plainfield, N.J.; eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Rear Adm. Grace Murray Hopper, retired, a mathematician and pioneer in data processing who was a legendary figure among both computer scientists and industry executives, died New Year's Day at her home in Arlington, Va.         Admiral Hopper, who was 85 years old, had been in ill health recently, family members said, and died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes.         She had been in the Navy, as an active-duty officer or a reservist, since World War II, and received a special Presidential appointment to the rank of rear admiral in 1983. In 1982, with the retirement of Adm. Hyman J. Rickover, Admiral Hopper became the oldest officer on active duty in the armed service, which she remained until retiring herself in 1986.         Admiral Hopper made several vital contributions to the development of modern computing systems, including helping invent the Cobol programming language, which is still in widespread use in business.  Award from President         In September, President George Bush awarded her the National Medal of Technology "for her pioneering accomplishments in the development of computer programming languages that simplified computer technology and opened the door to a significantly larger universe of users." She was the first woman to receive the award individually.         At the time of her death she was a senior consultant to the Digital Equipment Corporation. She joined Digital in 1986, shortly after her retirement from the Navy.         "Grace took every opportunity to challenge people young and old to consider the infinite possibilities of technology," said Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital Equipment's president.         Admiral Hopper was born Grace Brewster Murray on Dec. 9, 1906, in New York City. After receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale, she taught math at Vassar College, her alma mater, where she later became an associate professor. She was divorced in 1945 but kept her married name.         In 1949 she worked as a mathematician at the Eckert-Mauchly Corporation. The company was formed by Dr. John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, who in 1946 had developed one of the world's first electronic computers, ENIAC, at the University of Pennsylvania. Eckert-Mauchly was then building the Univac I, the first commercial electronic computer. The company was later bought by the Remington Rand Corporation.         Earlier, in 1943, Dr. Hopper had joined the Navy. As a lieutenant assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University, she worked as a programmer on a calculating device called the Mark I, a precursor electronic computers.  Recalled by the Navy         Leaving the Navy in 1946, she remained at Harvard as a faculty member in the computation laboratory. She continued to work on early Navy computers and maintained her Naval career as a reservist. Although retired from the Navy reserve in 1966, then-Commander Hopper was recalled within a year to active duty to oversee a program to standardize the Navy's computer programs and languages.         In 1962, she was elected a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. In 1969, the Data Processing Management Association selected her as its first computer sciences "Man of the Year."         Her work led to the first practical compiler for modern computers. A compiler is a program that translates instructions written by a human programmer into more specific codes that can be directly read by a computer.         Among her many contributions, Admiral Hopper is known for coining the term "bug," which is widely used to refer to mysterious computer failures.         The first bug actually was -- a moth, as Admiral Hopper told the story. It was discovered one August night at Harvard in 1945 inside the Mark I.         "Things were going badly, there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long, glass-enclosed computer," she is quoted as saying. "Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using ordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth. From then on, when anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it."         Like another Navy figure, Admiral Rickover, Admiral Hopper was known for her combative personality and her unorthodox approach.         A self-described "boat rocker," she once said in a speech that she hoped to live until the year 2000. "I have two reasons," she said. "The first is that the party on Dec. 31, 1999, will be a New Year's Eve party to end all New Year's Eve parties. The second is that I want to point back to the early days of computers and say to all the doubters, 'See? We told you the computer could do all that.' "         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Roger F. Murray II of New Hampshire, and a sister, Mary Murray Westcote of New Jersey.       
         Cecile L. Naumburg, a philanthropist and former board member of Carnegie Hall and other cultural organizations, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital.  Mrs. Naumburg was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was caused by respiratory failure, her family said.         She was born in Philadelphia and went to the Friends Select School there. Her first husband, W. Maurice Steppacher, who was vice president and treasurer of the WDAS radio station in Philadelphia, died in 1936.         In 1937 she moved to New York City and married George W. Naumburg, an investment banker. They also had a second home in New City, N.Y.         Sharing her husband's love of music, Mrs. Naumburg served as a director on the boards at the Greenwich School of Music, the Friends of French Opera and the Naumburg Park Concerts. Family contributions helped build the Naumburg bandshell in Central Park. She was also a longtime board member of the Day Schools Association.         She is survived by two sons, Walter Steppaccher of Sarasota, Fla., and John Steppacher of Waccabuc, N.Y.; a daughter, Doris Judell of White Plains; two stepsons, George Naumburg of North Salem, N.Y., and Philip Naumburg of Sante Fe, N.M.; a stepdaughter, Ellen London of Pound Ridge, N.Y.; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

         Constance M. Adamec, a vice president in Sotheby's finance department and a tenant advocate on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, died suddenly on Monday at her home. She was 52 years old.         An announcement by Sotheby's said she died of an asthma attack.         Ms. Adamec had a 33-year career at Sotheby's, having joined its predecessor in North America, Parke-Bernet Galleries, as a billing clerk in 1958. She was promoted to vice president in 1985.         She joined the tenant cause in 1970 when she began a successful six-year fight against eviction from her home while raising three children by herself. She was active in the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association for more than 30 years and helped form the East Side Tenants Union in the early 1970's. She served three consecutive terms as chairwoman of Community Planning Board No. 8, from 1985 to 1988.         Ms. Adamec is survived by her daughter, Justene Adamec of Los Angeles; her sons, Edward and Paul, both of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
         Jeanne F. Bernkopf, who edited "Scarlett" and many other best-selling books, died on Monday in Manhattan.  She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She was stricken and died while riding in a taxi, her family said. No exact cause of death has been determined.         Mrs. Bernkopf edited Kitty Kelley's unauthorized biographies on Nancy Reagan and Frank Sinatra as well as Alexandra Ripley's "Scarlett," the sequel to "Gone with the Wind."         Several prominent writers sought her to edit their work. Joseph A. Wambaugh, for example, used her on a score of his books. Ms. Kelley and the novelist James Clavell specified in their publishing contracts that Mrs. Bernkopf be their editor. Other popular authors she edited included Michael Korda, Erich Segal, Wayne Dyer, Joshua Logan, Ingrid Bergman, Richard Bach and Robert Ludlum.         "She was really an author's editor -- strict but loving," said Lawrence Hughes, the former president of William Morrow & Company, one of the publishers for whom she worked. The others included Delacorte, Dell, Dutton, MacMillan and Bantam. She also worked as a freelance editor.         Mrs. Bernkopf was born in Manhattan and grew up there and in Woodmere, L.I. After graduating from Smith College, she went directly into publishing.         Surviving are her husband, Michael, a mathematics professor at Pace University; three stepchildren, David of Manhattan, Daniel of Highland Park, Ill., and Donald of Brooklyn, and three brothers, Charles Frank of Ardsley, N.Y., and Howard and Edward Frank, both of Boston.       
         Linda M. Arenth, a nursing executive and innovator in the care of cancer patients, died Feb. 9 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She was 59 years old and lived in Baltimore.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Arenth was the vice president of nursing and patient services at Hopkins. Earlier, she was the first director of nursing at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, where she developed the system now used nationally to designate nursing services for different types of cancer patients. She was the first recipient of the national Oncology Nursing Society's award for excellence in the administration of cancer nursing.         She was also on the boards of the Foundation for Nursing of Maryland and Health Care for the Homeless.         Born in Orange, Calif., she grew up in nearby Bellflower. She graduated from Cottey College in Nevada, Mo., in 1952 and earned a nursing degree from the University of Southern California in 1955 and a master's degree from the University of Maryland in 1974. She was a doctoral candidate at Columbia University.         She was divorced from Donald Arenth, a designer who died last year.         She is survived by two sons, Craig of Albuquerque, N.M., and Sean of Frostburg, Md.; two sisters, Janet Morgan of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Maureen Morgan of Ossining, N.Y.; two brothers, Peter Magnusson of Spokane, Wash., and Dennis Magnusson of Boston, Mass.       
         Jean R. Yawkey, the majority owner of the Red Sox, a fixture at Fenway Park for almost half a century and a major Boston philanthropist, died yesterday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, six days after suffering a severe stoke. She was 83 years old.         Despite reports that she had been in failing health last year, Mrs. Yawkey had continued to attend Red Sox home games.         In addition to her active role with the Red Sox and her extensive charitable work, Mrs. Yawkey had been a director of the National Baseball Museum and Hall of Fame since 1984, when she became the first, and so far only woman elected to the board.         As the widow of Thomas A. Yawkey, the multimillionaire sportsman who bought the Red Sox for $1 million in 1933 and lost an estimated $10 million trying to build championship teams over the next 44 seasons, Mrs. Yawkey saw it as her duty to live up to his free-spending ways after his death in 1976.         For a while, however, it appeared that the team would fall into other, less generous, hands. In 1978, the Yawkey estate was on the verge of selling the team to a syndicate formed by Haywood C. Sullivan, a Red Sox executive, and the team's former trainer, Edward G. (Buddy) LeRoux Jr., with Mrs. Yawkey as a limited partner.         But the deal was so heavily leveraged that it failed to win the approval of the baseball commissioner until Mrs. Yawkey, who put up the Fenway real estate as part of her stake, agreed to join the group as the third general partner. At the time of the transaction, the club was valued at $20 million.         The arrangement proved stormy almost from the start, with Mr. LeRoux pressing for measures that would earn profits for the partnership and Mrs. Yawkey just as determined to continue operating the team in the grand Yawkey tradition. Mr. Sullivan for the most part sided with Mrs. Yawkey, and Mr. LeRoux was increasingly isolated.         By 1987, Mrs. Yawkey held a two-thirds interest to Mr. Sullivan's one-third share, and she was very much in charge from then on, relegating Mr. Sullivan to little more than a figurehead. Denied the Ultimate Goal         Although Mrs. Yawkey's business adviser and presumptive heir, John Harrington, the president of the JRY Corporation, which holds the Yawkey Red Sox shares, was often mistaken for the real power behind the franchise, those close to the club insisted that Mr. Harrington was merely the prime minister and Mrs. Yawkey was always the queen.         Like her husband, who saw his team win three pennants but never a World Series championship, Mrs. Yawkey, too, was denied the ultimate goal. During her tenure, the Red Sox won the American League East three times, but in their only World Series appearance, lost to the Mets in 1986.         Mrs. Yawkey, whose original name was Jean Remington Hollander, was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 24, 1909, and raised in Freeport, L.I.         Her first marriage apparently ended in a divorce within a short time, and from the early 1930's until the 1940's, Jean R. Hiller, as she was known, worked as a model at Jay Thorpe, a fashionable women's store on West 57th Street in Manhattan.         It was there that she supposedly met Mr. Yawkey during a visit to the store with his first wife, Elise Sparrow Yawkey. The couple, who had married in 1925, six years after Mr. Yawkey had inherited $20 million at the age of 16, divorced in November 1944, and Mr. Yawkey remarried the next month. Followed Games Closely         At Fenway, Jean and Tom Yawkey maintained his and her rooftop boxes. He liked to sit and drink with his cronies and cuss, it was once explained, while the more dignified Mrs. Yawkey sat with their wives or close friends.         Her attendance at Red Sox games was more than duty. She meticulously kept score in a custom-bound set of score cards.         Mrs. Yawkey rarely missed the annual visit to Cooperstown, N.Y., for Hall of Fame inductions. She became a major benefactor of the museum, donating two wings to the building and commissioning the famous basswood statue of Williams at work by Armand LaMontagne.         She apparently has no immediate survivors.       
         Marguerite Ross Barnett, who as president of the University of Houston was the first black woman to lead a major American university, died yesterday at Maui Memorial Hospital in Wailuku, Hawaii. She was 49 years old.         She had a blood disorder involving hypoglycemia and metastatic cancer, said Timothy Maloney, the hospital administrator. Dr. Barnett was on medical leave from the University of Houston, where she had been president since 1990. She was visiting Hawaii with her husband, Walter E. King, on a trip to where they had spent their honeymoon.         Before becoming president at Houston, Dr. Barnett had been an administrator at other major universities, including the City University of New York. She had a reputation as a successful fund-raiser and a pragmatic academic who urged that urban universities play a dominant role in spurring economic growth and solving social problems in the same way that land-grant colleges of a century ago did in developing America's agricultural economy.  Seeking Stronger Links         "What will characterize the superb 21st century university," she said at her inaugural in 1990, "will be its ability to manifest and focus areas of unquestioned institutional excellence on the challenging issues of the day."         Her views were representative of a substantial shift in higher education as universities, once isolated from their locales, sought stronger connections to their surroundings. And in many ways, Dr. Barnett was seen as representing a new generation of educational leader. While she had access to politicians and business leaders, she also worked to reach out to the public schools where she worked.         As vice-chancellor for academic affairs at the City University of New York from 1983 to 1986, she was instrumental in establishing a program to help poor high school students make the transition to college and good jobs. She instituted a similar program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, where she was chancellor from 1986 to 1990, and did the same in Houston.         Houston is a public university with 33,000 students that performs $45 million a year in scientific research. It has become especially well known for its work in superconductivity. Recording Firsts         In 1989, Dr. Barnett was considered a leading candidate to replace Chancellor Richard R. Green of the New York City schools after Dr. Green died. The position went to Joseph A. Fernandez.         When she was named the first black and the first woman to be president of the University of Houston, there were few other women in charge of colleges that were neither historically black nor all female, a situation that still exists. The only woman to lead a campus larger than the University of Houston is Donna Shalala, who is chancellor of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, which has 38,000 students.         But Dr. Barnett constantly tried to play down the racial distinction of her position. When interviewers persisted in asking her how it felt to be the first black woman to head the University of Houston, she would turn to her assistant, Wendy H. Adair, and ask "Well, how does it feel to be the first red-haired associate vice president of the university?" That usually ended the conversation.         During her brief tenure in Houston, Dr. Barnett became a leading spokeswoman for urban universities and university-driven economic development. She also played a key role in raising more than $150 million for her institution, including a donation of more than $50 million from an alumnus, John Moores, one of the largest gifts ever made to a publicly financed university.         Dr. Barnett was born in Charlottesville, Va., on May 21, 1942. She graduated from Antioch College in 1964 and received her master of science and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Chicago. She taught at the University of Chicago and at Princeton, Howard and Columbia universities before turning to university administration.         She was a member of the boards of the Student Loan Association and the Educational Testing Service. Last July she was the only university representative named to the President's Commission on Environmental Quality, a group that will recommend ways to slow the destruction of the environment without restricting business excessively.         Dr. Barnett is survived by Mr. King; her daughter by a previous marriage, Amy Barnett, of New York City, and her mother, Mary Eubanks, of Houston.       
         Frances Young Tang, a philanthropist in the field of education and a preservationist specializing in landmark buildings, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 53 years old and also had homes in Oyster Bay, L.I., and Vail, Colo.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Oscar L. Tang.         The beneficiaries of Mrs. Tang's philanthropy included the Department of East Asian Studies at Duke University, the Chinese language program at Skidmore College and Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. She was a trustee of Phillips Academy at the time of her death and had been on the executive committee of the school's development board.         She was also president of Vencura Ltd., a Manhattan-based company that rehabilitates landmark buildings and has been doing work in Vail, Colo. She had also managed a Chinese catering business.         Mrs. Tang was born in Paris, the daughter of Kuangson Young, a Nationalist Chinese career diplomat who was executed during World War II by the Japanese in the Philippines. She came to the United States on an American troop ship and grew up in Manhattan.  She graduated in 1957 from Abbot Academy in Andover, Mass., which later merged with Phillips Academy, and in 1961 from Skidmore College.         She was married in 1960 to Mr. Tang, who is the president of Reich & Tang, a financial services firm with headquarters in Manhattan.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her mother, Juliana Koo of Manhattan, who is the widow of V. K. Wellington Koo, a Nationalist Chinese diplomat who was an ambassador to Washington and a member of the International Court of Justice at the Hague; three daughters, Tracy Tang Limpe, Dana and Kristin, all of Manhattan; a son, Kevin, of Manhattan, and two sisters, Genevieve Young of Manhattan and Shirley Young of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and Manhattan.       
         Marion F. Schappel, a retired vice president at Citibank and one of the first women there to reach that rank, died on Wednesday at her home in Somers, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died of complications of cancer, her family said.         Miss Schappel was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Mahwah, N.J. She started at Citibank when she was 18, after graduation from high school. Her first job was as a page. She worked her way up to become secretary to a branch manager. After years of experience, she often found herself explaining procedures to younger male executive trainees.         In 1961 she was promoted to assistant manager, only the third woman in the bank's 151-year history to hold such a post. By 1964 there were a dozen female assistant managers and she was chosen from them to study at the Stonier Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers University. She and 22 other students from other banks that year were the first women admitted at Stonier.         In 1965 she was one of four women promoted to assistant vice president at Citibank and in 1972 became a vice president. Most of her work was in branch banking. She spent 22 years in the branch at the bank's headquarters at 399 Park Avenue in Manhattan and became its manager. She was also manager of the branch in the Pan Am Building. She retired from full-time work in 1987 but continued as a consultant to the bank for three years.         Surviving are two brothers, Robert B. of Pasco, Wash., and Richard B. of Oak Ridge, Tenn.       
         Mary Childs Black, an art historian, folk art expert, former museum director and writer, died yesterday at her home in Germantown, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, said M. J. Gladstone, a friend.         Mrs. Black's greatest contribution to American folk art scholarship was her identification of the unsigned paintings of known American 18th- and 19th-century artists, attributions she based largely on social history.         Mrs. Black organized more than 100 exhibitions seen in the United States, Britain or Israel. She made her most important discovery in the late 1960's, when she identified portraits attributed to four unidentified painters as the work of one man, Ammi Phillips, an itinerant 19th-century artist born in Connecticut. She disclosed her findings in 1969 in the book "Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter, 1788-1865," which she wrote with Barbara and Lawrence Holdridge, folk art collectors. The biography was published when she was director of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York City, where she had organized the first major show of Phillips's work. A Start at Williamsburg         Her museum career began in 1956 when she was hired as a research assistant at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Two years later she became curator at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center at Williamsburg, and was named director in 1961.         She left Williamsburg in 1964 to become the director of the Museum of American Folk Art. In 1969 she moved to the New-York Historical Society, where she remained as the curator of sculpture, painting and decorative arts until 1982, when she was abruptly dismissed by the director, Dr. James B. Bell.         Mrs. Black protested the dismissal and was widely supported in the museum world. After a complaint was filed with Federal and state agencies contending that the society had violated sex- and age-discrimination laws, the society settled out of court, awarding Mrs. Black a sum equal to the back pay and vacation owed to her, and restoring her full pension. Dr. Bell resigned in 1988.         At her death, Mrs. Black was working on an exhibition of Colonial American painters to be presented at the New-York Historical Society, said Barbara Knowles Debs, the director and president. A Childhood Interest         Mrs. Black often said her interest in folk art stemmed from seeing Erastus Salisbury Field's 19th-century portraits of her ancestors in her grandparents' home when she was a child in Pittsfield, Mass., where she was born.         Mrs. Black graduated from the Women's College of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1943, did graduate work at Catholic University in Washington and earned a master's degree in art history at George Washington University in 1952.         Her books include "Old New York in Early Photographs" (1973), "What Is American in American Art" (1971), "Erastus Salisbury Field" (1984) and "Gracie Mansion: A History of the New York Mayor's House" (1984). She was the co-author with Jean Lipman of "American Folk Painting" (1967).         She is survived by a daughter, Merrill Black of New Durham, N.H., and a grandson.       
         Elizabeth Man Sarcka, a founder of Spring Lake Ranch in Vermont, one of the earliest halfway houses for the mentally ill, died on Sunday at Hampshire House, a community care home in East Montpelier, Vt. She was 98 years old and lived much of her life in Long Island City and Richmond Hill, Queens.         She died of a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Sarcka and her husband, Wayne, established Spring Lake Ranch at Cuttingsville, Vt., in 1932 for people with mental and emotional problems and ran it for 30 years. Their therapeutic approach, based on the participation of both staff members and residents in ranch affairs, attracted national attention.         Retiring to the island of Jamaica in 1961, the Sarckas organized a school for adults in the mountain community of Malvern. After her husband's death in 1969, Mrs. Sarcka returned to Queens.         Active in volunteer work at the United Nations, Mrs. Sarcka was president of the Queens Chapter of the United Nations Association from 1975 to 1979. She also served as executive secretary of the League of Nations Association of Greater New York from 1927 to 1928.         A graduate of Barnard College, she was honored with the distinguished alumna award in 1983 and the Barnard Medal of Distinction in 1985.         Born in New York City, she came from a prominent New York family. Her father, Alrick H. Man, a Wall Street lawyer, developed the community of Kew Gardens in Queens, on property that had been bought by her grandfather, Alban P. Man.         She is survived by her daughter, Anne of Montpelier, Vt.; a niece, Lucy Jinishian of Old Greenwich, Conn., and a nephew, Alrick Man 3d of South Londonderry, Vt.       
         Rose Korn Hirschman, a real-estate lawyer and volunteer at the United Nations and other organizations, died Jan. 24 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of liver failure, her family said.         Born in Manhattan, she grew up there and in Brooklyn. She earned her undergraduate and law degrees at New York University. She began practicing law in Manhattan with her brother, Ashton Korn, and after his death worked on her own.         For nine years she represented the International Federation of Women Lawyers at United Nations commissions dealing with discrimination, minorities, women, economics, crime, commodities trade, human rights and population growth.         She was a past president of the Sisterhood of the Community Synagogue, vice president of the Congregation Emanuel Sisterhood and chairwoman of its youth activities and board member of the Young Women's Hebrew Association. She headed the Mount Vernon branch of the American Red Cross and served on the board of its Westchester County chapter. She was also on the boards of the Mount Vernon Nursing School and Mount Vernon Hospital and founded the hospital's volunteer services.         Her husband, Dr. Sol Hirschman, is dead. She is survived by two daughters, Judge Aileen Hirschman Belford of Fall River, Mass., and E. Judith Hirschman Berger of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Richard James Hirschman of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Myra de Haven Woodruff, a specialist in child development who helped shape the modern nursery-school system during and after World War II, died on Friday at Medford Leas, a retirement community in Medford, N.J., where she had lived for the last 20 years. She was 95 years old.         Miss Woodruff, a native of Ogden, Utah, graduated from Oberlin College and Teachers College at Columbia University. She worked as a psychologist and helped establish programs for nursery schools and parent education in North Carolina and Pennsylvania before going to work for the New York State Department of Education in 1941.         Three years later, she joined the department's Bureau of Child Development and Parent Education. She was bureau chief from 1953 until her retirement in 1966. She was a past president of the Association for Childhood Education International and the author of many articles for professional publications.         Miss Woodruff left no immediate survivors.       
         Cecile Ruth Sands, who served for six years as the only woman on New York City's Board of Education and also worked for charitable causes, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         After her surprise appointment in 1955 by Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Mrs. Sands immediately became a pivotal member of the board and took controversial stands against McCarthyism and for integration.         In her first year on the board she was the sole dissenter against a measure to force school workers to inform on employees who had been Communists. Her view was vindicated when four teachers, who renounced the party but refused to inform on others, appealed to the State Education Commissioner. He overruled the board, saying, "This type of inquisition has no place in the school system."         In a 1957 talk to the Central Synagogue in Manhattan, she called for school integration to overcome the effects of racial separation in neighborhood housing patterns.         For 60 years she was on the board of the Hebrew Education Society, which ran a settlement house in Brooklyn, and was its first female president. She was an officer in the National Council of Jewish Women and the National Jewish Welfare Board.         Her husband of 36 years, Dr. Irving J. Sands, a neurologist and psychiatrist, is deceased. She is survived by two sons, Dr. William L. of Albany, N.Y., and Dr. Richard H. of Westport, Conn.; seven grandchildren; five great grandchildren, and a brother, Dr. Eugene A. Humbert of Atlantis, Fla.       
         Ellen H. Johnson, an influential art historian and curator who taught at Oberlin College in Ohio for 38 years, died yesterday at her home in Oberlin. She was 81 years old.         She died of cancer, said Elizabeth A. Brown, the curator of modern art at the museum.         At the time of her death, Miss Johnson was emerita professor of art at the college and honorary curator of modern art at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin.         On a national level, Miss Johnson was a powerful force in the promotion of contemporary art. She gave the work of several prominent New York artists early exposure through her curatorship of the Allen Art Museum's well-known Young Americans series. She was the first to show the black-striped paintings that established Frank Stella's reputation, and she also exhibited works by Claes Oldenburg, Larry Poons and Bruce Nauman before the artists were widely known. Mr. Oldenburg's first site-specific sculpture, "Three Way Plug," was commissioned by Miss Johnson in 1970 for the Oberlin campus.         Miss Johnson's persistence in seeking out young artists and urging acquisition of their work helped make the Allen Museum one of the country's leading institutions in the contemporary art field. And generations of students, among them Agnes Gund, now the president of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, were influenced by the popular course in modern art that she initiated at Oberlin.         Miss Johnson left her eclectic art collection, ranging from Cezanne to the American contemporary artist Judy Pfaff, to the Allen Art Museum, where it is currently on view. In her honor, the main portion of an addition to the museum, designed by Robert Venturi and opened in 1977, was named the Ellen Johnson Gallery of Modern Art.         Ellen Hulda Elizabeth Johnson was born on Nov. 25, 1910, in Warren, Pa. Her affiliation with Oberlin began early. She earned both her undergraduate and master's degrees there, and went on to postgraduate study at Uppsala university in Stockholm and the Sorbonne in Paris.         After a short stint as a lecturer and cataloguer at the Toledo Museum of Art, she returned to Oberlin in 1938 as a part-time instructor, and soon became a member of the regular teaching faculty. Her interest in Scandinavian art also led her to serve as visiting professor in the field at the University of Wisconsin in 1950-51, and to teach American art at Uppsala University in 1960.         In Oberlin, Miss Johnson lived in a Frank Lloyd Wright house, built for another owner between 1948 and 1950. Over a period of years, she painstakingly restored it and it became a showcase for her collection. She bequeathed the Wright house to Oberlin.         She is survived by a sister, Evelina Johnson McAvoy, of Erie, Pa., and a brother, Harry Johnson, of Warren.       
         Roberta Bender Grossman, the president and publisher of Zebra Books, died on March 13 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Walter Zacharius, the chairman of Kensington Publishing Corporation, which owns Zebra Books.         Mrs. Grossman was born in Brooklyn and attended New York University. When she founded Zebra Books with Mr. Zacharius in 1975, she became, at the age of 29, the youngest president of a paperback house. Over the next decade, she expanded the company's range of titles from historical romances to both paperback and hard-cover novels and general nonfiction. Authors published by the company, with whom Mrs. Grossman worked closely, included Jerzy Kosinski, Isaac Asimov and Joyce Carol Oates. In 1988, Zebra acquired Pinnacle Books, and Mrs. Grossman took on its presidency as well.         She is survived by her husband, Robin, and a daughter, Shoshanna.       
         Amy Ogden Welcher, a founder and first national president of Church Women United, a national ecumenical organization, died on Feb. 21 at her home at Avery Heights in Hartford. She was 104 years old.         She died of heart failure, a family member said.         In 1941, several women's church groups formed what was then called the United Council of Church Women and named Miss Welcher as president. Under her leadership, the organization became a strong advocate for peace and national unity, fighting against religious, racial and political bigotry.         She was an active member of the Congregational Church's Foreign Mission Board for more than 60 years and was involved in organizational work, visiting missions in China, Japan, India and Lebanon.         She is survived by a nephew, Richard Parke Welcher of Old Greenwich, Conn., and a niece, Jeanne Welcher Kleinfield of Glen Cove, L.I.       
         Harriet Mandelbaum, who spent decades of her life working in behalf of autistic and other mentally impaired children, died on Thursday at Caledonian Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 79 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Her family said a cerebral hemorrhage caused her death.         She was active both in her community and on the national level. A member of the United States Joint Commission on Mental Health for Children, she toured the country to speak about the special needs of such children. In 1951, she helped found the League for Emotionally Disturbed Children, which was dedicated to promoting educational and therapeutic facilities.         The league became the National Organization for Mentally Ill Children in 1955, and Mrs. Mandelbaum was its first president. For many years, she was involved in the growth of the League Treatment Center, for both children and adults, in Brooklyn, and of the League School. She was the first head of the school's board after it was founded in 1953.         Mrs. Mandelbaum is survived by her husband, Dr. Joseph Mandelbaum, himself a past president of the League School; two sons, Paul Mandelbaum, of Brooklyn, and Dr. Joel Mandelbaum, of Kingston, N.Y.; a daughter, Jo Travis, of Branchville, N.J., and two grandchildren.       
         Edna Simon Levine, a psychologist who founded many programs to help deaf people, died on April 7 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart ailment, a friend said.         Dr. Levine devoted her career to the problems of people with impaired hearing as an advocate, author, teacher, researcher, clinician and trainer of other professionals.         She organized the first comprehensive dictionary of sign language in 1964, which standardized the signs. She formed the Deaf Repertory Theater, helped create the Foundation for the Deaf and worked on adapting telephones for the deaf, including experiments with video telephones.         As a psychologist, Dr. Levine focused on helping deaf people cope with feelings of social isolation from hearing people. Directed U.N. Program         She directed a 1972 United Nations Task Force on Deafness and a 1974 national conference on training psychological workers for the deaf. She initiated the New York State Psychiatric Institute's mental health program for the deaf and founded New York University's research and training center for deafness rehabilitation, a forerunner of centers elsewhere.         Among her books were "Youth in a Soundless World" (New York University, 1956), "Psychology of Deafness" (Columbia University, 1960) and "Lisa and Her Soundless World" (Human Sciences, 1974), which was chosen as the children's book of the year by the Child Study Association of America. Her other honors included an honorary doctorate from Gallaudet University, which educates deaf students.         She was a past president of the Psychology Commission of the World Federation for the Deaf and a former board member of the American Psychological Association, the American Hearing Society, the Inter-Branch Library Association of New York and the New York League for the Hard of Hearing.         Dr. Levine, who was not deaf, was born in New York City and got started in the field after she trained as a teacher at the Lexington School for the Deaf in Manhattan. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees and a doctorate in psychology at New York University, where she later taught educational psychology for 15 years. She also earned a master's in special education at Columbia.         Her husband, Dr. Matthew Levine, a psychiatrist, is deceased. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Louise Leonard Wright, who was active for many years in women's and foreign affairs, died on April 17 at Crosslands, a retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 95 years old and had previously lived in Charlottesville, Va., and, until 1956, in Chicago.         Her family said she died after a brief illness.         A native of Wilmette, Ill., she graduated from the University of Minnesota, which cited her for its Outstanding Achievement Award 50 years after she received a master's degree there.         The National League of Women Voters also honored Mrs. Wright for 50 years of service. She was a member of the league's national board in the 1930's and headed its government and foreign affairs department when the United States entered World War II. In testimony before the Senate on the country's neutral status in 1939, she also spoke for the American Association of University Women, the General Federation of Women's Clubs, the National Board of the Young Women's Christian Association, the National Council of Jewish Women and the National Women's Trade Union League.         Mrs. Wright was a past executive director of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations and in the 1950's directed the Midwest office of the Institute for International Education. She was a former president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation and was active in the Institute of Pacific Relations.         Mrs. Wright is survived by her daughter, Rosalind Wright Harris of New York City; four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Rosa Lee Nemir Audi, a pulmonary and pediatrics specialist who worked 60 years as a doctor, teacher and researcher, died on Monday at Tisch Hospital at New York University in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Dr. Nemir, who used her maiden name professionally, died of lung fibrosis, her family said.         Among the first American women to become a full professor of pediatrics, Dr. Nemir promoted medical careers for women as president of the American Medical Women's Association, North American vice president of Medical Women's International and its representative to the United Nations.         Tuberculosis was a major focus of her work. Before the discovery of antibiotics to treat the disease, Dr. Nemir studied the effects of steroids in tuberculosis patients. She also was the first to use rifampin, which became a standard drug for TB, to treat children and followed one group of patients from childhood through the next 30 years.         Her entire career was at New York University's medical school and Bellevue Hospital Center, where she remained active until her recent illness. She had served as director of the Bellevue Children's Chest Clinic, medical director for the Adolescent Girls Clinic at the Judson Health Center and director of Pediatric Laboratories at Gouverneur Hospital.         She was also an officer of the Young Men's Christian Association, Brooklyn chapter manager for the American Red Cross and a member of the boards of the Irvington House for Children, the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society and the Willoughby House Settlement.         Born in Waco, Tex., she graduated from the University of Texas in 1926 and Johns Hopkins University Medical School in 1930.         Her husband of 35 years, E. J. Audi, who ran a furniture and carpet business, died in 1968.         She is survived by two sons, Alfred, of Syracuse, and Robert, of Lincoln, Neb.; a daughter, Elaine Audi Macken of Brooklyn; a sister, Aline Nemir Speer of Austin, Tex., and eight grandchildren.       
         Joan Hickcox Garrett-Goodyear, an associate professor of English at Smith College, died last Thursday at her home in South Hadley, Mass. She was 50 years old.         She committed suicide by asphyxiation, said her husband, Harold Garrett-Goodyear, a history professor at Mount Holyoke College.         During a 19-year teaching career at Smith, Dr. Garrett-Goodyear's research focused on 19th- and 20th-century fiction, particularly the works of Thackeray, Lawrence, and Nabokov.         A native of Washington, she earned a bachelor's degree from Swarthmore College in 1963 and master's and doctoral degrees in English from Harvard University in 1965 and 1975.

In the 1950's she was president of the New York Society of Ceramic Arts and her work was exhibited widely in New York galleries and at the Cooper Union Museum.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Melissa Stutsman Topping, an executive of the Henry Luce Foundation, died on Friday at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 49 years old and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.         She died of complications from cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Topping was the vice president and secretary of the Henry Luce Foundation in Manhattan and principal staff officer of its Clare Boothe Luce Fund. She administered $21 million in grants for scholarships, fellowships and professorships for women in science, to help remedy their under-representation in that field.         She was born in St. Louis and graduated from Vassar College in 1964. After working for a law firm and Citibank, she joined the foundation in 1969, where she progressed from research assistant to program associate, program officer, associate director and vice president.         Mrs. Topping was also a trustee of Pratt Institute, manager of the National Society of Colonial Dames in New York, an advisory council member of the New York Women's Foundation and a past board member of the Women's Prison Association and was also active in the Trust for Cultural Resources.

Stutsman Jr. of St. Louis; and two stepchildren, Henry J. 4th, and Samantha S. Topping, both of Manhattan.       
         Molly Picon, the comedic actress and singer who lightened and brightened the often dolorous themes of Yiddish theater with shows that were sprightly operettas, died yesterday in Lancaster, Pa. She was 94 years old.         She died in her sleep at the home of her sister, Helen Silverblatt, said Seymour Rexite, president of the Hebrew Actors Union.         Miss Picon, who was an indefatigable performer well into her 80's, had a stage career that dated from first efforts when she was 5 years old. With her sparkling         ganayvishe oygen,         or mischievous eyes, and her sturdy delivery of Yiddish songs with appropriate gestures and intonation, she reigned supreme in more than 200 productions along the Yiddish theater row that was lower Second Avenue during the 1920's.         She also appeared on Broadway, achieving her most notable success in a two-season run of "Milk and Honey," a hit musical that opened in 1961, when she was in her mid-60's. When she co-starred with Robert Morley in a London production of "A Majority of One," she was acclaimed by critics.         But it was in Yiddish theater, where audiences often measured their enjoyment by the volume of tears on both sides of the footlights, that Miss Picon established an international reputation by playing for laughs. An Idol in Jewish Neighborhoods         To millions of Jews in major cities of the United States, Europe, South America, Africa and Australia, "our Molly" meant the slender, vivacious comedian with the dark, dancing eyes and elfin face whose songs, dances and mimicry provided hilarious joy. Among the songs she helped turn into hits were "The Story of Grandma's Shawl" and "The Working Goil." She was idolized in Jewish neighborhoods, where children and clubs were named after her during her heyday in the 1920's.         Hers was the expansive, emotional style that would have been restricted by the colder performances tailored to the realism of Broadway. When she performed her first English-speaking starring role, in 1940 in Sylvia Regan's drama "Morning Star," Brooks Atkinson, who did not care for the show itself, wrote about Miss Picon in The New York Times, "To coin a phrase, she is a darling."         This was the universal sentiment that she aroused in critics and audiences alike with her talent for generating warmth and rapport. Miss Picon loved the uninhibited audiences of the Yiddish theater.         She had a flair that averted staleness and repetition. On the Yiddish stage, she used Broadway dance routines as much as possible and flooded the dialogue with English. Jacob Kalich, her husband and colleague from 1919 until his death in 1975, wrote more than 40 scripts for her, and Joseph Rumshinsky, the well-known composer, did most of her music. Mr. Kalich wrote for her one of her most sustained presentations, the play "Yankele," a sort of Yiddish Peter Pan story in which she portrayed a little boy. She later said she had appeared in it 3,000 times, a figure that might be taken merely to mean that it went on quite often. Her Yiddish Was Acquired         Curiously, Miss Picon had to develop her knowledge of Yiddish. She was born on Broome Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, on June 1, 1898, to an immigrant couple. They moved to Philadelphia when she was a child, a migration that made her English sound a bit alien in later years to Jews with the accent of East Side New York.         At the age of 5, Miss Picon won a teddy bear in a burlesque-house amateur program. Her mother recognized her talent and encouraged her, and young Molly started singing for 50 cents a night.         At age 15 she joined a Yiddish repertory company and toured as Topsy in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," switching languages -- English or Yiddish -- to suit the ears of the audience. Because she thought of a future in English-language theater, Miss Picon drifted into the cross-country vaudeville circuits, where she perfected her timing and her uncanny instinct for audience response. Made a Film With Sinatra         Her career changed suddenly when her vaudeville troupe was stranded in Boston. There Mr. Kalich persuaded her to join the Yiddish company he managed. After their marriage she went with him, in 1919, to Eastern Europe, where she perfected her Yiddish. Upon their return in 1923, she made her stage debut as the star of "Yankele."         In more recent decades, Miss Picon did less Yiddish theater, of which there was less to do. After "Milk and Honey" she worked mostly in English-language undertakings, in such plays as "Paris Is Out" in 1970 and "Something Old, Something New" (later called "The Second Time Around") in 1977 with Hans Conried. She appeared in the films "Come Blow Your Horn," which starred Frank Sinatra, and "For Pete's Sake," with Barbra Streisand.         In 1959, after an interval of many years, she returned to Second Avenue to star in a Yiddish vehicle, "The Kosher Widow." She wrote the lyrics to the music by Sholom Secunda, and the book was by Mr. Kalich and Louis Freiman. She had two roles in it, and the audience determined the story's outcome with an applause meter.         Miss Picon was particularly touched in 1946 when she and her husband were among the first entertainers to visit European camps for displaced people.         As she recalled in an interview years after the visit, "A woman came up with a child and said, 'My child is 2 years old and she has never heard the sound of laughter.' "         Her husband told Miss Picon: "Molly, that's our job. Make them laugh!"         In 1960, "Molly!," an autobiography written with Jean Bergantini Grillo, was published by Simon & Schuster.         Miss Picon is survived by her sister.         Correction:  April 8, 1992, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the actress and singer Molly Picon misstated the publication date of her autobiography, "Molly!" It was 1980.

         Joyce Macwatty Black, called "the ultimate volunteer" for her nearly 40 years as an officer of more than 75 charitable organizations and government panels, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 65 years old, and her primary residence was in Manhattan.         She died of metastasized breast cancer, her family said.

Stern, executive director of the National Assembly, a coalition of charitable organizations, called her "the ultimate volunteer."         "She has probably done more work in more organizations at higher levels and had more influence than any private citizen," he said at the time.         Three times she won the Mayoral Award for Outstanding Voluntary Service.

"I was born into a good life," she said, "and was encouraged to give back what I could."         Stricken with polio as a young adult, she said she vowed to help others if she recovered. When she considered becoming a social worker, she said Dr. Alex Rosen, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, had told her, "You will do a lot more good going on boards, raising money and getting involved in direct service to meet community needs."         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Hiram D. Black, a retired lawyer and financial consultant; a daughter, Suzanne O'Toole of Darien, Conn.; a sister, Suzanne Morris of Delray Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.

         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Olga Loeb, a trustee of Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center who did volunteer work for more than five decades, died on Sunday in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 97 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Mrs. Loeb managed her gift shop at the hospital on Friday as usual and died at Northern Dutchess Hospital of complications after an asthma attack, said a hospital spokesman. She was on a family visit when she became ill.         She was a native of Vienna who moved to the Bronx in 1911.         As a girl, she collected pennies for a new dispensary that became a forerunner of the hospital that her future husband helped to found in 1927 -- Bronx-Lebanon on the Grand Concourse in the Tremont section. A Buyer for Store Chains         She studied at Syracuse University and then built a successful career buying merchandise for department-store chains. She returned to the Bronx at the age of 40 and married Dr. Martin J. Loeb, a surgeon and philanthropist.         Mrs. Loeb became active in the hospital's Ladies' Auxiliary in 1942 and had been its president since 1953. She also served as an officer or head of various hospital committees as well as the Comprehensive Planning Board for her local health district.         After her husband's death in 1961, Mrs. Loeb persuaded the hospital board to convert part of a waiting room into a gift shop that she would run with a few volunteers. It sells flowers and teddy bears among other things and has raised more than $1 million for the hospital. Mrs. Loeb herself opened the shop every weekday at 7:30 A.M. and closed it at 5 P.M.         She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         May Rudin, philanthropist and matriarch of one of Manhattan's real-estate dynasties, died yesterday at her East Side home. She was 95 years old.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         A native of New York City, she was one of seven children born to immigrant parents. May Cohen dropped out of high school at the age of 15 and enrolled in a business school to study typing, stenography, bookkeeping and commercial law. She then went to work as a bookkeeper.         In 1923, she married Samuel Rudin, who four years later founded Rudin Management, realtors and builders, whose holdings now comprise dozens of tall buildings. The buildings, assembled over 60 years, were valued at $1.5 billion by analysts two years ago.         When Mr. Rudin died in 1975, his will established the Samuel and May Rudin Foundation, of which Mrs. Rudin was the chairwoman at her death. Well into her 90's, she played an active part in its disbursements, which at last count, in 1990, came to 222 grants totaling $5.3 million. Sponsors of the Marathon         The foundation primarily supported education, social and religious welfare agencies, hospitals and health associations as well as museums and the performing arts. The money was spent mostly in Manhattan, where the Rudins' assets are concentrated.         The Rudins also were the first business sponsors of the New York City Marathon. From its inauguration in 1976 until 1990, May Rudin waited at the finish line each year to present the Samuel Rudin Trophy to the man and woman who broke the tape. Her husband, she noted, was keen on long-distance running well before it became fashionable.         Foundation beneficiaries included St. Vincent's Hospital School of Nursing, AIDS-related programs, Phoenix House and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center to public-school children, Lincoln Center and New York University, where the foundation endowed a chair in the humanities.         Mrs. Rudin is survived by her sons Jack and Lewis, respectively the chairman and the president of the family business, both residents of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Helen M. Knubel, archivist of the Lutheran Church, died on Thursday at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 91 years old. She lived in New Rochelle, N.Y., until she recently entered the Wartburg Nursing Home, in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         Miss Knubel died of respiratory failure, said her nephew, Frederick H. Knubel.         Miss Knubel was considered the foremost archivist of the history of the Lutheran Church in North America. She helped to gather and maintain records of the earliest settlements of Lutherans in the United States and Canada and organized the library and archives of the National Lutheran Council, which coordinated the service work of more than 30 Lutheran groups.         From 1954 to 1966 she was secretary of research and statistics of the National Lutheran Council. From 1967 to her retirement in 1971, she was associate director of the Office of Research, Statistics and Archives to the council's successor, the Lutheran Council in the U.S.A. She also founded and directed the Oral History of Cooperative Lutheranism in America.         Miss Knubel was born in New York City. Her father, Frederick H. Knubel, was president of the United Church in America, from its founding in 1918 to 1944. Her brother, Frederick R. Knubel, was president of the United Lutheran Synod of New York and New England from 1945 to 1957.         Miss Knubel's formal schooling was interrupted at age 15, when she was struck by polio, which forced her to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. She studied at the New School for Social Research; the Biblical Seminary of New York, the predecessor to the New York Theological Seminary, and the Columbia University School of Library Service.         Among many honors, Miss Knubel was awarded the Distinguished Disciple Award of the Metropolitan New York Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.         In addition to her nephew, Frederick H. Knubel, of Manhattan, she is survived by a niece, Helen Perry, of Milford, N.J.       
         Hope Miller Lessman, a former actress and real estate executive, died on July 25 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 63 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her son, Lance.         As Hope Miller, Mrs. Lessman appeared in numerous dramas on film, the Broadway stage, and in television between 1940 and 1954. Her credits included the live television drama "This Thing Called Love" with Ralph Bellamy in 1948; the 1950 Broadway play "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep" with Fredric March, and the 1954 live television drama "The Wages of Fear," with Louis Jourdan.         In 1953 Mrs. Lessman married Herbert L. Miskend, the president of a New York-based apparel company, and retired from acting. When Mr. Miskend died in 1962, Mrs. Lessman became president of Dural Realty Corporation, a company Mr. Miskend had owned, and she managed several buildings on a portion of the site now occupied by the Continental Illinois Building at Madison Avenue and 53d Street in Manhattan. She held that post until 1969, when she sold her property there.         Mrs. Lessman married Jac Lessman, a hotel and resort developer, in 1965. He died in 1990.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her father, Henry. Both are from Manhattan.       
         Ruth Batchelor, a songwriter and radio and television reporter, died on July 23 at South Miami Hospital in Florida. She was 58 years old and lived in Key Biscayne, Fla.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Peter Kory.         Ms. Batchelor began her career as a songwriter, writing songs for Elvis Presley. She also wrote several musicals, including a version of "Tom Jones" for CBS-TV. In 1971, she released an album of women's liberation songs called "Reviving a Dream" on Femme Records, a company she began.         Ms. Batchelor founded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association in 1975, and was its president and executive director for three years. She was an entertainment reporter for ABC Television's "Good Morning America" and a film critic for National Public Radio.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Douglas, of Covelo, Calif.; her parents, Lil and Albert Tarshis of Las Vegas, Nev.; a sister, Lolo Berkoff, and a brother, Stanley Gordon, both of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.       
         Katharine Bradley Lenhart, a volunteer active for decades in civic and social causes, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan and Waterford, Conn.         Her family said she died after a brief illness.         Born in Nyack, N.Y., Mrs. Lenhart graduated from Vassar College and studied at the Art Students League of New York and the Bank Street College of Education. She worked as a decorator before becoming executive secretary of the Spence School.         Mrs. Lenhart had been active in charities that included the American Red Cross, Bellevue Hospital and the Child Care Volunteers of New York. She was a benefactor and past president of the former Masters Nursery.         Mrs. Lenhart was involved in rehabilitating deserted buildings and transforming vacant lots into pocket parks or gardens in the South Bronx, an experience she turned into a play, "The Greening of Rosita." She was a founding director of West Farms Land Trust in Waterford and sat on the boards of the Hudson River Conservation Society and the Tappan Zee Historical Society.         Mrs. Lenhart is survived by three sisters, Helen B. Buckland of Farmington, Conn., and Mary B. Blake and Elizabeth B. Brookfield, of Nyack, and a brother, Dr. E. Tremain Bradley of Norfolk, Conn.       
         Willa L. Z. Armstrong, the president of Armstrong Information Services, a Manhattan video-production company, died on Tuesday at the New York University Medical Center. She was 63 years old and had homes in Manhattan and at Ocean Ridge on Fire Island, L.I.         She died of cancer, said a friend, Helen L. Horwitz.         Mrs. Armstrong won many industry awards for her films, which included a range of educational and informational videos, public-service announcements and video-news releases. Several of her productions, including "Screen Printing: An American Art Form" and "Drive to Win," about four-in-hand equestrian driving, were broadcast on public television.         She was born in Manhattan and reared in Brooklyn. She received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College. Before founding her company in 1979, she was a vice president of Planned Communications Services, a corporate-video production company. She was a member of Women Executives in Public Relations and New York Women in Film.         She is survived by a brother, Walter Zanger of Jerusalem, and a stepson, Grattan V. Armstrong of East Hampton, L.I.       
         Rae Dalven, a translator of modern Greek poets and historian of Greek Jews, died on July 27 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Friends said she had been in declining health but they did not know the cause of death.         Dr. Dalven was retired as a professor of English literature and department chairwoman at Ladycliff College in Highland Falls, N.Y.         Born in Preveza, Greece, she immigrated to the United States with her family as a youngster. She graduated from Hunter College and earned a doctorate in English at New York University. Translated Greek Poetry         Among her translations was "Modern Greek Poetry" (Gaer, 1949). In a review, W. H. Auden wrote, "we should be very grateful to Miss Dalven for introducing us to a world of poetry which has been closed to us" by the language barrier. Mr. Auden later wrote the introductions to her "The Complete Poems of Cavafy" (Harcourt, Brace, 1961) and "The Fourth Dimension" (Godine, 1977), translating Yannis Ritsos.         Dr. Dalven also wrote two plays, the first of which, "A Season in Hell," about the French poets Rimbaud and Verlaine, was produced Off Broadway in 1950.         Last year she finished "Our Kind of People," an autobiographical play about a family of Greek-Jewish immigrants. It was performed at a synagogue in Manhattan and is scheduled for presentation this fall at a Brooklyn theater and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Manhattan. Studied Greek Jewish Group         Dr. Dalven's special interest was the history of Jews in Greece, especially the community in Ioannina in northern Greece, most of whose members were driven out during World War II. They were Romaniotes, who traced their ancestry to Palestinians and who migrated as early as 300 B.C. They retained their customs and liturgy, which differed from those of the more numerous Sephardim whose ancestors were expelled from Spain.         Dr. Dalven was the editor of "The Sephardic Scholar," a journal; a board member of the American Friends of the Jewish Museum of Greece and a past president of the American Society of Sephardic Studies and of the Sisterhood of Janina, a Romaniote group.         Her marriage to Jack Negrin ended in divorce. She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Marion P. Ames, a major force for court reform in New York State for 35 years and a leader in many other public causes, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         She died after an operation for spinal bone cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Ames was a Wall Street lawyer for 10 years but left that career to rear her children and concentrate on volunteer activities.         She worked to consolidate the antiquated system of diverse state and local courts, give proper financing and modern management, provide for discipline in instances of judicial misconduct, eliminate political abuses and promote merit selection of jurists.         The American Judicature Society, a national group for improving the courts, honored her with an award for the major progress she made on all those points. Led League of Women Voters         Serving as the president of the State League of Women Voters and head of its courts committee, Mrs. Ames waged her campaign in speeches, reports, news releases, lobbying, coalitions, testimony at hearings and letters to the editor.         She also served as vice chairwoman of the state Committee for Modern Courts, a non-profit organization. In 1973 Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed her to a new State Judicial Screening Committee -- and she publicly criticized its limitations.         "She really was the guiding light of the league's work, which played a lead role in court reform," said Elizabeth Hubbard, executive director of the Committee for Modern Courts. "She was always at the center of the movement to improve the system, someone we and political leaders and other groups always looked up to."         Mrs. Ames's other activities included serving as the board chairwoman of the College of New Rochelle and vice chairwoman of Barnard College.         She also led private social service agencies as president of the statewide Health and Welfare Network, New York Communities Aid Association and State Association for Community Services. Broad Spectrum of Causes         Among the issues she championed were liberalized voter registration laws, permanent political primary schedules, equitable welfare benefits and education aid, impartial legislative redistricting, an improved automobile insurance system and the release of mental patients from state institutions to local residences with support services.         Mrs. Ames was born in Manhattan. Her nickname was Pat, from her maiden name, Patterson.         She graduated from Barnard in 1937 and Fordham Law School in 1943. Her law practice specialized in estates, trusts and labor law.         Surviving are her husband of 51 years, George J. Ames, a partner in Lazard Freres & Company; four daughters, Ruth Solie of Northampton, Mass., Joan Berkowitz of Guilford, Conn., Margery E. Ames of Manhattan and Dorothy Cummings of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, William H. Patterson of Cincinnati, and five grandchildren.

         Peggy Zinsser Douglas, who helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the arts and other charitable causes in 60 years of volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 94 years old.         Her family said she died of unspecified natural causes.         Mrs. Douglas raised more than $100 million for the Metropolitan Opera and a few times more than that for all her other causes, said John O'Keefe, a longtime friend who worked with her for Lincoln Center. She lived much of her life in Manhattan.         She served on the boards of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Red Cross, the United Negro College Fund and Lincoln Center and was chairwoman of funds, committees and benefits for these organizations.         "Peg Douglas has been one of our secret weapons," Amyas Ames, the chairman of Lincoln Center, said in 1980 when Mrs. Douglas retired from the board of directors. "Whenever we had a tough nut of a corporate chief to crack, we'd send Peg to see him. She'd go in and in her quiet, forceful manner, she netted millions of corporate dollars."         Mrs. Douglas was also a leader in the English-Speaking Union, Women's Volunteer Service in London, Volunteer Parents, Child Adoption Service, a New York State panel on education and the Institute of International Education, an organization for exchange students. She also supported Lenox Hill Hospital and Shakespearean theater.         For 54 years she was married to Lewis W. Douglas. He was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first budget director, Ambassador to England under President Harry S. Truman and president of McGill University and the Mutual Life Insurance Company.         An active partner in his career, she helped him campaign for Congress and entertain dignitaries in London. The Douglases became friends of Winston Churchill and were among the few Americans invited to attend his funeral.         Concurring in her husband's break with President Roosevelt, Mrs. Douglas supported the Republican candidate in 1940, Wendell L. Willkie. Mrs. Douglas presided over the unveiling of a giant poster in Times Square saying, "No Third Term!" Mr. Douglas rejoined the Roosevelt Administration to help direct shipping in World War II.         Mrs. Douglas was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and graduated from Smith College.         Her family founded the Zinsser Chemical Company. Her sister, Ellen, married John J. McCloy, an adviser to several American Presidents, and a cousin married Konrad Adenauer, a Chancellor of West Germany.         Surviving are a daughter, Sharman Douglas of Manhattan; two sons, James of Tucson and Lewis Jr. of Denver; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Flast, the chairwoman of the New York Committee on Public Education and Religious Liberty, died on Saturday at her home in Novato, Calif. She was 71 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Blanche Lewis, the treasurer of the committee, which is known as Pearl, of which Mrs. Flast was a national vice president.         She was a principal in a suit -- Flast v. Gardner -- in the United States Supreme Court that gave individual taxpayers the right to go to Federal court to challenge laws that, in their opinion, provide public funds for non-public schools. Mrs. Flast was one of seven taxpayers who sued John W. Gardner, then the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to establish that principle under the doctrine of separation of church and state.         The plaintiffs contended that H.E.W. was violating the Constitution by disbursing tax money to benefit private and parochial schools. The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in the case in 1967 after a lower court held that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue because the amounts of their taxes involved were negligible. Other Taxpayer Suits         The Court's ruling in 1968 came in an 8-to-1 decision, and other taxpayer suits have followed in which plaintiffs challenged acts of Congress.         When she went to court, Mrs. Flast was the president of the United Parents Associations of New York City, an umbrella group of parent and parent-teacher organizations representing the parents of more than 250,000 public-school pupils.         She also served as an officer of the Community Service Society, one of the city's oldest and most prestigious civic organizations.         Born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Mrs. Flast graduated from Hunter College, and was elected to the Hunter Hall of Fame in 1975. She received an Americans United Award in 1969 for serving the cause of public education and church-state separation.         She is survived by her husband, Howard; two sons, Robert, of Westfield, N.J., and Barry, of Novato; a brother, Arnold Fassler of Williamsville, Vt.; a sister, Sue Kellerman of San Rafael, Calif., and three grandchildren       
         Julie Desloge Haggerty Hunnewell, a patron of the arts and civic figure on Long Island, died Aug. 19 at North Shore Community Hospital, in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 63 and lived in Glen Cove.         Mrs. Hunnewell died of cancer, said Tex McCrary, a family friend.         A native of St. Louis and a graduate of Manhattanville College, Mrs. Hunnewell was president of Corporate Art Inc., an art consulting firm, and had a long career as an expert in the interior design of corporate offices and hotels.         Mrs. Hunnewell was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and a trustee emeritus of the Berkshire School. She was also a founder and director of the Long Island Council on Alcoholism and founder of the Hazelden Fellowship Club of New York City. The club is affiliated with the Hazelden Institute of Minnesota, a leading rehabilitation center for people dependent on drugs and alcohol.         Mrs. Hunnewell is survived by her husband, Richard F. Hunnewell; six children, Joseph J. Haggerty, of Stowe, Vt., Louis D. Haggerty, of San Jose, Calif., Angela B. Haggerty, of Norwalk, Conn., Lucie B. Cook, of Plaistow, N.H., Bryan Haggerty, of Boston, and Leah Clark, of Waccabuc, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Rae Dalven, a translator of modern Greek poets and historian of Greek Jews, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Friends said she had been in declining health but they did not know the cause of death.         Dr. Dalven was retired as a professor of English literature and department chairwoman at Ladycliff College in Highland Falls, N.Y.         Born in Preveza, Greece, she immigrated to the United States with her family as a youngster. She graduated from Hunter College and earned a doctorate in English at New York University. Translated Greek Poetry         Among her translations was "Modern Greek Poetry" (Gaer, 1949). In a review, W. H. Auden wrote, "we should be very grateful to Miss Dalven for introducing us to a world of poetry which has been closed to us" by the language barrier. Mr. Auden later wrote the introductions to her "The Complete Poems of Cavafy" (Harcourt, Brace, 1961) and "The Fourth Dimension" (Godine, 1977), translating Yannis Ritsos.         Dr. Dalven also wrote two plays, the first of which, "A Season in Hell," about the French poets Rimbaud and Verlaine, was produced Off Broadway in 1950.         Last year she finished "Our Kind of People," an autobiographical play about a family of Greek-Jewish immigrants. It was performed at a synagogue in Manhattan and is scheduled for presentation this fall at a Brooklyn theater and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Manhattan.         Dr. Dalven's special interest was the history of Jews in Greece, especially the community in Ioannina in northern Greece, most of whose members were driven out during World War II. They were Romaniotes, who traced their ancestry to Palestinians and who migrated as early as 300 B.C. They retained their customs and liturgy, which differed from those of the more numerous Sephardim whose ancestors were expelled from Spain.         Dr. Dalven was the editor of "The Sephardic Scholar," a journal; a board member of the American Friends of the Jewish Museum of Greece and a past president of the American Society of Sephardic Studies and of the Sisterhood of Janina, a Romaniote group.         Her marriage to Jack Negrin ended in divorce. She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Alison L. Gertz, who contracted AIDS in a single encounter with a man at the age of 16 and drew international attention by telling her story as a warning to heterosexuals, women and teen-agers, died yesterday afternoon at her family's summer home in Westhampton Beach, L.I.         She was 26 years old and lived in Manhattan. Her parents, Jerrold and Carol Gertz, said she died of AIDS.         When Ms. Gertz first publicly told her story, in an interview with The New York Times in 1989, the AIDS epidemic was widely perceived as confined to homosexual men, intravenous drug abusers and blood-transfusion recipients.         She fit none of those categories. Her story was all the more dramatic because of the privilege she was born into, with artistic talent, affluence, private schools and social prominence. Public Crusader         Ms. Gertz became a crusader, speaking at schools, colleges and public events. She appeared on the cover of People magazine, Esquire named her woman of the year and her story was printed overseas.         Her many television appearances included "20/20," "Good Morning America," "Sally Jessy Raphael" and "Joan Rivers." Some celebrity interviewers became concerned friends. A film she recorded for the World Health Organization was first shown at the United Nations on World AIDS Day in 1989 and has since been shown internationally.         Molly Ringwald portrayed her in "Something to Live For: The Alison Gertz Story," a two-hour ABC network special that was broadcast on March 29. It prompted 189,251 calls to the Federal AIDS telephone line in 24 hours, a record. A majority of the calls were from women.         Dr. Mathilde Krim, co-founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, called her a pioneer in educating middle-class heterosexuals.         Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, has praised the ABC movie and said Ms. Gertz delivered "a powerful message to all Americans about the realities of AIDS." Hopes Suddenly Dimmed         An only child, Ms. Gertz was born in Manhattan and grew up on Park Avenue. Her father, the grandson of a founder of Gertz department stores, is a real-estate investor. Her mother cofounded a national chain of fashion stores, Tennis Lady.         Educated at Horace Mann School, Ms. Gertz studied art at Parsons School of Design. At 22, she was beginning a career as an illustrator.         "I was just, as they say, starting out in life," she said, with hopes of marriage and children.         But she began suffering puzzling ailments that eluded treatment. Finally, in 1988, she checked into Lenox Hill Hospital for tests. The ultimate diagnosis was AIDS.         The mystery of how she had become infected remained; her boyfriend at the time and a previous one tested negative. Eventually she looked up an old friend with whom she spent one romantic evening six years earlier, when AIDS was virtually unknown. He, it turned out, was bisexual and had since died of AIDS.         With medication, Ms. Gertz recovered from her initial illness and started on her mission.         "Unfortunately, a lot of people just flip by" AIDS reports about gay men and addicts, she said. "They think it doesn't apply to them. They can't turn the page on me. I could be one of them, or their daughter, and they have to deal with this." Encouraged Others         She received thousands of letters from around the world. She encouraged others who made their cases public, including Elizabeth Glaser, the wife of a television actor, who addressed the Democratic National Convention, and Mary Fisher, a former aide to President Gerald R. Ford who will speak to the Republican convention.         Friends of the Gertz family founded Concerned Parents for AIDS Research and have raised more than $1 million, and Ms. Gertz's friends hope to carry out her idea for an AIDS care program named Love Heals.         She is survived by her parents, who live in Manhattan.       
         Esther K. Gayner, a painter, sculptor and printmaker, died on Wednesday at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park. She was 78 years old and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         She died of pneumonia, which was a complication of leukemia, her family said.         Mrs. Gayner, a native of Trenton, began her training at the Trenton School for Industrial Arts in 1929 and graduated from New Jersey Teachers College in Trenton. She took postgraduate art courses at several schools, including that of the Museum of Modern Art, and her work was exhibited widely in New York, New Jersey and as far away as Italy and Israel.         Over the years, she worked to gain recognition for female artists. She was a board member and past president of the National Association of Women Artists and was active in the Artists Equity Association, the American Society of Contemporary Artists and the Alliance of Queens Artists.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Irving C. Gayner; two sons, Stephen, also of Forest Hills, and Jay D., of Manhattan; a sister, Dorothy Kasman of Manhattan, and one granddaughter.       
         Jean T. Chorley, a former professional singer and a civic leader, died on Saturday at her home in Skillman, N.J. She was 88 years old.         She had a history of heart disease and died in her sleep, her family said.         From 1934-41 she sang professionally as a mezzo-soprano under the stage name of Jean Travers. She performed at Radio City Music Hall, with the St. Louis Opera Company, on the Rudy Vallee and Chase & Sanborn radio shows and in concerts nationally and in Canada and Europe.         She was born Jeanette Baumohl in Manhattan. Her first husband, Morris Treistman, died in 1937. She remarried in 1941, to Kenneth Chorley.         Mr. Chorley, a close associate of Laurance S. and John D. Rockefeller Jr., served for 23 years as president of the Colonial Williamsburg restoration project and was an officer of several nonprofit organizations.         During that period, Mrs. Chorley and her husband entertained foreign officials and royalty. In the 1950's they restored an old brick farmhouse in Hopewell, N.J., and filled it with 18th-century antiques and English pottery. Mr. Chorley died in 1974.         Mrs. Chorley served as the board president of the Old Barracks Association, an American Revolution historical organization in Trenton, and also coached the lay readers at the Trinity Episcopalian Church in Princeton.         Surviving are a stepson, Edward C. Chorley of White Plains, 5 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Alice Woodard Fordyce, a philanthropist whose support of medical research in the last five decades included her involvement in the awarding of one of science's most prestigious prizes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fordyce died of heart failure, her son, James Woodard Fordyce, said.         For almost 50 years, Mrs. Fordyce and her sister, Mary Woodard Lasker, were the driving forces behind the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, which awarded the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards.         The $15,000 awards, given for significant achievement in basic and medical research, have long been considered second in prestige only to the Nobel Prizes. Forty-nine Lasker Award recipients were later awarded the Nobel Prize.         The foundation and the awards program were founded by Mrs. Fordyce, Mrs. Lasker and her husband, Albert, in 1944 to draw attention to major achievements in basic and clinical medical research and stimulate Federal financing of research. Mr. Lasker died in 1952.         Mrs. Fordyce served as executive vice president of the foundation and director of the awards program until December 1990. She remained a member of the foundation's board and a consultant to the awards program until her death.         Mrs. Fordyce, who was born in Watertown, Wis., the daughter of a bank president, graduated from Smith College in 1928 and studied at the Sorbonne and the University of Grenoble in France. The sisters' interest in supporting medical research stemmed from the ear infections that Mary Lasker endured and from both their mother and father's suffering from hypertension.         Mrs. Fordyce served on many governmental committees and with health-related organizations, including the United States branch of the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the International Council for Coordinating Cancer Research, the United States Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation, the Rockefeller University Council, the Geriatric Advisory Council of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Psychiatry Department at Columbia University.         Mrs. Fordyce was also involved with civic activities that included the American Museum in Britain, the Leeds Castle Foundation, Bargemusic and the Port of Entry Program at Queensboro College, which helps Chinese students learn American customs and practices.         Mrs. Fordyce's husband, A. Grant Fordyce, an architect, whom she married in 1939, died in 1972. She is survived by her sister, Mary Lasker of Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn.; her son, James of Greenwhich, and three grandsons.       
         Harriet W. Sheridan, former undergraduate dean at Brown University, died on Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was 67 years old and lived in Barrington, R.I.         The cause of death was cancer, said Don DeMaio, a Brown spokesman.         Professor Sheridan was hired as dean at Brown in 1979 and remained in the post until 1987, when she resigned to return to her longtime career, the teaching of English. She later founded the Center for the Advancement of College Teaching at the university and was noted for her course on literature and medicine, which proved popular with many medical students.         She had arrived at Brown from Carleton College in Minnesota, where she had spent 26 years and had served at various times as the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities, chairwoman of the English department and faculty chairwoman. She was also Carleton's acting president from January to August of 1977, succeeding Howard Swearer, who had resigned to become president at Brown.         A native of Manhattan, she received her bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1944, a master's from Smith College in 1945 and a doctorate in medieval English literature from Yale University in 1950.         Professor Sheridan was chairwoman of the American Association for Higher Education and a member of many educational groups, including the American Council on Education's Commission on Women in Higher Education. She was a former director of the Association of American Colleges and a former member of the Commission on Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.         She is survived by her husband, Philip; two daughters, Alison Buffum of Narrangansett, R.I., and Roo Sheridan of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.       
         Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         "Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics," said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. "With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."         Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts.         She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" cartoons. Watchdog of Helsinki Accords         On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment.         Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.         Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman.         She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks "if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet." Hail and Farewell and Oink         Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries.         In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: "I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good." Her reply was classic Fenwick: "That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."         When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: "We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."         Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor.         Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance. Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg         Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money.         After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987.         After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery.         Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims. Scandalized Her Family         Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge.         Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish.         As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own.         She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest.         She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled "Vogue's Book of Etiquette" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies.         Surviving are her son, Hugh Jr. of Bernardsville, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Susan Jenkins Kinnear, a former director of the Garden Club of America, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Ala. She was 94 years old and lived in Birmingham.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Polly Lincoln.         Mrs. Kinnear was a horticultural and artistic judge and a director of the Garden Club of America from 1977 to 1979, when she received the club's Zone Horticultural Award. A native of Butler, Pa., she graduated from Allegheny College in 1920.         Mrs. Kinnear's husband, James W. Kinnear Jr., a vice president of United States Steel, now the USX Corporation, died in 1990. She is survived by two sons, James W. 3d, of Greenwich, Conn., president and chief executive officer of Texaco Inc., and Peter, of Birmingham; a daughter, Polly Lincoln of West Hartford, Conn.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Judith N. Shklar, a professor of government at Harvard University, died Wednesday at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 63 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         She died of a heart attack, said Ariadne Valsamis, a Harvard University spokeswoman.         Professor Shklar specialized in 18th, 19th, and 20th century political and intellectual theory. From 1989 to 1990 she was president of the American Political Science Association, the first woman to head the nation's largest professional organization of political scientists.         In 1984 she was awarded a MacArthur Foundation fellowship for exceptionally talented individuals.         In 1985 she was awarded the teaching prize of the Harvard University chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Its citation described her as "demanding, rewarding, forthright, fair, and reasonable, a model of intellectual and human qualities rarely combined."         Born in Riga, Latvia, Professor Shklar emigrated with her family first to Sweden and then in 1941 to Canada. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from McGill University and a doctorate in 1955 from Radcliffe College. She taught at Harvard since 1956.         Professor Shklar is survived by her husband, Gerald Shklar, a professor at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine; two sons, David, of Cambridge, and Michael, of Leminister, N.H., and a daughter, Ruth, of Berkeley, Calif.       
         Pamela Hollingworth, who drew national attention at the age of 5 when she was lost for eight days in a New Hampshire forest, died on Sept. 11 at her home in Orleans, Mass., on Cape Cod. She was 56 years old and also had a home in Sarasota, Fla, where she retired recently.         She died of a heart ailment, her family said.         Miss Hollingworth was a former vice president of the American Cancer Society.         In October 1941, she was lost for eight days on Mount Chocorua, a 3,475-foot peak in the White Mountains National Forest, after wandering away from a picnic wearing only overalls and sneakers.         Her disappearance touched off a search by more than 400 rescue workers. She had nothing to eat but drank often from mountain brooks. Despite freezing nighttime temperatures, she was found unharmed two miles from the picnic site.         When the little girl was reunited with her father, her first words were, "Daddy, I've been waiting for you."         Miss Hollingworth was born in Lowell, Mass., and grew up there and in Chelmsford nearby. She graduated from Smith College in 1958 and started a public relations career in New York.         She became the editorial director of the Arthritis Foundation, corporate communications director for Lane Bryant, vice president for creative services at the Cancer Society and communications director of the United States Committee for the United Nations Children's Fund.         Survivors include her mother, Blanche, of North Conway, N.H., and a brother, Joseph E. Hollingworth Jr., of Carlisle, Mass.       
         Dr. Barbara McClintock, one of the most influential geneticists of the century, died on Wednesday night at Huntington Hospital on Long Island. She was 90 years old and lived nearby at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where she had conducted research for more than 50 years.         She died of natural causes, said Lisa Gentry, a spokeswoman for the lab.         Dr. McClintock had an uncanny ability to understand the nature of genes and how they interact decades before biologists discovered the molecular tools to dissect genetic material. Working with corn all her life, she is best known for her discovery that fragments of genetic material move among chromosomes, regulating the way genes control cells' growth and development.         Modern genetics has known no figure quite like Dr. McClintock, who worked alone and chose not to publish some of her revolutionary observations for years, explaining later that she thought no one would accept the findings. She never gave lectures, as most scientists do to build their careers. Instead, until her last days, she worked in her laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor 12 hours a day, six days a week. Until 1986, she did not have a telephone, requesting that anyone who wanted to talk to her write a letter instead.         Dr. McClintock's findings were so profound that she garnered honors and prizes throughout her long career, including membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1944, president of the Genetics Society in 1945, the National Medal of Science in 1970, the first MacArthur Laureate Award, for $60,000 a year for life, in 1981, and a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983.         She was the first woman to win an unshared Nobel Prize in that category and the third woman to win an unshared Nobel science prize. The first was Marie Curie in 1911 and the second was Dorothy C. Hodgkin in 1964, both for chemistry.         "She was a giant figure in the history of genetics," said Dr. James Shapiro of the University of Chicago. "I think she is the most important figure there is in biology in general."         Dr. James Watson, director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, the chemical that makes up genes, said Dr. McClintock was one of the three most important figures in the history of genetics, one of "the three M's," he said. The other two, Gregor Mendel and Thomas Hunt Morgan, lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries and laid the groundwork for notions of inheritance.         In the 1930's, she was a discoverer of the fact that chromosomes break and recombine to create genetic changes in a process known as crossing over, a discovery that explained puzzling patterns of inheritance. She also discovered a structure called the nucleolar organizer of the chromosome, which seemed to order the genetic material during cell division, a finding that was not explained by molecular biologists for three more decades.         J. R. S. Fincham of Edinburgh, Scotland, writing in the Aug. 20 issue of Nature, a British science journal, said that Dr. McClintock's "solitary style of work, total independence of thought and extraordinary record of getting things right have elevated her to the status of a prophet in the eyes of some."         Dr. McClintock spent her professional life working on corn, using the telltale patterns of colored kernels to disclose the breaking, joining and rearranging of genes and chromosomes inside the cells. Because the pigments of the kernels are inherited, Dr. McClintock could trace genes through the changes in the kernels.  Astonishing Earlier Discoveries         To the astonishment of molecular geneticists, whose precise tools now allow them to cut and snip submicroscopic genes, Dr. McClintock's discoveries about the nature of genes and inheritance were made at a time when no one even knew what DNA was.         In the 1930's, Dr. McClintock established her reputation by becoming one of the scientists to develop an understanding of chromosomes as the basis of heredity, work that was honored by her National Medal of Science.         Dr. McClintock's Nobel Prize was for her discovery that the genetic material is not fixed, but instead is fluid. Small fragments of DNA, called transposable elements, actually move from place to place and, in doing so, they control the expression of genes.         Dr. McClintock made this discovery nearly 40 years before she won the Nobel Prize, at a time when genetics was still so rudimentary that her ideas baffled other scientists and were often dismissed outright or ignored.         In an introduction to a volume of papers about Dr. McClintock, produced in celebration of her 90th birthday, Dr. Nina Fedoroff of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and Dr. David Botstein of Stanford University described Dr. McClintock's plight.         Her ideas about transposable elements, they wrote, were "ahead of her time and Barbara found herself in an anomalous and unique position," adding, "She was universally respected and admired as one of the leading geneticists of her era, yet the reaction to her latest and perhaps most profound discoveries and insights was often uncomprehending or indifferent and not infrequently dismissive or even hostile." Filed Her Early Data         Concluding that she could never convince the scientific community, Dr. McClintock doggedly carried on with her work, carefully filing her data away and writing them up only in her annual reports to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, which supported her work.         In her biography of Dr. McClintock, "A Feeling for the Organism," Dr.  Evelyn Fox Keller of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote that geneticists were baffled by Dr. McClintock's ideas because they seemed too much at odds with the very nature of Darwinian evolution. The theory of evolution holds that changes occur randomly in genes, giving rise to variations that may or may not prove beneficial.         Dr. McClintock, however, was saying that purposeful changes occur in genes, that transposable elements jump to specific places to insert themselves into genetic material and alter it.         Another stumbling block, Dr. Keller said, was that Dr. McClintock was working with corn, a species whose complex patterns of development were clear to her but not to many others. And she had done her work alone without the benefit of long discussions trying to explain her ideas to colleagues.         Finally, in the late 1970's, when molecular biologists isolated transposable elements in bacteria and then discovered that they were universally used by cells to control genes, Dr. McClintock's work was rediscovered and widely celebrated as prescient.         Dr. Shapiro said: "I think the implications of this work are just being realized. The idea that the genome is capable of repairing itself, and that it is capable of reconstructing itself, that there are systems in the cell that can detect damage and do appropriate things to repair it, has tremendous implications for evolution as well as for genetics." Knew Where 'Mysteries Lie'         Because Dr. McClintock worked alone, emphatically rejecting reductionism, because she was so often right and saw so clearly when others were muddled, she has gained a reputation as almost a mystic. But Dr. Shapiro said she was more "someone who understands where the mysteries lie than someone who mystifies."         Dr. McClintock "understands the complexity of the genome and the limits to our understanding of it," he said, adding, "She appreciated that the problems we are addressing are enormously deep and complex."         Dr. Keller described Dr. McClintock as a person who from infancy valued her solitude and independence.         Barbara McClintock was born on June 16, 1902, in Hartford. The daughter of a doctor, she grew up in Brooklyn and learned to love science while attending Erasmus Hall High School there. When she was 17, she enrolled at Cornell University's College of Agriculture, a university that had been extremely hospitable to women.         When she was a junior she was invited to take the university's graduate course in genetics and became, unofficially, a graduate student. From the time she received her Ph.D. in 1927 until 1941, she worked at Cornell University and at the University of Missouri, collaborating with some of the country's most eminent geneticists. From 1941 until her death, Dr. McClintock worked at Cold Spring Harbor, following her own course.         Dr. McClintock is survived by a sister, Mignon Crowell, who lives in Florida, and a brother, Thomas N. McClintock of Newtown, Conn.       
         Eleanor H. Raynolds, an executive search consultant who was honored by the Queen of England for her work for the British-American Chamber of Commerce, died on Tuesday at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut. She was 55 years old and lived in Stamford.         The cause of her death was a massive staphylococcus infection, said Penny Paul Mooney, an associate at Ward Howell, the executive search firm where she was a partner. She said the cause of the infection has not been determined.         Mrs. Raynolds joined Ward Howell in 1985. Founder of Peer Group         During the early 1980's, she served consecutive terms as president of the British-American Chamber of Commerce, for which she was made a Commander of the British Empire. She was also a founder of the Peer Group, a national association of women in management and the arts, and served as a director of the New York Mission Society, the Women's Economic Round table and Mary Baldwin College.         Together with her husband, John F. Raynolds 3d, former president of Outward Bound USA, she wrote "Beyond Success -- How Volunteer Service Can Help You Begin Making a Life Insead of Just a Living."         Mrs. Raynolds, who trekked in the Himalayas and the Andes and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, had just returned from a horse-riding trip in Utah when she died.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two children from a previous marriage, a son, Jayson Kuhn of Silver Spring, Md., and a daughter, Jennifer Irwin of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and by two grandchildren.       
         Maggie Comer Robinson, whose efforts to overcome her own impoverished background and inspire her children to pursue higher education were recounted in a biography and in a television documentary, died Monday at St. Catherine's Hospital in East Chicago, Ind. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Robinson died of septicemia, a blood infection, said a son, Dr. James P. Comer of North Haven, Conn.         Her five children earned a total of 13 undergraduate and graduate degrees, and all seven of her grandchildren are college graduates.         It was Dr. Comer's recounting of his mother's life in "Maggie's American Dream: The Life and Times of a Black Family," published by New American Library in 1988, that brought her to the nation's attention. PBS Documentary         Her story was retold in a Public Broadcasting Service documentary, "The Legacy of Maggie's American Dream," which was first broadcast last month.         Mrs. Robinson, who was born in Woodland, Miss., and reared in Memphis, moved to East Chicago in 1920. She met her first husband, Hugh Comer, in the New Hope Zion Church, where he was a deacon. He died in 1955, and she later married Ervin Robinson of East Chicago. Mr. Robinson died in 1985.         She was a member of the Mothers Board of the New Ebenezer Baptist Church and a vice president of the Washington High School P.T.A. Among the many honors she received after her biography was published was an honorary doctorate awarded last year by Wheelock College in Boston.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Robinson is survived by two other sons, Dr. Norman D. Comer and Dr. Charles Comer, both of East Chicago; two daughters, Louise Comer of Eufala, Ala., and Thelma C. Morris of Gary, Ind.; two sisters, Susie Cossey and Carrie Watkins, both of East Chicago; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Edith Sable, a longtime civic leader who fostered voter participation and recruited public officials and business leaders to debate New York City's problems and future, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         For four decades Mrs. Sable was a League of Women Voters volunteer and officer. She was the economic development director of its New York chapter and was also on the national board.         She focused on the city's government structure, financing and management, as well as its economy. In the city and state fiscal crises in the 1970's, she convened seminars for officials and others to learn about and discuss finances and charter reform.         "Edith's meetings were one of the best sources of background information," said Elizabeth Cooke, then a municipal union lobbyist and now president of the Bronx Museum of the Arts. "Personal and political agendas were pretty much put aside, and thoughtful people struggled with difficult issues." Published 'They Represent You'         Mrs. Sable's later conferences examined city management in 1979, the capital budget process in 1981, infrastructure in 1983, public authorities in 1985 and contract procedures in 1989. She also organized sessions on the city's economy with officials, executives and economists speaking and touring sites from the Fresh Kills landfill to the Hunts Point market.         She started the league's popular reference booklet "They Represent You and Your Community," listing elected officials with their addresses and telephone numbers and district maps.         When the city created community boards, she produced an explanatory pamphlet. And to visualize the city's economy and financing, she created charts titled "Money Go Round."         She also worked several stints in government. She served in the city transportation agency and in public relations for Mayor Robert F. Wagner. She was also an aide to Angier Biddle Duke and Eleanor Roosevelt at the United Nations.         Mrs. Sable, whose maiden name was Berger, was born in Manhattan and graduated from New York University. Her husband of 48 years, Benjamin, died in 1986. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz, a great-grandniece of Chief Sitting Bull, who devoted her life to making American Indian culture available to other Americans, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 85 years old and had lived in Forest Hills, Queens, and Douglaston, Queens, since 1928.         She died of cancer, said Marjorie Weinberg, a family friend.         As director of the Indian Village at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island from 1930 to 1950, Rosebud, as she preferred to be called, enthralled legions of visitors with information about and stories from Indian culture.         Rosebud, who was born near Rapid City, S.D., was a descendant of the Lakota-Oyate, called the Sioux by the white settlers. Through her family's prominence, she came to know many well-known figures like President Calvin Coolidge, whom she helped induct into Lakota membership in 1927; Cecil B. DeMille, who tried to persuade her to star in his films, and the planner Robert Moses, who hired her for the Jones Beach post.         Last year Edward Castle, a reporter for The Las Vegas Sun, contended that it was her name that inspired Orson Welles to make "Rosebud" the last word spoken by Charles Foster Kane, the protagonist of his 1941 film classic, "Citizen Kane." He based his assertion on what he said were recently discovered daily sign-in sheets for the CBS Radio Network, where both Mr. Welles and Rosebud worked on several dramatic shows during the late 1930's.         Mr. Welles, who died in 1985, never revealed the source for the name "Rosebud."         After leaving her post at Jones Beach in 1950, Rosebud continued to lecture and write on Indian culture. Her book, "The Album of the American Indian," was published in 1969 by Franklin Watts Inc., and a second book, "Tonewaya and the Eagles," was published in 1979 by Dial Press.         In 1989 Rosebud received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from the University of South Dakota. She had attended the university from 1925 to 1927.         Rosebud's first husband, Arthur de Cinq-Mars, died in 1949. A sister, Chauncina Yellow Robe White Horse, died in 1981.         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz is survived by her husband, Alfred Frantz; a daughter, Tachawin Moy, of Brooklyn; a granddaughter, Karen Winona Moy, of Manhattan; and a sister, Evelyn Robe Finkbeiner, of Bad Pyrmont and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.       
         Bertina Suida Manning, a scholar of Italian art and a collector of French and Italian paintings and drawings, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         She died of heart failure, said a friend, Mary Jane Harris.         Mrs. Manning was born in Vienna and was the only child of William E. Suida, an eminent Viennese art historian known for his work on Leonardo da Vinci and Genoese painting. She moved with her parents to the United States in 1939 and attended Queens College and the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, where she met her husband, Robert Lee Manning, an art collector who became director of the art gallery at Finch College in Manhattan.         With her father, she wrote a book on Luca Cambiaso, a 16th- century Genoese painter. From her father, Mrs. Manning inherited thousands of Italian and French paintings and drawings, to which she and her husband added major works. During the 1950's she advised the collector Walter P. Chrysler Jr. In 1962-63, she and her husband organized the first United States exhibition of Genoese painting, which traveled from Dayton, Ohio, to Sarasota, Fla., to Hartford. Since 1989 she had served as president of the Godwin-Ternbach Museum at Queens College.         The Mannings were known for making their collection at their home available to students, curators and many others from around the world. Works from the Suida Manning collection have been donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Morgan Library and the National Gallery in Washington, among other institutions. Paintings by Guercino and Mattia Preti are among the works now on loan to the Metropolitan, where they are on view in the museum's galleries of Baroque painting.         She is survived by her husband; her daughter, Sandy Manning Dolnier, and a grandson, John Robert Dylan.       
         Elinor Kridel Bernheim, a social-welfare volunteer whose widely cast interests ranged from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and Columbia University's School of Social Work to a community center she founded in the Bronx, died yesterday at her Upper East Side home. She was 85 years old.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Bernheim relentlessly made the rounds of board rooms, foundation offices and charity luncheons and dinners, starting in the 1940's. In 1975, she still sat on the boards of 11 charities. At the time, The New York Times's About New York column described her as "The Queen of Volunteers," who was "the champion volunteer worker in town."         "I love this kind of work," she said between meetings with people who held the purse strings to grants for worthy causes. Sometimes it kept her busy for 15 hours a day, she said.         "You know why we do it?" she asked. "Because it shows we're alive. So many of the younger women now want to get paid. It's a status thing with them."         "I'll tell you what I'm good at," she declared. "I'm good at finding people for boards because I know a lot of people. I'm good at organizing, fund-raising and whipping up enthusiasm.         "I don't fight with anyone unless I have to get things done -- and then I'm a dog, very mean." She also was a critic of professional social-work jargon that she said could scare otherwise interested laypeople off.         Mrs. Bernheim, whose late husband, Leonard, was a stockbroker, suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1985. She recovered enough to return to the causes closest to her heart -- in a wheelchair or by telephone -- until her death.         Among those lasting interests were the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center, which she began in the 1950's and presided over until 1970. It was innovative because it was affiliated with a hospital, Montefiore Medical Center. Others included the New York chapter of the National Council on Alcoholism and Young Concert Artists, which helps talented young people to start a career.         Also remaining dear to her heart was the New York School of Social Work at Columbia, a place where she did postgraduate work after her 40th birthday, in the 1947-48 academic year. She later served as a member of its advisory board and took special pride when Columbia awarded her its Bicentennial Medal in 1956. It was but one of many honors bestowed on her.         Mrs. Bernheim was born Elinor Kridel in New York City on June 26, 1907, and graduated from Vassar College in 1928. By 1941, she was a member of the board and the council of the Association for Aid for Crippled Children.         Her relationship with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies went back to her years as a young woman. She became a trustee in 1942 and two years later was co-host of a luncheon addressed by Eleanor Roosevelt.         She served as chairwoman of the women's division fund campaigns in 1943, 1944 and 1949. After that, she became a vice president of the federation and board chairwoman of the women's division.         Over the decades, Mrs. Bernheim also was an officer or otherwise involved in, among others, the Jewish Association of Neighborhood Centers, the National Jewish Welfare Board, the National Conference for Social Welfare, an advisory committee on volunteer services for the Veterans Administration, the United Neighborhood Houses of New York City, the National Council on Social Work Education and the Associated Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Associations.         She was also involved with the Community Council of Greater New York, the Community Service Society, the National Homemakers Service Council and the Brookdale Institute on Aging, among others. She was a co-founder of the Florence G. Heller Research Center. She served three terms as vice president of the Community Council of Greater New York and was elected its first president in 1973.         Mrs. Bernheim's husband died in 1980. She is survived by two sons, Leonard H. Jr. and Charles A., both of Manhattan, and two granddaughters.       
         Fairy D. McIntire, a religious leader and the wife of Dr. Carl McIntire, president of the International Council of Churches, died on Sept. 13 at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 85 years old and lived in Collingswood, N.J.         She died of cancer, said a daughter, Celeste M. Bashaw of Princeton, N.J.         Mrs. McIntire was deeply involved in the work of Mr. McIntire's church, the Bible Presbyterian Church, in Collingswood, and in the international council, an organization of more than 500 fundamentalist churches.         She was president of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Faith Theological Seminary in Elkins Park, Pa., and chairwoman of the auxiliary to the Christian Admiral Bible Conference and Freedom Center in Cape May, N.J.         In addition to her husband and daughter, she is survived by a son, Carl T., of Toronto; another daughter, Marianna M. Clark, of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a sister, Oleta McCarty, of Pensacola, Fla.; 13 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Meusebach Carrington, who did volunteer work for a variety of charitable organizations, died yesterday at her Upper East Side home. She was 77 years old.         She died of cancer of the esophagus, said a daughter, Judith C. Green of Manhattan.         At the time of her death Mrs. Carrington was on the board of the Youth Counseling League, which aids troubled children. Earlier she was its president for seven years, a vice president of the New York Junior League and a member of the auxiliary board of the New York Philharmonic.         A native of St. Louis, she was married in 1934 to John C. Carrington, who became an executive vice president of The Freeport Minerals Company and the president of the Hewitt School's board of trustees. He died in 1979.         She is also survived by her daughter Elizabeth C. Bierman of Manhattan and four grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Kirsten, an American lyric soprano who sang leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera for 30 years and was particularly renowned for her performances of Puccini heroines, died yesterday morning at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of complications from a stroke she suffered on Nov. 5, said Peter Gravina, her longtime press representative.         At the height of her career, in the 1950's and 60's, Miss Kirsten appealed not only to opera fans, who knew her as an attractive, intelligent, thoroughly musical singer and a fine actress, but also to a broader public that knew her from her frequent radio and television appearances or from her performances in the films "The Great Caruso," with Mario Lanza, and "Mr. Music," with Bing Crosby.         On the opera stage, her repertory ran from staples like Mimi in Puccini's "Boheme" to comparative rarities like the title role in Charpentier's "Louise." In her concert and television appearances, she sang not only opera arias but theater and popular songs as well, and she co-starred with Frank Sinatra on the radio show "Your Hit Parade." Musical Heritage         Miss Kirsten was born into a musical family in Montclair, N.J., on July 6, 1910 (although she gave her birth year variously as 1917 and 1915). Her mother was an organist and music teacher. Her great-aunt, Catherine Hayes, had an operatic career and was known as "The Irish Jenny Lind." Her grandfather was a conductor and an early president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians.         She was drawn to music and acting early in life, but did not set her sights on an operatic career until she had achieved some modest success as a popular singer. After leaving high school when she was 16 years old, Miss Kirsten worked as a demonstrator of Singer sewing machines and as what she called a trouble-shooter at New Jersey Telephone, while studying voice in New York City at night. When she had made some progress and wanted more frequent lessons than she could afford, she agreed to work for her teacher, Louis Darnay, as both secretary and maid in exchange for lessons.         By 1937, she was singing professionally on radio, both as a member of the Kate Smith Chorus and in her own solo spots with several dance orchestras. The soprano Grace Moore heard her in 1938 and became her mentor and benefactor, sending her to Rome for a year of study with Astolfo Pescia, who was Beniamino Gigli's vocal coach. She had planned to spend a second year in Italy and then a year in France, but returned to New York at the start of World War II.         Upon her return in 1939, Miss Kirsten made her professional concert debut in a stage show at the New York World's Fair. She was also reunited with Miss Moore, who recommended her to the Chicago Grand Opera, where Miss Kirsten made her operatic debut as Pousette in Massenet's "Manon" in 1940. Miss Kirsten sang 15 minor roles during her first season and the following year shared the stage with Miss Moore in a Chicago performance of "La Boheme," singing Musetta to Miss Moore's Mimi.         In 1942, Miss Kirsten began to sing leading roles with the San Carlo Opera Company, in Washington and New York City. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1943, and by 1945 had performed with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras. Starting in September 1943, she had her own radio program, "Keepsakes," which ran for a year.         Miss Kirsten's Metropolitan Opera debut, as Mimi in "La Boheme" on Dec. 1, 1945, was a critical success, and was the start of a 30-year association with the house. In 1971, when she celebrated her 25th anniversary with the company, she reminisced about that debut, and recalled that Miss Moore sat in the first box, at the side of the stage, and threw roses to her. When Miss Moore died in a plane crash in Denmark in 1947, Miss Kirsten sang Schubert's "Ave Maria" at her funeral.         Miss Kirsten's career was centered in the United States, but she did tour Europe and, in 1962, the Soviet Union. There, besides giving recitals, she sang Violetta in a Bolshoi Opera performance of "La Traviata," to considerable acclaim, even though, as she said later, she had to go on without the benefit of a stage rehearsal. Worked With Composers         During her years at the Met, Miss Kirsten sang most of the important Puccini roles, including the title roles in "Manon Lescaut," "Tosca" and "Madama Butterfly," and she starred as Minnie in a revival of "La Fanciulla del West" that helped restore the work to the repertory. She prepared for the title role in "Louise" by going to France to study it with the composer. She also worked with the composer Italo Montemezzi on "L'Amore dei Tre Re" before she performed it in San Francisco and at the Met.         In addition to the Puccini heroines, her repertory included the female leads in Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette" and "Faust," Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Verdi's "Traviata." She sang in the American premieres of Walton's "Troilus and Cressida" and Poulenc's "Dialogue des Carmelites," both in San Francisco.         Miss Kirsten's voice was not huge, but she used it gracefully throughout her long career. When she gave her farewell performance at the Met, on Dec. 31, 1976, Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times that "she sang and acted the part of Tosca with the vocal control and dramatic acuity of a prima donna in mid-career."         In an article she wrote for Opera News just before that performance, Miss Kirsten attributed her vocal longevity to her refusal to accept roles that she felt were too heavy for her voice.         "I've always believed in the principle of protection, and I never sang a role I felt was not right for my voice," she wrote. "This took courage and drew some criticism along the way, but after 30 years of preserving Puccini's legato and tessitura I don't have to apologize to anyone, do I?"  Video Releases         Miss Kirsten's autobiography, "A Time to Sing," was published in 1982. Recently, several of her television performances on the "Voice of Firestone" program, including the Poker Scene from "Fanciulla," "Vissi d'Arte" from "Tosca" and several popular songs, have been released on tape by Video Arts International. And her recordings of several Romberg operettas have been reissued by Angel Records.         Miss Kirsten's first marriage, to Edward MacKayes Oates, ended in divorce in 1949. In 1951 she married Dr. Eugene Chapman, who died in 1954. In 1955, she married Dr. John Douglas French, a neurosurgeon who was director of the Brain Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. When Dr. French developed Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980's, Miss Kirsten testified at a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and in 1983 she set up the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research. Dr. French died in 1989.         She is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Parker of Tucson, Ariz., and Ethel Anderson of Lenoir, N.C., and a brother, George, also of Lenoir.       
         Audre Lorde, a black feminist writer who became the poet laureate of New York State in 1991, died on Tuesday at her home on St. Croix. She was 58 years old.         She died of liver cancer, said a friend, Blanche Cook.         Ms. Lorde had had cancer for 14 years and in 1980 wrote "The Cancer Journals," which traced the first stages of her disease.         From the publication of her first book in 1968, Ms. Lorde's 17 volumes of poetry, essays and autobiography reflected her hatred of racial and sexual prejudice. Among them are "Cables to Rage" (1970); "Coal" (1976); "Zami: A New Spelling of My Name" (1983), and, most recently, "Undersong: Chosen Poems Old and New," which was recently published by W. W. Norton.         A collection of essays, "A Burst of Light," won an American Book Award in 1989. Her 1973 collection, "From a Land Where Other People Live," was nominated for a National Book Award.  Active Politically and Academically         Ms. Lorde, who also used her adopted African name, Gamba Adisa, was born in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter College and the Columbia University School of Library Science. She became an English professor at Hunter and lectured widely throughout the United States, Europe and Africa. She was active in many literary and political organizations and a founding member of Women of Color Press and Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa.         She was an outspoken lesbian and served on the board of the Feminist Press in New York City and often gave readings of her works at Judith's Room, a feminist bookstore in Greenwich Village.         Among her honors were the Walt Whitman Citation of Merit in 1991, making her the poet laureate of New York; the Manhattan Borough President's Award for Excellence in the Arts in 1988, and honorary doctorates from Hunter, Oberlin and Haverford Colleges.         Her marriage to Edwin Rollins ended in divorce.         She is survived by her companion, Gloria I. Joseph of St. Croix; a son, Jonathan Rollins, and a daughter, Elizabeth Lorde-Rollins, both of New York City, and four sisters, Helen Lorde, Phyllis Blackwell and Marjorie and Mavis Jones.       
         Enid Schechter, who served as the executive assistant to four Speakers of the New York State Assembly in the Legislature's New York City office, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Ms. Schechter's 20-year career on the legislative staff included working for Speakers Stanley Steingut, Stanley Fink, Melvin Miller and Saul Weprin. Before her government work, she was an assistant to the president of London Records.         She was born in Great Neck, L.I., and was a graduate of Drew University.         Surviving are her husband, Martin; a son, Steven; a daughter, Susan Weprin, who is married to a nephew of the Speaker, and a granddaughter, all of Manhattan.       
         Alice I. Bryan, a psychologist who fostered the advancement of women in her profession and who led a major study on the role of libraries, died on Friday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, her relatives said. Her death was reported yesterday by Columbia University, where she had taught for 35 years.         Dr. Bryan was a founder and president of the National Council of Women Psychologists. Its first meeting was held in her apartment. She was also an officer of the American Association for Applied Psychology and the American Psychology Association.         This year she addressed the American Library Association, which honored her on the 40th anniversary of her book "The Public Librarian." Based on interviews with more than 3,000 librarians, it explored the role of libraries as centers of mass communication.         Dr. Bryan started teaching part time at Sarah Lawrence College and Pratt Institute in the 1930's, and joined Columbia's Library School in 1939 as a psychologist and teacher. She became its first female full professor and helped organize its doctoral program. She retired in 1971.         Dr. Bryan, whose family name was Bever, was born in Kearny, N.J. Her marriages to Chester Bryan and Frank Blasingame ended in divorce. Her third husband, George V. Fuller, died in 1960.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Carol Weil Haussamen, a New York City philanthropist, hostess and Democratic fund-raiser, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71 years old.         Her family said she died of cancer of the esophagus.         Mrs. Haussamen, a real-estate heiress, was born in Manhattan, the daughter of L. Victor Weil, a real-estate executive, and the former Beatrice Schwab. She attended private schools, including the Birch Wathen School in Manhattan, acquired fluency in French from her governesses and traveled extensively when her mother showed horses. In those years the family also kept an estate in Elberon, N.J., where she spent her summers. Hostess to Ambassadors         From her father she inherited, among other properties, a building on Central Park South, and with it a palatial 20th-floor, 18-room apartment. For the last 25 years or more her home served as a fountainhead of funds for Democratic candidates from around the country.         She served as hostess for foreign ambassadors during the 1976 national convention, and she often entertained other visiting foreign dignitaries as well. She played a role in every subsequent campaign, though her family said that in this Presidential election year she had to curtail her activities somewhat because of her health.         She was the president of the nonprofit Carol W. Haussamen and Carolyndale Foundations, which she dedicated to the rehabilitation of housing for the poor. She also headed Forty Central Park South Inc., a company that owns and manages apartment buildings.         She served in various capacities on the Governor's Committee on Scholastic Achievement, Just One Break Inc., Manhattan Industrial Home for the Blind, Community Board No. 5, First Women's Bank of New York, Urban Design Council, Citizens Housing and Planning Council, Association for a Better New York, Mayor's Midtown Committee and Roosevelt Island Development Corporation.         Her marriages to Crane Haussamen and Monroe Hemmerdinger ended in divorce.         Mrs. Haussamen is survived by a son, Dale Hemmerdinger of Manhattan; a daughter, Lyn Hemmerdinger of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.       
         Ellen Furman, a founding member and a past president of the New York City chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62 years old.         Mrs. Furman died of complications of diabetes, said her family, which reported her death yesterday.         Mrs. Furman, who was a graduate of Finch College, had suffered from diabetes since infancy. She devoted her life to urging the public in general and those suffering from diabetes in particular to press for more research that might lead to a cure.         The foundation is the chief private financial supporter of scientific research on diabetes.         The New York Juvenile Diabetes Foundation chapter is the largest of the organization's 126 chapters in the United States and abroad. Mrs. Furman helped found the volunteer organization in the early 1970's, and served a year's term as president from 1974 to 1975. She also held several other positions with the foundation.         In 1992, Mrs. Furman received the Shining Star Award from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation for her "longstanding commitment to find the cure for diabetes."         Mrs. Furman is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Julie Rosenthal, and two sons, Matthew and Ted, all of New York City.         Correction:  November 27, 1992, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Ellen Furman, a founding member and a past president of the New York City chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, misstated her age. She was 52 years old.       
         Catharine A. Yard, president of the American Timber Company, died on Thursday at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J. She was 48 years old and lived in Sea Girt.         Ms. Yard died of pneumonia, said Michael Cherenson, a family spokesman.         In 1990 Ms. Yard became president of American Timber, which was founded by her grandfather in 1893. Ms. Yard, who attended Yuba College in Marysville, Calif., and Chico State University in Chico, Calif., had worked for the company since 1968.         Ms. Yard is survived by a son, Michael Saito, and three daughters, Michelle, Mikiko and Mary Catherine Saito, and her mother, Dorothy, all of Sea Girt; two sisters, Elizabeth Rasmussen, of Chico, Calif., and Victoria Steiner, of Seattle; four brothers, William, of Modesto, Calif., Carl Jr., of Wall Township, N.J., Richard, of Jackson Township, N.J., and Stephen, of Oroville, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Norma K. Regan, a high school teacher and sculptor, died on Tuesday in a convalescent home in West Hartford, Conn. She was 95 years old and had been a longtime resident of Hartford.         She died of pneumonia, said a spokesman for the DellaVeccia Funeral Home in Southington, Conn.         A member of the Hartford public school system for many years, Miss Regan taught English at Weaver and Bulkeley high schools. She also coached students for college entrance examinations.         Inspired by Alexander Caldor, she studied sculpture while teaching. Her works were exhibited in group shows at the New Britain Museum of American Art, the New Haven Paint and Clay Club, the Yale Art Gallery, the Springfield Museum in Massachusetts and other galleries.         Miss Regan graduated from Cornell University in 1919. She was a member of the Cornell Club of Greater Hartford from 1959 to 1979, actively involved in regional programming, student recruitment and fund raising. She also belonged to the Advisory Council in the College of Arts and Sciences at Cornell and the University Council. She was honored by the university in 1981 as a "foremost benefactor."         Miss Regan sponsored a film, "Cornell Plantations" in 1974-75 and was special consultant for a film, "Mr. President," in 1977-78, on the university's president, Frank H. T. Rhodes.  Both films were shown on public television in Connecticut and elsewhere.         She is survived by a cousin, Normadiene W. England of Southington.       
         Blanchette Ferry Hooker Rockefeller, a major benefactor of the Museum of Modern Art and the widow of John D. Rockefeller 3d, died on Sunday at her home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. She was 83 years old.         A family spokesman said the cause of death was Alzheimer's disease complicated by pneumonia.         For four decades, Mrs. Rockefeller was a regal presence in philanthropy, helping to attract financial support and volunteers for causes ranging from children's welfare to the Juilliard School. Lay Administrator         But it was the Museum of Modern Art that was her predominant interest. She twice served as its president, although she insisted she had no curatorial expertise. "I'm not an expert on modern art," she once said, "just a person who has become interested."         Still, as a lay administrator, as she called herself, she had a major impact on the museum, leading a successful fund-raising campaign that enabled it to complete an expansion that doubled its gallery space.         These and other changes enabled the financially troubled museum to progress from a cultural institution dependent on the Rockefeller family and private support, to a more independent public institution attracting increased corporate and government support.         In 1979, while she was president, an expansion plan generated a dispute over the practice of selling the air rights of the museum to an outside developer to secure needed funds.         Mrs. Rockefeller, who upheld the sale, which brought in $17 million, was asked whether resorting to marketing techniques could be accomplished without jeopardizing the museum's standards.         "I hope so," she replied. "I hope we're not going to sell our birthright just to raise money. We have to find ways of doing it that don't compromise the basic premise of the museum, the reason for its existence." Believer in Hard Work         The innovative expansion program permitted the construction of a 52-story apartment tower at the Museum's 53d Street site, giving the museum additional exhibition space on lower floors. A law was also passed in Albany that, in effect, allowed the building's owners to give the museum a yearly sum that was the equivalent of taxes it would have paid to New York City. Other institutions have since copied that practice.         As the museum's president, Mrs. Rockefeller also favored adding new and younger trustees to the museum board, warning that they should not be named simply because they had wealth. She said, "We want them to bring some real contribution, like hard work."         Born in New York City on Oct. 2, 1909, Mrs. Rockefeller was heiress to the Ferry seed fortune through her mother. Her father was an engineer who became president of the Hooker Electro-Chemical Company.         She attended Miss Chapin's School for Girls, where she was known as "Hookie," and then Vassar College, graduating with a degree in music in 1931. A year later, she married Mr. Rockefeller, the eldest of the five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr.         At 24, and newly married, she began her involvement in the city's charitable and civic activities, joining the Central Council of the Community Service Society, one of the country's oldest and largest private family and health agencies. She was the first woman elected vice chairman.         She was a trustee of the Brearley School and of Vassar College, and she shared her husband's many philanthropic interests and his pleasure in collecting art. He was interested particularly in Asian art, and the Rockefeller homes were adorned with both Asian and American works. She once described their personal art collection as a "mishmash."         Mr. Rockefeller left his Asian collection to the Asia Society, which he founded in 1956 to promote better relations between the Asian and American continents. He was killed in an automobile accident on July 10, 1978, before he fulfilled his plans to increase significantly his financial gifts to the society and its new building on Park Avenue.         Mrs. Rockefeller was a member of the Asia Society's Gallery Advisory Committee and of the Japan Society's Gallery Advisory Committee. From 1974 to 1980, she was a member of the National Council on the Humanities and served on the New York State Council on the Arts. She was a member of the New York Philharmonic Symphony Society, the English-Speaking Union, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other leading cultural institutions.         She is survived by a son, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, and three daughters, Sandra Ferry of Massachusetts, Hope Aldrich of New Mexico, and Alida R. Messinger of Minnesota.         A memorial service will be held at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on Friday at 11 A.M. The family requests contributions be made to the Museum of Modern Art.       
         Elaine Whitelaw, for half a century the chief fund raiser and a major force for the March of Dimes, died on Tuesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 77.         She died of cancer, said her daughter, Patricia Snyderman of San Francisco.         In 1943, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt tapped her to join the national women's committee of the March of Dimes, which he founded to fight polio, Miss Whitelaw recognized the philanthropic potential of middle-income Americans. By creating a network of volunteers and programs for children and mothers, she made them the backbone of one of the country's most successful charities.         A dozen years after it began, the March of Dimes was helping to rid America of polio and has used the network Miss Whitelaw created to continue financing the fight against a variety of birth defects. 'She Was Irresistible'         "She was the general of a volunteer army," said Beverly Sills, the national chairwoman of the March of Dimes and a longtime friend of Miss Whitelaw's.         As a fixture on the national charity-ball scene, Miss Whitelaw embodied can-do do-gooding. Both colleagues and those she tapped relentlessly for contributions said she practiced what she preached. They described her as demanding, innovative, boundlessly energetic and fiercely determined.         "When she approached me about becoming involved with the March of Dimes she said, 'Other charities want to put your name on their stationery. I want your time, your energy and your money,' " Ms. Sills recalled. "She was irresistible."         Roseamond Elaine Whitelaw was born on Nov. 21, 1914, the oldest child of Louis Whitelaw, a wealthy diamond merchant, and his wife, Dora. Along with two younger brothers, Seymour and Jordan, Miss Whitelaw grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She graduated from Smith College, where she studied American history and art. She returned and embarked on a lifelong mission of balancing society and its entitlements and the social obligations of Roosevelt's New Deal.         "There was no question that I was going to work," she said last year. "But of course I wasn't going to work at some perfume counter and take a job from someone who needed it." After a brief stint as a script reader, an early marriage that ended in divorce and the birth of her daughter, Patricia, she volunteered to raise money for the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War. She moved on to volunteer for the National War Fund.         She later married Otto Brodnitz, an economist and stockbroker, and the couple lived on the Upper East side of Manhattan until his death in the mid-1970's.         After joining the March of Dimes in 1943, Miss Whitelaw created a network of volunteers who sought donations in cinemas and door to door. She also used her prodigious organizational abilities to help orchestrate the field tests of the Salk polio vaccine. "Her influence was all pervasive,' said Dr. Jonas Salk, founder of the Salk Institute in San Diego, Calif.  Serving Hot Meals         Later, along with Eleanor Lambert, she organized a fashion show to benefit the March of Dimes that Time magazine called "the event of the year." In 1976, she began "Gourmet Galas," dinners prepared in various cities by local celebrities and judged by culinary experts. Today, there are 40 different galas across the United States.         After retiring from the March of Dimes last year, Miss Whitelaw volunteered as a regional director of the Enterprise Foundation, a national organization involved in housing the poor. Increasingly concerned with homelessness, drug use and AIDS, she spent nights last winter riding a Planned Parenthood van and counseling women who lived or worked on the streets in the Bronx.         "The only way we're going to get them in for treatment is to feed them," she told a reporter at the time. "They don't know they might be sick. They know they're hungry, their children are hungry." Within days, she had cooking equipment and food donations, and, in her Adolfo suits and Ferragamo shoes, she helped serve hot meals from midnight to dawn.         One of the young women she fed, a runaway, took words from Miss Whitelaw's vocabulary to describe her. "She's a great dame," she said.         Miss Whitelaw is survived by her daughter; her brother, Seymour Whitelaw of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.       
         Louise L. Hoxie, an educator, died Monday at Huntington Hospital. She was 75 and lived in Oyster Bay, L.I.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         With her husband, Dr. R. Gordon Hoxie, she contributed to the growth of C. W. Post College on Long Island and established the Center for the Study of the Presidency.         Mrs. Hoxie, a native of Cincinnati, graduated from the University of Cincinnati. She did graduate work in French at Penn State University, the Universite de Paris and Columbia University. She served as dean of women at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and taught French literature at Nebraska Wesleyan and Aix-en-Provence before her marriage in 1953 to Dr. Hoxie.         Dr. Hoxie became the first dean of the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in 1955 and tended to its academic growth while his wife taught French and acted as the college's official hostess. Her husband became chancellor of Long Island University in 1964.         In 1968, Mrs. Hoxie and her husband started the Center for the Study of the Presidency, based in New York and Washington. Dr. Hoxie served as its president. Mrs. Hoxie helped to found the Presidential Studies Quarterly and served as its editor. The center reported that its more than 450 former fellows are establishing a memorial fellowship in her name.         Mrs. Hoxie was a consultant to the State Department and the United States Information Agency, serving on their selection and promotion boards. From 1986 to 1989 she was president of the Public Members Association of the Foreign Service. A frequent visitor to South Korea, she was a member of the board of the American Friends of Chung-Ang University.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Hoxie is survived by a brother, Dr. Wallace C. Lobitz of Portland, Ore.       
         Georgia L. McMurray, a leader in developing services for children in New York City, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 58.         A quadriplegic, she had been suffering from a progressive nervous disease, said the Rev. Gerald L. Wagner, a friend.         Ms. McMurray was a former Commissioner of the New York City Agency for Child Development and deputy general director for programming of the Community Service Society of New York.         She was teaching as a professor at Fordham University's School of Social Work at the time of her death. She was also the president of a consulting firm, the GLM Group, which provides research, training, technical assistance and other management services to governmental and nonprofit organizations concerned with programs for children and families.         Her many honors included the Essence Award this year, given to her by Essence, a magazine for black women. This year, too, the Children's Aid Society cited her for distinguished service.         Ms. McMurray managed to continue her work even though her own disabilities forced her to walk on crutches.         Ms. McMurray was a graduate of Temple University and held a master's degree in social services from Bryn Mawr College. She came to public attention 22 years ago as the founder of Project Teen Aid for pregnant adolescents, which still exists.         The Lindsay administration tapped her in 1969 to develop services for young children and families as director of an Early Childhood Task Force. Two years later she became the first head of the child-development agency, an umbrella for the city's child-care and preschool programs not handled by the Board of Education. Under her guidance the number of day-care centers multiplied and the number of children served rose from 5,000 to 40,000.         She worked at the Community Service Society from 1978 to 1986, producing reports on homelessness and the changing demographics of urban poverty, and developing model programs for children and youths.         Ms. McMurray is survived by her mother, Daisy Fulen, and two sisters, Caroline Johnson and Narvine Fulen, all of Philadelphia.       
         Clara M. Hale, who nurtured hundreds of abandoned and orphaned babies, the most fragile victims of New York City's epidemics of drug abuse and AIDS, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of a stroke, her family said.         Mother Hale, as she was known, was a pioneer in self-help efforts in poor neighborhoods and came to symbolize the untapped potential of disadvantaged groups taking care of their own. She eventually won international recognition for her efforts, and President Ronald Reagan saluted her as an "American heroine" in his 1985 State of the Union address. Battled Bureaucrats         At times she battled government bureaucrats who resisted her unorthodox methods. But public support helped her gain government grants and persuade officials to bend rules like the requirement that young children be reared in private homes instead of the group care she provided.         She started her work with babies in 1969 in her Harlem home and soon moved the program to a five-story brownstone at 145 West 122d Street. In the early days, the babies slept in cribs next to Mother Hale's bed.         As recently as a few months ago, she kept at least one child in her room, often choosing the neediest one. She expressed frustration when failing health made her too weak to hold a baby. Took in Nearly 1,000 Infants         Aided by donations, a growing staff and volunteers, Hale House took in nearly 1,000 infants, many still trembling from withdrawal pangs after becoming addicted to drugs in the womb.         With nourishment, nurture and play, most of the addicted infants recovered from the effects of fetal drugs and alcohol. But those born infected with the AIDS virus faced a drastically shortened life of suffering that Hale House tried to alleviate.         Her program especially drew attention in the 1980's, when so-called boarder babies languished for months in municipal hospitals, at a cost of several hundred dollars a day for each one. No one else wanted them, and the city's social-services agency was ill-prepared to place them.         "I'm not an American hero -- I'm simply a person who loves children," Mrs. Hale said recently. Explaining her approach to the children, she said: "We hold them and touch them. They love you to tell them how great they are, how good they are. Somehow, even at a young age, they understand that. They're happy, and they turn out well."         She said she expected to keep caring for children "until I die."         Hale House's policy is to reunite children with their families after the parents recover from their addiction, and it says it has been able to do so with about 90 percent of the children. Some children remained exceptionally close to Mother Hale, who considered them part of her own family.         Mrs. Hale's philosophy and mission were rooted in the travails of her own life.         She grew up in Philadelphia. Her father was murdered when she was a child, and her mother took in boarders and ran a lunchroom for longshoremen. Mrs. Hale credited her mother -- who died when she was just 16 -- with instilling the values on which Hale House is based.         After high school, she married Thomas Hale. They moved to New York, where he ran a floor-waxing service and studied business administration in night classes at City College. Mrs. Hale worked as a domestic and cleaned Loews theaters. Left to Rear 3 Children         Her husband died of cancer when she was 27, leaving her to rear three children, Nathan, Lorraine and Kenneth. At first she cleaned homes by day and theaters by night.         But then, reluctant to leave her youngsters, she started taking in other children for $2 a week and eventually became a licensed foster parent. She took in seven or eight children at a time. Eventually she reared 40 foster children, keeping them out of trouble and steering them from the temptations and dangers of the street. She emphasized reading and good behavior, and frequently treated them to trips to museums and other outings.         All made it through high school and many went to college, and they rewarded Mrs. Hale with 60 children of their own whom she regarded as her grandchildren.         The next phase of Mrs. Hale's life started in 1969, by chance. Her daughter, Lorraine, was driving on 146th Street when she was distressed to see a drug-addicted woman on a crate nodding off with her 2-month-old baby slipping out of her arms. 'She Says You Sent Her'         Impulsively, Miss Hale stopped, got out and admonished the woman to seek drug treatment and temporarily leave the baby with Mrs. Hale -- then 63 years old and retired.         The next morning, they later recalled, Mother Hale telephoned Lorraine to say, "There's a junkie at my door, and she says you sent her." Lorraine confirmed that she had, and Mrs. Hale took the baby. Word spread, and soon a steady stream of babies were placed with her.         Lorraine Hale went on to earn doctorates in developmental psychology and child development. In the mid-1980's, she became the executive director of Hale House and later its president. She plans to continue operating Hale House and its growing programs at other sites.         Hale House was renovated in 1975 with aid from Percy E. Sutton, then the Manhattan Borough President, with nurseries, a central kitchen and dining room, a playground, and many mirrors, placed at a toddler's eye level.         Throughout the Beame and Koch administrations, Hale House won waivers from state regulations barring group nurseries for children under the age of 5. But in 1989, saying that the crack epidemic had crested and the city was doing better in finding foster homes for children, the Dinkins administration stopped referring children to Hale House. Increased Fund-Raising         Mrs. Hale refused to give up. The flow of children continued, brought to Hale House by desperate parents, police officers, churches and other groups. To finance their care without government money, Hale House increased its private fund-raising.         Its budget last year was $3.5 million, and Hale House has been championed over the years by celebrities like Lena Horne, John Lennon and Tony Bennett.         In the last two years, Hale House has expanded its programs. They include housing and educating mothers after detoxification; apprentice training for youths who start to stray, and a home for mothers and infants infected with the AIDS virus. The organization also hopes to create Hale Haven, a larger version of the original Hale House, which will continue to house infants.         In addition to her daughter, Lorraine, Mrs. Hale's survivors include two sons, Nathan and Kenneth, and several grandchildren.         A service will be held at noon on Wednesday at the Riverside Church on Riverside Drive at 122d Street in Manhattan, with viewing from 9 to 11:20 A.M.       
         Marilyn Neufeld Bergner, a professor and researcher who helped to develop a widely used system for evaluating the medical condition of patients, died Dec. 12 at her home in Silver Spring, Md.. She was 59.         She died of ovarian cancer, her family said.         Since 1986, Dr. Bergner was a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.         In her prior teaching post at the University of Washington School of Public Health from 1972 to 1986, she was on the team that developed the Sickness Impact Profile. It measures the patient's level of functioning and monitors the progress during the course of an illness, based on periodic questionnaires filled out by the patient. The form is now widely used around the world.         Dr. Bergner was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College. After earning a doctorate in socio-medical science at Columbia University in 1970, she served two years as an assistant to the first vice president at New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation.         Surviving are her husband of 39 years, Dr. Lawrence Bergner, a physician; her mother, Clara Neufeld of Brooklyn; two sons, Daniel of Manhattan, and Robert of Montreal, and a granddaughter.       
         Margaret Hockaday LaFarge, a pioneer among women in the advertising industry whose saucy, irreverent ads shook up Madison Avenue, died on Friday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 85.         She died in her sleep of heart failure, said her niece, Susan Hockaday Jones.         Miss Hockaday, who used her maiden name professionally, was founder and president of Hockaday Associates, a New York agency with a reputation for whimsy and flair. The Hockaday ads were so inventive that they were frequently reported on in the general press and the trade magazines.         She made her first big splash in 1953 with Dunbar furniture, picturing sofas, armchairs and beds in treehouses, on city streets, in green fields -- everywhere but in their normal setting.         Then followed the Capezio campaign, starting in 1956, in which the shoe company was presented as a state of mind, with shoes not even mentioned in the ads for several years. Her "Capezio people" appeared everywhere; some critics complained that the ads did not picture the product, but they sold shoes.         Her most quoted slogans were for swimwear and Scotch: "Just wear a smile and a Jantzen," and, "As long as you're up, get me a Grant's."         Under her direction Hockaday Associates, which had started out in 1949 in a converted barber shop on 58th Street, moved to 575 Madison Avenue. Her list of accounts grew to include Fuller Fabrics, Crane stationery, Health-tex clothing for children, Elizabeth Arden, Reed & Barton silver, Royal Worcester Porcelain.         Her husband, L. Bancel LaFarge, an architect, died in 1989. Besides her niece, Susan, of Princeton, N.J., she is survived by two nephews, Peter Hockaday of San Francisco and John Hockaday of Alexandria, Va.       
         Barbara Rollock, an authority on children's literature who worked for 32 years with the New York Public Library, died on Sunday at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn. She was 70 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of colon cancer, said her son David.         Joining the Public Library as a clerk at the Aguilar Branch Library in Harlem in 1945, Mrs. Rollock rose to become coordinator of Children's Services in 1974, a post she held until retirement.

         Several thousand friends, admirers and family members filled Riverside Church yesterday to celebrate the life and to mourn the death of Clara M. Hale, the woman who sheltered and raised hundreds of abandoned and orphaned children in her home.         The service, an afternoon of heart-felt tributes, seemed to offer solace to those who were most touched by her example. Mother Hale, as she was widely known, died last Friday of complications from a stroke. She was 87 years old.         "Our lady of inner-city royalty," was the title given her by Percy E. Sutton, the businessman and former Manhattan Borough President, who in 1975 helped Mrs. Hale find and renovate a Harlem brownstone on West 122d Street which became Hale House, only a half-dozen blocks from Riverside Church. His description prompted a string of "amens" that rippled through the listeners.         Standing amid the seasonal red and green of bright poinsettias and fragrant Christmas pines, Mr. Sutton and others recalled Mrs. Hale's capacity for loving each of her children, for placing mirrors at toddler's eye level in Hale House, for taking the frailest of babies into her own room overnight. 'We're Almost Home'         A noonday mist dampened the gray stone on the outside walls of the church facing the Hudson River along Riverside Drive, but inside, song from the lips of the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Gospel Choir seemed to reach up toward the rich blue of the church's stained glass windows.         "We're almost home," sang the 30-member choir, many of whom came of age, and mind, at Hale House. They swayed back and forth in red and yellow robes as they sang: "I'm so tired and weary, no more do I want to roam."         The service, which lasted 100 minutes, opened with a procession of so many politicians, community leaders and members of Mrs. Hale's extended family that it took more than 10 minutes for them just to file in and be seated. Mayor David N. Dinkins, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Yoko Ono were among those in the procession.         A coffin of light-colored poplar was wheeled to the front of the church during the service. Afterward, it was guarded by a detail of the Harlem Youth Marine Cadets outside before it was taken for burial. Mrs. Hale's family asked that the location be kept private.         "Woe to those who thought this woman old and frail," said Mayor Dinkins, who was greeted by a standing ovation when he went to the pulpit. "She had twice the stamina of most others.         "The best tribute we can give is to keep her legacy alive," he added, saying that efforts would be made to fulfill Mrs. Hale's wish to establish a hospice for dying children at Hale House. Quoting the poet Langston Hughes, he concluded: "Beautiful also are the souls of my people. Mother, may you rest in peace." 'Like She Knew'         Mr. Sutton recalled his fondest memory of Mrs. Hale, which was when she rose to acknowledge the applause she received from Congress in 1985, after being cited as a "true American hero" in a State of the Union address by President Ronald Reagan.         "She rose gently, with the smile she always gave, like she knew that she owned everything," Mr. Sutton said. He described her reluctance at first to appear with Mr. Reagan because the President, as Mr. Sutton put it, "was not being too kind to people in the neighborhood where she lived." She resisted the invitation with the excuse that she was ill, but after the White House insisted that her daughter, Lorraine, appear in her place, Mrs. Hale eventually gave in.         Among the day's speakers was the Rev. Carolyn Knight, Mrs. Hale's pastor at the Philadelphia Baptist Church.         "She touched children no one else would touch," Ms. Knight said. "She showed us that what children really need is a hug and a kiss and a smile.         "In this season, when much is spoken of angels sent from God, Mother Hale was an angel," she said.         Ms. Knight recalled speaking with Mrs. Hale in a quiet moment about a year ago.         "She said: 'Carolyn, do you believe God knows my way? Do you believe I will go to heaven when I die ?' "         Ms. Knight closed the service with a final goodbye, provoking tears in the eyes of many listeners: "Farewell, farewell, you gentle lovely lady, we shall meet again."       
         Helen Joseph, a white dissident who was repeatedly detained and harassed by the South African Government in a long struggle against apartheid, died today in a hospital here. She was 87.         She died of complications from a stroke she had suffered two weeks ago, news agencies reported.         Mrs. Joseph became prominent here as a symbol of white opposition to the racial policies of her adopted land in the years after World War II when apartheid gained legal force. In this way, she was ahead of most other white foes of the system of racial separation.         The Government responded in kind, for more than three decades placing the often-ailing, ever-defiant Mrs. Joseph under various forms of house arrest and issuing banning orders that prohibited her from receiving more than one visitor at a time.         She was also declared a "listed person," a punishment intended to prevent her from being quoted in any form.         Even when formally silenced, she never accepted the restrictions, imposed under the Suppression of Communism Act. "You can't silence yourself," she once told an interviewer.         In the ranks of anti-apartheid campaigners, Mrs. Joseph was a militant, an associate of Nelson and Winnie Mandela, who once referred to her as part of their "family." From Polite Background         It was not a role that her upbringing might have suggested. Born in Sussex in England in 1905, Helen Beatrice May Fennell seemed set for a middle-class English life. She graduated with an honors degree from the University of London in 1927 and went on to teach for three years in India.         Arriving in South Africa in 1931, she settled in Durban, married a dentist, and "threw herself into the life style of a socialite," as The Weekly Mail of Johannesburg said in 1986. "In those days," the profile of her added, "she was known as beautiful and flighty, leading a life of wining and dining and bridge parties."         Friends say her service as an information and welfare officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in World War II and a subsequent decision to become a social worker in Cape Town and Johannesburg exposed her to some of the realities of South Africa.         Divorced in 1948, she became a founder of the Congress of Democrats, the white wing of the African National Congress. In 1955, she was present for the adoption of the congress's Freedom Charter, a blueprint for a South Africa without racial discrimination.         The following year, Mrs. Joseph helped lead a march of 20,000 women on the Union Buildings in Pretoria to protest the extension of laws requiring blacks to carry passes. She was arrested and charged with treason, and a year later was put under the first of a series of banning orders. Overcame Cancer         In 1961, Mrs. Joseph was acquitted of treason after a marathon trial. But from 1962 to 1971, as a banned person, she was not allowed to receive visitors on weekends or at night, or to socialize with more than one person at a time. The order was lifted when she entered a hospital for cancer treatment.         "I had a cancer operation and then I had a major heart attack," she told an interviewer, "and they must really have thought, 'This old girl can't go on much longer.' "         But she did go on, campaigning at English-language universities. In 1978, she was jailed again, this time for contempt after she refused to testify against Winnie Mandela.         In August 1983, she became a sponsor of the United Democratic Front, which orchestrated the protest campaign of the mid-80's on behalf of the still-outlawed African National Congress. The campaign led to international sanctions against South Africa and ultimately to President F. W. de Klerk's offer of political change and to Mr. Mandela's release in 1990.         By then some reforms had begun, including the lifting of racial restrictions in public places. It seemed that Mrs. Joseph had outlasted a legal system that persecuted her. But her age and health problems, like a painful infirmity from leg fractures, confined to a wheelchair. She was no longer strong enough to speak at rallies.         Nonetheless, when Mr. de Klerk conducted a referendum in March, seeking approval to continue talks toward nonracial democracy, Mrs. Joseph appeared in public to tell supporters that she was voting for changes she had sought for more than four decades.       
         Vivienne Segal, a musical-comedy star who appeared on Broadway in "The Desert Song," "No, No, Nanette," and "Pal Joey," died yesterday in Los Angeles. She was 95 years old and lived in Beverly Hills.         She died of heart failure, said Robert Sidney, a friend.         Miss Segal was born in Philadelphia, where she studied voice. She made her operatic debut in 1915 singing the title role of "Carmen" at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. The next year she took the leading role in "The Blue Paradise" at the Casino Theater in New York City, a show with which she toured for two years. On returning to New York, she appeared in many reviews, musicals and operettas, including "The Little Whopper" and "The Yankee Princess." In 1924, she was featured in the "Ziegfeld Follies." As the 'Fair Young Girl'         The roles capitalized on her fresh-faced beauty and sweet voice. "Just because I was little and could sing and wasn't too bad to look at, I was called a prima donna and was cast repeatedly in operettas and musical comedies as the fair young girl who was good and noble and got what she deserved," Miss Segal complained to an interviewer in 1940.         If Miss Segal found her roles limiting, audiences in the 1920's and 30's doted on her in musical confections like "Florida Girl," "The Desert Song," "The Chocolate Soldier," "Music in the Air," "The Three Musketeers" and "No, No, Nanette."         Miss Segal made her film debut in 1927 in an early sound short, singing excerpts from "Sweethearts" and "Maytime." She also appeared in "Song of the West," "Golden Dawn," "Bride of the Regiment" and "Viennese Nights," all made in 1930, and in "The Cat and the Fiddle" (1934). She later told an interviewer that she went on strike to protest the saccharine roles she was given. A Change in Style         In 1938, the lyricist Lorenz Hart came to the rescue, offering her the role of a cynical countess in "I Married an Angel" on Broadway. "He was the only one who really got me out of a rut of playing sweet-faced ingenues and taught me how to play comedy," she told an interviewer in the early 1950's.         Two years later came her breakthrough role, as the hard-boiled Vera Simpson in "Pal Joey." Describing her show-stopping number, "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered," Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote, "In a singularly sweet voice she sings some scabrous lyrics by Lorenz Hart to one of Richard Rodgers' most haunting tunes."         After appearing in the Richard Rodgers revival of "A Connecticut Yankee" (1943) and in "Great to Be Alive!" (1950), she did a reprise of her role in "Pal Joey" in 1952, for which she was named best actress in a musical by the New York Drama Critics.         On television she appeared in "Studio One" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents."         Her first marriage, to Robert D. Ames, an actor, ended in divorce. In 1950, she married Hubbell Robinson Jr., a vice president of CBS. He died in 1974.         She is survived by a sister, Louise Paget Kowalski of Los Angeles.       
         Lois Braun, a member of the board of the New York Federation of Reform Synagogues, died yesterday at her home in Larchmont, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         She died of pancreatic cancer, her husband, Julian, said.         Mrs. Braun, a graduate of Hunter College, was active for many years in Reform Jewish organizations. She was a director and a former president of the National Federation of Temple Sisterhood II, a past president and trustee of the Larchmont Temple Sisterhood and a past president and trustee of the Larchmont chapter of Hadassah.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Andrew, of Longmont, Colo.; two daughters, Laurie Braun of New Rochelle, N.Y., and Carol Shutzer of Swampscott, Mass.; a brother, Bruce F. Roberts of Purchase, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Ruth Sleeper, a national leader in nursing education who helped raise academic standards for the nursing profession, died Thursday at her home in Braintree, Mass. She was 93.         She died after a long illness, said the Massachusetts General Hospital, where she had been director of both the Nursing Service and School of Nursing from 1946 to 1966.         Miss Sleeper was a past president of the National League of Nursing Education and the National League for Nursing.         She helped lead the way in transforming nursing education by greatly expanding classroom instruction. She developed a curriculum that combined nine months of practical training with 28 months of academic classes.         Miss Sleeper, a native of Manchester, N.H., started her own nursing career at Massachusetts General, where she earned a diploma at the age of 23. Later she earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Columbia University's Teachers College.         She was an adviser to the State Department and was a representative to the Status of Women Commission at the United Nations. She was also an officer in the United Community Services, American Red Cross, International Council of Nurses and Nursing Advisory Council of the Veterans Administration.         Although retired, Ms. Sleeper remained active professionally until her death, advising two nursing schools.         She is survived by several nieces, grandnieces and grandnephews.
