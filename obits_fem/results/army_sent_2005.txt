Colonel Hallaren commanded the first battalion of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps to serve in Europe, the largest unit of women to serve overseas in World War II.
Shortly afterward the word auxiliary was dropped, making it the Women's Army Corps.
Colonel Hallaren was the first woman to be sworn in as an officer of the Regular Army outside its medical branch.
