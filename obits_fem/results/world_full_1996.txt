         Rhoda Haas Goldman, a San Francisco civic leader and benefactor of a wide variety of causes, died on Saturday while vacationing in Honolulu. She was 71.         She suffered a heart attack, said Duane Silverstein, executive director of the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund in San Francisco.         Over the past five years the fund has contributed some $25 million in grants to cultural and environmental causes. She and her husband, Richard, also established the Goldman Environmental Prize in 1990 to reward grass-roots environmentalists around the world.         Mrs. Goldman, a San Francisco native and graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, was a vice president and past president of the San Francisco Symphony and chairwoman of her city's Memorial to the Six Million Victims of the Holocaust. She was a director of the Mount Zion Health System and former president of the Mount Zion Hospital and Medical Center.         A great-grandniece and heir of Levi Strauss, the denim king, she was a corporate director of his apparel concern, Levi Strauss & Company.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Goldman's survivors include two sons, John D., of Atherton, Calif., and Douglas E., of San Francisco; a daughter, Susan R. Gelman  of Chevy Chase, Md.; a brother, Peter E. Haas Sr., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Maynor, a highly regarded soprano recitalist who founded the Harlem School of the Arts, died on Monday at the Chester County Hospital in West Chester, Pa. She was 85 and lived in Kennett Square, Pa.         Miss Maynor, whose career helped open the way for black artists like Marian Anderson and Leontyne Price, possessed a voice that the New Grove Dictionary of  American Music describes as "a soaring, belllike soprano capable of exquisite musical effects, supported by a sincere and ardent temperament." She took New York by storm in a sold-out recital at Town Hall in 1939 and pursued a successful recital career.         Although she committed more than 100 operatic roles to memory, she never appeared on an opera stage; there were no such opportunities for a black artist  in the late 1930's and the 1940's, when she was in her prime. (Miss Anderson, the first black singer to appear at the Metropolitan Opera, did not make her debut there until 1955.)         Miss Maynor was born in Norfolk, Va., and as a child she sang in the choir of her father's church. She entered Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) in Hampton, Va., intending to become a teacher of home economics, but she also joined the renowned Hampton Choir, with which she toured Europe in 1929. On the  advice of the choir director, R. Nathaniel Dett, she changed her major to music  and earned a bachelor's degree in 1933.         After being awarded a scholarship, she studied choir direction at the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, N.J., where she received a second bachelor's degree in music and choral conducting in 1935. While on tour in New England with the school's choir, she was encouraged by several wealthy benefactors to pursue a concert career. Three years of private study in New York followed, with Wilfried Klamroth and John Alan Haughton. At this time she changed the spelling of her name from Mainor.         After hearing her sing at the 1939 Berkshire Symphonic Festival at Tanglewood in western Massachusetts, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky reportedly jumped up  and down, shouting: "It is a miracle! It is a musical revelation! The world must hear her!" Koussevitzky, who called Miss Maynor "a native Flagstad," immediately used her in recordings with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.         She made her formal debut at Town Hall in Manhattan later that year, on Nov.  19, in a widely anticipated event that was sold out more than a week in advance. Olin Downes, reviewing the concert for The New York Times, hailed her as "one of the most remarkable soprano voices of the rising generation," called her voice "phenomenal for its range, character and varied expressive resources."         Miss Maynor began touring extensively in the United States, often appearing as a soloist with leading orchestras. She made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1940 with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by John Barbirolli. In the late 40's she toured Latin America and Europe. She often performed at benefits to aid the  war effort and black causes.         She sang at the Presidential Inaugural galas for Harry S. Truman in 1949 and  Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. In 1952, by special permission of the Daughters of the American Revolution, she appeared as a soloist with the National Symphony Orchestra at Constitution Hall in the first commercial appearance there by a black artist since Miss Anderson had been barred from performing at the hall in  1939. (Miss Anderson subsequently gave benefit performances at the hall.)         Miss Maynor recorded popular arias and songs for RCA Victor. Although she never appeared on the opera stage, she recorded the role of Leonore in "Fidelio" under Arturo Toscanini.         In 1963, she retired to work with her husband, the Rev. Shelby Rooks, at St.  James Presbyterian Church at West 141st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem, where he was pastor. That year she founded the Harlem School of the Arts. The school offered classes in music, ballet, modern dance, drama and art to poor children for minimal fees, sometimes as little as 50 cents a lesson, and lent or rented instruments to students who did not own one.         "In most schools, if you don't have a piano, you can't take lessons," Miss Maynor told one interviewer. "But we say, 'Good, you come here and practice.' "  She served as executive director of the school until 1979 and also taught there. In 1977 she raised more than $2 million to build a new facility for the school,  which originally served 20 children and now has more than 1,000 students.         "What I dream of is changing the image held by the children," she said on another occasion. "We've made them believe everything beautiful is outside the community. We would like them to make beauty in our community."         Her work with the school is recounted in "Dorothy Maynor and the Harlem School of the Arts: The Diva and the Dream" (Edwin Mellen Press, 1993), by William F. Rogers Jr.         She received honorary doctorates from many schools, including Howard University, Westminster Choir College, Oberlin College, Carnegie-Mellon University and Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C..         In 1975, she became the first black member of the Metropolitan Opera board.         She is survived by her husband.         Correction:  March 2, 1996, Saturday         An obituary last Saturday about the soprano Dorothy Maynor credited her with  one recording incorrectly. She did not record the role of Leonore in "Fidelio" with Toscanini.       
         One of the most elegant tennis players ever to grace a grass court, Sarah Palfrey Danzig, a mainstay on the international circuit in the 1930's and an esteemed ambassador of the game thereafter, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 83.         The cause was lung cancer, her husband, Jerry A. Danzig, said.         In addition to being active in the Boston social registry from the 1930's to the 50's, she and her four sisters all claimed national tennis titles at varying points of their lives. But she was the only member of the brood who continued to have a significant impact on the tennis scene upon making the transition from junior to the adult ranks.         In all, Danzig collected 18 Grand Slam titles, most of them in doubles where, because of her uncommon artistry around the net, she was a coveted partner in women's as well as mixed doubles competitions. And her beatific courtside manner made her a favorite with spectators in the United States and abroad, where she garnered 24 titles.         Danzig was born in Sharon, Mass., on Sept. 18, 1912. Early on, she received the attention and instruction of Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman, the progenitor of the international Wightman Cup competition between teams from the United States and  Britain, and a front-runner in making the volley an essential component of women's tennis.         As a result of that association, Danzig not only excelled at the net, but she was also selected to be a member of 10 Wightman Cup teams. Her doubles partners  there -- Helen Jacobs, Helen Wills Moody and Alice Marble -- constituted a veritable Who's Who of women's tennis.         The United States National champion in singles in 1941 and again in 1945, Danzig ranked among the world's top 10 women on six occasions between 1933 and '39. She was the United States doubles champion nine times and captured the Wimbledon doubles title, alongside the equally glamorous Marble, in 1938 and '39.         Danzig rose to prominence on the national scene as a teen-ager. At 14, she won the Junior Grass Court Doubles in 1927 and she began dominating both singles and doubles junior events the following year. By the time she acquired her last  amateur national title in 1945 at a doubles clay-court championship where her partner was Elwood Cooke, the second of her three husbands, Danzig possessed a total of 63 national titles.         "Sarah certainly had all the elements of grace and charm and played a very stylish game," said Virginia Wade, the 1977 Wimbledon champion, who benefited from Danzig's support while still a rookie. "She always treated newcomers to the game as if they were one of the family, and she was a wonderful role model,"         Danzig briefly turned professional in 1947 for an exhibition tour with Pauline Betz before switching her attention to a business career in which she also thrived. Besides performing charitable duties on a revolving list of social committees, Danzig worked for NBC television as a sports editor from 1956 to '57, and in 1965 became an advertising consultant for World Tennis magazine.         Her method for attracting advertising to the magazine was unique and ahead of its time. Instead of wooing corporate clients with the traditional martini luncheon, the health-conscious Danzig booked weekly court time at a mid-Manhattan facility and supervised vigorous tennis matches among writers, editors and business executives. She herself played recreational tennis well into her 70's.         The author of two instructional tennis books, "Winning Tennis and How to Play It" (1946) and "Tennis for Anyone" (1966), Danzig was elected to the sport's Hall of Fame in 1963. This year, a permanent exhibit in her honor will be incorporated into its collection.         She is survived by her husband and two children, Diana Dupont of Hudson, N.H., and Jerry P., of New York, and two sisters, Polly Woodrow of San Jose, Calif., and Joanna Brown of Canton, Mass.       
         Audrey Meadows, whose portrayal of a working-class housewife on "The Honeymooners" placed her in the pantheon of television comedy's grandes dames, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 71.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, the actress Jayne Meadows.         Audrey Meadows was the second actress to play Alice Kramden, whose bus driver husband, Ralph, threatened her weekly with a fist-propelled trip to the moon. "The Honeymooners" began in 1951 as part of "Cavalcade of Stars" with Pert Kelton as Alice. When it became part of "The Jackie Gleason Show" on CBS, Miss Meadows took over the role. "The Honeymooners" became a series on its own in 1955, and was initially something of a flop, running for only 39 episodes instead of the 70-plus that were planned. It was only later that the series, which is still being replayed on cable and airline flights, became what the television business calls a classic.         Miss Meadows's route to the role of Alice was decidedly circuitous. She was born in 1922 in China, where her father, Francis James Meadows Cotter, was an Episcopal minister. He brought the family back to the United States five years later and eventually become rector of Christ Church in Sharon, Conn.         Miss Meadows began her career as a coloratura soprano, making her concert debut at 16 in Carnegie Hall. It was her sister, Jayne, two years older, who steered her into acting.         Things moved quickly. After a World War II stint for the U.S.O. that included Mike Todd's production of "Mexican Hayride," Miss Meadows joined "The Bob and Ray Show" on NBC Television in 1951, playing all the female roles and ducking below the camera's eye to change costumes. At one point, she sang an opera aria  standing on her head.         In her spare time, she played the lead opposite Phil Silvers for 15 weeks in  the Broadway production of "Top Banana." And then she heard that Jackie Gleason, a hot new name in television, was looking for someone to replace Miss Kelton, who was ill, as Alice on his variety show.         The subsequent story is right out of the legends cherished in show business.  Gleason took one look at Miss Meadows and dismissed her as too young and too pretty. Hiring a photographer, she went home, washed off her makeup, got into a  frumpy housedress and sent the photos to Gleason, who hired her without even hearing her read lines.         During the life of "The Jackie Gleason Show," Miss Meadows appeared in different guises, including a sophisticated girlfriend of the character Reggie Van Gleason.         When Gleason decided he had had enough of an hourlong show every week, the pieces for a new half-hour show were in place: Gleason as Ralph Kramden; Miss Meadows as Alice; Art Carney as Ed Norton, and Joyce Randolph as his wife, Trixie.         No matter what else they did, each performer would forever after be fixed in  the public mind as the perfect embodiment of these hilarious and touching working-class characters whose problems seemed to connect with all of America. Each episode was a compact morality play. Ralph could keep on saying: "One of these days, Alice. Pow! Right in the kisser." But the audience knew he'd wind up admitting, "Baby you're the greatest!"         Miss Meadows held her own by remaining the calm sarcastic center around which the brilliant physical comedy of Gleason and Carney swirled. Listening to Ralph's harebrained get-rich schemes, Alice would stand with arms folded and eyes disdainful. More than once, Gleason publicly praised her ability to ad-lib  and keep the sketch on course. Once when Ralph burned himself and screamed, "Isn't there any lard around here," Miss Meadows simply took a long look at Gleason and said, "About 300 pounds of it."         The performance was perhaps too good. In a business notorious for typecasting, Miss Meadows quickly discovered that every producer wanted to keep  her in the kitchen. As recently as last year, in a New York Times interview with Bryan Miller, she lamented that she was lucky back then to get guest shots on the Dinah Shore and Red Skelton shows.         She virtually retired from acting after her 1961 marriage to Robert Six, the  chairman of Continental Airlines, turning her attention to business activities and her family. But she did have a recurring role as Ted Knight's mother-in-law  on the 1980's sitcom "Too Close for Comfort."         Mr. Six died in 1986.         Miss Meadows was adamant in her praise of Gleason, who died in 1987. After several less-than-flattering biographies were published about "The Great One," Miss Meadows wrote, with Joe Daly, her own "Love, Alice: My Life as a Honeymooner." She called the book, which was published last year, "a love letter...to my television husband Ralph Kramden."         Miss Meadows, a woman of loyalty and dignity, continued to be beset by autograph-seeking fans in restaurants and department stores. Alice had become a beloved fixture in American pop culture. People still wanted to tell her that  "Baby, you're the greatest."       
         Alice Ehrenfeld Weil, the first American woman to hold the rank of Assistant  Secretary General at the United Nations, died on Wednesday at her home in New York. She was 70 years old and lived for most of her life on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, a family member said.         As Assistant Secretary General for General Services from 1984 until her retirement in 1986, Mrs. Weil was the highest-ranking American woman to serve at the United Nations. Only a handful of women have held senior positions at the organization.         In her post Mrs. Weil supervised the security and maintenance of United Nations centers throughout the world, as well as procurement for all field operations, the management of United Nations commercial activities, and global purchasing and transportation.         She was born in New York City in 1925. After attending public schools in New  York, she received a bachelor of arts degree in 1945 from Smith College and a doctor of laws degree in 1947 from Yale Law School.         Mrs. Weil worked in the General Counsel's office of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and with what is now the Washington law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson before joining the United Nations in 1952, rising to the post of director of the world body's General Legal Division in 1980.         Mrs. Weil was married in 1958 to Ira Weil. Besides her husband, Mrs. Weil is  survived by two sons, Eric, of Arlington, Mass., and Jonathan, of Taunton, Mass.; a daughter, Ann Weil Richards, of Alstead, N.H., and a brother, Robert Ehrenfeld, of New York City.       
         Marie-Helene de Rothschild, one of Europe's most imaginative hostesses, whose activities were a major part of the Paris social season for many years, died on  Friday at her home in Ferrieres, 20 miles northeast of Paris. She was 65 and had suffered for three decades from an incurable degenerative arthritic ailment.         Baroness de Rothschild, whose husband, Baron Guy de Rothschild, is dean of the French branch of the banking family, was well known in the world of fashion  and was particularly renowned for the dinners, balls and benefits she organized. Many were held at Chateau Ferrieres, the former Rothschild mansion that now belongs to the French state. The house in which the Baroness died was built on the estate after the chateau had been given to the Government.         The Baroness, who enjoyed creating fantasies for her social occasions, once  greeted 150 guests at a dinner (Diner de Tetes Surrealistes, whose invitations had to be read in a mirror) dressed as a stag at the kill, with a mask of towering antlers and pear-shaped diamond "tears" on her face.         At a ball she gave at Ferrieres for 1,600 people, the chateau was covered in  white muslin to make it look like a huge diamond-studded cobweb. A gala for the  Paris Ballet transformed the Palais Garnier into a woodland, with trees and vines climbing to the ceiling. At another function, her Bal Proust, celebrating  the 100th anniversary of Marcel Proust's birth, Cecil Beaton took guests' photographic portraits.         "When she has made up her mind about something, there is nothing on earth that can deter her," her husband once said.         The daughter of Baron Egmont van Zuylen de Nyevelt de Haar, a Dutch diplomat, and an Egyptian mother, the Baroness was educated at Marymount College in New York.         On a trip to Paris shortly after leaving school, she met and married Count Francois de Nicolay. They were divorced six years later after she had met Baron  de Rothschild and he, too, had decided to obtain a divorce. The Rothschilds were married in 1957 in a civil ceremony in New York -- "to allow the tempest we had  stirred up by a double divorce to subside a little," the Baroness once recalled.         After Ferrieres was donated to the Government, the Baroness did most of her entertaining at her Paris residence, the 18th-century Hotel Lambert on Ile St.-Louis. Her guests included a cross-section of international society, business and the arts -- the Duchess of Windsor, Princess Grace, Elizabeth Taylor, Yves Saint Laurent, Oscar de la Renta and Andy Warhol.         "A good way of making people happy is to allow them to meet their opposites," she once said.         Nan Kempner, a New York socialite and a longtime friend, said, "She had enormous intelligence and curiosity and she wanted to see and do everything."         When France nationalized Banque Rothschild in 1981, the Baron moved to New York for a short time. Although the Baroness's illness made traveling difficult, she worked with an interior decorator on refurbishing their Upper East Side apartment.         The Baroness was also a major supporter of French couture and for many years  was in the front row at important shows. She was president of the committee that organized the 1973 Divertissement a Versailles, an event at which American designers were not only introduced to Europeans but also upstaged their French counterparts.         Survivors include her husband; two sons, Philippe de Nicolay, and Edouard de  Rothschild of Paris; a stepson, David de Rothschild of Paris, and a brother, Teddy van Zuylen of London.       
         Frieda Sandberg Lewis, a champion of Jewish causes and past national president of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on Feb. 29 in Deerfield Beach, Fla. She was 85, and a former resident of Great Neck, L.I., and Manhattan.         Mrs. Lewis's association with Hadassah went back four decades. She served as  national vice president and treasurer and headed its Nassau and Suffolk region as well as a number of its divisions. She was national president from 1980 to 1984. During her tenure, she presided over the creation of Hadassah International, which now has branches in some 30 countries.         She also held leadership positions in Jewish international affairs. She was  a past chairwoman of the American section of the World Jewish Congress and head  of its global commission on anti-Semitism for North America.         She was a life board member of Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a trustee of the American Friends of Hebrew University. Recently, she was a member of the  executive and national board of the American Zionist Federation and sat on the presidium of the Zionist General Council.         Mrs. Lewis was active in a number of other organizations, including the American Foundation for Jewish Culture, the advisory board of the National Jewish Family Center of the American Jewish, the United States and New York Holocaust Commissions, the Synagogue Council of America and the World Synagogue  Council.         She was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Adelphi University.         Mrs. Lewis is survived by her husband of 65 years, Edward Lewis; two sons, Dr. Jeffrey Lewis of Armonk, N.Y., and Dr. Michael Lewis of Nashville, Tenn.; a  sister, Beatrice Smith of Franklin Square, L.I., and nine grandchildren.       
         Jacquetta Hawkes, archeologist and author, who was the widow of the playwright and novelist J. B. Priestley, died on Monday at Cheltenham General Hospital in London. She was 85, and lived in the Cotswolds town of Chipping Camden.         In "Man on Earth," "A Land" and many other books, Ms. Hawkes searched for the humanity within science. She said, "Let us have the courage to accept the inner  experience that tells us we are something more and that we may be part of a process much greater still." Her fervent interest was in the world of prehistory.         Discovering a Neanderthal skeleton, she said: "I was conscious of this vanished being and myself as part of an unbroken stream of consciousness . . . With an imaginative effort it is possible to see the eternal present in which all days, all the seasons of the plain, stand in enduring unity." In her polymathic career, she was also a poet and novelist and, in collaboration with her husband, a playwright.         Reviewing "Time and the Priestleys, the Story of a Friendship," Diana Collins's 1994 double biography of Mr. Priestley and Ms. Hawkes, Peter Ackroyd said there was no reason Ms. Hawkes "should be remembered as the wife of anyone  . . . since her own story is as interesting and as compelling as that of Priestley himself."         That story began in her childhood when she dug in her family garden, which had once been part of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery. As Mr. Ackroyd said, "She discovered nothing, but found within herself a lasting treasure; it was her love of learning and her passion for the past." It was her goal in life "to retrieve  the landscapes of history."         Jacquetta Hopkins was born on Aug. 10, 1910, in Cambridge, which became the center of her early life. She graduated from the university with a degree in archeology and anthropology. In 1933, she married Christopher Hawkes, a professor of archeology, and they had a son, Nicolas. Her interest in archeology took her on expeditions to Palestine as well as England. During and immediately  after World War II, she held several government posts and was the founder of the United Kingdom Commission for Unesco.         Her 1951 book, "A Land" (with illustrations by Henry Moore), was based on her work as archeological adviser for the Festival of Britain. In his review in the  New York Times Book Review, Stanley Edgar Hyman said that Ms. Hawkes had told the "story of the shaping of the earth and the development of life with simple eloquence" and described "A Land" as "a triumph of skill as well as a work of love." Through the next 30 years Ms. Hawkes was a prolific author, writing bold  and often poetic books about archeology, geology and the history of mankind.         In 1947 she met Mr. Priestley at a Unesco conference in Mexico City. They were drawn together by the "magnetism of polarity," said Ms. Hawkes. She divorced Mr. Hawkes, and in 1953 married Mr. Priestley. It was his third marriage. She and Mr. Priestley collaborated on several projects, including the  play "Dragon's Mouth." When it was produced Off Broadway in 1955, Brooks Atkinson said in his review that the authors had "succeeded in writing a remarkably stimulating conversation" that was second only to Shaw's "Don Juan in Hell."         Ms. Hawkes's books included "A Woman as Great as the World," a collection of  fables and a science fiction novelette; "Journey Down a Rainbow," a personalized account of a visit to the United States written with Mr. Priestley; "Providence  Island: An Archeological Tale"; "King of the Two Lands: The Pharaoh, Akhenaten," and "Dawn of the Gods," a study of Greece in the Bronze Age. In the 1970's she wrote "The First Great Civilizations: Life in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and  Egypt," and atlases of ancient archeology and early human life. "A Quest for Love," in 1981, was an autobiographical novel.         Mr. Priestley died in 1984. Ms. Hawkes is survived by her son from her first  marriage.       
         Virginia Henderson, who took a temporary job caring for World War I wounded and ended up helping to elevate nursing into a respected independent profession  as a renowned researcher, teacher and scholar, died on Tuesday at a hospice in Branford, Conn. Known as the mother of modern nursing, she was 98.         Her own experiences in taking care of patients for the Army in Washington, and later as a public health nurse there and in New York in the 1920's, informed and inspired her work. But it was as an educator and researcher, first at Teachers College of Columbia University in the 1930's and 40's and after 1953, at the Yale School of Nursing, that Miss Henderson made her greatest contributions to a long-scorned profession.         To hear Miss Henderson tell it, a chief concern of hospital nurses when she  started was to keep their formidable starched white uniforms wrinkle-free.         It was an era not far removed from when nurses were regarded as at best glorified domestics filling in for female relatives caring for home-bound patients (and paid somewhere between cooks and seamstresses). At worst, they were regarded as the dregs of a society that expected prostitutes and other female outcasts recovering from illnesses to care for sicker patients in the almshouses that were the forerunners of modern hospitals.         After all, the definition of an untrained nurse as someone "too old, too weak, too drunken, too dirty, too stolid or too bad to do anything else," had been provided by Florence Nightingale herself.         Miss Henderson was born in Kansas City, Mo., named for her mother's native state and later educated there at a boys' school run by her grandfather. By the  time she was propelled by patriotic fervor to enroll in the Army Nursing School  at the Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, training programs spurred by Nightingale's preachings had helped. But nurses were still largely regarded as the handmaidens of the physicians they assisted rather than independent professionals.         Miss Henderson, who had initially planned to switch professions after two years, helped remedy that view of nurses in part through exhaustive research that helped establish the scholarly underpinnings of her profession.         Beginning in 1939, she was the author of three editions of "Principles and Practices of Nursing," a widely used text, and her "Basic Principles of Nursing," published in 1966 and revised in 1972, has been published in 27 languages by the International Council of Nurses.         Her most formidable achievement was a 19-year research project in which she gathered, reviewed, catalogued, classified and cross-referenced every known piece of research on nursing published in English, resulting in the five-volume  "Nursing Research: Survey and Assessment," written with Leo Simmons and published in 1964, and her four-volume "Nursing Studies Index," completed in 1972.         It was a tribute to her work that in creating the first nursing library, the  nursing society Sigma Theta Tau International named it the Virginia Henderson International Nursing Library. The library, in Indianapolis, has been available  in electronic form through the Internet since 1994.         Curiously, while Miss Henderson consistently stressed nursing's duty to the patient rather than to the doctor, her efforts to provide a scientific basis for nursing, including creating the universally used system of recording observations of the patient, have helped make nurses far more valuable to doctors.         Still, Miss Henderson, who lobbied hard for a system of universal health care, was well aware that the largely female nursing profession had not reached  the level of acceptance that doctors enjoy.         In 1985, when she received the first Christiane Reimann prize from the International Nursing Council, nursing's highest honor, she noted scornfully that diagnoses made by experienced, trained nurses were still not being accorded the medical weight of those made by physicians.         "You know what M.D. stands for," she said. "Minor Deity."         Miss Henderson is survived by a sister, Frances Houff of Lynchburg, Va., a nephew, four nieces and several great-nieces and nephews.       
         Lola Beltran, the soulful Mexican singer whose achingly emotional renditions  of mariachi ballads made her known as Lola the Great to generations of Latin Americans, died on Sunday night in Mexico City. During a career that spanned five decades, she made a point of refusing to discuss her age, but she was believed to be in her mid-60's.         The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Maria Elena Leal, said in newspaper reports.         Among Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, Lola la Grande was held in high esteem for her ability to capture and reproduce in her music what they consider the melancholy essence of life. Song after song found her confronting suffering, loneliness, abandonment or loss with an equanimity that her millions of listeners in the Spanish-speaking world found inspiring and deeply moving.         In a tribute to Ms. Beltran written in 1994, the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes declared that "passion and desire, joy and risk, tenderness and the cry  for existence are the wings of this dove that is the voice of our lady Lola Beltran." Like most Mexicans, he added, "I have spent my life living and writing and loving and traveling with the voice of Lola Beltran close to me, on records, over the airwaves, but above all in the soundtrack of memory."         Ms. Beltran suffered a heart attack on March 16 and had been hospitalized, but she vowed to keep singing "as long as the body holds up." Revived by doctors after her heart had stopped beating for a reported seven minutes, she remarked,  "I fought death with all my might, and God in His infinite compassion has let me live for a little while longer."         Though Ms. Beltran's devotees ranged from presidents to peasants, she was especially admired by her fellow musicians. Her remarkable sense of phrasing, inflection and drama influenced a whole generation of younger vocalists, both men and women, inside and out of Mexico.         "Singers don't come any more real than Lola Beltran," Linda Ronstadt said in  1988 after releasing an album that included several songs associated with Ms. Beltran. "She's a world-class singer, up there rubbing shoulders with Billie Holiday and Edith Piaf."         In both her private and professional life, Ms. Beltran played the role of diva to the hilt. She dressed extravagantly, was fond of furs and ornate jewels  and relished the deference her admirers showered on her. She consequently earned a second nickname, "La Reina," or "The Queen."         Onstage, whether performing for Mexican immigrants at county fairs in Texas or at state dinners for Dwight D. Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle or the King of Spain, her bearing was indeed regal. She would halt her orchestra in mid-measure with an authoritative wave of the hand, or in moments of great emotion clutch the rebozo, or shawl, that was her trademark.         Her origins, however, were modest. Maria Lucila Beltran was born in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa, where her father, Pedro Beltran, was a mine manager. Her mother, a housewife who liked to sing around the house, exposed her daughter both to the hits of the day and older standards.         In her early years, Ms. Beltran sang at family gatherings or to the Carmelite nuns who educated her. But in 1953, with her mother, Maria de los Angeles Ruiz,  in tow as her chaperone, Ms. Beltran moved to Mexico City with hopes of entering show business. She took a secretarial job at XEW, a radio station known throughout Mexico as the home of the Mariachi Vargas, the most popular group of  the genre.         Ms. Beltran later would tell how she pestered the group until they gave her a chance to show off her vocal skills. The purity of her voice and her masterly technique immediately won them over, and within a year she was the star of her own program and the most popular female mariachi singer in Mexico. "Even now, every time I go by the station, I make the sign of the cross," she said in a 1988 interview, as a gesture of gratitude for good fortune.         Through the Mariachi Vargas, Ms. Beltran also met Tomas Mendez, the songwriter who would go on to compose many of her most successful songs. Several of those numbers, "Cucurrucucu Paloma" and "Tres Dias" in particular, became hits everywhere -- the United States included -- and made Ms. Beltran a star throughout the Spanish-speaking world.         "When I hear a song, I want it to tell me something," Ms. Beltran said in the same interview. "It can tell the story of a great love or of a tremendous sadness, but it has to have emotion and truth. The song has to make it worth my  while to sing it."         Though many of Ms. Beltran's contemporaries have long since faded from the scene, she maintained her appeal among those who consider themselves hip and contemporary. The Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar, for instance, used Ms.  Beltran's version of "Soy Infeliz," or "I Am Unhappy," as the opening theme of his 1988 hit, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown."         All told, Ms. Beltran recorded more than 100 albums, with total sales estimated in the tens of millions. She also appeared in more than 50 movies, most of them Mexican musicals of indifferent quality that owed their commercial  success to her remarkable popularity and her dark, keening voice.         Ms. Beltran is survived by her daughter, born of her marriage to the bullfighter and actor Alfredo Leal.       
         Anne McDonnell Ford Johnson, who served on the White House Fine Arts Committee during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, helped restore Blair House in Washington and played an active role in social and charitable events in New York, died Friday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 76.         Her death was due to complications from a stroke, her daughter Charlotte Ford said.         Mrs. Johnson was divorced from the late Henry Ford 2d, the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, in 1964. She married Deane F. Johnson, a prominent Los Angeles lawyer, in 1968 and the couple moved to New York in 1980.         One of 14 children in the prominent New York family of James F. McDonnell, Mrs. Johnson was born in Rye, N.Y., and grew up in a duplex apartment in Manhattan and on the 55-acre family estate in Southampton. Her grandfather, Thomas E. Murray, was a utilities executive and inventor.         Mrs. Johnson attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Noroton, Conn., and  the Grattanelli School in Sienna, Italy. She met Mr. Ford while returning from a European trip in 1936, and they were married in 1940 in what was a major event of the Southampton social season. The service was conducted by the Most Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, then a monsignor, who had instructed Mr. Ford in Roman Catholicism before his conversion.         During her years in Grosse Pointe, Mich., she was active in the support of the Detroit Institute of Art and the Metropolitan Opera Association of Detroit. She was also one of the first women elected to the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1956, she was selected as one of the 10 best-dressed women in the world and four years later was named to the Fashion Hall of Fame.         The announcement of the Ford separation and divorce followed months of rumor  in which Mr. Ford was linked romantically to the Italian-born Maria Cristina Vettore Austin, the divorced wife of a British naval officer. Mr. Ford and Mrs.  Austin were married in 1965.         Shortly after her divorce, Mrs. Ford, who had moved to Manhattan, was with a  friend having a cup of espresso at the Regency Hotel. She noticed Mrs. Austin, who was with a friend at another table. "This had to happen some time," she whispered to her companion. "I think the only gracious thing is to go over and say hello. You know I've never met her." The two went over, introduced themselves and shook hands. Mrs. Ford's friend later reported: "It was all very  civilized, but if there were a way to bottle up the electricity in that little room, it would run the Ford industries for a solid year."         After her marriage to Mr. Johnson, to whom she was introduced by Rocky Converse, the widow of Gary Cooper, Mrs. Johnson created an instant status revolution in Los Angeles, where she immediately became the most prestigious hostess. The couple bought a Regency-style house that Mrs. Johnson, who was known as a connoisseur of French furniture, filled with the pieces she had collected. She eventually became the Los Angeles representative of Christie's, the international auction house. Later, in New York, she was associated for a time with Sotheby's.         Survivors include Mr. Johnson, two daughters, Charlotte Ford of Manhattan and Anne Ford of Southampton and Manhattan; a son, Edsel B. Ford 2d of Grosse Pointe; five sisters, Katherine Sullivan of Arizona, Mary Murnane and Margie Murphy of Florida, Barbara Hennessey of Connecticut and Sheila Collins of California; two brothers, Morgan McDonnell of Chicago and Jim McDonnell of Detroit, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
         Helen Bunce, who knitted so many mittens she didn't know what to do unless she was knitting more mittens, died on Feb. 24 at a nursing home in Watertown, N.Y., where she was known as the Mitten Lady. She was 86 and had been knitting mittens until a few days before her death.         Mrs. Bunce had been a legend in Watertown and in international church circles for decades, although until December only a few people knew she was the Mitten Lady whose anonymous handmade donations to an annual church clothing drive had spread her fame far and wide.         Since 1948, when the third-grade Sunday school class at the Emmanuel Congregational Church in Watertown established a special Christmas tree to collect clothing for poor children, Mrs. Bunce had spent every otherwise spare moment knitting away.         "She could knit in her sleep," her daughter, Helen McDonald, said yesterday,  estimating that her mother had knitted at least 4,000 pairs of mittens over the  last 47 years, and probably a lot more.         "She didn't keep records in the early years," Mrs. McDonald said, "but some years she did more than 200."         For all the mittens she turned out, the Mitten Lady sobriquet was somewhat misleading. Mrs. Bunce, who knew that little heads as well as hands needed protection against the cold, knitted a matching cap for every pair of mittens and also turned out scarves.         The sets, which included a handwritten tag saying "God Loves You, and So Do I," were distributed to various churches and charities in Watertown and through  Church World Service, the Protestant relief agency, to poor children across the  nation and abroad.         As word of Mrs. Bunce's work spread, people across the country began sending  her yarn in care of the church, and she kept a scrapbook of thank-you notes from children she had helped and photographs showing some of them wearing her handiwork. Like the donated packages of yarn, the notes, addressed simply to the Mitten Lady, were delivered to the church and then passed on to her.         Mrs. Bunce, who lived in Watertown most of her life, carried her knitting wherever she went, clicking away whenever she found a spare moment. Her mittens, which always included two contrasting colors in striking designs, came in three  sizes, with the colors becoming darker as the sizes increased.         Although she suffered from osteoporosis so painful that she found it difficult to sit in a wheelchair in her last months, Mrs. Bunce, who had taught  herself to knit lying down after entering the nursing home, insisted on being taken to the church in December to make her usual surreptitious donation of her  year's production.         This time her cover was blown. She was introduced to the congregation as the  Mitten Lady, and the woman who had once explained that she labored anonymously because the purpose of her work was to help poor children and not to have people say, "Oh, that's wonderful," had to endure a five-minute ovation.         Then she went back to the nursing home and continued her knitting. Mrs. Bunce, who always made it a point to start a new pair of mittens or a cap as soon as one was completed (on the assumption, she once explained, that God would not let anything happen to her as long as she had unfinished work), apparently knew the end was near. When she died, her daughter said, her needles were empty.         Mrs. Bunce's husband of 67 years, Karl, died on Feb. 27. In addition to her daughter, of Alexandria Bay, N.Y., she is survived by two sons, Roy, of Strasbourg, France, and Jack, of Watertown; 11 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Molly Keane, an Anglo-Irish novelist who had ridden to enough hounds, attended enough hunt balls and listened to enough below-stairs gossip by the time she was 17 to sustain two literary careers three decades apart, died on Monday at her cliffside home in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland. She was 91.         Although she was best known for her novel "Good Behavior," a finalist for the 1981 Booker Prize, its publication represented the resumption of a career she had abandoned after the death of her husband more than 30 years earlier.         It was a career that had been born and remained grounded in her childhood experiences.         Growing up in a grand home in County Wexford, where her Protestant English father was a noted fox hunter and her Irish mother was a lapsed poet and Italian literary scholar who wrote occasional reviews, was not entirely pleasant for Mrs. Kean.         But although her own sister once described her as an unloved child, her childhood served her well, providing the swirling fox-hunting background and social intrigue she drew on for more than a dozen novels and five plays.         An accomplished horsewoman herself, Mrs. Keane never apologized for her own youthful enchantment with a world circumscribed by riding, dancing and clothes.  Indeed, she began writing as a teen-ager, she once acknowledged, to supplement her dress allowance.         She also took the precaution of using a pseudonym, M. J. Farrell, a name she  spied on a board outside an Irish pub while riding home from a hunt.         "It would have been death to be known as a writer," she once explained.         Although the real identity of M. J. Farrell had long since become known in Irish and English literary circles, it was not until "Good Behavior" that Mrs. Keane, whose original name had been Mary Nesta Skrine, felt secure in publishing under a name of her own.         After the publication of "Good Behavior," her earlier works, including "Conversation Piece" and "Rising Tide," were reissued, and Mrs. Keane added two  further novels, "Time After Time," (Knopf, 1983) and "Loving and Giving," published in the United States by Dutton as "Queen Lear."         Mrs. Keane, who mined the same vein of childhood experiences time after time, inevitably found new nuggets of insight or intrigue. Unlike her earlier works, which she once suggested were written to portray a life she had wished for herself, her later novels had more bite, depicting the darker side of life among the disenfranchised Anglo-Irish gentry. ("Good Behavior" begins as the main character is genteely murdering her own mother.)         As a young adult, Mrs. Keane continued her childhood interest in parties and  gaiety, marrying a young Irishman, Bobby Keane, four years her junior, but only  after living with him for five years.         In her mid-30's she added plays to her repertory, writing five with John Perry, including "Spring Meeting," which was directed by John Gielgud in 1938 and provided Margaret Rutherford with her first starring role.         When she was 40, her husband died, and Mrs. Keane, who had two daughters, Sally and Virginia, was so grief-stricken she found she no longer had the zest for writing. She did manage to turn out two more novels, but with the exception  of a play that was panned in 1961, she wrote nothing until "Good Behavior" marked her return to form in 1981.         She is survived by her daughters.       
         P. L. Travers, who insisted she had never meant to write for children when the magical nanny Mary Poppins leaped from her pen, died on Tuesday at her home  in London. She was 96.         Miss Travers, a native of Australia who had lived in England since she was a  young woman, had been at various times in her life a poet, journalist, essayist, film and theater critic, dancer, Shakespearean actress and scholar of folklore and myth.         But she became renowned for "Mary Poppins," which, if not consciously intended for children, has been devoured by generations of them since its publication in 1934. The book, which has sold millions of copies and has been translated into more than 20 languages, has inspired critical studies, a string  of sequels and the 1964 Walt Disney movie musical, starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.         "I think the idea of Mary Poppins has been blowing in and out of me, like a curtain at a window, all my life," Miss Travers said in 1964. The critic Richard Lingeman wrote that Miss Travers "has succeeded in creating a timeless world inhabited by real people and complete unto itself -- an immortal world that is summoned into being, unchanged whenever one opens a book."         A prolific writer who was still publishing well into her 80's, Miss Travers employed a precise, lyrical prose. Her entire body of work, whether for children or adults, is linked by a deep concern with myth and mysticism, a belief in the interconnectedness of human experience, and a ceaseless quest for meaning.         "Her great thing was E. M. Forster's wonderful phrase 'Only connect,' " Jenny Koralek, a children's writer and longtime friend, said by telephone from London  yesterday. "That is the key to her entirely: a wonderful ranging mind and heart, putting together the pieces of life."         A gracious observer of the English proprieties who at the same time did not suffer fools gladly, Miss Travers had deep blue eyes, high cheekbones and, as a  young woman, a cap of curly dark gold hair. Her likeness appears once, hidden in Mary Shepard's illustrations, in each of the many Mary Poppins books.         Miss Travers, who demonstrated the gravest consideration for children but often displayed a tart impatience with her adult interrogators, was taciturn to  the point of secrecy about the details of her personal life. Partly to render herself anonymous, she signed her work only with her initials instead of the name -- Pamela Lyndon Travers -- that she adopted when she went on the stage as  a young woman.         As a result of her fierce privacy, concrete information about Miss Travers's  life is often elusive. She frequently supplied interviewers with different renditions of events large and small, as if these variant accounts had arisen from the oral tradition that so often inspired her writing.         It is known that she was born Helen Lyndon Goff in Maryborough, Queensland, Australia, on Aug. 9, 1899, the eldest of three daughters of Robert and Margaret Goff. Her father was a sugar planter, and Miss Travers recalled growing up near  the Great Barrier Reef in a tropical world of sugar cane, shells and mangoes. Miss Travers's Irish father and her mother, an Australian of Scottish and Irish  descent, infused the household with the mystery and melancholy of the literary traditions of the British Isles.         "Many a phrase, as ordinary to me then as the daily porridge, began its life, as I later learned, as a quotation from a poem or snatch from a ballad," she once said.         A voracious reader, Miss Travers began writing stories as a young child. Her  principal influences, she later said, were fairy tales and the Bible. A formative event in Miss Travers's childhood was the death of her father when she was 7. She moved with her mother and sisters to New South Wales to live with a great-aunt, who years later would become the title character in Miss Travers's 1941 book, "Aunt Sass."         Throughout her writing life, Miss Travers retained the extraordinary ability  to tap into the private, wistful anguish of childhood, and often said that she viewed the passage from childhood to adulthood as a single unbroken thread. "The ideas I had then move about in me now," she once said, adding elsewhere that "sorrow lies like a heartbeat behind everything I have written."         Miss Travers began her acting career at 10, when she was cast in a professional production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." As a teen-ager, she toured Australia with a Shakespearean company. She also worked as a dancer and journalist, and began publishing poetry. Sometime during this period she adopted the professional name Pamela Travers.         In 1924 Miss Travers left Australia for England, arriving with five pounds in her pocket. She soon began contributing poems to The Irish Statesman, a literary weekly whose editor, George William Russell, was the poet A. E. Through A. E., who became a mentor and lifelong friend, and through W. B. Yeats, to whom he introduced her, Miss Travers began to pursue the deep interest in Celtic folklore and Eastern mysticism that is palpable in all her subsequent work. Miss Travers also contributed film and theater criticism to the weekly The New English.         In 1934 Mary Poppins blew into Miss Travers's life and remained long enough to be captured on paper. Miss Travers was living in Sussex, recuperating from an illness in a 900-year-old thatched cottage mentioned in the Domesday Book. One day she found herself with two bored visiting children to entertain. She came up with a story about a raven-haired, rosy-cheeked governess who arrives with her carpetbag and parrot-headed umbrella at 17 Cherry Tree Lane to care for Jane and Michael Banks and their siblings. When Mary Poppins wasn't busy ruling the nursery with a will of iron, or admiring her own reflection in a shop window, she worked fabulous deeds: sliding up banisters, presiding at tea parties held on the ceiling, pasting gold paper stars in the heavens at night.         Encouraged by friends, Miss Travers published "Mary Poppins," which was an immediate critical success. A sequel, "Mary Poppins Comes Back," appeared the following year. It was followed by "Mary Poppins Opens the Door" (1943), "Mary Poppins in the Park" (1952), "Mary Poppins From A to Z" (1962), "Mary Poppins in Cherry Tree Lane" (1982) and "Mary Poppins and the House Next Door (1988).         "Nothing I had written before 'Mary Poppins' had anything to do with children, and I have always assumed, when I thought about it at all, that she had come out of the same wall of nothingness as the poetry, myth and legend that had absorbed me all my writing life," she wrote in 1978.         Although the Mary Poppins books were set permanently in the London of the 1930's, the Disney film was transposed to Edwardian times at Miss Travers's suggestion to give it a period sensibility. But despite her collaboration, Miss  Travers expressed dissatisfaction with the finished product.         "I think I was disturbed at seeing it so externalized, so oversimplified, so  generalized," she said in a 1967 interview. "I think that 'Mary Poppins' needs a subtle reader, in many respects, to grasp all its implications, and I understand that these cannot be translated in terms of the film."         After the outbreak of World War II, Miss Travers spent the years from 1940 to 1945 in the United States. Her experience became the basis for her 1941 book "I  Go by Sea, I Go by Land," the fictional diary of an 11-year-old girl who, like Miss Travers, was evacuated from England. The author would later return to the United States as a writer in residence at Radcliffe College in 1965 and at Smith College the following year.         In the decades after the war, Miss Travers continued to write. From 1976 on she was a consulting editor of the New York-based journal Parabola, which is devoted to the scholarly exploration of myth and tradition. Ms. Travers's books  during these years include "Friend Monkey," a 1971 retelling of the Hindu myth of the monkey lord Hanuman, a 1973 biography of the Russian mystic G. I. Gurdjieff, "About the Sleeping Beauty" (1975), a critical exploration of the fairy tale, and "What the Bee Knows" (1989), a collection of her Parabola pieces.         Miss Travers became the subject of public controversy in the early 1980's after "Mary Poppins" was banned from the San Francisco Public Library because of concerns over its treatment of members of minority groups. Of particular concern was the chapter entitled "Bad Tuesday," in which Mary Poppins and her charges travel to exotic corners of the world, meeting, among other characters, a black  woman on a South Sea island who holds a "pickaninny" on her lap, speaks in an American Southern dialect and offers everyone watermelon.         She rewrote the chapter for the 1981 revised edition of the book, substituting exotic animals for the offending ethnic characters. But in her public comments about making the revisions, she adopted a somewhat defensive tone. "I have done so not as an apology for anything I have written," she said.  "The reason is much more simple: I do not wish to see Mary Poppins tucked away in a closet."         In recent years, as her health began to decline, Miss Travers was confined increasingly to her home, a white Georgian town house with a bright pink front door in London's Chelsea section. Although she had previously stated that she looked forward to her old age, when she could sit in her rocking chair knowing all the answers, she grew incensed when a reporter for The New York Times asked  her about it in a 1994 interview. "But here I am sitting in my chair, and I don't think I'm going to know all the answers," she shouted. "I'm human."         Miss Travers, who never married, is survived by an adopted son, Camillus Travers of London, and three grandchildren.       
         Greer Garson, the actress who epitomized a noble, wise and courageous wife in some of the sleekest and most sentimental American movies of the 1940's, died yesterday morning at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. She was 92.         Miss Garson, who had a history of heart problems, had lived at the long-term-care hospital for the last three years, according to Ann Harper, a spokeswoman at the hospital.         Miss Garson became an instant success as a captivating young wife in the sentimental 1939 film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips." She was nominated for an Academy Award for this first film performance and quickly became one of the 10 most popular Hollywood stars.         She received five more Oscar nominations in five years for self-sacrificing portrayals in "Blossoms in the Dust" (1941), "Mrs. Miniver" (1942), "Madame Curie" (1943), "Mrs. Parkington" (1944) and "The Valley of Decision" (1945). She won the best actress Oscar for "Mrs. Miniver," in which she superbly symbolized  the spirit and virtue of a British homemaker in wartime.         With much of the earth ravaged by World War II, the Scotch-Irish actress with titian hair, blue-green eyes and alabaster complexion filled a need for a dignified and intrepid wife-mother figure. Her portrayals were so proper that one sequence in "Random Harvest," a major dramatic hit of 1942, created a sensation when she was allowed to wear kilts and show her shapely legs. Otherwise, she was heavily costumed and wholesomely typecast by Louis B. Mayer.         After the war, because of inferior vehicles and changing tastes, she was unable to escape the mold.         Nonetheless, in her Broadway debut in 1958, Miss Garson won acclaim in a comedy, succeeding Rosalind Russell as the devil-may-care "Auntie Mame." Two years later, Miss Garson received a seventh Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in the film "Sunrise at Campobello."         While preparing for "Auntie Mame" she told an interviewer: "I'm tired of playing four-handkerchief heroines in crinoline roles. I think there's a little  bit of 'Auntie Mame' in every woman -- a kind of counterpart to the 'Walter Mitty' in every man. I think Mrs. Miniver and Auntie Mame would have gotten along real well. Mame's really a doll. She promoted a liveliness and kindliness, and isn't that the best one can do?"         Early on, the actress enjoyed peerless popularity. Nine of her first 11 movies opened at Radio City Music Hall and played at that premier movie palace a total of 64 weeks. In 1978, Vincent Canby of The New York Times offered a tribute in which he deemed Miss Garson "emblematic of everything the Music Hall offered its patrons."         "In her high-toned M-G-M pictures she was invariably serene, polite, elegant  in a slightly unreal way, too good to be true, always prepared to meet any emergency and staunchly middle-class," Mr. Canby continued. "Her pictures were neither inhibited by the Hall nor did they ever look tacky amid all that splendor. Actress and theater were one."         Greer Garson was born on Sept. 29, 1903, in County Down, Northern Ireland, of Presbyterian parents. Her father, George Garson, a businessman, died soon after, and she and her mother, Nina, moved to London. The name Greer was a contraction  of MacGregor, her mother's ancestral name.         She was a frail girl with chronic bronchitis who was comfortable with her many adult relatives but uneasy with people her own age. She recalled a childhood of scrimping, study and an abiding ambition to act despite her family's pressure on her to teach. She received full scholarships from a county  school and from the University of London, where she won honors studying French and 18th-century literature in an accelerated course, with secretarial classes for a backup.         Miss Garson obtained a secure post as a market researcher for a London advertising firm, but gave it up to study acting with the Birmingham Repertory Theater during two years in the provinces, where she received increasingly         favorable notices.         She polished her craft during two years in the West End, starring in eight plays, including Shaw's "Too True to Be Good," and became one of Britain's ablest young stage actresses. Most of the plays were flops, but she was praised  for her talent, drive and professionalism. Envious associates dubbed her Ca-Reer Garson, a tag that trailed her to Hollywood.         In one theater audience in 1938 was the head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Riveted  by her performance, Mayer persuaded her to sign a movie contract for an uncommonly high starting salary of $500 a week. She confirmed his faith by her performance in "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" and further confirmed her skill in an effervescent 1940 film version of Jane Austen's novel "Pride and Prejudice," co-starring Laurence Olivier.         Miss Garson then entered her wartime phase of idealized helpmates, appearing  regularly with Walter Pidgeon. She inherited the mantle of M-G-M's First Lady from Norma Shearer, who had retired, and was indelibly typecast as what she ironically called "Metro's Glorified Mrs."         Her postwar, mostly unsuccessful, movies included "Adventure" (1946), co-starring Clark Gable; "That Forsythe Woman" (1949), with Errol Flynn and Mr.  Pidgeon, and the cameo role of Calpurnia in "Julius Caesar" (1953). In later years, she co-produced several plays in New York, including "On Golden Pond."         Miss Garson's marriages to Edward A. A. Snelson, a British civil servant, and to Richard Ney, an actor 10 years her junior who had played her son in "Mrs. Miniver," ended in divorce. In 1949, she married E. E. (Buddy) Fogelson, an oil  developer and industrialist. The Fogelsons had homes in Dallas and Los Angeles and a ranch outside Santa Fe, N.M., where they were civic leaders. Mr. Fogelson  died in 1987.         The actress's recreations included raising cattle and domestic animals as well as gardening and fishing. She continued to support the performing arts, giving $10 million to Southern Methodist University in Dallas for the Greer Garson Theater, which opened in September 1992. Asked once if she missed Hollywood, she replied: "No. I have at long last learned to be interested in where I am."         She is survived by a stepson, Gayle D. Fogelson, of Dallas.       
         Ariel Allen, a senior advertising executive for the Colgate-Palmolive Company, died on April 7 in New York. She was 58.         The cause of death was cancer, the company said.         Miss Allen joined the Ted Bates advertising agency in 1960 to work on the Colgate account.         She then moved to the Norman, Craig & Kummel agency, still working on the Colgate account. In 1971, she joined Colgate as vice president for creative services, developing television commercials with various advertising agencies.         In 1992, she assumed major responsibilities for the company's television advertising around the world as vice president for creative services in global advertising.         In 1988, the trade publication Advertising Age named her to its "100 of the Best and Brightest Women in Advertising" list and in 1989, Business Week included her in its list of "Women in Corporate America to Watch."         She had served as a chairman of the American Advertising Federation National  Convention.         Miss Allen is survived by her mother, Shirley Adsit, and her sister, Louisa Brownell.       
         Frances Frenaye, a veteran American translator of French and Italian literary works into English, died on Friday at her apartment in Miami Beach. She was 88.         Earlier, Miss Frenaye lived for some 50 years in Manhattan, where she was employed, from 1963 to 1980, by the Italian Cultural Institute and edited its newsletter.         Over the years she also translated writings by scores of French and Italian  authors, including Balzac, Carlo Levi and Ignazio Silone. And she translated the writing of Elie Wiesel, who was born in Romania, from French.         According to Herbert Mitgang, an author and former New York Times book critic, the most notable aspect of her work was an ability to combine clarity and eloquence. "She didn't confine herself to literal translation," he said, "but also succeeded in capturing both the sense and the spirit of the author's intention."         An award jury that included Henri Peyre of Yale University chose Miss Frenaye to receive the 1951 Denyse Clairouin Memorial Award for distinguished translation of French into English for her renderings of the books "The Plunderers," by Georges Blond, and "Renee," by J. H. R. Lenormand.         Other books she translated included "Christ Stopped at Eboli" (1948), by Carlo Levi; "The Road to the City," by Natalia Ginzburg (1952), and "Little Misunderstandings of No Importance" (1985), by Antonio Tabucchi.         Miss Frenaye was also a freelance critic, and she appreciated -- though sometimes grudgingly -- esprit and individualism in people as well as in literature. Applauding a 1956 work, "Wingless Victory," about Gabriele d'Annunzio, the Italian poet, novelist and dramatist, and his mistress, the actress Eleonora Duse, Miss Frenaye wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book's author, Frances Winwar, "in her spirited and lush re-creation of the  posing poet, has done well to present him in his own terms."         "Perhaps, in our iron age," Miss Frenaye added, "there is something to be said for flaming lives and for individual rather than mass aberration."         Miss Frenaye was born in Lawrence, L.I., into a family of remote French origin. She graduated from the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and in 1930 from Bryn Mawr College. She then spent six years in Europe, mostly in Paris and  Rome.         In 1939 she married Angelo Lanza di Trabia, a Sicilian, and afterward she used the surname Lanza in her personal life, although not in her work. During World War II she was a Washington-based official of the Justice Department. In Manhattan, after the war, she wrote a column for an Italian newspaper, Il Mondo, for a time.         Miss Frenaye and her husband separated in 1961, when he moved back to Italy.  He died in 1978.         She is survived by a daughter, Bianca Lanza of Miami, and a grandson.       
         Luana Patten, a child actress in the 1940's who appeared in the Walt Disney films "Song of the South" and "So Dear to My Heart," died on May 1. She was 57.         The cause was respiratory failure, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Patten made her movie debut at the age of 8, opposite Bobby Driscoll in  "Song of the South," a 1946 movie combining live action and animation. She was one of Disney's first contract players after the studio moved beyond animation,  and also acted in Disney's "Melody Time."         When she was 13, she took a brief hiatus from acting to finish high school. Her later film credits included "Johnny Tremain," "Follow Me, Boys," "The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come," "A Thunder of Drums," "Rock, Pretty Baby," "Joe Dakota," "The Restless Years," "Home From the Hills" and "Go Naked in the World."         On television, she appeared in "Rawhide," "Wagon Train," "Bonanza," "Daniel Boone" and "F Troop." She married John Smith, a television actor, in 1960; they  were divorced four years later.       
         Mary Rosamond Haas, a professor of linguistics whose interests ranged from American Indian languages that were dying to the prehistory of languages and modern Thai, died on May 17 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 86.         She suffered a long illness, according to the University of California at Berkeley, where she retired as professor emerita in 1977.         She, along with a handful of graduate students, was trained at Yale University by Edward Sapir, the legendary linguist and anthropologist, and became a force behind the Survey of California Indian Languages. Financed by the State Legislature, the project provided the wherewithal for sending qualified graduate students into the field for studies of the spoken native American word.         The program, started as a pilot project in 1949, surveyed cultures and languages presumably doomed to oblivion. In 1953, the survey of surviving Indian tongues became official, and the graduate department of linguistics was established on the Berkeley campus.         In the 1950's and 1960's, Dr. Haas used the survey for intensive explorations of the native languages in California and beyond. Such efforts inspired more than 40 dissertations and the careers of a generation of ethnolinguists.         Dr. Haas was a graduate of Earlham College in her native Richmond, Ind. She received a degree in comparative linguistics at the University of Chicago in 1931 and a Ph.D. at Yale in 1935. Her dissertation was on Tunica, an Indian language once spoken in what is now Louisiana.         She then delved into fieldwork with various other endangered or extinct species: Natchez, the only known member of its family of languages, as well as several of the Muskogean branch-offs, like Creek-Seminole.         As the entry of the United States into World War II loomed, she started working with the Thai language. She helped prepare Thai materials for the armed  forces and taught the language in a special training program at Berkeley, an experience that led to her appointment as an assistant professor of Siamese and  linguistics in 1947. She was promoted to professor of linguistics in 1957.         Her books in print include "Language, Culture and History: Essays" (Stanford  University Press, 1978), "Prehistory of Languages" (Mouton, 1978), "Thai Vocabulary" and "Thai System of Writing" (Spoken Language Service).         Dr. Haas is survived by a brother, Robert Haas, of Elkhart Lake, Wis.       
         Arona Lipman McHugh, the author of four novels, two of them set in her native Boston, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Staten Island. She  was 71 and lived in the West Brighton section.         The cause was cardiac arrest, her family said.         Mrs. McHugh's first novel, written at the family's summer home in Sag Harbor, L.I., was "A Banner With a Strange Device" (1964). It prompted the critic Haskel Frankel to welcome her in The New York Times Book Review with an accolade, "The lady is a born storyteller." Unusual for a first effort, it became a best seller and a Literary Guild selection.         It was the tale of a group of former G.I.'s and their women who were trying to patch their lives together again in the late 1940's in Boston. A sequel, "The Seacoast of Bohemia" (1965), followed some of the same characters and their entanglements.         Mrs. McHugh then turned out a historical novel in 1969, "The Luck of the Van  Meers," which traced several generations of a Dutch-Jewish family. Her final novel, also historical, was "The Calling of the Mercenaries" (1977), which focused on occupied Germany after World War II.         Mrs. McHugh graduated in 1950 with one of the first groups to finish the writer's program at the University of Iowa. She earned a master's degree in library science at Columbia University the next year.         In World War II she served in the Women's Army Corps in the United States and in occupied Germany. Before becoming a published novelist, she worked as a children's librarian at the New York Public Library.         Her husband, Warren J. McHugh, a folk artist who kept an art gallery in Sag Harbor for many years, died in 1986. She is survived by two sons, Michael W., of Staten Island and Jonathan A., of Los Angeles, and a granddaughter.       
         Constance Sullivan Carden, who helped plan Alice Tully Hall and was on the boards of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, died on Thursday at her Manhattan home. She was 86.         Mrs. Carden was born in Manhattan, a daughter of Walter S. Sullivan, a New York Times advertising manager. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and from Bryn Mawr College.         She studied lieder singing in the 1930's and worked for the Office of Strategic Services, translating captured Nazi documents, in Washington during World War II. She was a singer during, and for some years after, the war.         Mrs. Carden was on the Philharmonic board from 1958 to 1978 and was chairwoman of its education committee, which developed programs to bring classical music into New York City public schools.         She was on the planning committee for Alice Tully Hall for several years before the hall opened, in Lincoln Center, in 1969. In that capacity, she mainly helped Alice Tully, the philanthropist for whom the building is named, raise funds for its construction. Mrs. Carden was on the board of the Chamber Music Society from 1969 to 1991.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. George A. Carden; three sons, Dr. George  Alexander Carden of Palm Beach, Fla., William of Manhattan and Timothy of Montclair, N.J.; a daughter, Constance of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and a sister, Jeanet Curtis of New Haven. Her brother, Walter Sullivan, a former science editor of The Times, died in March.       
         Dorothy Hyson, a Chicago-born stage and screen actress of the 1930's and 40's who was famed for her beauty, died on Thursday in a London hospital. She was 81  and had moved to London with her parents as a child.         She had been in declining health after suffering a stroke, The Times of London reported.         Miss Hyson's second husband, the actor and director Sir Anthony Quayle, once remarked: "It was not only her beauty that possessed me. It was a radiant lightness of heart."         She was often said to have inspired the 1935 Rodgers and Hart hit song "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World," with what The Guardian on Saturday called "her blue eyes, blond hair, and fragile singing and dancing style."         Miss Hyson made her screen debut as a child in the movie "Money Mad" and her  stage debut in London in a 1927 play, "Quality Street," by J. M. Barrie.         The Daily Telegraph said that on the London stage she "scored her greatest triumph in the thriller 'Pink String and Sealing Wax,' " which opened in 1943.         Her first marriage, to the actor Robert Douglas, ended in divorce. Sir Anthony died in 1989. Her mother, the musical-comedy star Dorothy Dickson, died  last year at the age of 102.         Miss Hyson is survived by two daughters and a son.       
         Eugenia Price, who turned a chance visit to coastal Georgia into a career as  the South's most popular writer of antebellum romantic fiction, died on Tuesday  at a hospital in Brunswick, Ga., not far from her home in St. Simons, the island she made famous through a series of novels. She was 79.         Her companion, Joyce Blackburn, said the cause was congestive heart failure.         Her hoop-skirted heroines tended to be too unremittingly beautiful, her handsome heroes a shade too dashing and their problems a bit too easily solved for Ms. Price to have won serious literary acclaim. But then again, how many acclaimed authors sell more than 40 million books in 18 languages?         That Ms. Price did just that was a tribute both to her ability as a storyteller and her knack for recreating a bygone era with such compelling and authentic historic detail that, according to the St. Simons's Chamber of Commerce, a substantial majority of the thousands of tourists who visit the island each year come there specifically to scout out the houses, marshes and other locales she used in her novels, not to mention the headstones of the actual people she brought back to life as fictional characters.         Ms. Price, a dentist's daughter from Charleston, W.Va., was a precocious student who entered Ohio University at 16 and later studied dentistry at Northwestern University before dropping out of school to pursue a writing career.         Those familiar with the intensely romantic themes of her fiction would not be surprised that she began her career writing soap operas, initially in Chicago and later in New York and Cincinnati, the headquarters of Procter & Gamble.         An intense conversion to Christianity in the late 1940's altered the course of her life and of her writing. Abandoning soap operas, she began turning out inspirational books -- among them "Discoveries," "Beloved World" and "The Eugenia Price Treasury of Faith" -- that won her a wide following long before she turned to fiction.         Indeed, it was while on a tour in 1960 to promote one of her two dozen inspirational titles that she and Ms. Blackburn, who had been living in Chicago, happened to stop off in St. Simons and were so enchanted by the beauty and ambiance of the place that they decided they never wanted to leave.         It was a measure of their immediate and intense devotion to the island that the two women bought cemetery plots there before they built the house they named Dodge after the real St. Simons clergyman who, with his two wives, became the focus of Ms. Price's first novels, "Lighthouse," "New Moon Rising" and "Beloved  Invader."         Those books were such a succcess that she wrote a Florida Trilogy and a Savannah Quartet before a turning out a final Georgia Trilogy, whose return to the familiar St. Simons settings helped propel the first book of the final series, "Bright Captivity" (1991), to The New York Times best-seller list. The third, "Beauty from Ashes" (1995), was also a best seller. Her last book, "The Waiting Time," is to be published next year by Doubleday.         Ms. Blackburn, a writer who subsumed her own career to serve as Ms. Price's live-in editor, is her only survivor.       
         Tamara Toumanova, a child-prodigy ballerina of the 1930's who became familiar to American audiences as one of the most glamorous stars of 20th-century dance,  died on Wednesday at the Santa Monica Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 77 and lived in Beverly Hills.         She died after a brief illness, said John Taras, a friend.         By the time she was 13, Miss Toumanova was internationally acclaimed as one  of the three so-called baby ballerinas of Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes. She and two other phenomenally gifted daughters of Russian emigres -- Irina Baronova and Tatiana Riabouchinska -- were discovered in Parisian ballet studios by George Balanchine. They soon became the talk of London and New York.         Adoring fans nicknamed Miss Toumanova "the black pearl of the Russian ballet." Even as a teen-ager, her beauty was as remarkable as her technique. Kathrine Sorley Walker, a British dance historian, said of her in "De Basil's Ballets Russes" (1983) that with her "large dark eyes, raven wings of hair and magnolia skin, she combined lyricism and virtuosity to a remarkable degree."         A founding member of the de Basil Ballets Russes in 1932, Miss Toumanova inspired two of this century's greatest choreographers. She created roles in Balanchine's "Cotillon" and "Concurrence" and in Leonide Massine's "Jeux d'Enfants" with the company. She left the following year and was given starring  roles by Balanchine in his short-lived troupe Les Ballets 1933. Returning to the Ballets Russes a few months afterward, she danced in the classics as well as in  such new works by Massine as "Choreartium" and "Symphonie Fantastique." Later in her career, she performed with Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, and appeared in a number of Hollywood films.         Miss Toumanova was born on March 2, 1919, in a boxcar in Siberia. She was the daughter of a czarist army colonel and his wife, who were fleeing the Bolsheviks. The couple settled in Paris, where their daughter became a pupil of  Olga Preobrajenska, a Russian-born teacher.         Miss Toumanova astonished balletgoers in 1929, at the age of 9, when she appeared at the Paris Opera in "L'Eventail de Jeanne," a ballet with a cast of children. Reviewing the production in the theatrical magazine Comoedia, Andre Levinson, the most famous Parisian ballet critic of the time, called Miss Toumanova's dancing both "astonishing" and "frightening."         When quarrels between de Basil and Massine prompted the choreographer to form his own company, Miss Toumanova became a member of Massine's new Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938. She dropped out of the company the next year to appear in the Broadway musical "Stars in Your Eyes," and rejoined de Basil's company for an Australian tour and the New York season that followed it in 1940. She was once again a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1940 to 1942, and during the 1944-45 season, was a star of Ballet Theater.         As she toured the world, Miss Toumanova was accompanied by her mother, Eugenia, one of the most famous of the "ballet mothers" of the 1930's. These mothers went everywhere with their daughters, serving as dressers, laundresses,  cooks and pet keepers. In addition, the mothers were their daughters' fiercest partisans and sternest critics. Eugenia Toumanova was also said to be fond of fortune telling, faith healing and poker playing.         When, as a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Miss Toumanova was cast in the virtuosic Black Swan pas de deux from "Swan Lake," she and her mother would minutely inspect the stage to choose the spot at which the ballerina would perform a notoriously difficult series of whipping turns known as fouettes. Then they would pray over that spot. The fouettes never faltered. Grace Robert, an American dance historian, said of the Black Swan in her "Borzoi Book of Ballets" (1946): "Tamara Toumanova is at her exciting best in this tour de force, its vertiginous turns and sustained balances exactly suiting her temperament and forceful technique."         Miss Toumanova's later career, although a distinguished one, did not always seem as remarkable as her youthful achievements. After leaving Ballet Theater, she became a freelance ballerina, appearing with such companies as the Paris Opera Ballet, London Festival Ballet and the Marquis de Cuevas Grand Ballet. During the 1960's, she toured extensively in South America with Vladimir Oukhtomsky as her partner.         She created two notable roles with the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1947, she was a star of "Le Palais de Cristal," the glittering abstract ballet by Balanchine that is known in America as "Symphony in C." Three years later, she displayed her dramatic talents in the title role of Serge Lifar's "Phedre."         Some critics thought Miss Toumanova acquired annoying mannerisms. Reviewing her in the London Festival Ballet production of "Swan Lake" in 1955, John Martin, who was then the dance critic of The New York Times, complained that "her grandiosity (including some incredible bows) smothered the whole work like  so much thick chocolate sauce."         Nevertheless, she remained capable of extraordinary performances. Seeing her  at the Paris Opera in 1950, the American critic Edward Denby wrote in "Dancers,  Buildings and People in the Streets" (1965) that he was distressed by her "careless feet, limp and wormy arms, brutally deformed phrasings" but that his objections vanished when she offered "a few terrifying extensions, a few incisive strokes that counted phenomenally."         "At these moments," he went on, "she had so much vitality she made everyone else look as if they merely crept or scuttled about her while she danced."         Miss Toumanova acted and danced in several movies. She made her screen debut  in "Days of Glory" in 1944. That same year, she married the film's producer and  screen writer, Casey Robinson; the marriage ended in divorce. Miss Toumanova played the ballerina Anna Pavlova in "Tonight We Sing" in 1953 and appeared in "Deep in My Heart" in 1954. She had a starring role in "Invitation to the Dance," a ballet film directed by Gene Kelly in 1955. She was also in Alfred Hitchcock's "Torn Curtain" (1966) and Billy Wilder's "Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" (1969).         Miss Toumanova, who became an American citizen in 1944, lived quietly in later years at her home in Beverly Hills.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Hedwig Adele van Ameringen, a philanthropist who was a major supporter of the New York Philharmonic, died on April 27 at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.         Mrs. van Ameringen, born Hedwig Pfaltz in Newark, first heard the Philharmonic as a child at Carnegie Hall and became the orchestra's friend for life. She had been a member of the board since 1980.         She gave $5 million in 1991 to establish the Hedwig van Ameringen Guest Artist Endowment Fund, which helped engage scores of the world's leading soloists to play with the Philharmonic.         Mrs. van Ameringen was also a supporter of Lincoln Center, the Philharmonic's home since it left Carnegie Hall. Another of her principal beneficiaries was Fountain House, which helps people with mental illness find housing, schooling and the way back to productive lives.         In 1919, she married Arnold Louis van Ameringen, a founder and later chairman of what has grown into a billion-dollar company, International Flavors and Fragrances, based in Manhattan. Her husband, who died in 1966, formed the van Ameringen Foundation in 1950 to support programs in mental health. At her death, Mrs. van Ameringen was the foundation's honorary chairwoman.         She is survived by two daughters, Lily Auchincloss of Manhattan and Patricia  Kind of Huntingdon Valley, Pa.; a son, Henry P., of Manhattan; 6 grandchildren,  and 15 great-grandchildren.       
         Patsy Montana, whose yodeling-cowgirl songs made her a pioneer in country music, died on Friday at her home in San Jacinto, Calif., The Associated Press reported. She was 81.         Ms. Montana had her biggest hit, "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart," in 1935, the first million-selling hit for a female country singer. It brought an assertive female voice to country music, as she announced her readiness to "rope and ride" and sang whooping high notes. Ms. Montana remained active for a career that lasted six decades.         Ms. Montana, who original name was Rubye Blevins, was born in Hot Springs, Ark., in 1914, and grew up in Hope, Ark., hearing the music of Jimmie Rodgers, country's "blue yodeler." She moved to California in 1930 with an older brother, and began performing on radio there after winning a talent contest. She joined the revue of a well-known country singer, Stuart Hamblen, in 1931, working with  a group called the Montana Cowgirls; Hamblen renamed her Patsy. She made her first recordings as Patsy Montana in 1932, and in 1933 she moved to Chicago to perform on WLS radio with the Prairie Ramblers.         She appeared regularly on the "National Barn Dance" program and recorded for  the American Record Corporation, usually accompanied by the Ramblers; she relocated with them to WOR radio in Manhattan in 1935. Along with "I Want to Be  a Cowboy's Sweetheart," which she wrote, her hits included "Shy Anne from Old Cheyenne," "The She Buckaroo," "Rodeo Sweetheart" and "I Wanna Be a Western Cowgirl." In 1939, she appeared with Gene Autry in the movie "Colorado Sunset."         During the 1940's, she recorded with the Sons of the Pioneers and the Light Crust Doughboys, and had a hit with "Goodnight, Soldier" during World War II. She returned to Arkansas in 1948, performing on radio there and at the Saturday-night "Louisiana Hayride" in Shreveport, La. When her husband, Paul Rose, was transferred to California, the family moved to the West Coast, and Ms. Montana went into temporary retirement during the 1950's.         But she returned to touring in the 1960's. In 1964, she made an album with a  band that included Waylon Jennings, little known at the time, on lead guitar. In the 1970's and 80's, she made albums for folk and bluegrass labels like Birch, Old Homestead and Flying Fish.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Beverly Losey, both of San Jacinto, and two brothers, Ira Blevins of Mena, Ark., and Kenneth Blevins of Florida.       
         Honor R. Holland, who served as a British Army officer with the future Queen  in World War II and as a high Government official in Imperial Ethiopia, died last Monday in Saratoga Hospital in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. She was 79 and lived  in Saratoga Springs.         The cause was pneumonia, said Timothy Holmes, a friend.         Miss Holland was born in London, the daughter of a British major and an Ethiopian princess. She lived in Switzerland as a young woman but returned to Britain at the outbreak of war to join the Auxiliary Territorial Service of the  British Army.         She served in the same unit as the Princess Royal, now Queen Elizabeth II, and her sister, Princess Margaret. She rose to the rank of captain and, after the war, entered the diplomatic service in London.         She had met the exiled Emperor Haile Selassie, whose family were guests of Britain's royal family during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia. At his invitation, she went to Ethiopia in the late 1950's.         There, as an official in the Ministry of Education, she helped build the English-language University College into what became Addis Ababa University. She also served as civilian head of the country's modest navy and co-founded a magazine, Ethiopian Woman.         While in Ethiopia, an American cousin invited her to America, where she stayed. After moving to Saratoga Springs in 1982, she was active in the League of Women Voters and the Saratoga Springs Urban Cultural Park.       
         Pilar Lorengar, a Spanish soprano who was best known for her portrayals of Mozart heroines but whose repertory ranged from zarzuela to Puccini, Verdi and Wagner, died on Sunday at the Park Sanitarium in Berlin. She was 68 and lived in Berlin, where she was a star of the Deutsche Oper for more than 30 years.         Hans Boon, her publicity representative, said the cause was breast cancer.         Miss Lorengar had a bright, distinctive sound that was not to all tastes. Her detractors often pointed to her wide vibrato, a characteristic that is shared by many Spanish singers and has been described by Ms. Lorengar's admirers as an expressive shimmer. The vibrato aside, she was an attractive and vibrant singer who created a sense of feminine vulnerability in roles like the Countess  in "Le Nozze di Figaro," Dona Elvira in "Don Giovanni" or Mimi in "La Boheme," but could also be a commanding Tosca and a lively Fiordiligi in "Cosi fan Tutte."         Although she sang with orchestras and opera companies all over the world, and made recordings with many conductors and ensembles, she was unusual in that she  considered a single company, the Berlin Deutsche Oper, her artistic home. Miss Lorengar made her debut there in Orff's "Carmina Burana" in 1958, when the company was called the Berlin City Opera, and quickly became a favorite of Berlin audiences and critics. When the company opened its new house in 1961, it  was with a production of "Don Giovanni" in which she sang Donna Elvira.         Miss Lorengar sang most of the major Mozart roles in Berlin, as well as Wagner's Elsa in "Lohengrin" and Eva in "Die Meistersinger," the title roles in Puccini's "Manon Lescaut," "Madama Butterfly," "Tosca" and "Suor Angelica," and Verdi's Desdemona in "Otello," Violetta in "La Traviata" and Alice Ford in "Falstaff." She was made a lifetime member of the Deutsche Oper in 1984, when the company staged a 25th-anniversary gala for her. And it was in Berlin that she gave her last operatic performance, as Tosca on June 9, 1990.         She also performed often at the Metropolitan Opera, where she made her debut  as Donna Elvira in 1966. At the Met she sang several of the Mozart, Puccini, Verdi and Wagner roles that were also in her Berlin repertory, as well as Antonia in Offenbach's "Conte d'Hoffmann," Micaela in Bizet's "Carmen" and Agathe in Weber's "Freischutz." Her last appearance at the Met was as Fiordiligi in 1982. Her last appearance in New York was a recital at the 92d Street Y in 1987.         Miss Lorengar was born Pilar Lorenza Garcia -- Lorengar is a combination of her middle and last names -- in Saragossa, Spain, on Jan. 16, 1928. She became fond of singing after she joined the choir of the convent school she attended as a child, and was smitten with zarzuela when she heard it through the earphone of a homemade radio made for her by a neighbor. Before she undertook formal vocal studies, she was hired by Radio Saragossa as a member of its zarzuela troupe.         In the mid-1940's, Miss Lorengar moved to Madrid, where she studied with Angeles Ottein and sang in a zarzuela company for several years before she decided to change her focus to the more conventional operatic roles. She made her international opera debut, as Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro," at Aix-en-Provence, in 1955. The same year she made her American debut in a concert version of Granados's "Goyescas" with the Little Orchestra Society in New York.  She made her American operatic debut as Liu in Puccini's "Turandot" at the San Francisco Opera in 1964, and maintained a close relationship with that company over the next 25 years.         Miss Lorengar's discography includes recordings of Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice," Mozart's "Zauberflote" and Verdi's "Traviata" (all on London Records) and Hindemith's "Mathis der Maler" (on Deutsche Grammophon).         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jurgen Schaff, and a brother, Luis Garcia Seta, of Madrid.       
         Lily Auchincloss, a philanthropist and major supporter of the Museum of Modern Art, the American Academy in Rome and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Alexandra Herzan.         Mrs. Auchincloss was well known in New York cultural and social circles as an active and generous supporter of the arts with a keen interest in architecture and design.         A trustee at the Museum of Modern Art since 1971, she served on more than one-third of the museum's many trustee committees, including those of painting and sculpture, drawings and prints and illustrated books, and had been chairwoman of the museum's architecture and design committee since 1981.         In the 1990's, the several exhibitions she helped to finance included those of the architects Louis I. Kahn, Rem Koolhaus and Frank Lloyd Wright, as well as "Light Constructions" and "Cy Twombly: A Retrospective."         In 1994, the Modern named the Lily Auchincloss Center for Architecture and Design, a research facility, and 18 architects donated drawings to the collection in her honor. Terence Riley, chief curator of the department of art and architecture, said: "She was not a passive philanthropist. Her generosity came from a belief that the world could be a better and more beautiful place." Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Modern, said Mrs. Auchincloss was "one of the great, great trustees of our museum and involved with every aspect of its life."         Mrs. Auchincloss was born on April 5, 1922, in Newark. Her father, Arnold Louis van Ameringen, who was born in Holland, founded the International Flavors  and Fragrances Company. Her mother, Hedwig Pfaltz van Ameringen, who died last month at the age of 95, was a major supporter of the New York Philharmonic.         Although Mrs. Auchincloss's first cultural interest was music, her affinity for architecture and design was kindled at Radcliffe College, where she met Philip Johnson, formerly head of the department of architecture at the Museum of Modern Art, and the architect Marcel Breuer, with whom Mr. Johnson was studying  at Harvard. She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe in 1944.         From 1944 to 1958, Mrs. Auchincloss worked in New York City as an editor on magazines and newspapers, including Look, The World-Telegram, The Herald Tribune, Glamour, Harper's Bazaar and McCall's. In 1956, she married Douglas Auchincloss, a writer at Newsweek. They were divorced in 1979.         A lifelong Episcopalian, Mrs. Auchincloss became a trustee of St. John the Divine in 1975, where she founded a committee that supported the cathedral's presentations of art and music. She was especially interested in large free concerts and financed the first performance of Liszt's "Christus" Oratorio in 100 years in 1979 at the cathedral.         In 1991, Mrs. Auchincloss served on the jury for the competition for the design of the cathedral's new wing, which was won by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.         In 1977, Mrs. Auchincloss became the first woman to join the board of the Cooper Union. She also served on the board of Japan Society, and was a director  of the Municipal Arts Society and a Fellow for Life of the Morgan Library.         A member of the board of the American Academy in Rome since 1982, she was a major contributor to the renovation of the Academy's McKim, Meade & White building in Rome.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by a brother, Henry P. van Ameringen of Manhattan; a sister, Patricia Kind of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., and a granddaughter.       
         Dr. Constance B. Wofsy, a medical professor and clinician who created a program to educate health workers about advances in AIDS treatments, died on Monday at her home in San Francisco. She was 53.         The cause was breast cancer, according to the University of California at San Francisco, where she was a faculty member. Dr. Wofsy was also co-director of the AIDS Program and associate chief of infectious diseases at San Francisco General Hospital.         As co-founder of the hospital's AIDS Program in 1983 with Dr. Paul Volberding, she was influential in providing medical services for young gay men  early in the AIDS epidemic. She also created and directed a program that has attracted hundreds of health professionals to the hospital from around the world to learn about the latest techniques in AIDS care.         Early in the epidemic she recognized that women were at risk and founded an organization in San Francisco called Aware (Association for Women's AIDS Research and Education), which offered confidential testing for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and counseling. It published some of the earliest data on the prevalence of H.I.V. infection in women at high risk in the San Francisco area.         Dr. Wofsy was the founding chairwoman of the Women's Health Committee of the  AIDS Clinical Trials Group of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. The group oversees and carries out studies of various therapies for AIDS.         She was one of the first AIDS experts to address the issue of workplace discrimination against H.I.V.-infected people, and provided education and training materials on the issue to corporations in San Francisco.         Constance Wofsy was born in Cheltenham, Pa., on Oct. 6, 1942. She earned a bachelor's degree in bacteriology at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964 and a medical degree at the University of Southern California at Los Angeles in 1971. She joined the faculty of the University of California at San Francisco in 1975 and became a full professor in 1989.         She is survived by her husband, David, who is also a medical professor at the university, a son, Kevin, and a daughter, Susan, all of San Francisco, and her mother, Ruth Blitman, of Novato, Calif.       
         Laurel Weiner, a national associate and former national vice president of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on June 2 at Portsbridge Hospice in Atlanta. An Atlanta resident, she was 68.         The cause was cancer, the family said.         Mrs. Weiner, a native of Brooklyn, attended the University of Georgia. She devoted most of her spare time to volunteer work for civic organizations and the cause of Zionism. She was a delegate to three World Zionist Congresses and a leader in many national, regional and local Jewish groups.         She was on the board of the Atlanta Community Council and the Community Planning Council. She was also a former president of the Southeast Region of Hadassah.         Mrs. Weiner is survived by her husband, Charles J., a daughter, Toby White, two sons, Barry and Steve, a sister, Miriam Komesar, and a brother, Saul Weinberg, all of Atlanta, and seven grandchildren.       
         Brigitte Helm, the German actress who defined the unobtainable, cool-eyed screen vamp as the haunting teen-age star of Fritz Lang's futuristic 1926 masterpiece, "Metropolis," died on Tuesday in Ascona, Switzerland, where she had lived in seclusion for more than 30 years. By her own account, she was 88.         She was the most sought-after actress of the glory days of the German film industry, a tall blond beauty who starred in more than 35 movies and set directors against one another in the competition for her services. Ms. Helm was  regarded as such a perfect embodiment of the era's ideal of cool sophistication  that when she turned Josef von Sternberg down for the starring role in "Blue Angel," he had to settle for Marlene Dietrich.         Yet for all the acclaim she received for such roles as her portrayal of a blind girl in Georg Wilhelm Pabst's "Love of Jeanne Ney," or as a bored aristocratic wanton in his "Crisis," Ms. Helm could never eclipse the role, or rather roles, in which the good Maria, an oppressed working girl, is transformed into an evil robotic doppelganger of herself in Lang's "Metropolis."         Even today, 70 years after it was released, "Metropolis," is not only a cult  classic, it is regularly listed among the half-dozen most important films ever made. This is a tribute, to be sure, to Lang's grotesque science-fiction vision, and the array of fabulous special effects he used to bring it to the screen. The film depicts the world of 2006, a time, Lang envisioned, when a ruling class lives in decadent luxury in the lofty heights of skyscrapers linked by aerial railways, while beneath the streets slavelike workers toil in unbearable conditions to sustain their masters.         But for all the steam and special effects, for many who have seen the movie in its various incarnations, including a tinted version and one accompanied by music, the most compelling lingering image is neither the towers above nor the hellish factories below. It is the startling transformation of Ms. Helm from an  idealistic young woman into a barely clad creature performing a lascivious dance in a brothel.         The scene is, in a way, a reflection of Ms. Helm's own transformation.  While she was a woman of rectitude who never became anything close to the vamps she portrayed on the screen, according to most accounts she was a reluctant recruit  to the movies. The daughter of a Prussian Army officer who died when she was a toddler, Ms. Helm, a native of Berlin whose original name was Eva Gisela Schittenhelm, was a serious, idealistic boarding school student who appeared willingly enough in school plays but who regarded movie acting with Prussian disdain as an immoral occupation on its face.         Then her mother, who had no such notions, sent her daughter's photograph to Lang's wife, the screenwriter, Thea von Harbou, and Ms. Helm, who was 16 when she was tricked into taking a screen test, was suddenly on her way to stardom.         While he may not have been the sadist many of his actors made him out to be,  Lang was such a hard-driving perfectionist that Ms. Helm, who worked virtually every day for 18 months, often hanging upside down or standing in water up to her waist for hours at a time, found the experience excruciating.         After one torturous ordeal, when she wondered why a double could not have taken her place during the nine days it took to shoot a scene in which she is encased in a metallic robot shell, her face obscured, Lang haughtily claimed an  auteur's creative sensibility.         "I have to feel that you are inside the robot," he said. "I was able to see you even when I didn't."         After the movie made her a star, Ms. Helm, who had her own artistic standards, refused to make another movie with Lang.         She made a successful transition to sound, but refused to abandon Germany for Hollywood. Then in 1935, disgusted with the Nazi takeover of the film industry,  she abruptly quit, marrying an industrialist, Hugo von Kunheim, himself a Nazi opponent.         The couple left Germany for Italy in 1942, but although they returned after the war, Ms. Helm had put her career so far behind her she made no further films and turned down almost all requests for interviews.         Ms. Helm's survivors include a son, Mathius Kunheim of London, two other sons and a daughter.       
         Ella Fitzgerald, whose sweet, silvery voice and endlessly inventive vocal improvisations made her the most celebrated jazz singer of her generation, died  yesterday at home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 79.         She had been suffering from diabetes and its eyesight and circulatory system  complications for many years. In 1993, both of her legs were amputated below the knees.         A pre-eminent American singer who brought a classic sense of musical proportion and balance to everything she touched, Miss Fitzgerald won the sobriquet "first lady of song" and earned the unqualified admiration of most of  her peers. Musicians from Bing Crosby to Benny Goodman, when asked to name their favorite singer, cited Ella Fitzgerald.         "Man, woman or child, Ella is the greatest," Crosby once said. Mel Torme hailed her as having "the best ear of any singer ever." Until the 1970's, when physical problems began to impinge on her perfect technique, this hefty, unglamorous woman seemed to loom as an immutable creative force in a musical world where everything else was crumbling.         In a career that spanned six decades, Miss Fitzgerald stood above the emotional fray of the scores of popular standards she performed. Stylistically she was the polar opposite of her equally legendary peer, Billie Holiday, who conveyed a wounded vulnerability. Even when handed a sad song, Miss Fitzgerald communicated a wistful, sweet-natured compassion for the heartache she described.         Where Holiday and Frank Sinatra lived out the dramas they sang about, Miss Fitzgerald, viewing them from afar, seemed to understand and forgive all. Her apparent equanimity and her clear pronunciation, which transcended race, ethnicity, class and age, made her a voice of profound reassurance and hope.         Over the decades, Miss Fitzgerald performed with big bands, symphony orchestras and small jazz groups. Her repertory encompassed show tunes, jazz songs, novelties (like her first major hit, "A-Tisket A-Tasket," recorded in 1938), bossa nova, and even opera ("Porgy and Bess" excerpts, recorded with Louis Armstrong). At her jazziest, her material became a springboard for ever-changing, ebullient vocal inventions, delivered in a sweet, girlish voice that could leap, slide or growl anywhere within a range of nearly three octaves.         Great Diction And Vocal Agility         Miss Fitzgerald was renowned both for her delicately rendered ballads and her pyrotechnical displays of scat improvisation. (The jazz historian Barry Ulanov traced the term be-bop to her spontaneous interpolation of the word "re-bop" in  her 1939 recording of "T'Ain't What You Do, It's the Way That You Do It.") She was sometimes criticized for a lack of bluesiness and emotional depth. But her perfect intonation, vocal acrobatics, clear diction and endless store of melodic improvisations -- all driven by powerful rhythmic undercurrents -- brought her nearly universal acclaim.         During her long career, Miss Fitzgerald recorded with Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Louis Armstrong. Her series of "Songbook" albums, celebrating such songwriters as Cole Porter, Harold Arlen, the Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart and Duke Ellington, helped to elevate the work of the best American songwriters to a stature widely recognized as art song.         "I never knew how good our songs were," Ira Gershwin once said, "until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them."         Although most biographies give her birth date as 1918, her birth certificate  and school records show her to have been born a year earlier, on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Va. She was the product of a common-law marriage between William Fitzgerald and Temperance Williams Fitzgerald. The couple separated within a year of her birth, and with her mother and a Portuguese immigrant named Joseph Da Silva, she moved to Yonkers.         As a child, Miss Fitzgerald dreamed of being a dancer. But she also sang and  was attracted to the recordings of Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and the Boswell  Sisters, in particular the group's lead singer, Connee Boswell.         "My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it," she  recalled many years later. "I tried so hard to sound just like her."         As a teen-ager, Miss Fitzgerald developed a dance routine with a friend, Charles Gulliver, which they performed in local clubs. Then in 1932, her mother  died suddenly, and she went to live with an aunt in Harlem.         On Nov. 21, 1934, she made her stage debut in an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater, singing two songs, "The Object of My Affection" and "Judy," in the style of Connee Boswell. She won first prize.         Around this time, she also caught the attention of Chick Webb, the band leader and drummer, who was reluctant to sign her to a contract because she was  gawky and unkempt, a "diamond in the rough," as the band leader Mario Bauza later remembered. But the audience's reaction to her performances persuaded him  to offer her a job, and during the Webb band's residency at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem her reputation blossomed.         "I thought my singing was pretty much hollering," she recalled many years later, "but Webb didn't."         A Novelty Song Made Her a Star         Miss Fitzgerald made her first recording in 1935 ("Love and Kisses," with Chick Webb), and had her first hit with "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," a song she helped  write, adapting the lyric, she later explained, from "that old drop-the-handkerchief game I played from 6 to 7 years old on up." The record became a popular sensation and made her a star. After Webb died in 1939, the young singer was the band's nominal leader until mid-1942, when it broke up. Between her recording debut in 1935 and the demise of the band seven years later, Miss Fitzgerald recorded almost 150 sides, the majority of them novelties and disposable pop fluff.         During this period, she married Benjamin Kornegay, a shipyard worker and petty thief with a criminal record. The marriage ended in annulment after two years. The singer was 30 when she fell in love with the bassist Ray Brown while  they were on tour with Dizzy Gillespie's band. They were married in December 1947, set up housekeeping in East Elmhurst, Queens, and adopted the son of Miss  Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances. They named the boy Ray Jr. While Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on her career, her son was cared for by her aunt Virginia.         The marriage eventually became a casualty of conflicting career schedules, and the couple were divorced in 1953, although they continued to work together.  In 1957, there were reports in the Scandinavian press that she had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a Norwegian impresario. Miss Fitzgerald is survived by Ray Brown Jr. and a grandchild.         As early as 1942 and 43, Miss Fitzgerald began to be influenced by the experiments of such be-bop instrumentalists as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. She incorporated elements of be-bop rhythm and harmony into her singing, and while on tour with the Gillespie band in 1946 she embraced the music wholeheartedly.         A year earlier, she had recorded what would become one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade, a version of "Flying Home" in which she indulged extensively in the phonetic improvisation known as scat. Where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness.         Two years later, when Decca released her sensational be-bop version of "Lady  Be Good," Downbeat magazine proclaimed her "as great a master of bop as she has  been of swing."         These achievements were among the high points of a recording career that found Miss Fitzgerald recording in all manner of pop settings. Between 1935 and  1955 she recorded for Decca Records. Under the commercially astute supervision of the producer Milt Gabler, she was teamed with the vocal group the Ink Spots for several hits, including the million-selling "I'm Making Believe" and "Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall." She also scored commercially with novelty duets  recorded with Louis Jordan, the most popular of which was "Stone Cold Dead in the Market."         A Huge Change Of Direction         Dictated largely by the fads of the moment, Miss Fitzgerald's pre-1955 pop recording career was an artistically mixed bag and stood distinct from her work  as a swing and jazz singer in nightclubs. One of the artistic high points of the Decca years was a 10-inch long-playing record, "Ella Sings Gershwin," which she  recorded with the pianist Ellis Larkins in 1950.         Miss Fitzgerald's life changed when Norman Granz, the impresario of the popular Jazz at the Philharmonic series, invited her to join the touring jam sessions in 1949 and later became her manager. One of her most popular numbers,  "How High the Moon," evolved into the unofficial signature tune of the series.         Their relationship quickly developed into one of the most productive artist-manager partnerships in the history of jazz. When Miss Fitzgerald's contract with Decca expired, she became the first artist Mr. Granz signed to his new Verve label. It was under his supervision that she undertook the series of landmark "Songbook" albums that brought her voice to a large nonjazz audience.         "I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be-bop," she later recalled. "I thought be-bop was 'it,' and that all I had to do was go someplace  and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman came along, and he felt that I should do other things, so he produced 'The Cole Porter Songbook' with me. It was a turning point in my life."         "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook" became the prototype for a series of anthologies recorded over more than a decade and focusing on individual composers or composing teams, blending familiar standards and lesser-known, usually first-rate songs.         Backed by various studio orchestras, she also interpreted the work of Irving  Berlin, Harold Arlen, Duke Ellington, the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer  and Rodgers and Hart. "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbook," a 53-song, 5-LP collection recorded with the arranger and conductor Nelson Riddle in 1959, is widely regarded as the greatest of the collections.         These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing  the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.         From 1956 through the mid-1960's, Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on material that was almost consistently commensurate with her artistry, and her career soared. She made her first feature-film appearance in "Pete Kelly's Blues," in 1955, and in 1957 presented her own concert at the Hollywood Bowl. In April 1958 she gave a Carnegie Hall concert with Duke Ellington to celebrate the release of her four-disk set, "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook."         A workhorse who toured from 40 to 45 weeks of each year, Miss Fitzgerald showed the first signs of fatigue when she nearly collapsed on the stage during a concert in Munich in 1965. Five years earlier, Mr. Granz had sold Verve records to MGM, and when her contract came up for renewal in 1966, she was not re-signed to the label, but Mr. Granz moved her to Capitol, where her producer,  Dave Dexter, promised to give her "a totally different sound." These albums, which included a religious record, an album of country music and a Christmas collection, found her groping insecurely for a new pop identity.         Signed briefly to Reprise Records, Miss Fitzgerald tried singing contemporary hits by the Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Marvin Gaye, but rock and soul proved almost as uncongenial to her style as had country.         Basie, Sinatra And Symphonies         She returned to jazz full time when Mr. Granz founded his label Pablo in 1973. Among her many Pablo recordings are four duet albums with the guitarist Joe Pass, made from 1973 to 1986, and another songbook album devoted to the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim. She also began performing regularly with symphony orchestras, and in 1974 she teamed with Frank Sinatra and Count Basie for a two-week concert engagement at the Uris Theater in New York that grossed more than a million dollars.         From the early 1970's, Miss Fitzgerald began to have eyesight problems complicated by diabetes, and in 1986 she had heart surgery, but she returned to  the concert stage the next year. Despite ill health, she continued to perform at least once month into the early 1990's. Although her quality of voice slowly deteriorated from the early 1970's, even at the end of her career, her singing retained a remarkable rhythmic acuity.         Offstage, Miss Fitzgerald lived a quiet, self-protective life in a 13-room house in Beverly Hills. Her social life involved a small circle of old friends,  including members of the Count Basie and Duke Ellington orchestras, and other singers, including over the years Carmen McRae, Sarah Vaughan and Peggy Lee.         A model of abstemious self-discipline, she shunned cigarettes and liquor. She was also a person of few words. Shy and extremely sensitive to criticism, she preferred to let Mr. Granz do most of the talking for her.         Asked once how she felt about being "a legend," she replied: "I don't think I noticed it at first. But when Norman Granz and I began recording the 'Songbook'  series in the mid-50's, it just seemed that more people began to like my singing. The awards I started winning didn't make me feel important, but they made me realize people loved me. And then kids started calling me 'Ella' -- half of them never even mentioned 'Ella Fitzgerald' -- just 'Ella.' "         She amassed countless awards and commendations, including honorary doctorates at Yale and Dartmouth, the National Medal of Arts, and 13 Grammy Awards, including one in 1967 for Lifetime Achievement. In 1979 she was given a Kennedy  Center Award for her lifetime in the performing arts.         Accepting an honorary doctorate of music at Yale, she commented with her characteristic modesty, "Not bad for someone who only studied music to get that  half-credit in high school."         Fitzgerald for Home Listening         Ella Fitzgerald was one of the most prolific recording artists in jazz. These are some of her best albums:         "Ella Fitzgerald: 75th-Birthday Celebration" (Decca Jazz). A two-disk, 39-song collection, it includes the cream of the singer's pop output recorded for Decca between 1938 and 1955.         "Pure Ella" (Decca Jazz). These 20 songs recorded in the 1950's with the pianist Ellis Larkins exemplify elegant simplicity and ideal teamwork.         "Ella and Louis" (Verve). In this 1956 collaboration with Louis Armstrong, two titans meet playfully.         "Like Someone in Love" (Verve). This lush collection of 19 ballads recorded in 1957 with Frank DeVol's orchestra is her most romantic album.         "Mack the Knife: The Complete Ella in Berlin" (Verve). This classic live album was recorded in 1960 when the singer was at the height of her powers.         "The Intimate Ella" (Verve). Originally released in 1960 under the title "Ella Fitzgerald Sings Songs From the Soundtrack of 'Let No Man Write My Epitaph,' " the collection of 13 ballads recorded with the pianist Paul Smith is a neglected masterpiece.         "The Complete Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks" (Verve). Taken together, these 16 disks, recorded between 1956 and 1964, constitute the singer's crowning achievement. The tributes to Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer can also be purchased individually. Although the Cole Porter collection,  which was the first, is the most famous, it is not the best. The 53-song Gershwin album, recorded with Nelson Riddle's orchestra, is the artistic peak.         "Ella and Basie: On the Sunny Side of the Street" (Verve). A swinging powerhouse, released in 1963.         "Fitzgerald and Pass . . . Again" (Pablo). The best joint recording by two beautifully matched jazz classicists.         "Fine and Mellow" (Pablo). A wonderful swinging album from 1974, recorded with an all-star small ensemble.         Correction:  June 20, 1996, Thursday         An obituary on Sunday about Ella Fitzgerald misidentified the first feature film in which she appeared. It was "Ride 'Em Cowboy" in 1942, not "Pete Kelly's  Blues" in 1955.       
         Delia Goetz, whose travels as an education specialist for the United States Government provided her with material for more than a score of children's books, died on June 26 at her home in Washington. She was 100.         Mrs. Goetz, who was born in Wesley, Iowa, attended Iowa State Teachers College and then went abroad to teach at schools in Panama, Cuba and Guatemala.  During World War II she worked in Latin America for the United States Office of  Education, eventually joining that agency and remaining on its staff from 1946 to 1961.         Her first book was "Neighbors to the South" (1941), an introduction to 12 Latin American countries. She followed that with "Panchita, a Little Girl of Guatemala," the first of her many books for young readers. Her other works include "The Dragon and the Eagle," "The Hidden Burro" and "Other Young Americans." She was also the translator, with Sylvanus G. Morley, of "Popol Vuh," a Mayan Indian folk tale.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Harriett Heywood Patton, a founder of Recording for the Blind and a managing  director of the Metropolitan Opera Guild, died on Wednesday at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville. She was 85 and lived in Bronxville.         She suffered a brief illness, her husband, Arch Patton, said.         Mrs. Patton is credited with contributing significantly to the growth of Recording for the Blind, which she served as president in 1954, and of the Opera Guild. She was managing director of the guild from 1959 to 1968.         She was born in Indianapolis and graduated from Wheelock College in Boston. During and after World War II, she worked for United China Relief and the Friends of France and played a pivotal role on the Committee for Economic Development, a national organization.         The committee brought together top corporate executives to plan for the postwar era; Mrs. Patton was recruited as deputy director.         Acting as a welcoming party of one, she kept track of the members' comings and goings and saw to it that they were fed, chauffeured and otherwise cared for.         In 1948, she was a founder of Recording for the Blind, and she helped build it from a local group in New York for the benefit of blind war veterans into a national organization. She crusaded across the country to get concerned people to band together in local chapters and open recording studios for volunteers to  do the readings.         Eleanor R. Belmont, founder of the Opera Guild and a friend, persuaded Mrs. Patton to turn her attention in that direction and become managing director. During her tenure of nearly 10 years, the guild's membership and donations quickly increased, both in the United States and abroad.         Mrs. Patton, who had served as a director, was familiar with the operation and earned a reputation for running a trim ship. Annual gifts to the guild, $90,000 in Mrs. Patton's first year as chief executive, rose nearly fourfold, to $355,000.         She grew up in Portland, Me., and acted in summer stock for three years as a  young woman.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Patton left no immediate family. An earlier marriage to Roswell L. Gilpatric ended in divorce.       
         Jessica Mitford, whose book "The American Way of Death" won her enormous popularity as an irreverent muckraker and witty polemicist, died yesterday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Constancia Romilly.         Over the more than three decades that she wrote nonfiction, Miss Mitford railed against those who tried to suppress dissent over the Vietnam War, against a prison system she found to be corrupt and brutalizing, and against a medical profession she thought was greedy and given to unnecessary procedures. She even  exposed the odd doings of her sisters.         But it was "The American Way of Death," published in 1963, that made the British-born Miss Mitford a formidable literary figure in her adopted country. Near her death she was preparing a revision to be published next year by Alfred  A. Knopf.         The thesis of the book, a scathing indictment of the American funeral industry, was that undertakers had "successfully turned the tables in recent years to perpetrate a huge, macabre and expensive practical joke on the American public."         She explored the changing lexicon of death, in which undertakers had come to  call themselves "funeral directors" and "morticians," coffins had become "caskets," and hearses had become "professional cars." In the new order, she said, flowers were "floral tributes" and corpses were always called "loved ones." One of the results of all this, she said, was that the cost of dying was  rising faster than was the cost of living.         She told her readers unsettling things about their neighborhood undertakers,  much to the dismay of the trade, and at the end of the book included a list of medical schools that might have good use for a dead body. She felt strongly that someone's mortal remains would be better off studied by medical students than transformed into a profit center for those in the business of marketing and planning funerals.         The New Yorker hailed the book as a "brilliant journalistic case against the  whole funeral industry," and the work led to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. But not everyone was pleased. James B. Utt, then a Republican  Congressman from California, a state known for its Pharaonic funerals and ornate cemeteries, denounced Miss Mitford as "pro-Communist, anti-American." Mr. Utt said he suspected that profits from the book "no doubt will find their way into  the coffers of the Communist Party, U.S.A." Miss Mitford had been a Communist in the 1940's, an experience chronicled in her memoirs, but had quit the party.         Jessica Mitford was born on Sept. 11, 1917, at Batsford Mansion in Gloucestershire, England, one of seven children and the youngest daughter born to Lord Redesdale (David Mitford) and Lady Redesdale, the former Sydney Bowles.         It was by any measure a family given to eccentricity. One of Miss Mitford's five sisters, Pamela, aspired as a child to be a horse. Another, Diana, wanted to be a Fascist and succeeded in becoming the wife of Sir Oswald Mosley, the ranking leader of Britain's Fascists. Another daughter, Unity, went to Germany,  became a disciple of Hitler, shot herself and died nine years later in a nursing home.         Miss Mitford's eldest sister, Nancy, became a novelist, and is best remembered for "The Pursuit of Love" and "Love in a Cold Climate."         Miss Mitford described her childhood as largely unhappy. She particularly resented that she and her sisters were prevented from going to school because Lady Redesdale did not believe that girls needed it and tutored them at home.         Early in life, Miss Mitford shared a sitting room with her sister Unity, who  adorned it with swastikas. According to her memoirs, Miss Mitford responded by using a diamond ring to carve small hammers and sickles into the windowpanes on her side of the room.         When she was 19, she ran away from home with a second cousin, Esmond Romilly, a nephew of Winston Churchill. Because she eloped, she was cut out of her father's will. In 1939, Miss Mitford quit her job as a market researcher in the  London office of J. Walter Thompson and moved to the United States with her husband. He joined the Canadian Air Force after the war broke out and was killed in action in 1941.         Miss Mitford was a union organizer, a bartender at a Miami restaurant, a clerk in a Washington dress shop and a typist and later an investigator at the Office of Price Administration in World War II.         In 1943, she married Robert E. Treuhaft, a lawyer from Brooklyn, and the couple moved to Oakland, Calif. When Miss Mitford was 38, she decided that she would become a writer. She had largely failed at her other jobs, she wrote, and  "I figured that the only thing that requires no education and no skills is writing."         She produced her first book, "Life itselfmanship," in 1956. It was privately  published and had little circulation. Her second effort, "Daughters and Rebels," an autobiography, was published in 1960 and won praise from the critics. Her next book was "The American Way of Death," which remained on the best-seller list for a year.         Late in life, she was asked what sort of funeral she wanted. An elaborate one, she replied, with "six black horses with plumes and one of those marvelous  jobs of embalming that take 20 years off." She added that she wanted "streets to be blocked off, dignitaries to declaim sobbingly over the flower-smothered bier, proclamations to be issued -- that sort of thing."         Her other books attracted much attention, although none as much as "The American Way of Death." She also wrote "The Trial of Dr. Spock, William Sloan Coffin Jr., Michael Ferber, Mitchell Goodman and Marcus Raskin" (1969), five who were accused of aiding and abetting those who sought to violate the Selective Service Act. Among her other books were "Kind and Unusual Punishment: The Prison Business" (1973), a study of American prisons, which she found wanting in almost everything except brutality; "A Fine Old Conflict" (1977), a memoir of her Communist days; "Poison Penmanship: The Gentle Art of Muckraking" (1979), and "The American Way of Birth" (1992), in which she accused doctors of doing too many Caesarean sections and of not paying enough attention to the possibilities  offered by midwifery.         She also wrote articles for Life, Esquire, The Nation and The San Francisco Chronicle.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband; a  son, Benjamin Treuhaft of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Deborah Devonshire of Chatsworth, England, and Diana Mosley of Paris, and three grandchildren.         Correction:         An obituary of the writer Jessica Mitford on Wednesday omitted the titles of  her surviving sisters and misidentified the hometown of one. One sister is Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire. Her hometown is Bakewell, in Darbyshire; Chatsworth is the name of her house. The other sister is Lady Diana Mosley.         An obituary on July 24 about the writer Jessica Mitford misstated the relative ages of her and her sisters. Ms. Mitford was the second youngest of six daughters. Her sister Deborah was the youngest.       
         Bessy Pupko, who spent 50 years locating witnesses to Nazi war crimes, died on July 26 at her home on the Upper West Side. She was 99.         She worked for the World Jewish Congress until a few years ago, searching for people willing to testify at trials in West Germany and the United States. She kept the names of Holocaust survivors on cards in endless file boxes in her midtown Manhattan office, and placed small ads in Yiddish newspapers asking witnesses to come forward.         Among the cases for which Miss Pupko found witnesses was that of Andrija Artukovic, Minister of the Interior for the Nazi puppet state of Croatia in World War II. Mr. Artukovic was extradited to what was then Yugoslavia in 1986.  He was sentenced to death for war crimes there, but died in prison in 1988 before the execution could be carried out..         "In the days before computers, she was better than computers," said Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress. "She knew where everything was and where everyone was."         Miss Pupko grew up in Vilna, Lithuania, which was then part of Poland, and became a teacher at a school for Jewish children. In 1936, she immigrated to the United States, joining her two brothers. The rest of her family stayed behind.         Her father died before the war, and she lost her mother, a sister, a brother  and two nephews in the Holocaust. Her only immediate survivor is a sister, Rachela Malezin of Teaneck, N.J.       
         Anne W. Simon, an environmentalist whose books explored the perils to the world's seas and shorelines, particularly on her beloved Martha's Vineyard, died on Monday at her Manhattan home. She was 82 and also had a home in Chilmark, Mass.         At her death she was working on a book on the changing nature of Martha's Vineyard and what might be done to save the island where she had summered for many years. An article based on its first chapter was published in the July issue of the monthly Martha's Vineyard Magazine.         The article echoed her earlier book, "No Island Is an Island: The Ordeal of  Martha's Vineyard" (1973). There she told the tale of how the Vineyard, after hundreds of years of slumber, surrendered to tract subdivisions, an explosion of second homes, sewage spillovers and traffic jams.         Another volume, "The Thin Edge: Coast and Man in Crisis" (1978), discussed the precarious state of dunes and beaches, wetlands and estuaries everywhere that economic development reaches them. "Neptune's Revenge: The Ocean of Tomorrow" (1984) was an unsparing critique of the environmental damage to oceans from oil spills, overfishing, the greenhouse effect and the dumping of sewage, toxins and radioactive waste.         Anne Wertheim was born in Cos Cob, Conn., and in 1935 graduated from Smith College, where she edited the campus newspaper. She earned a master's degree at  the School of Social Work of Columbia University.         She was a writer at radio station WNYC, became a television critic for The Nation and subsequently wrote for McCall's, Good Housekeeping and other periodicals. Her first book was "Stepchild in the Family: A View of Children in  Remarriage" (1964), a primer based on her own experience as a stepchild and as a stepparent.         She was married three times and had taken the surname of her last husband, Prof. Walter Werner, while keeping her pen name. He died in 1986. Her previous marriages, to Dr. Louis Langman and Robert Simon, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son and three daughters from her first marriage: Thomas  Langman of Washington, Betsy L. Schulberg of Westhampton Beach, L.I., Lynn L. Lilienthal of Reston, Va., and Deborah L. Lesser of Berkeley, Calif., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Claudette Colbert, the versatile stage and film star whose flair for light comedy cheered audiences during the Depression and for decades afterward, died yesterday at Belle-rive, her home on the island of Barbados. She was 92 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Miss Colbert's wit, gaiety, cupid's-bow mouth and light touch took her from the Art Students League in New York to the height of stardom on Broadway and in  Hollywood. She is best remembered for screwball comedies in which, no matter what situation befell her, she usually managed to keep her aplomb and good humor. Her greatest triumph was playing a runaway heiress opposite Clark Gable's cynical reporter in Frank Capra's film comedy "It Happened One Night," a performance that won her an Academy Award as best actress in 1934.         She could appear worldly and sophisticated yet down to earth, a quality that, combined with attention to camera angles, lighting and other technical details, helped her to sustain a remarkably durable career encompassing more than 60 films and many stage appearances.         In 1981, in her seventh decade in show business, the New York Times critic Frank Rich, praising her performance in the Broadway flop "A Talent for Murder," called her "a lady of piquant, irrepressible, ever-so-amusing common sense." He  cited "her big Betty Boop eyes, curly light hair" and "her low, one-of-the-boys  voice, effortlessly hurling asides like pool balls into every pocket of the house."         "Audiences always sound like they're glad to see me, and I'm damned glad to see them," Miss Colbert told an interviewer in 1978. "If they want you, you want to do it. The feeling never dies."         From 'The Lady Lies' To the Milk of Asses         Miss Colbert had her first film success in 1929, as the heroine of the talkie "The Lady Lies." Her early notable films, all box-office hits, included "The Smiling Lieutenant" (1931), a wistful Ernst Lubitsch comedy; "The Sign of the Cross," a 1932 Cecil B. DeMille spectacular in which she played Nero's sensuous  empress Poppaea, and the 1934 production of "Cleopatra," in which she played the title role.         "The Sign of the Cross" included a memorable scene with Miss Colbert bathing  in what was described by the studio as asses' milk, a scene that became widely admired. The film historian David Thomson wrote six decades later that Miss Colbert had bathed not only in asses' milk but also in "the director's boyish lasciviousness."         Miss Colbert confided in a 1984 interview that the asses' milk was really made from a powdered product called Klim.         "That's 'milk' spelled backward," the star explained. "I was in the pool all  day. The Klim was so warm my bangs came uncurled. When the electricians turned off all the hot lights for an hour it congealed and the Klim turned to cream cheese."         Besides DeMille, directors of her films included George Cukor, John Ford, Gregory LaCava, Mervyn LeRoy and Anatole Litvak. Among her leading men were Maurice Chevalier, Gary Cooper, Joseph Cotten, Melvyn Douglas, Henry Fonda, Fred MacMurray, Fredric March, Ray Milland, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne and Orson Welles.         Her early films were followed by such successes as "Imitation of Life" (1934); "The Gilded Lily" (1935); "Private Worlds" (1935), a drama of a mental institution; "Bluebeard's Eighth Wife" (1938), another Lubitsch comedy; "Midnight" (1939); "The Palm Beach Story" (1942), a Preston Sturges caper, and "Since You Went Away" (1944), a drama of the American home front during World War II.         Her last artistically substantial movie role was as a married American woman  in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in "Three Came Home" (1950). Her performance  was warmly praised by the critics, but the film did not fare well at the box office.         Through much of her movie career she was under contract to Paramount, although she was on loan to Columbia when she made "It Happened One Night." After 1950 her movie roles were largely vignettes. She made her last feature film, "Parrish," in 1961 but went before the cameras again in 1986 for a television movie, "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles."         Miss Colbert's most noteworthy stage vehicles included "The Barker" (1927), a box-office hit in which she played an alluring snake charmer; Eugene O'Neill's "Dynamo," which was produced by the Theater Guild in 1929 and won her considerable prestige, although it was not a popular success, and the fluffy comedy "The Marriage-Go-Round," a smash hit that opened in 1958 co-starring Charles Boyer, with whom she had also appeared in such films as "Private Worlds" (1935) and "Tovarich" (1937).         An important ingredient in her early success in the theater was her skill asa speaker. When talking films took hold and many silent-film stars turned out to have inadequate voices, she was taken on by Paramount.         "Hollywood was not my dream, you know," she said in an interview in 1978. "I  only left Broadway when the crash came. The Depression killed the theater, and the pictures were manna from heaven."         For many years, Miss Colbert was among the top-earning movie stars: some industry analysts calculated that she was the industry's best-paid star in 1938  and 1942. That made it even easier for her to clothe her 5-foot-4-inch frame ultra-fashionably, and for several years she was voted Hollywood's best-dressed  woman.         Despite her long identification with Hollywood, Miss Colbert's dramatic skills were versatile enough that she was among the few major film stars who managed repeatedly to return to the stage to critical acclaim.         Triumphant Returns To the Theater         Her first return to Broadway, after more than a quarter-century and the cooling of her movie career, came in the spring of 1956, when she replaced Margaret Sullavan during the spring and summer in the comedy "Janus." Appearances in other Broadway productions followed, including "The Marriage-Go-Round," and in 1963 she announced that she was bidding farewell to Hollywood for good.         Miss Colbert was born in Paris on Sept. 13, 1903, and was brought to this country as a child by her parents, Georges and Jeanne Loew Chauchoin. Her name was originally Lily Claudette Chauchoin. But she took the name Claudette Colbert (pronounced coal-BEAR) for her first Broadway role, an opening that resulted from an introduction to the playwright Anne Morrison at a tea party in New York  in 1923. Miss Colbert, who was studying at the Art Students League, jokingly suggested that Morrison give her a role in her next play. Morrison gave her a small one in "The Wild Westcotts."         "I just went right onstage, and I learned by watching," Miss Colbert said years later, noting that she had never taken acting lessons. "I've always believed that acting is instinct to start with; you either have it or you don't."         Broadway fame came quickly. In 1927 the young Leland Hayward, who would become a celebrated theatrical producer, told the director Frank Capra that Miss Colbert was "a real headline maker, the finest young actress that's hit Broadway in years."         Mr. Capra was soon directing the silent movie "For the Love of Mike," with Mr. Hayward in overall charge of production and Miss Colbert in the leading female role.         The movie, nade on a shoestring, was a flop. In his 1971 book "The Name Above the Title," Mr. Capra wrote that Miss Colbert, "never easily pleased, said that  for her it was a disaster, and vowed that it would be her first and last film."         Although she changed her mind, Miss Colbert was far from Mr. Capra's first choice for the female lead when he began preparing "It Happened One Night." First he approached Myrna Loy, who turned the part down. So did Margaret Sullavan. So did Miriam Hopkins. So did Constance Bennett.         Finally Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia Pictures, suggested Miss Colbert, who grudgingly took on the role. When the movie was being made, Mr. Capra reported, Miss Colbert proved to be firm yet engaging. For one intimate scene, he said: "Claudette refused to even partially undress before the camera. She wanted to feature her acting, not her sex appeal."         By the same token, she refused at first to raise her skirt for the subsequently famous hitchhiking scene, in which the script called for her to demonstrate that a display of leg could stop a motorist.         And so, Mr. Capra recalled: "We waited until the casting director sent us a chorus girl with shapely underpinnings to 'double' for Colbert's. When she saw the double's leg, she said: 'Get her out of here. I'll do it. That's not my leg!' "         During the filming, Mr. Capra asserted, Miss Colbert had "many little tantrums, motivated by her antipathy toward me," but "she was wonderful in the part." Later it was said that she told friends, "I've just finished the worst picture in the world."         When Oscar time rolled around, the film won the five top awards: best picture, best writer, best director, best actor and best actress.         When the Oscar was placed in her hands Miss Colbert said, "I owe Frank Capra  for this."         In later years Miss Colbert also appeared frequently on television, and in that medium, too, it was said that despite her talent she could be difficult. Noel Coward, who worked with her in 1956 on the live telecast of his comedy "Blithe Spirit," recorded in his diary that he found her "extremely tiresome."         "All this is a sad pity," he wrote, "because she is, within her limits, an excellent actress and those limits she imposes on herself.I have for years had a definite affection for her as a person, but these rehearsals are wilting it considerably."         Miss Colbert, who was short-necked, liked to tell of a Coward comment during  those rehearsals: "If she had a neck, I'd wring it." Miss Colbert said the comment had hurt at the time, but agreed that it was funny. She and Coward made  up a year later.         Miss Colbert drew praise for her acting, into her 80's. She co-starred on Broadway with Rex Harrison in "The Kingfisher" in 1981 and shared top billing with him again in the 1985 Broadway revival of "Aren't We All?," a 1923 drawing-room comedy by Frederick Lonsdale that took them to Australia for a five-month tour after runs in London, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Mr. Rich of The Times called her the play's "most alluring attraction" and "simply a wonder" as the tea-sipping Lady Frinton.         Always Appreciative Of Her Film Genre         In 1984, a building at the Kaufman Astoria studios in Queens, where she made  her first 10 films for Paramount, was named after her, and the Film Society of Lincoln Center paid tribute to her lifetime achievement with a gala in her honor. She was also honored by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1989.         For years, Miss Colbert spent six months annually at her beachfront estate in Barbados, where her guests included Ingrid Bergman, Frank Sinatra and Ronald and Nancy Reagan. She remained on Barbados after her stroke three years ago.         In 1928, Miss Colbert married Norman Foster, an actor and director who was appearing with her in "The Barker." They were divorced in 1935, and in December  of that year she married Dr. Joel Pressman; he died in 1968, and she leaves no immediate family members.         Miss Colbert never looked down on the material she was best at. The film studios liked her to do comedy, she once said, "because they made a lot of money off me." But she added: "I did the comedy because all my life I always wanted to laugh myself. There was never anything that gave me as much satisfaction as to be in something amusing."         Emancipated, With a Light Touch         During a career that began in the 1920's and lasted into the 1980's, Claudette Colbert starred in more than 60 films and in plays on Broadway and in  London. These are some of the works in which she appeared.

         Jean Broward Shevlin Gerard, who as America's permanent representative at Unesco played a key role in President Reagan's decision to pull out of the agency in 1984, died of cancer at her home in Paris yesterday. She was 58.         Drago Najman, a friend and former senior Unesco offical, confirmed her death by telephone from Paris, where Mrs. Gerard had been living while undergoing treatment.         Active in Republican politics, Mrs. Gerard was appointed representative to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1981 with a mandate from the Reagan Administration to clean up an agency that in its view was badly managed and had become increasingly politicized and anti-Western under its director general, Amadou Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal.         The outspoken Mrs. Gerard tried to negotiate changes at Unesco headquarters in Paris, but quickly ran into opposition from Mr. M'Bow and his senior staff.         Mrs. Gerard and Mr. M'Bow also found themselves at odds over the developing world's campaign to create what it termed a New World Information and Communications Order to be administered by Unesco.         This new order was intended to curb the industrialized world's perceived monopoly on the flow of information by drawing up a new code of conduct for journalists and the work they do. But the proposal was opposed by the United States as an infringement of press freedom.         On Dec. 28, 1983, the Reagan Administration abandoned its efforts to negotiate change at Unesco when Mrs. Gerard gave Mr. M'Bow notice of America's intention to withdraw from the organization on Dec. 31, 1984, and to end its financial support of the agency, cutting its budget by a quarter. Subsequently Britain and Singapore also withdrew.         None have yet returned, although Mr. M'Bow was replaced in 1987 by Federico Mayor, a Spaniard who is regarded as more moderate, and the campaign for a new information order has been abandoned.         In 1985, Mrs. Gerard was named Ambassador to Luxembourg, serving there until 1989. She was a director of the Youth Foundation, the N.Y. Genealogical and Biographical Society and the Child Health Foundation.         Born in Portland, Ore. in 1938, she graduated from Vassar College in 1959. She married James Watson Gerard, a United States Army officer, the same year. He died in 1987. She earned her law degree from Fordham University in 1977.         She is survived by a son, James, and a daughter, Harriet.       
         Barbara Srenco Brier, a former world bridge champion, died yesterday in Allegheny University Hospitals Center City in Philadelphia. She was 73 and a resident of Miami.         Her daughter, Bonnie Brier of Penn Valley, Pa., said she died of complications after heart surgery.         In 1970 Mrs. Brier won the World Mixed Pairs Championship in Stockholm. Her partner was Waldemar Von Zedtwitz. This was a remarkable accomplishment, as he was 74 years old and had vision problems that made it difficult for him to see the cards. He died in 1984.         She won two national titles, the Open Pairs in 1955 and Mixed Teams in 1965, and was runner-up three times. She won many regional titles.         She was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Cornell University. She worked for many years as a bridge teacher, primarily in Miami.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Jean Hershell of Tinton Falls, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Nanette Bearden, the founder and artistic director of the Nanette Bearden Contemporary Dance Theater, died on Aug. 10 at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island. She was 69 and had homes in Manhattan and on St. Martin in the French West Indies.         The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said Dorothy Dow, a sister.         Ms. Bearden was an energetic supporter of fledgling black choreographers and small modern-dance companies and produced their work in a series, Broadway Dance Festival, in 1975 and 1976. Her own modern-dance company, founded in 1976 as the Chamber Dance Group, presented simple stage productions for dances by black choreographers who included Walter Rutledge, Gary DeLoatch, Walter Raines, William Scott and Roumel Reaux. The company also performed dances by such leading choreographers as Alvin Ailey, Talley Beatty, Fred Benjamin, George Faison and Dianne McIntyre.         Born on Staten Island, Ms. Bearden studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and was a model with the Ophelia DeVore Agency. She trained in dance at the Martha Graham school, at Clark Center and at the Luigi Dance Center and performed from 1971 to 1974 with the New World Dancers. She was also a promoter of visual arts in the French West Indies.         Ms. Bearden's husband, the artist Romare Bearden, died in 1988. Besides Mrs. Dow, she is survived by six other sisters, Evelyn Jackson and Marie, Sheila and Delores Rohan, all of Staten Island and St. Martin; Annette Rohan of Bellflower, Calif., and Gloria Elboushi of Long Beach, Calif.       
         Virginia Corwin Brautigam, a scholar who helped pioneer the field of comparative religion and who traveled the world in search of knowledge about Eastern faiths, died on Monday at a retirement community in Newtown, Pa. She was 95.         Dr. Corwin, as she was know to her students and colleagues, was a professor emeritus of religion and biblical literature at Smith College, where she taught from 1930 until  retiring in 1966.         Originally a specialist in early Christianity, Dr. Corwin's intellectual curiosity about Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam and Shinto was stimulated by a course in world religions she taught as a young assistant professor.         Her studies took her far and wide. She walked through central India with the disciples of Vinoba Bhave, a spiritual successor of Mohandas K. Gandhi who traveled on foot from village to village preaching asceticism and social reform.         In Kyoto, Japan, she was taken in by Buddhist monks as a visiting resident in their temple.         And in Vietnam she hitched a ride with the United States Army, which flew her to isolated villages deep in the interior so she could study their Buddhist traditions.         Virginia Corwin, who was born and raised in East Orange, N.J., graduated from Wellesley College, Union Theological Seminary and Yale University, where she received a doctorate in history in 1937 after studying under Robert Calhoun, Roland Bainton and Richard Niebuhr.         Her dissertation, ''St. Ignatius and Christianity in Antioch,'' was published by Yale Press in 1960.         Dr. Corwin's broadening interests, which went from the study of early Christianity to include more world religions, was emblematic of her generation of theologians. She began teaching when the field of comparitive religion was still young.         ''Her generation was involved in the forming and shaping of a whole new field of study, especially for liberal arts colleges, that changed the focus of study from normative Christianity to a whole range of religions,'' said Diana L. Eck, a professor of comparative religion and Indian studies at Harvard University, who took Dr. Corwin's class at Smith and became a lifelong friend.         Dr. Corwin remained single until she was 74 years old, when she married Herman Brautigam, a friend and colleague she had first met 40 years earlier as a student at Yale. Mr. Brautigam died in 1985.         Dr. Corwin, who lost her eyesight in the 1970's, continued teaching courses in religion to her neighbors at Pennswood Village, her retirement home, until this March.         She is survived by a brother, Theodore S. Corwin of Chatham, N.J., three step-children, and nine step-grandchildren.       
         Maria Telkes, an advocate of putting the sun's energy to use and one of the first researchers to do so in an experimental residence, died last Dec. 2 in Budapest on her first visit to her native Hungary in 70 years. She was 95 and lived in North Miami, Fla.         News of her death was relayed by members of the Hungarian community in this country last week.         Dr. Telkes also developed a solar salt-water still for the Navy in World War II, which saved the lives of torpedoed sailors and downed airmen. She spent many years experimenting with stoves that used solar energy for their heat and were simple and cheap enough for use by  villagers in poor, arid regions.         She also worked on an air-conditioning system in the 1970's that stored ''coolness'' at night for use the next day. The idea was to reduce power demand during hot spells and lower the risk of electrical ''brownouts'' and blackouts.         Born in Budapest, Dr. Telkes received a doctorate in physical chemistry at the University of Budapest, where she started her career as an instructor. She came to the United States in 1925 to visit a cousin, who was then the Hungarian consul in Cleveland, and stayed when the Cleveland Clinic Foundation hired her as a biophysicist.         She worked there for 12 years under Dr. George Crile. In a series of experiments they invented a photoelectric mechanism capable of recording brain waves.         Later, she carried out research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University and the University of Pennsylvania, among others. She retired in 1977 as a senior scientist at the University of Delaware but remained active as a consultant until about three years ago.         In the 1940's she teamed up with an architect, Eleanor Raymond, to build the first solar-heated house, using a chemical that crystalized and retained the heat and then radiated it back to keep a constant temperature. The plant used no auxiliary power source but still kept the five-room house in Dover, Mass., cozy through the winter.       
         Elizabeth Eyre de Lanux, an American artist, writer and designer of 1920's Art Deco furnishings whose works were rediscovered in the late 1980's, died on Sunday at the DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 102.         Mrs. de Lanux designed lacquered furniture and geometric patterned rugs that were produced in Paris in the 1920's. Her modernist furnishings were considered among the most sophisticated and were frequently exhibited with those of Eileen Gray and Jean-Michel Frank.         The designs of Eyre de Lanux, the name she used professionally from the 1920's on, came to light in 1989 when two pieces she had designed were offered in the widely publicized New York auction of the Art Deco collection of Robin Symes, a London antiquities dealer.         One of them, a lacquered table with a Cubist-inspired base from 1929, was reproduced in announcements of the sale, which included Mr. Symes's house, an 1860's carriage house that was modernized by Philip Johnson in 1949 for use as a guest house by the owners, Blanchette and John D. Rockefeller 3d.         By 1989, Mrs. de Lanux's whereabouts were unknown in the design world. But her name was listed in the Manhattan telephone book, and despite her great age and infirmities -- she was legally blind -- she granted several interviews. The table ''was a joke,'' she said. ''I made it as a caricature of a Cubist sculpture.''         Elizabeth Eyre was born in Johnstown, Pa., and studied painting at the Art Students League in Manhattan. In 1918, she married Pierre de Lanux, a French writer and diplomat, who was visiting New York. World War I had just ended, and they immediately moved to Paris. She studied with Brancusi in the early 1920's and became a designer, illustrator and writer. The couple moved in literary and art circles with Andre Gide, Hemingway, Matisse, Picasso and Bernard Berenson. She wrote about that world for Town & Country magazine in the 1920's. And, after she returned to the United States, she wrote in the 1960's for The New Yorker and Harper's Bazaar. Mr. de Lanux died in 1955.         In her later years, Mrs. de Lanux continued as an interior decorator and as an illustrator of children's books, the last of which, ''Overheard in a Bubble Chamber,'' by Lillian Morrison, was published in 1981. Mrs. de Lanux lived alone until she moved in late July to the nursing home. She is survived by her daughter, Anne Strong of Shingle Springs, Calif., and two grandsons, Nicholas Eyre of Napa, Calif., and Paul Eyre of Honolulu.       
         Martha Phillips, a notable force in luxury fashion retailing for more than 60 years and an early supporter of many of today's leading designers, died on Saturday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 98.         Martha, as she was generally known (Miss Martha to her employees), was for many years a well-known front-row figure at major fashion shows in New York and Europe and a booster of, among others, Valentino, Halston, Geoffrey Beene, James Galanos, Pauline Trigere, Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta and Zandra Rhodes at the beginning of their careers.         Her customers at her elegant Park Avenue and Palm Beach salons were some of the world's richest and most socially prominent women, who often filled in checks that ended in three and four zeros.         There were four Martha shops in the 1980's, when sales were said to be almost $40 million. A boutique in the Trump Tower closed after several years, and a bankruptcy filing in 1992, attributed to the economy, resulted in the shuttering of the Park Avenue salon and another in Bal Harbour, Fla. The Palm Beach shop, operated by Mrs. Phillips's daughter, Lynn Manulis, remains, and Mrs. Phillips went in almost daily until shortly before her death.         ''There was never anybody like her and there won't be anyone like her,'' Ms. Trigere said yesterday. The designer, who did business with Mrs. Phillips for almost a half-century, added, ''She developed a special knowledge of who her customer was -- from the very first client, she knew what she was doing.''         Mr. Beene described Mrs. Phillips as ''an icon to an audience of a more frivolous era of dressing -- steeped in vanity and femininity.''         And Mr. de la Renta called it ''the end of a whole era'' and Mrs. Phillips ''the last of the great ladies of retailing with a true grasp of the luxury business and a tremendous sense of quality.''         A small, meticulously groomed woman with carefully coiffed hair who wore signature David Webb jewelry, Mrs. Phillips did not hesitate to pop into fitting rooms as her customers tried on clothes. More often than not, she did not ask what they wanted but told them what they should have. More often than not, they listened. Although the salon had a workroom  for alterations, Mrs. Phillips also did not hesitate, on occasion, to get on her knees to pin a hem.         There was never a time when she was not fascinated by fashion, Mrs. Phillips said in a 1983 interview on the 50th anniversary of her business. Born Martha Rollins in Brooklyn, where her father had a shop called the Star that specialized in hand-tailored clothes and riding clothes, she asked to help in the business one day when she was 8. Her father got a crate, placed it behind the counter and she stood there after school, selling lace blouses.         ''People were so amused, they would buy,'' she recalled.         At 18, she married Phillip R. Phillips, a manufacturer of ready-to-wear clothing and in the early 1930's she opened a shop on the 12th floor of a Madison Avenue building. Despite the Depression, she refused to buy anything for the shop that would sell for less than $100.         ''I did very well,'' she said. Her customers included Marjorie Merriweather Post, who brought in her jewels to make certain that both the color and the neckline of the dress were appropriate for showing them off properly. Other clients were Doris Duke, Brooke Astor, Gloria Vanderbilt and Diana Ross.         Mrs. Phillips remained there for 20 years, leaving only when the building was torn down. She then leased space in what was the Savoy Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue. After that building was sold to the General Motors Corporation, she balked at a shop she was offered downstairs in the plaza of the new building to be built on the site, saying, ''Martha's customers never shop in cellars.''         Shortly after, she and her daughter, who joined her several years earlier, found a location at Park Avenue and 58th Street where in plush  surroundings she coddled her customers with tea and cookies while models paraded the clothes or saleswomen carried them out.         Mr. Phillips died in 1981. Besides  her daughter, who lives in Palm Beach, Mrs. Phillips is survived by a son, Herbert R. Phillips, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a brother, Milton Rollins of Brooklyn, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         In an interview when she was in her mid-80's, Mrs. Phillips, who was chairwoman of her company -- her daughter was president -- said she had no intention of ever retiring.         ''I like to think that what we're doing is being impresarios, finding talent,'' she said. ''I like the excitement.''       
         Julia Morton, a self-taught expert on the uses of medicinal and toxic plants and a ''Dear Abby'' for Floridians concerned about poisonous greenery, died on Tuesday at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. She was 84 and lived in Homestead, Fla.         Mrs. Morton had been critically injured in an automobile accident on Aug. 28, said officials at the University of Miami, where she was a professor for about four decades until retiring in 1993.         To her colleagues in the field of economic botany, the study of how people use plants, Mrs. Morton was an academic's academic, a founder and developer of the Morton Collectanea, an invaluable compilation of information about plants, and the author of 10 books on the subject.         But to the people of South Florida -- backyard gardeners, telephone line workers and ranchers, for example -- she offered practical advice, practically every day, on plants that can harm humans or animals. Through letters and phone calls, lectures and even posters that she designed for hospital emergency rooms, she worked to educate the public.         ''She was the poison plant center'' in South Florida, said Lawrence Kaplan, an emeritus professor of botany at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and editor of the journal of the Society of Economic Botany, which Mrs. Morton helped found. Anyone who suspected contact with plants that might be dangerous could, and did, contact her.         Her plant expertise extended far beyond the toxic variety. Several of her books are considered standard references in the field, including ''The Atlas of Medicinal Plants of Middle America'' (C.C. Thomas, 1981). She also had extensive knowledge of tropical fruits, which she also shared with anyone who asked.         ''She used to get mail by the pound from people all over the world,'' said Dr. Robert Kelley, associate chairman of the department of mathematics and computer science at the University of Miami, who knew Mrs. Morton for more than 20 years.         The letters would inquire about a particular plant, and Mrs. Morton would respond after doing the necessary research in her vast collection of reports, books and newspaper clippings or, often, just pulling the information out of her memory.         Mrs. Morton, who was reared in Vermont, never got a college degree. She started the Morton Collectanea with her husband, Kendal, in 1933 from an office near the New York Public Library.         The couple lived in the Bahamas during World War II, and their studies of the plant life there resulted in their first book, ''50 Tropical Fruits of Nassau'' (1949). The work attracted the attention of the president of the University of Miami, Bowman Foster Ashe, who offered them jobs as professors. Mr. Morton, a trained scientist, died in 1964.         Dr. John Beutler, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., said that unlike many botanists who only dabble in the study of how plants are used, Mrs. Morton devoted all of her time to the field.         Dr. Beutler said he first encountered Mrs. Morton about two decades ago, when she sent him a plant that she thought might have some applications to cancer treatment. ''She was always on the lookout for obscure plants that might serve a useful purpose,'' he said.         Mrs. Morton is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Evelyne V. Johnson, widow of Gen. Robert Wood Johnson, the philanthropist and chairman of Johnson & Johnson, died on Tuesday at Longleat, her estate in Princeton, N.J.         Mrs. Johnson's family would not give her age, but a family friend said she had been in her 90's.         General Johnson, a brigadier general during World War II, was chairman of Johnson & Johnson, the international health care company, from 1932 to 1963. He was also the founder of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a health care philanthropy in Princeton. After his death in 1968, his estate added $1.2 billion to the foundation's endowment, which now has assets of $5 billion. Mrs. Johnson's own philanthropies, which were extensive, benefited Appalachian children, American Indian tribes and a number of Catholic churches, among others.         She was born in Cambridge, Mass., and educated at schools in Boston and Providence, R.I. In her youth, she also took up classical ballroom dancing and appeared for a time professionally in nightclubs and cabarets.         She was married to General Johnson in 1943.         Mrs. Johnson is survived by a sister, Adele P. Comjean of Concord, Mass.       
         Elizabeth Bottomley Noyce, a microchip millionaire's scorned first wife who showed as much imagination and verve in deploying her half of his Silicon Valley fortune as he had in making it, died on Tuesday at her seaside home in Bremen, Me. She was 65 and had been the state's premier philanthropist and most innovative investor for two decades.         Her lawyer, Owen Wells, noting that Mrs. Noyce had long suffered from emphysema, said the cause was a heart attack.         The daughter of a blue-collar worker from Auburn, Mass., who had to hold two jobs to support his family in the Depression, Mrs. Noyce was majoring in English at Tufts University in the early 1950's and dreaming of becoming a writer when she signed on as costume director of a summer theatrical production and caught the eye of one of the cast members, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Robert N. Noyce.         The couple were married in 1953, and Mrs. Noyce, who had dreamed of writing novels and short stories, became the most dutiful of corporate wives, bearing four children and following her husband from job to job, including a somewhat reluctant move to California for a woman who never felt comfortable away from her beloved New England.         ''We were under the distinct impression that we would try it for a year and if I didn't like it we wouldn't stay,'' she recalled years later, suggesting that her husband had forgotten the bargain: ''We stayed 19 years.''         By then the life of the blue-collar worker's daughter had changed considerably, largely because her husband had become a co-inventor of the microchip, which laid the foundation for the vast personal computer industry, and had helped found three of the industry's premier companies, including the giant Intel Corporation.         Her life changed even more in 1975 when Mr. Noyce left her to marry an Intel executive. Although bitter over the circumstances of the breakup of her marriage, Mrs. Noyce, whose husband died in 1990, managed to console herself somewhat in the divorce. Under California's community property laws she claimed half his Intel stock and all his other assets, including full title to their 50-acre Maine estate, where Mrs. Noyce had been spending summers.         How much she received from the divorce could not be determined yesterday, and a spokesman for Intel, which has a market capitalization of $86 billion, could not say how much stock she owned at the time of her death. Mr. Wells, her lawyer, said, however, that after all her charitable donations, her estate was worth $100 million to $1 billion.         Putting her husband and California behind her, Mrs. Noyce did not so much move to Maine as adopt the state.         In a whirlwind of philanthropy that began almost as soon as she settled into her house on Muscongus Bay and continued the rest of her life, she systematically gave away some $75 million, primarily to Maine charities.         Oh, there would be the occasional out-of-state donation -- a million to Tufts here, a half-million to Harvard there -- but for the most part Mrs. Noyce, whose donations covered the gamut of public causes including education, medicine, the arts and the environment, concentrated her giving in Maine, responding to virtually any cause, charity or public institution in the state that needed money.         Among other things, she built a golf course for the town of Bremen, gave lavishly to the Portland Museum of Art, the Maine Maritime Museum and the University of Maine. When the Cumberland County Civic Center was so pressed for cash that it was looking for a corporate sponsor that would give it money in exchange for the right to give the center its name, Mrs. Noyce came through with a $1.3 million donation that allowed the center to retain its identity.         But for all the acclaim Mrs. Noyce received for her direct philanthropy, including the $15 million in endowments for charitable trusts that make independent grants to Maine charities, Mrs. Noyce gained even more applause when she began pioneering what she called ''catalytic philanthropy,'' investments designed to bolster the state's economy.         In 1991, for example, when out-of-state financial institutions were picking off Maine's banks one by one and it appeared that Maine businesses and other borrowers would soon be at the mercy of distant lenders, Mrs. Noyce blithely created a brand new bank, the Maine Bank and Trust Company with an initial $7.7 million investment that eventually grew to some $14 million.         What made such ''philanthropy,'' especially appealing became apparent when the bank prospered. Mr. Wells, who advised Mrs. Noyce on her investments, estimated yesterday that the bank was now worth at least twice what she paid for it.         During a lull in Maine's construction industry, Mrs. Noyce built five homes to provide jobs for construction workers, and when Maine's leading bakery was threatened with a takeover by a company that intended to move it out of state, Mrs. Noyce came to the rescue, buying the bakery and saving its 1,200 jobs.         Recently Mrs. Noyce had turned her attention to Portland's deteriorating downtown, going on a buying spree in which she acquired about 10 percent of the city's office and retail space. The rehabilitation effort attracted L. L. Bean and other tenants.         Although her efforts won wide praise, there were some rumblings that Mrs. Noyce was becoming too big a factor in the Portland economy and she had recently announced that she had no further designs on downtown property.         For all her wealth, Mrs. Noyce lived fairly simply, shunning the usual trappings of wealth and even driving her own car, most recently a Cadillac, to be sure, but only, she told her friends, because after a wreck in her smaller Oldsmobile, she felt more secure in a larger car.         Although she was always appropriately dressed, Mrs. Noyce had no interest in fashion and even less in travel, preferring to stay in Maine rather than visit the world's resorts.         Not that she was above the occasional indulgence. When she found that the steep driveway to her house became dangerously slick with wintertime ice, she built a more accessible winter home a thousand feet away.         Her only real material weakness stemmed from her love of the water, but it was a tribute to her reputation for innovative ''catalytic philanthropy,'' that when she indulged her passion by commissioning a multimillion-dollar 60-foot yacht a few years ago, the acquisition was not viewed in Maine as an example of conspicuous consumption. Instead the purchase was trumpeted in the Maine press as a rescue of Maine's boat-building industry.         In recent months Mrs. Noyce had apparently developed renewed concern about the state's beleaguered boat builders. She had commissioned a 90-foot yacht.         Mrs. Noyce is survived by a son, William, of Hollis, N.H.; three daughters, Pendred of Weston, Mass.; Priscilla, of Kenya and Margaret, of Montana; two brothers, Frank Bottomley of Ohio and Bruce, of New Hampshire; a sister, Frances Broomhead of Rhode Island, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Annabella, a film star with flashing eyes who became the toast of France in the 1930's, died on Wednesday at her home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris. She was 86.         The cause was a heart attack, said a friend, Jose Sourillan, according to The Associated Press.         Annabella, whose real name was Suzanne Georgette Charpentier, was the daughter of a French publisher. She rose to celebrity when she starred in two films directed by Rene Clair: ''Le Million'' (1931), about hunting for a lost lottery ticket, and ''Quatorze Juillet,'' or ''July 14th'' (1933), about the adventures of a flower girl and a cab driver. They are still widely regarded as her finest work.         Her skill at playing the gamine became known in the United States, where The New York American commented in 1937: ''Among screen types she is like a fresh breeze among too many orchidaceous blooms. Her eyes are frank, her forehead high and her mouth childishly quizzical.''         She moved on to Hollywood and starred in a down-to-earth role opposite Tyrone Power when he played the canal builder in ''Suez'' (1938). Later that year, when her plans to divorce the French actor Jean Murat drew wide attention, she was quoted in The New York Mirror as saying: ''It is not always good to be a film star in America. It is like being a goldfish in a bowl. They must know what I eat, what I think, they even want to know whom I love -- and that I tell no one.''         In 1939 she married Power. She appeared in four other American films and in 1942 became an American citizen. But Annabella achieved only minor success in her adopted country. She returned to France for good after a divorce in 1948 from Power, who went on to marry the actress Linda Christian.         Back in Europe, Annabella failed to regain her earlier acclaim. Her last film was ''Le Plus Bel Amour de Don Juan'' (1952).         In her teens she started out as a dancer. She made her first screen appearance, at 16, under the name Annabella, in a minor role in the epic-length silent film ''Napoleon'' (1926), with Abel Gance as director and screenwriter. Other minor film parts followed, until she was chosen by Clair, regarded by the film world as an original stylist, for her roles in ''Le Million'' and ''Quatorze Juillet.''         In 1936 she moved on to Britain, where she starred in three movies made there in 1937: ''Wings of the Morning,'' which was in color, ''Under the Red Robe'' and ''Dinner at the Ritz.''         Then Hollywood beckoned, and she appeared in ''The Baroness and the Butler'' (1938) before taking the role in ''Suez.'' That year she also found time to star in ''Hotel du Nord,'' directed by Marcel Carne, a classic with a fond view of working-class Parisians.         In 1940 Annabella and Power performed together in the Screen Guild radio production of ''Seventh Heaven,'' and the next year they were onstage together in a summer stock revival of Ferenc Molnar's hit ''Liliom.''         Over the years she took other roles in theatrical productions in New York, London and elsewhere.  The New York Times theater critic Brooks Atkinson praised her acting in a 1946 production of Jean-Paul Sartre's play ''No Exit'' as ''a bold and calculated performance that packs one corner of hell with horror.''         She is survived by a daughter, Anne Werner Power of Boston.       
         The train carrying Japan's most famous young couple chugs into the station and out comes Princess Masako, all charm and elegance in a pale-green suit, waving to her picture-snapping fans and walking briskly, two steps behind the Crown Prince.         That is almost the only kind of public appearance that Princess Masako makes these days -- a quick swish from a train to a car, en route to a hospital or charity -- for she has virtually disappeared since her marriage three years ago.         After a wedding that captivated this country, a union filled with the promise of imperial renaissance, these days there is only silence.         Before she married, Masako Owada was the symbol of the new Japanese career woman, an attractive Harvard-educated diplomat in the Foreign Ministry, moving with professional ease in five foreign languages.         When she became the Crown Princess, she was the second commoner ever to marry into the imperial family. Many in this nation brimmed with the hope that she could help  update the Chrysanthemum throne, ushering into the modern age a dynasty that is the world's oldest and is shrouded in pageantry and tradition.         Now Masako-san, as the Crown Princess is often called, has not only virtually vanished from sight, but is also measured by a standard that is thousands of years old: her ability to bear a son.         For the couple, producing an heir is a big responsibility. The Emperor, Akihito, is said to be the 125th direct descendant in an imperial dynasty that reaches back 26 centuries -- although these claims reflect the triumph of faith over scholarship.         But without a son in sight, people are openly discussing the succession. After Akihito, the throne goes to the Crown Prince, Naruhito, but if he dies without leaving a son, it will go to his younger brother, Prince Akishino. Akishino, however, has only two daughters now; after him, there is no male descendant.         So Japanese imperial-watchers are debating the possibility of seeing Chrysanthemum throne go to a daughter. After all, the dynasty was spawned by a Japanese sun goddess, Amaterasu, and 8 of Japan's 125 emperors have been women.         The last female emperor -- the title of empress is reserved for the emperor's wife -- reigned for seven years until 1770. Then a century ago, the imperial code was changed to forbid a woman from ascending the throne. Parliament would have to pass a new law before a woman could become emperor, but if that happened, then there would be potential long-term heirs. At least for now, for example, the throne could go to one of Prince Akishino's daughters, Mako and Kako.         Though the Crown Princess is only 32, there is an old Japanese saying, ''Marry for three years, and bear no child, then it's time to leave!'' But in a country where divorce is still uncommon, any kind of parting in the imperial family is unthinkable.         If there is any overwhelming feeling these days that ordinary Japanese have for the Crown Princess, it is sympathy. They tend to identify more with her as a commoner than with the Prince, and do not often discuss publicly the Prince's role in producing an heir.         ''She married into a position where her responsibility is to give birth to a boy, and I feel for her,'' said Naomi Yamaha, 33, a computer engineer. ''Even as commoners, there is a lot of pressure on you to have a boy if you marry the oldest son.''         And the pressure is a thousand times more intense for the Crown Princess, living in a gilded imperial cage where her every move is watched and evaluated.         ''Indeed, being the wife in the imperial family has got to be the No. 1  source of stress,'' said Rihachi Iizuka, a prominent fertility specialist at Keio University. ''That's why caged animals like monkeys and pandas in zoos don't have as many babies as the ones out in the wild.''         Princess Masako's royal zoo keepers are the 1,100 administrators and servants who form the Imperial Household Agency, a bastion of conservatism and protector of tradition and ritual. It has not only cloistered  Princess Masako and the Crown Prince, but many say it has created a greater distance between the imperial family and the ordinary Japanese people.         ''The Japanese imperial family is not in step with the times, with the perception of the new generation of citizens,'' said Toshiaki Kawahara, who has written many books on the imperial household. ''Unless they mix with the ordinary people, the imperial family will be forgotten.''         Another of the imperial tasks is to build links with other countries, the kind of diplomacy for which the Crown Princess spent her life training. But the couple's last trip abroad was to the Middle East in January 1995.         Some people say that the cloak of silence the Imperial Household Agency has now wrapped around her may be an effort to play down her presence until the royal couple produce an heir. Others say it is the agency's method of easing stress.         ''The agency wants to preserve a mood of tranquillity for the couple,'' said Minoru Hamao, a former chamberlain to the Emperor and a private tutor of the Crown Prince. ''If she comes out in public, she'd be surrounded by the press, by photographers, and it would make her nervous.''         Masako's mother-in-law, the Empress Michiko, the first commoner to be brought into the imperial fold, suddenly collapsed nearly three years ago in an incident that left her unable to speak for several months. It is still not clear what caused it, but many people blame Japan's gossipy magazines for triggering the Empress' breakdown with unflattering accounts of her.         Many ordinary Japanese blame the Imperial Household Agency for transforming the Crown Princess from a sophisticated, highly educated traveler into a dainty flower who studies poetry and ancient rituals.         ''Some women were happy having Masako-san enter the family, hoping the imperial system itself might change, but I said it would not be like that,'' said Mikiyo Kano, a professor who focuses on women in history. ''She's totally ignored. Unlike an empress, Masako-san is a yome, the wife of a son, and according to Confucian patriarchy, a yome doesn't hold any role, not even a place in the family.''         It is hard to imagine a more backward step for one of Japan's most talented career women. And indeed for the moment at least, she seems to be receding from the wider public's interest.         ''I look up to the female Japanese astronaut and the women athletes at the Olympics,'' said Yoko Nishimura, 49, a furniture store owner. ''I don't look up to Masako-san.''         The new Masako-san does have die-hard fans, like Harumi Tadakawa, a 30-year-old housewife who has spent $60,000 following the Crown Princess around the country. At the train station, Mrs. Tadakawa was snapping pictures to add to her collection of nearly 5,000 photographs of the imperial family.         But other Japanese prefer to follow the exploits of crowned heads elsewhere.         ''I care more about the British royal family, and I'm interested more in Queen Elizabeth and Princess Diana than in Masako-san,'' said Daisuke Sakaguchi, a 25-year-old clothing salesman. ''Whenever the imperial family gets sensational news coverage because of some ceremony, like Masako-san's wedding, for example, sure, I feel happy and want to congratulate them. But that's about it. The imperial family here is just too boring.''       
         Vera Brodsky Lawrence, a pianist, editor and historian of American music whose research helped bring the works of Scott Joplin and Louis Moreau Gottschalk to the attention of contemporary performers, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         Mrs. Lawrence was best known for ''The Collected Works of Scott Joplin,'' which restored to print much of that composer's long unavailable music. The edition, published in 1971, was a catalyst in the ragtime revival of the mid-1970's. She was an artistic consultant to the Houston Grand Opera in 1975 when it staged Joplin's opera, ''Treemonisha,'' and to Deutsche Grammophon when it recorded the production the same year.         Mrs. Lawrence also published ''The Piano Music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk'' (1969), the first collected edition of an American composer's works, and ''The Wa-Wan Press, 1901-1911,'' a five-volume reprint of Arthur Farwell's pioneering American music series. Her ''Music for Patriots, Politicians and Presidents'' (1975) explored the relationship between politics and music during the 18th and 19th centuries.         Her most recent project was ''Strong on Music,'' a series that explored the musical world of 19th-century New York through the eyes of the lawyer and diarist George Templeton Strong. The first volume, ''Resonances,'' was published in 1991. A second, ''Reverberations,'' followed in 1995. Mrs. Lawrence left a third volume nearly completed.         Music history was actually Mrs. Lawrence's second career; she did not begin to devote herself fully to it until 1965, when she gave up a 40-year career as a concert pianist. She was born in Norfolk, Va., in 1909, and attended the Juilliard School, where she was a student of Josef and Rosina Lhevinne, Rubin Goldmark and Bernard Wagenaar.         Mrs. Lawrence made her debut in 1925, and performed regularly in new music concerts and with chamber groups. She was a staff pianist at CBS radio from 1939 to 1946. In 1944, she married Theodore Lawrence, an engineer for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He died in 1964.         During her years as a performer, Mrs. Lawrence taught at the Juilliard School and the Curtis Institute of Music. In 1967, she became the administrator of the publications program of the Contemporary Music Project, which sent 73 composers to 77 secondary school systems around the country.         In 1969, Mrs. Lawrence compiled and edited a library of 500 works composed as part of the project.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Dorothy Lamour, whose sarong-draped charms adorned many films of the late 1930's and 40's, especially the ''road'' pictures she made with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, died yesterday at her home in North Hollywood, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Lamour, a comely brunette who was also a favorite pinup of thousands of G.I.'s during World War II, was in her heyday at a time when the major studios believed that certain actresses needed something of a signature. Veronica Lake peered out from behind the lock of hair that invariably hid part of her face; Miss Lamour had her trademark sarong.  She wore that clinging garment in a series of films, from the 1936 ''Jungle Princess'' through such 1940's comedies as ''Road to Singapore'' and ''Road to Morocco.''         Miss Lamour appeared in seven of the road pictures, in which she was always the exotic but demure girl invariably won by a crooning Mr. Crosby at the expense of a more comedic Mr. Hope. On occasion, Miss Lamour would join Mr. Crosby in a ballad, such as ''Moonlight Becomes You'' or ''Constantly.'' By the late 1940's, her salary rose to a top of around $450,000 a movie.         But she had no illusions about either her acting or singing ability. Asked by an interviewer if she had ever studied acting or singing, she replied, ''No, can't you tell?''         During World War II, Miss Lamour was also known as ''the bond bombshell'' because of the volunteer work she did selling United States War Bonds. In tours around the country, she was credited with selling some $300 million of the bonds. So  effective was she as a saleswoman that the Government put a private railroad car at her disposal when she decided to go on a bond tour.         She received a belated citation for her bond work from the Treasury in 1965, at which time William H. Neal, at that time the director of the United States Savings Bond Division, credited her with being the first star to offer her services to sell war bonds and the originator of the successful Government plan for payroll deductions for those who wanted part of their salaries set aside for war bond purchases.         Her contributions to the war effort did not stop there. She was frequently seen at the Hollywood Canteen, the nightclub for servicemen founded by Bette Davis and John Garfield, where she spent many hours talking to and dancing with G.I.'s.         Miss Lamour was born on Dec. 10, 1914, in New Orleans as Mary Leta Dorothy Slaton, the daughter of John Watson Slaton and the former Carmen Louise La Porte. Her father was a waiter. Her mother, who soon divorced her father, worked as a waitress.         Young Dorothy never finished high school. The family finances were so desperate that when she was 15, she forged her mother's name to a document that authorized her to drop out of school.         Later, however, she did go to a secretarial school that did not require her to have a high school diploma. She regarded herself as an excellent typist and usually typed her own letters, even after she became quite wealthy.         After she won the 1931 Miss New Orleans beauty contest, she and her mother moved to Chicago, where  Miss Lamour earned $17 a week as an elevator operator for the Marshall Field department store on State Street. She had no training as a singer but was persuaded by a friend to try out for a female vocalist's spot with Herbie Kay, a band leader who  had a national radio show called ''The Yeast Foamers,'' apparently because it was sponsored by Fleischmann's Yeast.         She left Mr. Kay's group and moved to Manhattan, where Rudy Vallee, then a popular singer, helped her get a singing job at a popular night club, El Morocco. She later worked at 1 Fifth Avenue, a cabaret where she met Louis B. Mayer, the Hollywood studio chief. It was Mayer who eventually arranged for her to have a screen test, which led to her Paramount contract in 1935.         When she was at her zenith as a star, her fans suggested that an agent had adopted her last name from the French word for ''love'' as a box-office ploy. In fact, the name was close to one in the family; Miss Lamour adapted it herself from Lambour, which was the last name of her stepfather, Clarence, to whom her mother was briefly married.         Miss Lamour's more than 50 films included ''Typhoon'' (1939), ''Johnny Apollo'' (1940), ''The Fleet's In'' (1941), ''Star-Spangled Rhythm'' (1942), ''Duffy's Tavern'' (1945),  ''Here Comes the Groom'' (1951), ''Donovan's Reef'' (1962) and ''Pajama Party'' (1964).         The seven movies in which she appeared with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope were ''Road to Singapore (1940), ''Road to Zanzibar'' (1941), ''Road to Morocco'' (1942), ''Road to Utopia'' (1946), ''Road to Rio'' (1948) ''Road to Bali'' (1953) and ''Road to Hong Kong'' (1962). Although Miss Lamour worked closely with Mr. Hope and Crosby for many years, she said that she was not close to them personally.         Miss Lamour's first marriage, to Herbie Kay, ended in divorce. She met her second husband, William  Ross Howard 3d, in 1943 while she was on a bond tour. Mr. Howard, who had interests in the frozen food and advertising businesses, died in 1978.         After she retired from the movies, Miss Lamour remained active. In 1968, she starred in the national road show production of ''Hello, Dolly!'' And in 1969, she was named to the Civic Center Commission of Baltimore, where she then lived. She was active in various causes there for many years. In the 1980's, she worked the cabaret circuit, where she sang many of the songs she had sung in her movies.         In the 1987 film ''Creepshow 2,'' she played a sloppily dressed housewife who gets murdered. ''Well, at my age you can't lean against a palm tree and sing 'Moon of Monakoora,''' she said. ''People would look at that and say, 'What is she trying to do?' ''         While ''Creepshow 2'' was her only film role in two decades, she was frequently seen on television, doing guest shots such shows as ''The Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and, naturally, a few Bob Hope specials.         She is survived by her two sons, John Ridgley Howard and Tom Howard; a stepson, William Ross Howard 4th; a grandson, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  September 24, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Dorothy Lamour yesterday reversed parts of the name of her second husband in some copies. He was William Ross Howard 3d, not William Howard Ross 3d.

         Sabina Zlatin, who rescued dozens of Jewish children from the Nazis during World War II, died on Saturday in a Paris hospital. She was 89.         The Children's Home of Izieu, which she founded, helped more than 100 children elude capture by the occupying Germans before it became one of the more enduring and horrific symbols of Nazi barbarism.         One spring morning in 1944, the Gestapo raided the home and plucked 44 Jewish children from their breakfast and trucked them to their eventual deaths in concentration camps.         When Klaus Barbie, the wartime head of the German police in Lyons who ordered the raid on the home, went on trial in 1987, Mrs. Zlatin was among those who testified against him.         ''Her death makes even more necessary our duty to remember,'' said Lionel Jospin, the French Socialist Party leader.         Sabina Schwast was born to a Jewish family in Warsaw. She married a French agronomist named Miron Zlatin, settling with him on a farm in northern France and becoming a French citizen.         When war broke out in 1939, the Zlatins left their farm and she became a nurse at a military hospital in Montpellier. The job was short-lived. Once it was discovered that she was Jewish, the collaborationist government dismissed her. Soon after, she was drawn to the work of the Children's Rescue Charity, which assisted children endangered by the war.         In 1943, putting herself and her husband at grave risk, she decided to open a home to help these children. She chose as a refuge a farmhouse in Izieu, a quiet, tiny hilltop hamlet with a sweeping view of the Rhone River Valley and the snowy peaks of the Alps.         In that idyllic setting, she gave Jewish children of all ages sanctuary while she arranged to shuttle them out of France to safety in Switzerland. She managed to smuggle some 100 children from the Izieu home over the Swiss border and beyond the grasp of the Gestapo before the day the trucks came.         It was a neighboring farmer of German descent who betrayed the safe house. He had hired a teen-age boy from the children's home, somehow found out that the children were Jewish, then apparently passed the information to German troops garrisoned in a nearby town.         On April 6, 1944, as the children were having breakfast, German trucks rolled up in front of the farmhouse. Mrs. Zlatin was away at the time, arranging for another batch of children to be smuggled to Switzerland. But 7 teachers and 44 children between the ages of 4 and 17 were arrested. Only an assistant to Mrs. Zlatin escaped, managing to squeeze through an upstairs window and hide in the garden.         The rest, including Mrs. Zlatin's husband, were herded into the trucks. Witnesses told of the children being kicked and hurled into the trucks like sacks of potatoes.         Mr. Barbie commanded his officers to transport the captives to deportation centers. As they rode along, jounced about in the back of the trucks, the 44 children sang a song declaring their defiance. They had learned it from their history lessons: ''Vous n'aurez pas l'Alsace et la Lorraine'' (You will not have Alsace and Lorraine).         Mrs. Zlatin learned of the roundup via a telegram that said: ''Family ill. Contagious disease.'' Those were the code words that meant the worst: the Nazis had arrived at Izieu.         At once, Mrs. Zlatin hurried to Vichy to beg for the lives of the children before the collaborationist French government. She was spurned. ''Why do you bother about those dirty Jews?'' a senior French official asked her.         Five of the adults and 42 of the children died in gas chambers at Auschwitz. Mr. Zlatin and the two remaining children were executed by firing squad in Estonia. A single adult, a 25-year-old teacher, managed to survive.         When Mr. Barbie went on trial for crimes against humanity in May 1987, Mrs. Zlatin, then 80, went to testify against his brutalities. The assistant who had escaped from the farmhouse the day of the Izieu raid testified that as he hid outside, he saw Mr. Barbie among the Germans.         Mr. Barbie was convicted and later died in a French prison.       
         Ludmilla Chiriaeff, the founder of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens of Montreal and a major force in Canadian dance, died on Sunday at a hospital in Montreal. She was 72.         She died of complications from a lung illness, said Catherine Luft Mead, a daughter.         Mme. Chiriaeff developed a major company in a city that knew little about ballet before her arrival there in 1952. Her earliest efforts perplexed straitlaced audiences, and a clergyman once chastised her for showing her legs in public. Mme. Chiriaeff persevered, and, in addition to building a company, she became a pioneer of dance on Canadian television and a leader of Canadian dance education.         Born in Riga, Latvia, of a Russian father and a Polish mother, Mme. Chiriaeff grew up in Berlin, where she received her first ballet lessons. She appeared with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, 1936-37, but was considered too young to remain on the company's arduous tours. She danced with the Berlin State Opera Ballet during World War II until Nazi doctors measuring her body decided that she must be Jewish (she was not) and sent her to a labor camp.         After the war she danced with companies in Switzerland, then moved to Montreal with the aid of the International Rescue Committee. Les Ballets Chiriaeff, which she founded in 1952, originally functioned as an ensemble for television, dancing on so many shows that its dancers were nicknamed ''Chiriaeff's grasshoppers,'' perpetually hopping about on the screen.         The group made its stage debut in 1955 and aroused such enthusiasm that Mme. Chiriaeff decided to transform it into a company for Canadian theaters. Renamed Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1958, it acquired an eclectic repertory and toured widely. In 1969, when he troupe danced Fernand Nault's ''Symphony of Psalms'' in a Montreal church, many local theatergoers decided that the city no longer found ballet to be morally suspect.         The following year, Mr. Nault, a French-Canadian choreographer, made Les Grands Ballets Canadiens internationally famous with his staging of ''Tommy,'' the rock-opera by the Who.         Mme. Chiriaeff founded l'Academie des Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1958 and l'Ecole Superieure de Danse in 1966, and relinquished the artistic direction of her company in 1974 to devote herself full-time to educational activities. Her many projects ranged from courses for students desiring professional careers to introductory ballet lessons for sixth graders.         Among the honors received by Mme. Chiriaeff are the Governor General's Medal of the Order of Canada, the Governor General's Award for the Performing Arts, the Denise Pelletier Award for the Performing Arts and honorary doctorates from McGill University, the University of Montreal and the University of Quebec. She was named a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1984 and an Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 1985. The City of Montreal proclaimed her a ''Grande Montrealaise (Great Montrealer)'' in 1978, and the headquarters of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens is called La Maison de la Danse Ludmilla Chiriaeff in her honor.         Mme. Chiriaeff was married twice; both marriages ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Mead, of New York City, she is survived by two other daughters, Anastasia Chiriaeff of Montreal, and Ludmilla Luft Ivanovic of Boston; two sons, Avde Chiriaeff and Gleb Chiriaeff, both of Montreal, and four granddaughters.       
         Guillermina Rico, a lemon peddler who bargained her way to wealth and power as the head of a political machine she forged from the ranks of Mexico City's itinerant vendors, died on Wednesday of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 63.         In the market stalls and side streets she was known as La Jefa, the boss, and at her death her office walls were adorned with photos of the curly-haired matriarch, often wearing a trademark white apron, with senators, mayors, police chiefs and every Mexican president since Jose Lopez Portillo took office in 1976.         Today 2,000 people marched three miles from the city center to a weed-choked cemetery in a working class suburb, bearing Mrs. Rico's coffin to a plot wafting with the scent of lily and lavender and heaped with scores of wreaths. The trumpets of a mariachi sounded a dirge.         ''I feel like an orphan,'' said Pablo Ibarra, a 45-year-old vendor who accompanied her coffin. ''She helped me, and many others, to earn an honest living on the streets.''         In a 40-year career, Mrs. Rico led thousands of market peddlers through cycles of street war and peace with successive Mexico City mayors, who have repeatedly sought to clear the streets of the informal merchants who block sidewalks in front of tax-paying businesses. Sometimes the vendors have been removed to suburban markets, but always they have returned.         The vendors, whose ranks swelled during years of economic crisis as farmers lost their land and factory workers were dismissed, hawk everything from tortillas to tires to pirated American music tapes. Today Mexico City's central market is among the largest outlets in the world for contraband.         Mrs. Rico was born in 1934 in the downtown neighborhood of La Merced into a clan of street sellers. Both parents migrated to Mexico City during the Depression from outlying states. Guillermina's three brothers, Manuel, Fernando and Candido, also devoted their lives to street commerce, Roberto Hidalgo Lopez, one of Mrs. Rico's advisers said in a cemetery speech today.         Both of Mrs. Rico's parents died when she was a teen-ager, and Mrs. Rico was forced to give up school after fourth grade, Mr. Hidalgo said.         She began working the street at age 15, peddling lemons and avocados, and three years later, married another vendor: Salvador Sanchez Velazquez. They had four children.         In 1946, Mrs. Rico joined the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, and eventually she organized the vendors into a powerful bloc that cast thousands of ballots for the governing party.         During the early years, Mrs. Rico's leadership was informal, but in 1965 she organized 500 merchants into the Civic Union of Street Vendors of Old Merced. Twenty years later, the union's ranks had swelled to 3,000, and by 1985 it stood at 7,000.         Mrs. Rico gained the power to assign the choicest market stalls, for which she charged a quota, and those and other revenues made her wealthy. The Chamber of Commerce estimate in 1988 that Mrs. Rico and other union leaders collected about $1 million annually.         She funneled vast sums into the pockets of city authorities, partly to forestall their periodic threats to remove the vendors. Some of her riches she channeled into social work, and she once responded to a reporter's question about what she had done for Mexico: ''Ask the priests in the downtown churches who is the one that helps them. Go to the shelters. Ask the drug addicts and the alcoholics undergoing rehabilitation.''         She is survived by her brother Candido, her four children, Silvia, Margarita, Isabel, and Salvador, all of whom live in Mexico City, and 16 grandchildren, Mr. Hidalgo said.       
         Ljuba Welitsch, the flame-haired Bulgarian-born soprano whose career was highlighted by her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in ''Salome'' in 1949, died on Monday in a hospital in Vienna. Miss Welitsch, who had become an Austrian citizen, was 83.         The cause of death was a series of strokes, said Herta Wiedenhuber, the executor of her estate.         Miss Welitsch's performance in the title role of the Richard Strauss opera on Feb. 4, 1949, was regarded as one of the most memorable in Metropolitan Opera history. The packed house had turned out mainly to hear Fritz Reiner make his Met debut as a conductor, but by the time the performance ended, with at least 15 minutes of cheering and whistling from an ecstatic audience, Miss Welitsch had become an international star.         ''Miss Welitsch is a musician and interpreter of flaming temperament, who has the part absolutely in her hand,'' Olin Downes wrote in his review in The New York Times the next day. ''She is an actress of individuality and power.''         A few days later, Miss Welitsch dazzled the critics again, displaying her versatility in the title role of Verdi's ''Aida'' and prompting Howard Taubman of The Times to call her ''one of the few perfect singers to come to the Met in recent years.''         But Miss Welitsch's extensive repertory and her determination to make up for the years on the international stage that she had lost during World War II shortened her operatic career. She drove her voice mercilessly, and by the mid-1950's, critics seemed to agree that her best singing was behind her.         At the Met, she appeared in 63 performances between her debut and her final appearance, in the nonsinging role of the Duchesss of Krakenthorp in Donizetti's ''Fille du Regiment'' on Feb. 17, 1972.         Besides Salome and Aida, her Metropolitan Opera roles included Donna Anna in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' the title role in Puccini's ''Tosca,'' Rosalinde in Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus'' and Musetta in Puccini's ''Boheme.''         But most of Miss Welitsch's career was spent in Europe, where she was coached by the composer when she made her Vienna Opera debut in a special performance of ''Salome'' that celebrated Richard Strauss's 80th birthday in 1944.         Even when her career in grand opera faded, Miss Welitsch's love of performance kept her busy into the early 1980's in operetta, films, radio, television and on the stage.         She was born in Borissovo, on the Black Sea in Bulgaria, on July 10, 1913. As a child, she liked to sing and play the violin. By her teens she was taking singing lessons, and at 19 entered the Academy of Music in Vienna.         She began her professional career in 1936 with the Graz Opera Company, which played a 10-month season that enabled Miss Welitsch to build her repertory. From 1941 to 1943 she sang in Hamburg and from 1943 to 1946 in Munich. In 1943 she also joined the Vienna Opera, where she made her noteworthy debut in ''Salome'' the next year.         When she made her English debut with the company in 1947, she dazzled audiences at Covent Garden, and by 1948 she had sung Salome more than 50 times and appeared in more than 40 other roles. That summer, while abroad, Edward Johnson, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, heard Miss Welitsch and engaged her to sing in New York the following year.         In 1956, when she was 43, Miss Welitsch caused a stir in Vienna when she married Karl Schmalvogel, a 29-year-old traffic policeman who had assisted her after an accident a year earlier. They were divorced in 1969.         Miss Welitsch left no immediate survivors.       
         Frances Lear, a mercurial figure in the media world who spent some $25 million she received in a divorce settlement to start a magazine named after herself, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She died of breast cancer, said Dr. Jonathan LaPook, her son-in-law.         Ms. Lear was married for 28 years to Norman Lear, the highly successful television producer of series like ''All in the Family'' and ''Maude.'' Her divorce settlement from Mr. Lear, an amount variously estimated to be between $100 million and $112 million, was one of the largest ever recorded.         ''I was very much a part of his thinking,'' she often said, justifying the amount of the settlement. ''Norman could not have done his shows without me.''         It is generally considered -- and she herself claimed -- that she was the inspiration for Maude, the feisty and opinionated title character played by Bea Arthur.         Ms. Lear made a name for herself among feminists, working in political campaigns, including Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968; with the National Organization for Women on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was not ratified; as a partner in an executive search firm specializing in placing women, and as a writer, producing articles for a number of national publications. But she believed that she had faded into the background as her husband's career took off in the 1970's. After Mr. Lear acquired his own movie studio and founded his own civil liberties group, People for the American Way, she discussed her frustrations in an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times in 1981.         A woman in Hollywood is a nonperson, she wrote, ''unless she is under 21, powerful or a star.'' She noted, too, that an industry wife was looked through, never at. In a later interview, recalling her years as a Hollywood wife, she said she had felt constantly ignored and undervalued, had had little self-esteem and had often been depressed.         Ms. Lear, in her own words, ''always aspired to something out of the ordinary,'' and she moved to New York after her divorce in 1985. She quickly set out to change the nonperson identity she had felt in Hollywood by creating Lear's, a magazine aimed at women like herself -- ''the woman who wasn't born yesterday,'' as the magazine said on its cover.         Lear's began publication in 1988 and was a success. It began with a circulation base of 250,000 and grew to 350,000 in a year. But after two years, Ms. Lear abandoned her original concept and lowered the age of the theoretical Lear's woman to over 35. Abandoning the older-age niche put the magazine into competition with other women's magazines, and its advertising never recovered from the move.         Almost immediately after the magazine's debut, Ms. Lear developed a reputation for being unpredictable and hot-tempered. She held a series of intimate lunches in her apartment during which she sought, and then usually ignored, advice for her fledgling publication. She also frequently brought up more of her personal history than most of her guests were prepared for, revealing that she had a Dickensian childhood, that doctors had determined that she was manic-depressive and had prescribed lithium for her condition, that she was an alcoholic and that she had made several suicide attempts over the years.         There ensued a revolving door of editors and writers, many of whom complained of Ms. Lear's inexperience and capricious decisions. Numerous articles were accepted and not published, and layouts were changed at the last minute. In an article in The New York Times, a staff member recalled that when Ms. Lear had been told that she could not change a quotation, she had shouted, ''It is my magazine, and I will do what I want.''         A former associate once said of her, ''She spent her life in Hollywood, where you go on your gut and you are prized for being slightly nuts.'' Ms. Lear did not deny the validity of the remark. She had lived with that behavior for many years, she said, and ''very possibly some of it rubbed off.''         Although circulation was more than 500,000 in its final months, Lear's ceased publication in March 1994. It had lost an estimated $25 million to $30 million in its six years of operation.         Ms. Lear then formed Lear Television, investing $500,000 in a video production company. The videos, which she referred to as ''television books,'' were specifically for women and dealt with subjects like personal finances and relationships. She had also just completed a book, ''Frances Lear's Guide to Work and Family in the 21st Century,'' which does not yet have a publisher.         Ms. Lear was born on July 14, 1923, at the Vanderheusen Home for Wayward Girls in Hudson, N.Y., the child of an unwed mother and an unknown father. ''The odds were stacked high against me,'' she once said. She was given the name Evelyn, but she was renamed Frances when she was adopted after 14 months in an orphanage by Aline and Herbert Loeb of Larchmont, N.Y.         ''Aline was outwardly affectionate with me for my father's sake, but she did not like me,'' Ms. Lear wrote in ''The Second Seduction,'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1992) an autobiography that pulled no punches. The slim volume laid out in harrowing detail her personal history and most intimate experiences.         The memoir related her years of sexual abuse, beginning at age 12, by the man whom her adoptive mother married after Mr. Loeb committed suicide during the Depression. She told, too, of being sent to a psychiatrist, to whom she revealed her stepfather's abuse, and of the psychiatrist's betrayal in repeating her confidences to her mother and stepfather. Her stepfather, she wrote, ''met me at the door with a kitchen knife in his hand.'' Her mother ''turned and left the room, went into her bedroom, closed the door and protected her economic hide.'' On her mother's death, her stepfather was left 90 percent of the $100,000 remaining from Mr. Loeb's insurance, Ms. Lear said.         Ms. Lear attended the Mary A. Burnham School for Girls in Northampton, Mass. In the 1940's and early 50's, she held a number of jobs, primarily in advertising and retailing in New York. She was, she never hesitated to say, dismissed from most of them for behavior like listening in on the boss's telephone conversations and drinking through lunch.         For a brief period, she was the camera girl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York. The job ended when she asked Frank Costello, the camera-shy gangster, whether he would like to have his picture taken. Her boss grabbed her under her armpits, lifted her into the air, carried her into the street, set her down, kissed her goodbye and advised her to try another line of work.         Ms. Lear had two short-lived marriages before she met Mr. Lear. Her first marriage, to Arnold Weiss, a traffic manager at the Navy Yard in Charleston, S.C., lasted less than two years. Her second marriage, to Morton Kaufman (''or Kauffman or Kaufmann -- I cannot remember how to spell my second husband's name,'' she wrote in the autobiography), was dissolved within a year. She said that he had been unfaithful, leading to her first suicide attempt and three weeks in the psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital.         ''I tried to commit suicide three times seriously and three times with minimal interest in the outcome,'' she once said.         She was 33 and a buyer for better active sportswear at Lord & Taylor when she married Mr. Lear, who was then a television writer, and moved to California. She turned down a buyer's job with a Los Angeles store and concentrated on homemaking and rearing her two daughters.         One day, she recalled, she realized that ''we had become he.'' She began to think seriously of leaving her marriage. It took her 15 years, she said, ''to work up the courage.''         ''I believe the second half of one's life is meant to be better than the first half,'' she said in an interview last year. ''It is certainly true of me.''         Ms. Lear is survived by her two daughters, Maggie Beth Lear and Kate Breckir Lear (who is married to Dr. LaPook), both of Manhattan, and two grandsons.       
         Beryl Reid, the versatile British character actress who won a Tony Award in 1967 for her performance in ''The Killing of Sister George'' and was one of the most popular stars on the London stage and on British television, died on Sunday. She was 76.         She had developed pneumonia after undergoing a knee operation, her agent, Robert Luff, said. He would not say where she died.         Ms. Reid, who specialized in eccentric characters, had been a stand-up comic and variety entertainer for 30 years before making the transition to more serious acting. She performed in plays by Joe Orton, Edward Albee and Peter Nichols, as well as in classics for the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater.         She had her greatest success as June Buckridge in Frank Marcus's ''Killing of Sister George.'' June was a lusty, cigar-smoking soap opera actress whose role as a rural nurse named Sister George was being excised from a long-running radio serial. In the play, which was a hit both in London and New York, Ms. Reid and Eileen Atkins portrayed a lesbian couple in a disintegrating relationship.         Friends had warned Ms. Reid not to touch the play ''with a barge pole,'' thinking that the role would damage her image. Instead, it made her international reputation. She later starred in the Robert Aldrich film version, with Susannah York replacing Ms. Atkins. Sister George became her signature role, but it was one of several peaks in her career.         She played the seductive landlady in the film of Joe Orton's ''Entertaining Mr. Sloane'' and recreated that role in a 1975 revival of the play at the Royal Court Theater. Subsequently, she won more admirers in the United States and London through television, especially from her role opposite Alec Guinness in the dramatizations of John le Carre's ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' and ''Smiley's People.'' Ms. Reid was Connie Sachs, George Smiley's former research aide, who, despite her drinking, retained her exceptional memory.         Ms. Reid was born in Hereford, England. Leaving school at 16, she made her debut in 1936 as a music hall performer at the Floral Hall, Bridlington. Before and during World War II, she took part in variety shows and pantomimes. Her comic imagination was certified on the BBC radio series ''Educating Archie,'' in which she created and played two contrasting roles, a schoolgirl in love with a ventriloquist's dummy and an earthy teen-ager with airs.         In 1951, she made her London stage debut in ''After the Show,'' followed by a series of musical revues, in which she demonstrated the transforming ability of a chameleon. She said she usually played 16 to 18 characters in one night and never looked the same. After Ms. Reid appeared in a revue sketch by Harold Pinter in 1959, Harold Clurman called her ''a real artist and trouper with technical command.''         ''Sister George,'' first presented in Bristol and in London in 1965, was her breakthrough. Later she acted in Mr. Albee's ''Counting the Ways'' at the National, in Congreve's ''Way of the World'' for the Royal Shakespeare Company and in Mr. Nichols's ''Born in the Gardens.''         Her films include ''The Belles of St. Trinian's,'' ''The Dock Brief'' (renamed ''Trial and Error'' in the United States), ''Inspector Clouseau'' and Dylan Thomas's ''Doctor and the Devils.''         In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby described her role in ''Joseph Andrews'' in 1977 as ''a battered, flirtatious crone with the manners of a truck driver trying to be dainty.''         Ms. Reid wrote an autobiography, ''So Much Love,'' and was the co-author of ''Cats' Whiskers'' and ''Beryl, Food and Friends.'' In 1986 she was awarded the Order of the British Empire.         Married and divorced twice, she lived in a cottage in Wraysbury, outside London. No immediate family members survive.       
         Magda Trocme, a French parson's wife who opened her door to a single shivering refugee in 1940 and helped inspire a movement that saved thousands of Jews and others from the Nazis in World War II, died on Oct. 10 a hospital in Paris. She was 94 and lived in Paris.         Although she was a heroine to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Memorial Authority, to her dying day Mrs. Trocme could not comprehend a world that regarded it as in any way remarkable that she, her husband, and thousands of other residents of the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in the plateau region of southern France had risked their lives to feed, clothe, hide and protect those who would have died without their help.         But then Mrs. Trocme was an anomaly, a free-thinking woman whose life was dedicated to the curious principle that just as food is the answer to hunger the only rational antidote to violence is nonviolence.         Mrs. Trocme owed her own prominence in the rescue movement in part to the fact that her husband, Andre Trocme, was the charismatic pacifist pastor of the French Reformed Church in Chambon, a founder of the Cevenol boarding school there and a recognized leader of the rescue effort, which has been credited with saving some 5,000 refugees, about 3,500 of them Jewish, many of them children.         But as scores of refugees who came to her own door discovered, Mrs. Trocme was more than her husband's shadow; she was a highly organized, tireless and practical woman who knew how to find food when there was no food and just which door to knock on to find room and welcome for those her own overburdened household could not accommodate.         The almost unanimous support the rescue movement enjoyed in the area around Chambon is generally attributed to the mostly Protestant peasant population's identification with the victims of persecution.         But neither her husband nor Mrs. Trocme were natives of the region. Mrs. Trocme, whose paternal grandfather was a refugee from Czarist Russia and whose father was an engineer who had been a colonel in the Italian cavalry, was born in Florence, where she had an unconventional reaction to a conventional Catholic upbringing. While a convent student, she rejected the Church and embraced Protestantism.         While studying on a scholarship at the old School of Social Work in New York in 1925, she met Mr. Trocme, a  Protestant from northern France who was studying at the Union Theological Seminary. They were married in 1926.         After his ordination, Mr. Trocme, who was something of a free-thinker himself (he had renounced violence and become a conscientious objector in World War I) was regarded as so much of a rebel in the French Protestant church that he was sent in 1934 to Chambon in southern France, a region with a long history of tolerance since the days it had become a refuge for Huguenots fleeing the purges of Catholic France.         Like her husband, Mrs. Trocme, who taught Italian at the Cevenol school, was a thoroughgoing pacifist. But many of the villagers and farmers of the region were not. Under the rule of the collaborationist Vichy Government and the later German occupation many of them took part in the Resistance activities that were common throughout France, but what set the Chambon area apart was its role as a place of refuge.         Although her open-hearted welcome to the Jewish woman who knocked on her door one snowy night in 1940 has been considered the beginning of the Chambon movement, Mrs. Trocme's daughter, Nelly Hewitt of Minneapolis, stressed yesterday that in an area where secrecy was a way of life and virtually every home eventually harbored one or more refugees, it is impossible to know whether her mother had been the first.         Mrs. Trocme's initial effort almost backfired, her daughter recalled, when she placed her visitor's soaked shoes next to the hearth to dry and they caught fire.         After the war, Mr. Trocme became the European secretary for the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an American-based pacifist group, and during the 1950's he and his wife made fund-raising tours of the United States. He later became pastor of a church in Geneva, and after his death in 1971, Mrs. Trocme retired to Paris.         There she wondered at the attention her efforts had received over the years, including a 1989 book by Philip P. Hallie, ''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed,'' and a television documentary, ''Weapons of the Spirit.''         To her mind, at least, she had done nothing more than provide the obvious help to those in obvious need. She no more understood the fuss over her efforts to rescue Jews than the consternation she caused her neighbors  when policemen came to arrest her husband (he was later released) and she served them dinner.         ''I don't understand,'' she said. ''It was dinner time.''         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Trocme is survived by a son, Jacques, of Paris, 10 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 9, 1996, Saturday         An obituary on Oct. 19 about Magda Trocme, a Frenchwoman who helped shield Jewish refugees from the Nazis in World War II, misspelled the name of her daughter and misstated the daughter's hometown. She is Nelly Hewett, not Hewitt, of St. Paul, not Minneapolis.       
         Edith Tilton Penrose, an American-born British economist who was an authority on corporate growth and on oil, died on Oct. 11 in Waterbeach -- near Cambridge, England -- where she lived. She was 81.         Her death was reported on Saturday by The Guardian and The Independent.         Dr. Penrose, whose doctorate was from Johns Hopkins University, retired in 1978 as a professor at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, where she concurrently headed the school's economics department. In later years she was a professor and a dean at the Institut Europeen d'Administration des Affaires in Fontainebleau, France.         Her best-known book is ''The Theory of the Growth of the Firm'' (1959, Oxford), about the ways companies grow and the reasons why they do. Jay B. Barney, a professor of management at Ohio State University, writing in a management journal last year, called it a seminal work about ''the competitive implications of a firm's internal strengths and weaknesses.''         A Scottish economist, Sir Alec Cairncross, recalled in The Independent on Saturday, that the book brought Dr. Penrose ''instant recognition as a creative thinker, and its importance to the analysis of the job of management has been increasingly realized.''         In theorizing about companies, Dr. Penrose held that, as The Guardian  put it: ''There are important administrative restraints on the speed of the firm's growth. Human resources required for the management of change are tied to the individual firm and so are internally scarce. Expansion requires the recruitment of more such resources. New recruits cannot become fully effective overnight. The growth process is, therefore, dynamically constrained.''         Dr. Penrose's interest in oil originated in the late 1950's, when she was a visiting professor at the University of Baghdad. In a 1976 interview, she recalled: ''I was doing a book on multinational corporations, although nobody called them that in those days. Being in Iraq, it would have been rather silly not to concentrate on oil, wouldn't it?''         That book, ''The Large International Firm in Developing Countries: The International Petroleum Industry,'' was published in 1968, and by 1976 she was considered one of the top oil economists in the world.         In the 1976 interview, she said: ''Historically, the international oil companies often have wielded their vast power selfishly, although their accomplishments have often been beneficial to the world.'' By that time, oil executives had often been less than pleased with conclusions expressed in her writings, but she contended: ''I don't take sides. I just gather the facts and if people don't like my work, they just don't like the facts.''         Edith Tilton was born in Los Angeles and received a bachelor's degree in 1936 from the University of California at Berkeley. After working for the American Embassy in London, she received her doctorate in 1950. Her first book, ''Economics of the International Patent System,'' was published in 1951.         Dr. Penrose was a lecturer and research associate at Johns Hopkins for many years. Sir Alec wrote that after a campaign she and her husband, Ernest F. Penrose, a British-born economist and writer, ''conducted in support of Owen Lattimore, a professor accused of un-American activities,'' the couple ''fell afoul of McCarthy and were more or less exiled, first to the Australian National University in Canberra and then to Baghdad University.'' Then the couple moved to Britain.         Dr. Penrose married David Burton Denhardt in 1934; he died in 1938. She married Mr. Penrose in 1944; he died in 1984. Her survivors include three sons.       
         Julia Waldbaum, an effervescent personification of motherly concern, homey wisdom and business savvy who helped build a supermarket chain from a butter and egg store in Brooklyn, died in her sleep on Monday as her son held her hand in her apartment in Floral Park, Queens.         Mrs. Waldbaum, 99, who would have turned 100 on July 4, had been a longtime resident of the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.         Late in life, even after nearly all her family's stock in the Waldbaum's supermarkets was sold to the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company in 1986, Mrs. Waldbaum  liked to keep an eye on the stores.         In the 1960's, her picture appeared on almost all of the 400 food products sold under the Waldbaum's label, along with recipes she had tested in her own kitchen.         ''They left me off the dog food and the bathroom tissue,'' she observed one day as she made one of her regular surprise inspections as self-appointed watchdog of the chain.         In a store on Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn, Mrs. Waldbaum, who was also the secretary of the company, told a produce clerk to discard a bruised grapefruit, or put it in with the reduced-price merchandise. She checked at the meat counter to see if anyone had poked through the plastic meat wrappers. ''When that happens, I have it rewrapped,'' she said.         She told how she grew upset when she saw long lines at the checkout counters and not enough checkers, and how she became angry when clerks forgot to say ''thank you'' to customers.         As she continued her tour, one of 30 she made each month, she brushed dust off cans of kidney beans and straightened an untidy display of marshmallows.         ''I'm really not too fussy about messy shelves, though,'' she said. ''That means we're selling.''         By the early 1980's, the chain was grossing $1.376 billion at 140 supermarkets in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. There was never a Manhattan store, she said. ''Manhattan has too many single people, rents are too high and there's no space for parking lots.''         Julia Leffel, the daughter of Harry and Anna Leffel, was born in Manhattan and reared in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. She was 12 when she met Israel Waldbaum. Known as Izzy, he was an immigrant from Austria selling butter and eggs in a little store established in 1904 at 911 DeKalb Avenue.         According to family legend, one day during World War I, Anna Leffel asked Izzy Waldbaum if he could get her some sugar, which was in short supply. Mr. Waldbaum found a 50-pound sack and offered to deliver it personally to her home. When he did, he encountered Julia. He realized that she was the girl who came to his store every day to buy milk, which she carried home in a pail.         In time, Izzy Waldbaum asked to carry the pail home for her. That was their courtship. When he was 28 and she was 21, they married, and Julia went to work in the store.         ''People used to stand three abreast to get into that store,'' she said with a faraway look in her eyes as she reminisced in 1967, 20 years after she was widowed and left with three children.         By the time Mr. Waldbaum died at age 55, the chain consisted of seven stores. When a store ran short of a product, Mrs. Waldbaum, the first woman in her family to have a driver's license, would put her children in the car, drive to a store with a surplus of the product and take some to the needy supermarket.         For years, much to the consternation of her family, she refused to have her telephone number unlisted. ''I like to have the customers call me, because a lot of them think Julia Waldbaum is an imaginary person like Betty Crocker,'' she said.         Away from the supermarkets, Mrs. Waldbaum was devoted to opera and the theater and was a benefactor of many charities.         She is survived by a daughter, Shirley Waldbaum Witkin of Glen Cove, L.I.; a son, Ira Waldbaum of Old Westbury, L.I.; a sister, Sylvia Goldman of Riverdale, the Bronx; a brother, Alfred Leffel of Syosset, L.I., 10 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Mary Heiss Boynton, who directed blood donor programs for the American Red Cross during wartime and later at Lenox Hill Hospital, died on Oct. 8 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 85.         Dr. Boynton served as chief medical director of the American Red Cross blood donor program for metropolitan New York during both World War II and the Korean War. She also served as administrator of the Lenox Hill blood bank in the 1970's through mid-1980's.         She was a life trustee of Brick Presbyterian Church's hospital chaplaincy, as well as a director, trustee and past president of James Lenox House, a home for the elderly.         She was born in Ann Arbor, Mich.,  and graduated from Wellesley College in 1932 and Cornell University Medical College in 1936.         Dr. Boynton was the widow of Dr. Perry S. Boynton, former chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Lenox Hill. She is survived by two sons, Charles H., of Pottersville, N.J., and Perry S. 3d, of Bernardsville, N.J.; a daughter, Esther B. Wilkens of Darien, Conn.; a sister, Anne H. Boynton of Stonington, Conn., and eight grandchildren.       
         Fritz and Ingeborg Kahlenberg, exiled Germans who met during World War II as members of Hidden Camera, a Dutch Resistance group that documented the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, died this month at New York University Hospital within two weeks of each other.         The Kahlenbergs, who established Film Authors, a New York film production company after they immigrated to the United States in 1946, lived in Manhattan. Mr. Kahlenberg, 80, died on Oct. 15; Mrs. Kahlenberg, 76, died on Oct. 2.         The couple's daughter, Liz Kahlenberg Bordow, said her mother had died of lung cancer and her father of complications of kidney failure.         Working secretly, the Hidden Camera photographers, led by Mr. Kahlenberg, hoarded rationed film, snapped pictures with cameras concealed in coats or handbags, developed the photographs and, in some cases, tried to smuggle them out of the country.         Under the title ''The Illegal Camera: Photography in the Netherlands During the German Occupation, 1940-1945,'' an exhibition of 75 photographs taken by members of the Hidden Camera opened in August at the Jewish Museum, at Fifth Avenue and 92d Street, where it is to run until Dec. 1.         In addition to the persecution of the Jews, the photographs at the museum cover warfare and occupation, confiscation of goods, compulsory labor, resistance, the ''Hunger Winter'' of 1944-45 when starvation was rampant, and liberation.         One of the most widely known of the Hidden Camera photographs, taken by Cas Oorthuys and included by Edward Steichen in his collection ''The Family of Man,'' studies the face of a sunken-eyed woman gnawing on a crust of bread.         ''The pictures are painful to look at,'' Sarah Boxer wrote in her review in The New York Times.         Henry Kol, the Dutch consul for press and cultural affairs in New York, credited photographs taken by Hidden Camera with providing evidence that enabled the Dutch Government in exile to persuade the Red Cross to arrange food drops.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, who was taught by her husband to operate a camera, was also involved in resistance communications, transporting munitions and the use of forged documents.         Mr. Kahlenberg, who was born in Berlin, where his father was a founder of the U.F.A. film studio, settled in Amsterdam after Hitler came to power and was a film distributor when World War II began.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, whose maiden name was Wallheimer, was born in Bremen and moved to Amsterdam with her family in 1939.         The couple, cited by the Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, for their resistance activities, were married in 1946 and settled in New York.         For a time, Mr. Kahlenberg was a producer with Telenews, which provided newsreels to movie theaters. In the 1950's, the Kahlenbergs founded Film Authors, a production company.         They produced a wide variety of documentary and travel films for such clients as Pan American Airways, the Icelandic and Scandinavian Travel Bureaus, Holland America Lines and Bermuda. David Frost, Ernie Kovacs and Jonathan Winters were among the narrators.         In addition to their daughter, of Berkeley, Calif., they are survived by  a grandchild.         Mr. Kahlenberg is also survived by a brother, Hans Kahlenberg of Chiddingfold, England. Mrs. Kahlenberg is survived by a brother, Gunthur Wallheimer, and a sister, Helga Ekker, both of Amsterdam.       
         Charlotte H. Dinger, a New Jersey housewife who a paid a chance visit to a Philadelphia antiques shop in 1972 and walked out with the foundation of an unlikely collection and an even less likely career, died on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Morristown, N.J. She was 66, and known as the nation's leading collector and foremost authority on antique carved horses and other carousel art.         Her husband, Carl W. Dinger Jr., said the cause was a heart attack.         To hear her tell it in later years, Mrs. Dinger had two transforming experiences in her life.         The first occurred during a childhood visit to the old Olympic Park in Maplewood, N.J., where she became so enchanted with the flamboyantly beautiful wooden horses whirling around the amusement park's carousel that she promptly announced she wanted one of her own.         The second came on the 1972 visit to the antiques store, where she encountered an old and faded carousel horse that for all its obvious neglect and disrepair evoked such a powerful nostalgic recollection of her bright childhood fascination that she paid $75 for it on the spot.         By the time she got it home and began stripping away the successive layers of thick paint that had obscured the delicate carved features underneath, her old childhood fascination was well on the way to becoming a full-blown adult obsession.         Fired by her initial purchase, Mrs. Dinger soon tracked down what she recognized as a treasure trove of two dozen carousel horses stacked like so much cordwood in a Philadelphia warehouse. Their next stop was the Dinger garage.         (It's a safe bet that there aren't many such warehouse troves left. By the time Mrs. Dinger was in full swing, figures stripped from the thousands of carousels that operated  at the turn of the century were recognized as valuable examples of a neglected art.)         Her husband, only mildly irritated at the loss of space for the family cars, could hardly complain. He, too, was a collector, but then again his collection of baseball cards did not require repeated additions to the couple's Morristown home.         Over the next two decades Mrs. Dinger tracked down, bought and restored scores of horses and other carousel figures. She became familiar with the history of the American carousel, from its beginnings in 1867 with the work of a German immigrant, Gustav Dentzel, to its decline after the introduction of the automobile and its abrupt demise in the Depression.         She became an expert in the subtle distinctions of the work of such carousel masters as Charles Loof (known for friendly, smiling steeds) and Sol Stein and Harry Goldstein (the Central Park Carousel).         She helped found the American Carousel Society to spread the word among other collectors and carousel lovers. She started her own publishing company to produce a definitive coffee table book, ''Art of the Carousel.''         When her collection threatened to outstrip the capacity of her home, she put together a traveling exhibition that was displayed at museums across the country.         As other collectors, recognizing that antique carousel figures were not merely curiosities or so much junk but examples of an important American folk art, bid up the prices of choice specimens to astronomical levels (as much as $175,000), she became a consultant to Sotheby's.         And finally, concerned about the wear and tear of constant travel on her own increasingly valuable figures, she established a permanent home for more than 100 of her best pieces at Carousel World, a museum and working carousel she helped establish at Peddler's Village in Lahaska, Pa., outside New Hope.         Anyone who hasn't seen them there may have caught a glimpse of a few of her prize pieces in the family mail. The United States Postal Service has twice used Mrs. Dinger's collection as the basis for an issue of commemorative stamps depicting carousel animals.         Despite her interest in collecting individual carousel figures, Mrs. Dinger campaigned to keep the dwindling supply of working carousels intact. (According to the American Carousel Society, which estimates there were once 3,000 to 6,000 carousels in the country, from the famous Flying Horses on Martha's Vineyard, where children still ride on the oldest American carousel, assembled in 1884, to the last carousels produced in the 1920's, there are now only 133 left.)         And all her instincts as a collector and her appreciation of carousels and carousel figures as art, Mrs. Dinger never forgot her initial childhood fascination with the fairy tale experience of whirling around on a noble horse.         During her many visits to carousels across the country, Mrs. Dinger was never content just to look. She always climbed aboard and took a ride.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Carl Dinger 3d of Sugarland Tex., and Jeff, of Morris Plains, N.J., and two granddaughters.       
         Diana Trilling, an uncompromising cultural and social critic and a member of the circle of writers, thinkers and polemicists of the 1930's, 40's and 50's known as the New York intellectuals, died on Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         At one point, as a critic for The Nation, Mrs. Trilling read a novel a day for six and a half years, delivering challenging reviews on some of the most important works of the modern era: Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited,'' Robert Penn Warren's ''All the King's Men,'' Jean-Paul Sartre's ''Age of Reason'' and George Orwell's ''1984.''         As a reviewer, she approached her work with ''force, control and precision,'' said Paul Fussell, the scholar and author, in his introduction to a collection of her criticism titled ''Reviewing the Forties'' (Harcourt Brace, 1978). Her theme, he said, was ''the threat of monomanias and systems and theories and sentimentalities to fiction.'' Above all, he said, she was ''impatient with simplicities,'' but ''generous in recognizing real merit.''         As an intellectual living through the Depression, the rise and fall of Fascism and Communism, World War II, the Holocaust, Prohibition and the sexual revolution, Diana Trilling clung to an old-fashioned ethos.         ''My first responsibility was to my home and family,'' she once said. ''I was able to deceive myself that it was a matter of free will and competence that I took on the tasks of the home.'' She credited her husband, Lionel Trilling -- one of the century's foremost literary critics and teachers and the author of works like ''The Liberal Imagination'' that became central documents of American intellectual life -- with her success and development as a critical writer, even as she struggled to establish herself in her own right in later years.         Keeping the Flame, While Breaking Free         To everyone, she was a complicated woman, with a passion for language, a zest for cultural contention and a sharp, usually unforgiving pen. Robert Lowell called her ''a housekeeping goddess of reason.''         She began writing in 1941 and never stopped. Fifty-four years later, in her 90th year, with failing eyesight, she composed a 75-page article on the Welsh literary figure Goronwey Rees, offered it for publication to The New Yorker, then headed for her summer home on Cape Cod. Later, back in her ground-floor apartment on Claremont Avenue near Columbia University, she resumed her routine of writing from 9 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon, five days a week.         She believed that ''writers are what they write, also what they fail to write.'' No novels, no volumes of poetry or short fiction bear her name, but among her credits are five books. These include three collections of essays and reviews and an impressionistic piece of journalism, ''Mrs. Harris: The Death of the Scarsdale Diet Doctor'' (Harcourt Brace, 1981), about the sensational murder trial of Jean Harris, the headmistress of an exclusive girls' school, for the murder of her lover. She also wrote ''The Beginning of the Journey'' (Harcourt Brace, 1993), sometimes a memoir, sometimes an apologia, often a long letter of rebuke to those who thought of her as little more than a sidekick to the scholar with whom she lived for 46 years.         Still, the task of keeping Lionel Trilling's flame while trying to break free of its light sometimes seemed to envelop her. She once told an interviewer that the headline on her obituary would read: ''Diana Trilling Dies at 150. Widow of Distinguished Professor and Literary Critic Lionel Trilling.''         His expertise was acquired; he held a doctorate from Columbia University, taught there in the company of brilliant colleagues and challenged students who went on to produce some of the country's finest literature and criticism. Her expertise, on the other hand, was intuitive; her Radcliffe degree in fine arts, she said, left her ill-prepared for anything except a walk through a gallery or a museum.         ''I graduated from Radcliffe without having read a line of Homer or Dante or Chaucer, without knowing anything of Shakespeare,'' she said. So she learned from her husband, ''casually, unconsciously, by association,'' and along the way discovered that she had a natural acuity for language and an innate sense of what made a good book work.         She suggested in her memoir that Lionel Trilling often used her as an editor and tutor on style. ''What I was trying to bring to his writing was a greater directness and greater fluidity,'' she wrote. Nevertheless, she never doubted ''that, of the two of us, he was the more important writer.'' Her husband ''had more to say than I and a great deal more resonated from what he wrote.''         Her work appeared in some of the best magazines in the country, including The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Harper's and The Saturday Review, but mainly in two journals that were among those at the center of American intellectual life of the period, The Nation, where she wrote book reviews and literary criticism, and The Partisan Review, to which she contributed essays. Her writing bears out her interest in the relationship between esthetics, morality and society and her determination to express moral judgments -- her critics said moralistic judgments -- on literature and the political issues of the day.         She was a fierce anti-Communist, someone who joined some Communist-front groups in the early 1930's but who then became disaffected by the ruthlessness of Stalin, and for the rest of her public life she wore the ideals of Western democracy on her sleeve. Perhaps it was this disaffection that led her to think of herself as a rationalist bent on exposing empty slogans and ideas -- political, literary and cultural. And it was this stance, the immovable anti-Communist who insisted that all ideas be grounded in rationality and morality, that dominated her work.         'An Anxious World' Filled With Fears         A native New Yorker, she was born on July 21, 1905, one of three children of Helene Forbert Rubin and Joseph Rubin, a manufacturer of straw braid. Her parents were immigrant Polish Jews who moved with their children from Westchester to Brooklyn to Manhattan. ''Pleasure was not the principle of our home,'' Mrs. Trilling once wrote. ''I learned early in life that to laugh before breakfast was to cry before dinner.''         She described herself as an ''excessively fearful'' child. First she was afraid of the dark, then of burglars and, as she grew older, eventually of just about everything, especially being alone or leaving the house. ''I regard the whole of my life as having been lived in an anxious world,'' she said.         Her fears, indeed her fear of having so many fears, may have shaped her choice of work, she came to believe, because they made her ''too intent upon reasonableness'' and ''blocked the free play of my imagination.'' Thus she stuck to analytical writing, preferring the logical and cerebral to the fantastic.         In 1927, in a Manhattan speak-easy -- over a drink called a bullfrog (gin, apricot brandy and grenadine) -- she met Lionel Trilling. He was smart and handsome, a graduate student in literature at Columbia. In a short time, they fell in love. Later they slept together. (''Surely going to bed with a man before marriage was the most courageous act of my life,'' she said.) And in 1929, they were married.         ''With marriage I had entered Lionel's world,'' she said. ''It was with his friends that I now chiefly associated. They were not easy companions, these intellectuals. They were overbearing and arrogant, excessively competitive; they lacked magnanimity and often they lacked common courtesy. Ours was a cruelly judgmental society, often malicious and riddled with envy.''         But what a society it was, with Alfred Kazin, Irving Howe, Philip Rahv, William Phillips, Sidney Hook, Delmore Schwartz, Dwight McDonald, Hannah Arendt, Saul Bellow, Mary McCarthy, Clement Greenberg, Irving Kristol and several others striving to set the intellectual agenda of the nation.         In book-cluttered apartments on the Upper West Side, they lived what Mrs. Trilling called ''a life of significant contention.'' In the pages of The Partisan Review, Commentary, The Nation and Dissent, they debated whether America should enter World War II. They quarreled over Trotsky and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the Beats and the Columbia riots to such an extent that many of the survivors have not spoken to one another for years.         When these intellectuals were not preoccupied by ideas or pulling apart the culture, they talked incessantly, Mrs. Trilling remembered in her memoir, ''about sex, sex, and more sex, with particular emphasis upon adultery.'' Sex, she continued, ''took up as much conversational space as in later years we would give to politics.''         Wielding Her Pen With Candor         Diana Trilling's career as a critic began in 1941, at the age of 36, when she overheard a telephone conversation between her husband and Margaret Marshall, the literary editor of The Nation, who had called to ask if he could recommend someone to write the magazine's literary notes column. When her husband hung up, Mrs. Trilling looked at him and offered herself for the position.         She held the job for 10 years, often wielding her pen like a Bowie knife: ''A mad, bad, and dangerous book, Allan Seager's 'Equinox' is fiction's most recent attempt to practice psychiatry without a license.'' Or, of Truman Capote's ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'': ''I find myself deeply antipathetic to the whole artistic-moral purpose of Mr. Capote's novel. I would freely trade 80 percent of his technical skill for 20 percent more value in the uses to which it is put.''         She was proud of her reputation as a clear-eyed, uncompromising critic. She liked to tell the story of a Viennese novelist, a refugee from Nazi Austria, who ''was said to have remarked that he had lost his country, his home, his language, but that he had at least one good fortune; he has not been reviewed by me.''         As she approached her 42d birthday, she decided that she and her husband had been squandering their lives. ''We were afraid to be full grown up and to be in command of ourselves and others.'' And so she became pregnant. Their only child, James, was born shortly thereafter, in 1947. James, of Providence, R.I., survives her, as do two grandchildren.         In 1975, Lionel Trilling died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 70, and in the years that followed, she worked hard to assure his legacy, editing a 12-volume uniform edition of his work. But she also strove successfully to establish her own mark, writing essays, publishing two collections of criticism -- ''Reviewing the Forties''  and ''We Must My Darlings'' (Harcourt Brace, 1977) -- and covering the Jean Harris trial. Then, suffering from macular degeneration that left her with eyesight so poor she could no longer type, she dictated her memoir, ''The Beginning of the Journey.''         To the last, she remained contentious, complaining of America's loss of intellectual culture. ''I think the life of significant contention no longer exists,'' she told New York magazine in 1995. ''We have enormous division in our society on sectarian or ideological lines. But we don't have any discourse.'' She said that the best academic minds had drifted into esoteric specialization and she assailed multiculturalism as ''our present-day version of Stalinism -- a culture of moral virtue without thought.''         Earlier this year The New Yorker published her brief memoir of her days at summer camp, and she finished her last book, ''A Visit to Camelot,'' an account of an evening spent at the White House when John F. Kennedy was President.         Three or four times a week in her later years, friends would come to the cluttered apartment to read to her. Among them was the poet Richard Howard, who said that despite her infirmities, she remained ''remarkably autonomous.''         Often the conversation turned to Lionel Trilling. ''Seventeen years have now passed since Lionel's death,'' she wrote at the conclusion of her memoir, ''and hour by hour, minute by minute I still listen for a clock which no longer ticks.''         Correction:  October 31, 1996, Thursday         An obituary of the critic and writer Diana Trilling on Friday omitted part of the title of a collection of her essays. It is ''We Must March My Darlings.''       
         Hermine Baron, one of America's top-ranked female bridge players, died in Los Angeles on Sept. 27. She was 83 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her former husband, Arthur Baron of Los Angeles.         For the last 22 years, Mrs. Baron had more master points than any other female player, ending with 22,645 and the title of grand life master. From 1975 to 1983, she was ranked second among all players by the American Contract Bridge League, and was 10th when she died.         In 1964 and 1970, she won the McKenney Trophy, awarded for winning the most points in a calendar year.In 1964, she set a points record.         Mrs. Baron was a member of the United States Women's Team that took third place in the 1968 world championships in Deauville, France, and she competed in the World Women's Pairs Championship in 1978 and 1982. In national competition, she won the Life Master Pairs in 1966 and five other titles: the Women's Teams in 1964 and 1968; the Women's Pairs in 1968 and 1982, and the Life Master Women's Pairs in 1963. She finished second seven times.         Mrs. Baron was born in Omaha and stricken with polio at the age of 13, after which she was confined to a wheelchair.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Jerry Hirschman of Chicago.       
         Miriam Kressyn, a star of the Yiddish stage and, along with her husband, Seymour Rechtzeit, a primary force in the survival of Yiddish theater in the United States, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         As actress, singer, adapter of plays, radio personality and teacher, Ms. Kressyn was one of the most popular artists in the Yiddish-speaking theater, brightening musicals as well as plays over a period of 60 years. Although she had diverse talents, she was best known for portraying stately, ladylike characters.         She was born in Bialystok, in what is now Poland, and came to the United States in 1925. While living in Boston, she began singing on radio, then switched to the stage, singing in the chorus of a Yiddish theater. Soon she was acting, playing male and female roles. She studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and Northeastern University.         Subsequently she acted in Chicago and Philadelphia (where she met her husband), and toured Europe, South America and Africa before settling in New York. She quickly became a favorite of local audiences drawn to theaters on lower Second Avenue by stories of sentiment, nostalgia and sometimes tragedy.         For five years, she and her husband acted in musical comedies with Menasha Skulnick. She was also in I. J. Singer's ''Brothers Askenazi'' and ''Yoshe Kalb'' and in Isaac Bashevis Singer's ''Family Muskat,'' and played the title role in an adaptation of Philip Yordan's ''Anna Lucasta.''         She and her husband became known as the romantic idols of Yiddish musicals. Often she was featured in a cast with other Yiddish theater favorites, including Reizl Bozyk, Ben Bonus, Leo Fuchs, Mina Bern and Jacob Jacobs.         In reviewing the musical ''A Cowboy in Israel'' in The New York Times, Richard F. Shepard said that the actress, ''rising to the occasion as usual, plays the tsoriss-ridden heroine -- no laughs, all trouble -- who stands to inherit a fortune if only she marries.''         Eventually Ms. Kressyn began adapting plays, including ''The Flowering Peach'' by Clifford Odets, Leon Kobrin's ''Riverside Drive'' and Nahum Stutchkoff's ''Land of Dreams.'' She taught Yiddish theater at Queens College, and for 40 years she and her husband broadcast in Yiddish on WEVD radio. In 1937 she appeared in Joseph Green's Yiddish film ''Der Purimshpieler.''         Several times in her career there were suggestions that she might perform in English on Broadway (in ''The Diary of Anne Frank'') and in English-language films, but she remained in the Yiddish theater for her entire life. To the repeated charge that Yiddish theater was defunct, she would say, with characteristic enthusiasm, ''We are not dead, we are very much alive.'' Summing up her career, she said, with pride, ''Yiddish is my world.''         She is survived by her husband, who is president of the Hebrew Actors Union.       
         Angela Romano Perez, an advocate for the disabled whose life was a model of the personal independence, responsibility and achievement she championed, died on Friday at the Cabrini Hospice in the Gramercy Park area of Manhattan. Ms. Perez, a lifelong resident of the Upper East Side, was 49.         Her husband, Joseph, said the cause was breast cancer.         Ms. Perez, who was born with cerebral palsy, spent her life trying to change the prejudices that disabled people often encounter or even impose on themselves.         At her death, she was the program director of the Y.W.C.A. of New York City, for which she directed the Networking Project for People With Disabilities. ''The project was founded to provide young people with disabilities with positive role models because, particularly for young women with disabilities, there tends to be a lack of visible, appealing role models,'' said Madeline F. Beusse, a consultant who worked with Ms. Perez on the financing of the project. ''The project is about empowerment, boosting self-esteem and opening doors.''         Besides leading the Networking Project, which is paid for by the city's Youth Services Department and private donations, Ms. Perez designed and oversaw a study of the accessibility of health services for disabled women. Called ''Breaking Down Barriers: Eliminating Obstacles to Reproductive Health Care for Women With Disabilities'' and financed by the New York State Department of Health, the study is continuing. The findings and recommendations are to be presented by its board -- health care professionals, disability advocates and corporate and public officials -- at a conference in the spring.         Before taking the Y.W.C.A. post in 1988, Ms. Perez was the educational counseling coordinator for the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities, from 1983 to 1987.         Working to raise awareness of domestic violence against people with disabilities, she served on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's task force on domestic violence, giving a voice to some of the more vulnerable victims of abuse.         Ms. Perez was also on the board of directors of the Center for the Independence of the Disabled and a vice president of Women With Disabilities, both of which are advocacy and service organizations.         Combining advocacy with her love of travel, Ms. Perez attended the nongovernmental forum on women held in Beijing in conjunction with the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women last year. She went frequently to Canada to collaborate with the Disabled Women's Networ, and traveled as well to Japan, Thailand, Austria, Britain and Italy and throughout the United States.         On Oct. 5, her birthday, a personal letter of commendation from Hillary Rodham Clinton was delivered to Ms. Perez's room at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, where she had been under care since August. It was followed by a letter from the Mayor, commending Ms. Perez for the difference she had made in the life of New Yorkers.         Ms. Perez held two degrees from Hunter College: a Bachelor of Arts in psychology, awarded in 1978, and a Master of Science in education, awarded in 1983.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her parents, Stephen and Mary Romano, and her brother, Benjamin, all of Manhattan.       
         Marjorie Shostak, a woman from a traditional family in Flatbush whose book about a bold older woman from the !Kung San tribe in Africa's Kalahari Desert rode an early wave of women's studies and injected new life into techniques of anthropology, died on Sunday at DeKalb Medical Center in Atlanta. She was 51.         The cause was breast cancer, family members said.         Ms. Shostak relayed her findings in a 1981 book, ''Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman'' (Harvard University Press), illustrated with her photographs. The book revealed the world of a 50-ish !Kung San woman who says, for example, speaking of sex in old age, ''Then I'll wear the beads and powder and I'll be beautiful again, so beautiful that the men will say, 'Nisa, aren't you a lovely one.' ''         The book, which is frequently used as a text in women's studies and anthropology classes, portrayed Nisa, a name that Ms. Shostak invented to protect the privacy of the subject, as a vibrant, piercing, blunt, frank desert woman who would discuss sex, men, jealousy and women's anatomy as casually as a woman in Flatbush might discuss a grocery list.         The encounter between Nisa and the author took place during Ms. Shostak's initial field work from 1968 to 1971, when she was 21 and had just married her Brooklyn College sweetheart. Nisa was about 30 years older.         Despite the contrast between their social backgrounds, author and subject managed to share emotions and to bridge the gulf of geography and social background, said Ms. Shostak's husband, Dr. Melvin Konner, who is the Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Anthropology and an associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at Emory University.         Nisa's life, as described by Ms. Shostak, was one through which readers came to understand that !Kung San were open and direct in ways that amazed Westerners.         ''It was a life that we can recognize emotionally,'' said Brenda Bynum, an associate of Ms. Shostak.         The language of the !Kung San involves a number of click sounds that others find difficult to speak, let alone learn. (The exclamation point, in Western depictions of the language, is used to represent the click sound.) Yet Ms. Shostak was able to learn it by pointing to objects and asking women to talk about them. Learning from women as she sat under trees or in grass huts, Ms. Shostak quickly reached a level of mastery that allowed her to conduct the hours of interviews with Nisa and other women about their lives.         Ms. Shostak wrote the book while she and her husband lived in Cambridge, Mass., where she was an associate of the Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.         Beginning in 1983, both were associated with Emory University, where she was an adjunct assistant professor of anthropology.         In 1993, Ms. Shostak, part way through an eight-year battle with breast cancer and believing that it would be her last chance to see Nisa, spent weeks searching for her in the deserts and, remarkably, found her. The story was recorded in a second book, ''Nisa Revisited,'' that Ms. Shostak had largely completed before she died, Dr. Konner said.         Ms. Shostak lacked training in anthropology -- she earned a bachelor's degree in literature at Brooklyn College -- but her work was the subject of a number of doctoral studies in that field, and although she wrote few academic works, her field work was often analyzed at academic conferences, her husband said.         She is survived by her husband, two daughters, Susanna B. Konner and Sarah B. Konner, and a son, Adam J. Konner, all of Atlanta; her parents, Jerome and Edna Shostak of Midwood, Brooklyn, and Palm Beach, Fla., and a sister, Lucy Shostak of Baldwin, L.I.       
         Jessie Bernard, a sociologist whose wide-ranging research and writings on women's issues provided scholarly foundation for the modern feminist revolution, died on Oct. 6 at a nursing home in Washington. She was 93.         By rights, Dr. Bernard should have been content to observe the reawakening of feminism benignly from the far side of a long and completed career.         Indeed, when Betty Friedan revived feminist fervor with the publication of her landmark ''Feminine Mystique'' in 1963, Dr. Bernard was a 60-year-old Penn State professor a year away from retirement. And, with the exception of ''Academic Women,'' a 1961 work derived from her own experiences in academia, the dozen or so works on subjects like community organization that had gained her reputation as a respected scholar seemed remote from the suddenly urgent issues raised by the Friedan treatise.         But like many professional women of a certain age who had balanced a successful career with marriage and motherhood, Dr. Bernard came to the realization that she had been a feminist all along and, as it turned out, had a lot to say on the subject.         So much so, in fact, that within a decade after her formal retirement in 1964 she had turned out a torrent of books -- among them ''The Sex Game,'' ''The Female World,'' ''The Future of Marriage'' and ''The Future of Motherhood'' -- that established her as a premier scholar of the women's movement.         It is in part a tribute to her scholarship that many of the ideas she advanced, like the notion that marriage generally benefits men more than women, seem commonplace today.         Although her works were based on meticulous research, as a feminist scholar Dr. Bernard had an edge. For when it came to writing about women as wives, mothers and breadwinners, she had not only been there and done that, she had also done it with uncommon flair.         On the surface, she had led the most conventional of lives. The daughter of immigrant shopkeepers from Romania, Dr. Bernard, whose original name was Ravitch, was born in Minneapolis, attended the University of Minnesota, married her college sweetheart and followed her husband from job to job, serving variously as his assistant and collaborator while holding a series of lower-level jobs, and not beginning her own academic career in earnest until she was in her 40's, an age when a woman's children are generally old enough to fend for themselves.         But surfaces can be deceiving, and there was very little conventional about Dr. Bernard.         For one thing, the college sweetheart she married was not a classmate, but one of her professors, Dr. Luther Lee Bernard, a founder of the modern study of sociology and a man more than twice her age when they met in a classroom and felt such a powerful mutual attraction that neither looked back.         She then accelerated her education, graduating at 20 and receiving a master's degree the next year. After marrying her professor she began a peripatetic life, following him band from academic post to post, including a sojourn to Argentina, where she helped him with the research that would win him wide acclaim.         Dr. Bernard did not obtain her own doctorate, from Washington University in St. Louis, until she was 32, and did not begin her teaching career, at the Lindewood College for Women, near St. Louis, until she was 37.         Then, at a time when many women's children are beginning to leave home, Dr. Bernard started having children, the first when she was 39, another when she was 42 and the last when she was 47, three years after she and her husband had joined the Penn State faculty and six months before his death at the age of 69.         By the time she retired from Penn State and began writing about women's issues, Dr. Bernard knew what it meant to be both a wife and a single mother.         She moved her family to Washington and became a central figure in the feminist revolution, studying subtle forms of sex discrimination as scholar in residence for the United States Commission on Civil Rights, for example, and becoming a founding board member for the Center for Women in Policy Studies.         In her later years Dr. Bernard, who was known for her beaming smile and generosity in helping younger scholars, exerted a magnetic attraction at conferences and other gatherings, her colleagues at the center said, and was regarded by some scholars as a founding mother of sociology.         Dr. Bernard is survived by a daughter, Dorothy Jackson of Washington; two sons, Claude, of Laurel, Md., and David, of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.       
         Alma Kitchell, a pioneering radio singer who became a pioneering talk show host, sang in the first televised opera and capped her career by presiding over the first television cooking show, died on Wednesday at her home in Sarasota, Fla. She was 103.         She was known as the Golden Voice of the Golden Age of radio, and from the time she walked into NBC's old New York station, WJZ, in 1927 and sang her way into a job, her rich contralto was rarely silent for the next two decades.         After singing regularly on the local station for a year, she moved up to NBC's old Blue network, spending two years with the NBC Opera Company and five years as the soloist on a weekly program with the NBC concert orchestra before increasing her schedule to three nights a week for a seven-year run.         By the time she abandoned broadcast singing in 1940, Miss Kitchell had embarked on a new phase of her vocal career, as the originator and host of a series of talk shows devoted to women's concerns. Her program and Mary Margaret McBride's, which ran on NBC's Red network, are regarded as the first radio talk shows.         Under names like ''Let's Talk It Over,'' ''Women's Exchange,'' and ''Alma Kitchell's Brief Case,'' in which she answered her voluminous mail, the programs were broadcast from 1938 to 1947, initially on NBC and later on ABC, the network organized in 1943 to take over NBC's Blue network.         Along the way, Miss Kitchell interviewed prominent women like Eleanor Roosevelt, discussed family and social issues and chatted about her own active life.         For all the fans she acquired as a singer, Miss Kitchell became even more famous as a talk show host, and she put her celebrity to civic use, especially during World War II. She once sang on the air while giving blood, for example, and she conceived of and popularized the slogan ''A Stamp a Day for the Man Who's Away'' to help sell war bonds.         A formidable woman on or off the air, Miss Kitchell, who had been sent on cross-country speaking tours by NBC to promote radio, became an important fund-raiser for the Republican Party in New York and was named to state commissions by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey.         A native of Superior, Wis., Miss Kitchell, whose maiden name was Hopkins, began singing locally. She studied at the Cincinnati Conservatory and came to New York in 1912 at the age of 19 to pursue a professional career.         According to family legend, she was chaperoned by her mother during her first year in New York, spent the second year on her own and in the third married her voice teacher, Charles W. Kitchell.         She began by singing with major local choral societies and orchestras, and made her debut at Town Hall in 1924 in a program that included Bach and Handel airs, Swiss and Jewish folksongs and modern French, German and Russian songs with American lyrics.         By the time she began her radio career in 1927, Miss Kitchell had already established her credentials as a broadcast pioneer. In 1917, six years before regular broadcasts were begun, she sang for an experimental station established at the base of the Statue of Liberty.         For all her devotion to music, Miss Kitchell came to love radio more. In 1937, she turned down an opportunity to join the Metropolitan Opera in order to stay in broadcasting.         Although she was primarily known for her work in radio, Miss Kitchell was a pioneer in television as well. In 1939, when RCA began the first experimental television broadcasts from its Rockefeller Center headquarters, she sang the part of Ruth, the piratical maid of all work, in the first televised opera, Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirates of Penzance.''         Eight years later, at the dawn of network television in 1947, Miss Kitchell abandoned her radio career and ABC to return to NBC and make television history once again, this time as the star of the first commercial network television series, also  television's first cooking show, ''In the Kelvinator Kitchen.''         She remained on the program until 1949, then retired from public life.         Miss Kitchell, whose first husband died in 1956, married Joseph Yoder, a retired chemical engineer, in 1965 and settled in Florida. Mr. Yoder died about a decade ago.         Miss Kitchell remained in vigorous health until her 100th birthday. It was an occasion noted by Willard Scott, the ''Today'' weatherman, from NBC's studios in the same building where she had helped open the television era a half-century earlier.         She is survived by two sons,  Charles Kitchell of Osterville, Mass.,  and James Kitchell of Atlanta; four grandchildren, and four great-grandhildren.       
         Virginia Cherrill, a 1930's actress who starred as a beautiful, blind flower girl in the classic Charlie Chaplin silent film ''City Lights'' (1931), died late Thursday in a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 88 and had settled in Santa Barbara in 1950.         Miss Cherrill was born near Carthage, Ill. and educated at schools in Kenosha, Wis., and Chicago.         After an early marriage to Irving Adler, a Chicago lawyer, ended in divorce, she went to California to recover and met Chaplin there. He has variously been said to have first noticed her on a California beach and when they were both at a boxing match.         David Robinson, film critic for The Times of London, wrote in a 1985 biography of Chaplin that the actor gave Miss Cherrill the part of the flower girl largely because she portrayed a blind person appealingly, in a test, after he advised her to look at him but ''to look inwardly and not to see me.''         In the movie, Chaplin starred opposite her as a little tramp who fell in love with her. Its final scene, with close-ups of Miss Cherrill, has won special praise. The writer and critic James Agee called it ''enough to shrivel the heart to see, the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies.''         Miss Cherrill starred in several other American-made movies in the early 1930's and met Cary Grant at a film premiere. They were married in 1933, and she went on to retire briefly from movie making.         Their divorce came in 1935. Then she resumed her career, again briefly, in Britain, where she acted in two films. Later she said, ''I was no great shakes as an actress.''         She retired from movie making for good when she began her nine-year marriage to the ninth Earl of Jersey, in 1937.         As the Countess of Jersey, she did charity work in Britain during World War II.         She is survived by her husband of 48 years, Florian Martini, a World War II flying ace.       
         Dr. Kathelyn Sue Steimer, a leading researcher in the quest for an AIDS vaccine, died on Nov. 16 at her home in Benicia, Calif. She was 48.         The cause was cancer, according to the Chiron Corporation of Emeryville, Calif., where she was vice president for research in the vaccines division.         Dr. Steimer joined the company in 1983 and led a project that developed Chiron's candidate for a vaccine against H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The vaccine is undergoing clinical trials on humans in the United States and Thailand. With Dr. Dino Dina and Dr. Paul Luciw, Dr. Steimer helped bring about the first sequencing and cloning of the virus, in 1985, the company said.         She led a program to evaluate and develop genetically engineered proteins of the virus for use in diagnostic assays. As vice president, she oversaw the vaccine research staff at Emeryville and coordinated efforts with vaccine research centers around the world.         She was a biology graduate of the University of California at Riverside, with a master's degree in microbiology from Pennsylvania State University and a doctorate in that specialty from the University of Pennsylvania.         Dr. Steimer is survived by her husband, Prof. Martin Wilson; a daughter, Acacia, also of Benicia; and her father, Harry Steimer of Sacramento, Calif.       
         Meridel Le Sueur, who reported on the plight of the poor during the Depression and celebrated the free spirits of early Americans in her fiction for children, died on Nov. 14 in Hudson Memorial Hospital in Hudson, Wis. She was 96 and had lived in the hospital's residential unit in nearby St. Paul, Minn., for the last few years.         Miss Le Sueur, a native of Murray, Iowa, grew up among the radical farmer and labor groups that informed her youth, like the Populists, the Farmers Alliance and the Wobblies, the Industrial Workers of the World. Her first story was published  in a literary magazine in 1927, and she kept writing into her 90's.         Her mother and stepfather, Marion Wharton and Alfred Le Sueur, were ardent socialists who imbued her with an idealism that never left her. Just beyond their Middle Western kitchen the world was filled with  eloquent radicals: Big Bill Haywood, Eugene V. Debs, Lincoln Steffens and Emma Goldman.         Largely self-taught, Miss Le Sueur teamed with kindred souls in literary communal relationships and, sent East by her mother, moved in with Goldman while attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She came to know John Reed and met Theodore Dreiser and Edna St. Vincent Millay at Mabel Dodge's literary salon.         She won acclaim in 1927 for her story ''Persephone'' and again in 1934 for ''The Horse,'' a strange, powerful novella. With her distinctly personal style of journalism, she rendered detailed observation with a sense of political urgency. She reported on bread lines and unemployment offices and on deserted mining towns and desolate farms.         Blacklisted during the McCarthy period, she continued to write, turning out experimental prose works, novels and poems and storing them in her basement in Minnesota.         Her highly praised children's books, in which she interwove history and regional lore in poetic prose, included ''Little Brother of the Wilderness: The Story of Johnny Appleseed,'' ''Nancy Hanks of Wilderness Road: A Story of Abraham Lincoln's Mother,'' ''Sparrow Hawk'' and ''Chanticleer of Wilderness Road: A Story of Davy Crockett.''         Miss Le Sueur's own wilderness relented as collections of her prose began to appear in the 1970's. Her recovery culminated in ''Ripening: Selected Work, 1927-1980'' (Feminist Press, 1982), a clear reflection of how she had listened from childhood to the stories of immigrants and Indian women.         An early milestone in her career was ''North Star Country'' (1945), the story of how Minnesota and Wisconsin were settled. It was reprinted by the University of Nebraska Press in 1984. Her recent work included ''The Dread Road'' (1991), a novel about a mining strike in Colorado.         She is survived by two daughters, Rachel Tilsen of Hudson and Deborah Le Sueur of Graton, Calif.; 8 grandchildren; 27 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Lansing Dulles, an economic specialist for the State Department who played a major part in planning the reconstruction of West Berlin in the 1950's, died on Wednesday in the Knollwood military retirement home in Washington. She was 101.         Her death was reported by The Associated Press on Friday.         Mrs. Dulles, who was sometimes called ''the Mother of Berlin'' for her enthusiastic efforts to revitalize the economy and culture of that battered capital as it recovered from World War II, managed to carve for herself a formidable reputation even though her two brothers, John Foster Dulles and Allen Welsh Dulles, held much higher rank in the American Government.         She was offered the State Department's Berlin desk in 1952, just before Foster Dulles was named Secretary of State.         She quickly saw trouble coming, she said in a memoir published in 1980, because Foster had been criticized for using his influence to get Allen the top job in the C.I.A. and wanted to avoid further accusations of nepotism. She was already a career diplomat, and her West Berlin position came through before Mr. Dulles's appointment, yet once he was in office, he tried to force her out. He did not succeed, she noted with some satisfaction.         Mrs. Dulles said it was difficult for a woman to serve in the State Department in that era.         ''This place is a real man's world if ever there was one,'' she said in 1958. ''It's riddled with prejudices. If you are a woman in Government service you just have to work 10 times as hard -- and even then it takes much skill to paddle around the various taboos. But it is fun to see how far you can get in spite of being a woman.''         Mrs. Dulles was born in Watertown, N.Y., one of five children of a Presbyterian minister and his wife. One ancestor, John Welsh, served as envoy to Britain in Rutherford B. Hayes's Administration, and her grandfather John W. Foster and an uncle, Robert Lansing, each served as Secretary of State, under Presidents Benjamin Harrison and Woodrow Wilson, respectively.         She graduated from Bryn Mawr College with a major in social sciences, worked in refugee rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in France after World War I and returned to Bryn Mawr to earn a master's degree in labor and industrial economics.         She took odd jobs in the early 1920's -- running a punch press at the American Tube & Stamping Company in Bridgeport, Conn., and working as payroll clerk for a hair net company in Long Island City, Queens.         She also traveled extensively in Europe, studied at the London School of Economics, investigated industrial methods in 75 British firms and received a master's degree from Radcliffe College and a doctorate in economics from Harvard.         In the 1930's she studied and taught economics and finance in Paris, Geneva, Basel, Boston, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Bryn Mawr. She produced scholarly books including ''The French Franc, 1914-1928,'' ''The Facts and Their Interpretation'' and ''The Bank for International Settlements at Work.'' She wrote more than a dozen books in all.         When she was 30 she met David Simon Blondheim, a philologist who, as an Orthodox Jew, was not regarded by her family as marriage material, she indicated in her memoir. She married him anyway, in 1932. In 1934, not long before the birth of their son, Dr. Blondheim committed suicide.         Mrs. Dulles, who used her maiden surname, entered Government service in 1936 as director of financial research for the Social Security Board. In 1942 she moved on to the State Department. At the Bretton Woods international monetary conference in New Hampshire in 1944, she was a prominent member of the American delegation.         The next year, she went to Vienna as the State Department's financial attache. She demonstrated keen bargaining powers -- helping to feed starving Austrians by arranging the barter of horses for German cabbages and potatoes.         Later, as special assistant to the director of the State Department's office of German affairs, Mrs. Dulles was credited with ''working miracles,'' as one biographer put it. She helped to reduce West German unemployment and increase production.         To hasten those developments, she said, she would ''send requests from Berlin for money and rush back to Washington in time to compose favorable answers.'' She wangled more than $1 billion for West Berlin, adorning it with the now-famous Congress Hall, which Berliners for many years fondly referred to as the ''Dulleseum'' and ''Frau Dulles's Hut,'' as well as a hospital and educational centers.         Beginning in 1959, Mrs. Dulles was assigned to studying foreign aid programs and visited 60 countries on behalf of the State Department's office of intelligence and research.         She left the State Department in 1962, after her brother Allen had been dismissed from the C.I.A. in the wake of the Bay of Pigs catastrophe. Leonard Mosley wrote in his 1978 book ''Dulles'' that early in 1962, during the Kennedy Administration, Secretary of State Dean Rusk summoned her and said, ''The White House has asked me to get rid of you.''         Mrs. Dulles, in her memoirs, ''Eleanor Lansing Dulles: Chances of a Lifetime,'' published in 1980, wrote affectionately of her older brothers but did not hesitate to say that since childhood there were frictions among the siblings. She also admitted that her strong personality won her her share of enemies.         She suffered from poor eyesight since childhood and developed deafness but remained active well into her old age.         Her survivors include her son, David, of Washington, and her daughter, Ann Dulles Joor, of Manlius, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Carolyn Eugenia Agger, a prominent tax lawyer and the widow of former Justice Abe Fortas of the Supreme Court, died on Thursday at her home in the Georgetown section of Washington. She was 87.         The cause was pneumonia, said the Washington law firm Arnold & Porter, where she retired two years ago as a senior partner and head of the tax practice section.         Ms. Agger was at the center of a rebellion that ruffled the world of big-ticket law offices in 1960 when she led an exodus of partners from the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. A partner in the firm's Washington office, she defected to Arnold, Fortas & Porter and took the entire Washington office with her.         At the time, Mr. Fortas was a member of the firm, now known as Arnold & Porter. And he was loath to give up his lucrative partnership when President Lyndon B. Johnson tried to cajole him into joining the Court in 1965. Mr. Fortas refused several times, but Mr. Johnson was not one to take no for an answer.         The assent to the bench meant a sharp financial loss, to $39,500 from an estimated yearly salary of $200,000, something that Mr. Fortas openly derided. It also angered Ms. Agger, suddenly the couple's principal breadwinner by far. It was Mr. Fortas, an Associate Justice from 1965 until resigning in 1969, who steered her into a legal career after their marriage in 1935.         Carolyn Eugenia Agger, who was born in New York City, graduated from Barnard College in 1931. After obtaining a master's degree in economics in 1932 at the University of Wisconsin, she worked in staff positions at various New Deal agencies.         She graduated from Yale Law School in 1938 and went into private practice when few women did. She was associated with Lord, Day & Lord and then advanced to a full partnership in Paul, Weiss before moving to Arnold, Fortas & Porter.         Mr. Fortas died in 1982 after 47 years of marriage. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Nancy Macdonald, the well-born anarchist who helped radicalize her husband, Dwight Macdonald, in the 1930's, managed his magazine Politics in the 1940's, and then struck out on her own in the 1950's to aid refugees of the Spanish civil war, died last Monday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 86 and had lived on East 10th Street for more than half a century.         Her son Nicholas said the cause was emphysema.         The darlings of New York's radicals in the 1930's were the half million Spanish loyalists who fought in vain against the forces of Francisco Franco, then made their way across the Pyrenees to refuge in southwestern France.         The loyalists got a lot of attention at the beginning, and those who had been Communists continued to receive support, but by the 1950's, with Franco's fascist dictatorship well established, the others had become what Mrs. Macdonald called ''the legion of the forgotten,'' languishing in poverty, unable and unwilling to return to their homeland.         It was then that Mrs. Macdonald decided to remind the world of their plight. In 1953 she founded Spanish Refugee Aid to provide help to the non-Communist exiles.         From her office on Union Square, Mrs. Macdonald attracted money and support from intellectual friends like Hannah Arendt, James T. Farrell, Alfred Kazin and Barbara Tuchman, while Pablo Casals and Francine Faure, the wife of Albert Camus, distributed the aid in France.         And her home, which had been a literary and political social center in the 1930's, was hopping once again. Where T. S. Eliot had once been among the lionized guests, Alexander Calder mingled with refugees.         There was, to be sure, one change on East 10th Street. Mr. Macdonald, who had helped establish the aid organization, was no longer around as the marriage had dissolved.         On paper, at least, the union between Dwight Macdonald and Nancy Gardiner Rodman seemed made in establishment heaven. He was Yale, she was Vassar, and both were descended from prominent families, he from the Dwights of old New England, she from the Gardiners of colonial New York.         When her brother, Selden Rodman, a poet and prominent art collector, introduced them at a party, she, the daughter of a New York architect, was fresh out of college, and he was a writer for Fortune magazine.         For all their social and establishment credentials, both had left-wing views. In his years as a founding editor of Partisan Review in the 1930's, as the founder of Politics in the 1940's and later as a social critic for The New Yorker, Mr. Macdonald acknowledged that his wife had prodded him ever leftward.         It was also her family money that enabled him to leave Fortune for The Partisan Review, where she worked as business manager. And it was her administrative skills as managing editor that helped keep Politics going  after the couple established it in their apartment in 1943.         While her husband was securing his reputation as a major critic, Mrs. Macdonald was becoming known for her intellectual fervor and for what Mr. Kazin recalled as her abiding kindness and concern for others.         Mrs. Macdonald, who peppered The New York Times and other publications with letters and articles describing the plight of the refugees, even after the death of Franco in 1974, continued to direct Spanish Refugee Aid until retiring in 1983, then summed up her work with a book in 1987 based on taped interviews, ''Homage to the Spanish Exiles: Voices from the Spanish Civil War.''         With the time and the restoration of democracy in Spain, the number of exiles has declined, but there are still 125 aging loyalists receiving help from the charity. According to the director, Margaret Childress, because of Mrs. Macdonald's financial efforts, the help will continue.         Mr. Macdonald died in 1982. In addition to her son Nicholas, of Brooklyn, and her brother of Oakland, N.J., Mrs. Macdonald is survived by another son, Michael of Manhattan, two grandchildren and one great grandchild.         Correction:  December 21, 1996, Saturday         An obituary on Monday about Nancy Macdonald, who aided refugees of the Spanish Civil War, misstated the year of Francisco Franco's death. It was 1975, not 1974.       
         Mary Cooper Jewett Gaiser, a philanthropist who served on the boards of nonprofit institutions in the fields of education, community service and the arts, died on Sunday at Deaconess Medical Center in Spokane, Wash. She was 95 and lived in Spokane.         Over the years, Mrs. Gaiser (pronounced like ''geyser'') served on the boards of numerous institutions that were beneficiaries of her largess. She was a trustee of Wellesley College, of which she was an alumna, for 18 years. She was active in fund-raising for Wellesley, and its Jewett Art Center is named for her first husband, George Frederick Jewett, who died in 1956. He was chairman and president of Potlatch Forests, a forest-products concern based in Lewiston, Idaho. .         Her philanthropy extended to other educational institutions, including the American University of Beirut, Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., and Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Calif., all of which she served as a trustee. Mrs. Gaiser had been on the national board of the Young Women's Christian Association since the late 1940's. ''Women are wonderful,'' she once declared. ''Like tea bags, they never know their strength until they get into hot water.''         She was president of the Spokane Y.W.C.A. during World War II, and oversaw programs to help women and children with problems related to the war. In addition, she was on the boards of the Spokane Arts Commission, which she helped set up, and of what is now the Spokane Symphony orchestra, in whose founding she was instrumental. In 1987, after donating $225,000 to the orchestra's endowment, she said: ''Half the fun of life is sharing. People are missing a lot of satisfaction if they don't get pleasure from using their abilities to help others.''         She and Mr. Jewett also played an important role in the construction of the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Spokane.         A doctor's daughter, Mrs. Gaiser was born in Ogdensburg, N.Y., received a bachelor's degree from Wellesley in 1923, and taught school in Bronxville, N.Y. until she married Mr. Jewett in 1925. They lived in communities in Idaho until they moved to Spokane in 1937. She married Dr. David Wesley Gaiser, a surgeon, in 1961, and he died in 1985.         Mrs. Gaiser is survived by a son, George Frederick Jewett Jr. of San Francisco; a daughter, Margaret Jewett Greer of Chevy Chase, Md.; six grandchildren; nine great-grandchildren; a sister, Janet Cooper Dakin of Irvington, Va., and a brother, Dr. William Grant Cooper Jr., of Little Rock, Ark.       
         Peggy Wattles Pulleyn, whose grandchild's ill fortune moved her to found the Princeton Child Development Institute in 1970, died on Dec. 8 in a freakish accident near her home in Oldwick, N.J. She was 85.         According to the Somerset County Prosecutor's office, she was walking on a road in Bedminster when a car driven by a longtime friend, Allison Ewing, backing up to meet her, lurched out of control and struck her. No charges were filed against Mrs. Ewing, 76, who is the wife of New Jersey's senior State Senator, John H. Ewing of Bernardsville.         The institute in Princeton, now caring for about 40 autistic children, has grown into a nationally recognized center that has served as a model elsewhere in the country. Its science-based program, backed by research and staff training, was recognized by the Federal Government in 1983 when it cited the Institute as one of 60 exemplary private schools in the country.         Mrs. Pulleyn felt the need for such a school in 1968 when her family realized that her first grandson, Rollie, was autistic, a still-enigmatic condition with many associated disorders. Her search for a suitable program for the child led her, her daughter and some other parents in the Princeton region to start their own school.         From modest beginnings with 17 children, the institute moved into its own home in Princeton, where a further addition was completed this year. Mrs. Pulleyn was an original board member.         She served as its longtime chairwoman, raising funds for the state-supported institute. Up to her death, she remained active on the board, and was also active in another project: the Magic Shop in Oldwick.         Founded just after World War II, it is a gift shop that initially assisted returning veterans. Since then, it has been a financial supporter of the nearby Bonnie Brae Home for Boys, a boarding institution that teaches troubled children academic subjects and trade skills.         Mrs. Pulleyn, an amateur artist, contributed her work and staffed the counter to sell the Magic Shop's wide variety of children's clothing and other handmade materials. The day before her death, she suited up the shop's Santa for the season.         Peggy Wattles grew up in Buffalo and graduated from Bennett Junior College in Millbrook, N.Y. She was an outstanding amateur golfer who won New York State championships in the 1930's and twice reached the quarterfinals of the United States Women's National Golf Tournament.         Mrs. Pulleyn's husband, Robert, a lawyer, died in 1990. She is survived by her daughter, Pamela Pulleyn Machold of Princeton; a brother, Gurdon W. Wattles of Oldwick; a sister, Elizabeth Wattles of Hightstown, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Grace M. Mayer, a pioneering curator of photography who was instrumental in rediscovering the work of Jacob Riis and who built a major collection of prints and photographs for the Museum of the City of New York, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.         ''She was well ahead of her time in recognizing the art of photography,'' said Peter Galassi, chief curator of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art, where Ms. Mayer also became a curator. ''And generations of photographers are indebted to her careful and sympathetic attention to their work.''         Ms. Mayer was an elegant, witty and intensely precise woman. (One of her hobbies was meticulously compiling errors in The New York Times.)         She was born in New York City.  Her father was an investment banker. It was expected that she would lead the sheltered life of a society woman, but she carved out a career for herself.         Having been privately tutored in New York and abroad, she joined the Red Cross as a nurse's aide during World War I. She joined the Museum of the City of New York in 1930, when it was a fledgling institution in Gracie Mansion.         Immersing herself in the job, she read cover to cover the 6,000-page ''Iconography of Manhattan Island,'' by I. N. Phelps Stokes, developing an encyclopedic knowledge of the city.         She spent the next three decades at the museum, organizing more than 100 shows, among them ''Currier & Ives and the New York Scene'' and ''We Cover The New Yorker.'' In 1934 she organized the first important Berenice Abbott show in the United States. She also secured major and varied collections, including the Harry T. Peters Collection of Currier & Ives prints, and more than 10,000 photographs of the city.         And she published ''Once Upon a City,'' a detailed and imaginative portrait of New York at the turn of the century illustrated by the photographs of Joseph and Percy Byron, which she also acquired for the museum.         In 1957 Ms. Mayer helped Edward Steichen, head of the photography department at the Modern, organize a show there of photographs of the city. Steichen hired her as his assistant, and in 1962 she became curator of photography, organizing, among other things, the inaugural show in the Modern's first photography-collection galleries, which opened in 1964. She collaborated with Steichen on important shows like ''The Sense of Abstraction,'' and after retiring in 1968 she was appointed curator of the Edward Steichen Archive.       
         Eileen R. Donovan, the United States Ambassador to Barbados from 1969 to 1974, died on Thursday in Spring Hill, Fla. She was 81 and had lived in Clearwater, Fla.         Her brother, William L. Donovan, said that the cause was cardio-respiratory arrest and that she had suffered from chronic respiratory obstructive disease.         Miss Donovan was a consul in Barbados in 1960, and in 1962 became consul general.         From 1965 to 1969, she served as assistant director of the State Department's Office of Carribean Affairs before returning to Barbados as Ambassador, becoming the highest ranking woman in the Foreign Service.         Miss Donovan began her career in the Foreign Service in 1948, serving in the Philippines, Italy and Japan, where she was a political liaison officer. In the late 1950's she became  chief of the Southern Europe branch of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research.         Miss Donovan was a native of Boston, where she earned a bachelor's degree from Boston Teachers College in 1936 and a master's degree in education in 1937. She later received a master's of public administration degree from Harvard.         Miss Donovan was a history teacher in the Boston public school system from 1938 to 1943, and then served in the Women's Army Corps during World War II, where she quickly rose from private to captain.         In 1945, she was the primary assistant to Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the Tokyo headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. She worked in the field of Japanese women's education.         She is survived by her brother, of Scituate, Mass.       
         Magda Denes, a psychoanalyst who had just completed a book recounting her torment as a Jewish child hunted by the Nazis in wartime Budapest, was found dead on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62.         She apparently had suffered a heart attack or stroke, her family said yesterday through a friend, Geoffrey Weill.         Dr. Denes's second book, ''Castles Burning: A Child's Life in War,'' is to be published in January by W. W. Norton. A book party was set for Jan. 9, after which Dr. Denes was to give readings and interviews around the United States and abroad. Rights to the book, which was selected as a Literary Guild featured alternate, were also recently sold for German, British and Dutch publication.         The book recounts Dr. Denes's ordeal as one of the so-called hidden children, estimated to number from 10,000 to 100,000, who spent World War II in stables and caves and secret rooms like Anne Frank's annex in Amsterdam. Young Madga was 5 in 1939 when her father, Gyula Denes, a wealthy publisher, fled Budapest, abandoning his daughter, son and wife, who sought refuge in houses protected by Swiss diplomats.         For five months in 1944, she and her family lived in a basement, and on occasion, she wrote, she hid in a filthy bathroom and an oven.         In despair, she and her family once debated whether to commit suicide or continue to hide. Magda, then 9, cast the deciding vote for survival.         In December 1944, months before liberation by Soviet forces, her 16-year-old brother, Ivan, who had been a secret courier for the Zionist resistance group Hashomer, was caught and shot. After the war, she and her mother, grandmother and aunt fled  to France and then to Cuba before immigrating to the United States.         She was 12 before she re-encountered her father, who pronounced her a rather unpleasant child. ''I know,'' she said she replied. ''Starving for prolonged periods of time while simultaneously being fed on by packs of lice tends to corrode one's pleasanter side.''         In New York City, Ms. Denes attended City College, and she did postgraduate study in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis at Boston, Yeshiva and New York Universities. Since 1961 she had trained psychologists and psychiatrists.         At her death she was a participant in postdoctoral programs at Adelphi and New York universities. She was also a faculty member and supervisor in the psychiatry department at Mount Sinai Medical Center's School of Medicine and chairwoman of the New York State Psychological Association's Committee on Public Information.         In 1976, Dr. Denes published her first book, ''In Necessity and Sorrow: Life and Death in an Abortion Hospital,'' which a reviewer for The New York Times Book review called ''a highly emotional anti-abortion tract.'' Many other critics praised the book, and it was published in Austria, England, Germany and Japan.         Dr. Denes is survived by her mother, Margit, and two sons, Gregory Radomisli and Timothy Radomisli, both of New York City.         Interviewed along with with other childhood survivors of the Nazis in 1991, Dr. Denes said she had long struggled to break her silence. ''The hidden children are in a curious position,'' she said. ''They were not deported and they were not killed. So they never felt entitled to talk about their own experiences.         ''Holocaust survivors tend to be totally absorbed with that experience, while hidden children have tried to forget what happened to them.''       
         Mary Leakey, matriarch of the famous fossil-hunting family in Africa whose own reputation in paleoanthropology soared with discoveries of bones, stone tools and the footprints of early human ancestors, died yesterday in Nairobi, Kenya. She was 83.         Her family announced her death but did not give the cause, saying only that she died peacefully.         Over half a century, Mary Leakey labored under the hot African sun, scratching in the dirt for clues to early human physical and cultural evolution. Scientists in her field said she set the standards for documentation and excavation in paleolithic archeology. They spoke of hers as a life of enviable achievement.         ''She was one of the world's great originals,'' said Dr. Alan Walker, an anatomist at Pennsylvania State University who has long excavated fossils with the Leakey family. ''Untrained except in art, she developed techniques of excavation and descriptive archeology and did it all on her own in the middle of Africa. It was an extraordinary life.''         In a biography of the Leakey family, ''Ancestral Passions,'' published last year by Simon & Schuster, Virginia Morell characterized Mary Leakey as ''the grande dame of archeology.''         Beginning in the 1930's, Mary Leakey and her late husband, Louis, awakened the world to Africa's primary place in human origins with their spectacular discoveries and increasingly pushed back the time of those origins much earlier than had been thought. Until then, many scientists still believed the human birthplace would be found in Asia.         She discovered the skull of Proconsul africanus, an apelike ancestor of both apes and early humans that lived about 25 million years ago. In 1959, her discovery of a well-preserved skull of a hominid, a member of the extended human ancestral family, brought fame and substantial financial backing to the Leakeys. A few years later, the two Leakeys uncovered the fossils of the first known member of the genus Homo habilis, or ''able man,'' in recognition of the many stone tools found among the bones.         From then on, the name Leakey was synonymous with the study of human origins. The flamboyant Louis seemed to know just where to look to find revealing fossils; the envious spoke of ''Leakey's luck.'' Meanwhile, Mary Leakey worked in her husband's shadow, seeing to the plodding excavations and meticulous documentation of their finds.         ''Louis was always a better publicist than scientist,'' said E. Barton Worthington, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London and former African explorer. ''Mary was the real fossil hunter.''         After Louis Leakey's death in 1972, Mary Leakey overcame some of her natural shyness to assume direction of the family fossil enterprise, which by then one of their sons, Richard, joined as an expedition leader. Her operations centered on Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli, both in Tanzania. On the arid plain of Laetoli, she made her most sensational discovery in 1978: the earliest footprints of a human ancestor.         A Playful Moment, But a Fateful One         As often happens, the discovery of the prints was made by chance -- more Leakey luck. While tossing dried elephant dung in a playful camp fight, one scientist on Mrs. Leakey's expedition fell down and saw in the gray surface some curious indentations. They were imprints of raindrops and animals, now hardened to stone and recently exposed by erosion and weathering.         After further exploration, scientists determined that the tracks were made about 3.7 million years ago. The animals had walked over volcanic ash when it was damp from rain, leaving impressions of their feet. The wet ash set like concrete and was later covered over by more ash and silt. There the tracks remained to be found by dung-throwing scientists.         It was two years before a scientist uncovered a heel print that hinted of an even more significant find. It seemed to belong to a hominid. On Aug. 2, 1978, Mrs. Leakey spent three hours examining one of the clearest of these prints. She cleaned the crevices of the print with a small brush and dental pick. All the important elements were preserved: heel, toes and arch. She appraised the print from every possible angle.         Finally, Mrs. Leakey stood up from her work, lit a cigar and announced, ''Now this really is something to put on the mantelpiece.''         She was at last sure that a hominid had left this print and a trail of prints extending more than 75 feet across the plain. Two and possibly three individuals had walked this way 3.7 million years ago: the larger one, presumably a male; the smaller one, presumably female, and an even smaller individual, perhaps their child, whose prints are sometimes superimposed on the others.         In a Footprint a Clue To Human Behavior         Somewhere along the way, as Mrs. Leakey noted, the female appeared to pause and turn to her left. She might have sensed danger, possibly from a predator or the rumble of a volcanic eruption nearby. Then she resumed her walk to the north.         ''This motion, so intensely human, transcends time,'' Mrs. Leakey wrote in the National Geographic magazine. ''A remote ancestor -- just as you or I -- experienced a moment of doubt.''         These evocative footprints are the earliest known traces of human behavior. At the time, the discovery established that human ancestors had begun walking upright much earlier than previously thought, long before the evolution of larger brains. Whether upright walking preceded the larger brain, or vice versa, was still a much-debated issue among scholars.         With the discovery of a species called Australopithecus afarensis, based on the famous Lucy skeleton, the most likely identity of these prehistoric strollers was established. The species lived between 3.9 million and 3 million years ago, and from the fossils paleontologists have determined that they were as capable of walking upright as modern humans.         ''I think it's the most important find in view of human evolution,'' Mrs. Leakey was quoted by The Associated Press as saying in an interview in September. ''I was really looking for tools, but we never found any at the site.''         In Stone Age Art, Two Interests Merged         She also looked back fondly on what she called another highlight of her career. She was a budding artist before she met and later married Mr. Leakey, when she turned to fossil hunting and archeology. In 1951, her two interests merged briefly.         Mrs. Leakey recorded on drawing paper some 1,600 of the thousands of late Stone Age paintings in the Kondoa-Irangi region of Tanzania. The work gave her ''a great sense of happiness and well-being,'' she wrote in her autobiography, ''Disclosing the Past,'' published in 1984, because the drawings afforded a glimpse of the lives of the hunter-gatherers who painted them. ''No amounts of stone and bone could yield the kinds of information that the paintings gave so freely,'' she said.         One of her last books was a collection of these Stone Age drawings, entitled ''Africa's Vanishing Art: the Rock Paintings of Tanzania'' and published in 1983.         Art and, to some extent, prehistory were part of Mary Leakey's heritage. She was born Mary Douglas Nicol on Feb. 6, 1913 in London. Her father, Erskine Nicol, was a prolific and fairly successful landscape painter, as was his father before him. Her mother, Cecilia Marion Frere, was a descendant of John Frere, a British prehistorian who in 1797 first recognized Stone Age flint implements as primitive tools and weapons.         After World War I, the family spent months each year in Switzerland, France or Italy, where the father painted and took Mary to archeological ruins and the caves painted by Cro-Magnon hunters. As she said, this was the source of her early interest in archeology.         ''Basically, I have been compelled by curiosity,'' she wrote in her autobiography. But formal education was not for her.         Bored by class work and her fellow students, Mary was expelled from two schools and so, with attending a university out of the question, decided to pursue independent studies in drawing and archeology. ''I had never passed a single school exam, and clearly never would,'' she wrote.         At the age of 20, Mary Nicol, a sometime illustrator of stone tools and occasional participant in archeological digs, met Louis Leakey, 10 years her senior, married and an established figure in African archeology with a position at Cambridge University. He asked her to help him with drawings for a book, and she readily agreed. A romance followed, and then scandal.         Scandal in Cambridge Led to Magic of Africa         They would marry as soon as his divorce came through. Meanwhile, they did nothing to conceal the intimacy of their relationship, living together for more than a year in a cottage near Cambridge. This eventually cost him his post at Cambridge, the memory of which was dancing lightly through Mary Leakey's mind years later as she walked up the aisle at Cambridge to receive an honorary doctorate degree.         The two were married in 1936 and set out for Africa, where he had grown up as the son of British missionaries. As Mrs. Leakey wrote later, she was never the same again after ''Africa had cast its spell'' on her. Much of their marriage was spent at dig sites. ''Given the chance, I'd rather be in a tent than in a house,'' she said in a recent interview with Associated Press.         It was a discovery by the Leakeys in 1959 that, according to Dr. F. Clark Howell of the University of California at Berkeley, marked ''the beginnings of paleoanthropology in a modern sense.'' The pace of exploration quickened. Geologists and anatomists joined the quest, a multidisciplinary approach that the Leakeys did much to promote.         On a July day in 1959, as Louis lay ill in camp, Mary stumbled on some teeth and part of a jaw on a slope of Olduvai Gorge. Rushing back to her husband, she exclaimed, ''I've found him -- found our man.''         How the couple celebrated is not recorded. But in her autobiography, Mrs. Leakey wrote that after an earlier major find they ''cast aside care'' and that was how their son Philip ''came to join our family.''         The 1959 discovery turned out to be a 1.8 million-year-old fossil known as the ''nutcracker man'' because of its huge jaws and molar teeth. It was later designated Australopithecus boisei.         As Two Lives Diverged, A New Independence         From 1968 until Louis Leakey's death in 1972, he and Mary Leakey were separated. He spent more and more of his time in the celebrity whirl, raising money and lecturing,  while she stuck to her digging at Olduvai. She was becoming more independent, opposing some of her husband's more sensational interpretations of discoveries.         ''I ended by losing my professional respect for Louis; and it had been very great indeed,'' she wrote. ''Once that was so I was no longer able to offer the concurrence and unquestioning adulation he now seemed to demand.''         Another unsettling episode in her life was the controversy between her and Richard Leakey, on one side, and Dr. Donald C. Johanson, the discoverer of Lucy, on the other. She insisted on the removal of her name from the joint authorship of a paper that made assumptions about the place of the Lucy species human evolution.         Mrs. Leakey retired from fieldwork in 1983, still smoking small Cuban cigars and accompanied by her beloved Dalmatians. Her honors were many for a woman who never finished high school: medals from the National Geographic Society, the Geological Society of London and the Royal Swedish Academy and many honorary degrees.         She is survived by her three sons, Jonathan, Richard and Philip, all of Kenya, and by 10 grandchildren.       
         Suzanne Railey, a representative for Christie's auction house who was known for her talents as an international hostess, died last weekend in her Manhattan apartment. She was 85.         She died in her sleep, Ed Gallagher, a longtime friend, told Christie's. She had a list of guests for her next dinner party at her bedside, he said.         Ms. Railey, who was known as Sue, lived most of her life in Paris and New York, and had been employed by Christie's in New York since March 1985. She was a public relations ambassador of sorts. Her only  role for the auction house was to hold a black-tie dinner party at her home each month, drawing on her long list of wealthy and influential friends, many with extensive art collections. The idea was to generate good will, and eventually business, for the auction house.         Seated at the tables in her two bedroom apartment in the East 60's  would be diplomats, society doyennes and fashion designers.         ''It all depends who's in town and what I'm thinking about,'' Ms. Railey said during an interview last week.         The jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane, a frequent dinner guest at her house, said: ''You never knew who you'd be seated next to. She always had good people. And her apartment was amazing, with more objects than you could count on every table and mirrors on the ceilings.''         Entertaining and collecting were what she enjoyed.         ''You must talk to me about dinner parties,'' Ms. Railey said, standing at Alexis Gregory's dinner party on Dec. 2, clutching a black pocketbook with a big white clock on top. ''I love them so much. It's just so much more attractive to entertain at home. You can actually sit and talk.''         Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's, said, ''Her apartment was filled with all these treasures of Europe.'' She collected portraits from the French Revolutionary period, miniatures and African works of art, and also had a large collection of letter seals.         She was born Suzanne Rosenberg in Rochester. Her family owned a department store. As a young girl she traveled to Manhattan, Washington and Paris with her parents, said David Granger, a longtime friend.         She lived in Manhattan during part of her 20's with an uncle, Ed Goodman, who owed Finchley's, a men's clothing store. Mr. Granger said, ''And she did what popular young girls do, she traveled and went to parties.''         Then she moved to Washington,  where she started Overcoats for Britain, a program shipping coats to England during World War II.         In 1950, she married Howard Barclay Railey, a businessman who was attached to the American Embassy in Paris. For the next 33 years, she lived and entertained in ''a romantic apartment overlooking the Seine in Paris,'' said Ethel de Croisset, a close friend who lives in Paris.         ''She was a born brilliant hostess,'' she said. ''She was always friends with all the ambassadors.'' When her husband died, Ms. Railey moved back to Manhattan and began working for Christie's.         She is survived by two stepsons.

         Rebecca Drucker Bernstien, a journalist, critic and feminist who was a fixture in New York City literary circles from 1910 to 1950, died of heart failure on Dec. 28. A resident of Gramercy Park for the last 45 years, she was 105.         Mrs. Bernstien, who emigrated to the city from Russia when she was 3 and who  grew up on the Lower East Side and in Brooklyn, was closely associated with a group of artists and writers who rose to prominence before World War II, including those in the Algonquin Round Table.         Beginning in 1912, when she began working as a secretary and reader at The American Magazine and met such writers as John Reed, Ida Tarbell and Walter Lippmann, she combined literary zeal with political advocacy. And as a reporter  at The New York Tribune and an assistant to the critic Heywood Broun, she wrote  book and theater reviews from 1919 to 1922 under the byline Rebecca Drucker and  the initials "R. D."         During the same years, she became a charter member of the Lucy Stone League,  a group founded by Mr. Broun's wife, Ruth Hale, that encouraged married women to keep their names. Its credo was, "My name is the symbol of my identity and must  not be lost."         During the 1930's, she worked as a press agent for several theatrical producers and companies, including Morris Gest and the Ethiopian Theater Company, and founded the League of Women Shoppers, a consumer advocacy group.         Mrs. Bernstien was married for 63 years to Oscar Bernstien, a founder of the  law firm O'Dwyer & Bernstien, who died in 1974. She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Denise Grey, a theater and film star whose career spanned nine decades, died  on Saturday at her home in Paris. She was 99.         Miss Grey, who retired four years ago, came to personify the ideal grandmother to many French audiences. But as a young woman she was a leading can-can dancer at the Folies-Bergere.         She became a hit in Paris theaters after World War I. During World War II she was a member of the Comedie Francaise and also appeared in films. Her best-known movie work was a co-starring role in 1946 in "Le Diable au Corps" ("Devil in the Flesh"), directed by Claude Autant-Lara.         In the 1980's she starred in Claude Pinoteau's film "La Boum" ("The Party") and on the stage in a French version of the play "Arsenic and Old Lace," with the roles of her sister and her daughter played by her daughter and her granddaughter. Both survive her.       
         Josephine Patterson Albright, who flew the mail, shot tigers in India, covered Chicago crime in journalism's colorful "Front Page" era, ran an Illinois dairy and pig farm, bred horses in Wyoming, wrote a column about her family and  helped establish a foundation for journalists, died on Monday at her home in Woodstock, Vt. She was 82.         A daughter, Alice Arlen of Manhattan, said the death was caused by complications after a stroke.         Mrs. Albright was a member of one of the most prominent families in American journalism. Her father, Joseph Medill Patterson, founded The Daily News in New York and helped found The Chicago Tribune. Her aunt, Eleanor Medill Patterson, published The Washington Times-Herald, and her older sister, Alicia Patterson, founded, published and edited Newsday.         Like Alicia, who was seven years her senior, Josephine was told by her father that journalism was not for women. Both proved him wrong.         When Josephine earned her spurs in Chicago in the early 1930's, interviewing  killers like George (Baby Face) Nelson and covering murders and the criminal courts, she worked not for her father's newspaper but for a rival paper, The Chicago Daily News, whose staff members served as models for the characters in the classic Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur comedy "The Front Page."         In "Ladies of the Press" (Harper & Brothers, 1936), Ishbel Ross wrote, "She sailed along successfully under her own steam, in spite of the professional handicap of being born into a noted newspaper family."         Josephine Patterson was born in Libertyville, Ill., on Dec. 2, 1913, and educated at the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va. Although her father disapproved of women in journalism, he did approve of women as pilots, and she got her pilot's license at the age of 16. Before her 18th birthday, she was the  youngest pilot flying the mail route between Chicago and St. Louis.         But Josephine's career as a commercial mail pilot lasted only a few months. At 18, in the midst of her debutante party, she decided to fly with Alicia to India to hunt tigers. Without telling their mother, the two young women hopscotched their way across the world, dancing every night.         When they arrived in India, Josephine, who was later to become an ardent animal rights activist and naturalist, quickly bagged a tiger.         Alicia, who was supposed to shoot the tiger, was angry. She told her sister to stay out of the next hunt. So Josephine went on the next hunt carrying only a book. She was sitting in a tree reading when a leopard bounded up behind her. Josephine threw the book and hit the leopard in the nose. Alicia finished it off.         In 1936, Josephine married Jay Frederick Reeve, a Chicago lawyer she met while covering the courts. At that time she operated a dairy and pig farm that became the Hawthorne-Melody Dairy, a major Illinois enterprise.         In the mid-1940's, after a divorce, she moved to Dubois, Wyo., bought a stallion from an Indian reservation and began raising horses.         In 1946, in Red Lodge, Mont., she married Ivan Albright, an artist of the Chicago school who was known for his realistic paintings. The couple traveled extensively, and Mrs. Albright's travels fostered her enthusiasm for geography.  Near the end of her life, she sponsored a statewide geography bee that was held  in every Vermont school district.         In 1949, Mrs. Albright returned to journalism for three years as the author of a weekly Newsday column, "Life With Junior," which chronicled her foibles and successes in rearing her four children.         In 1963, she and her husband moved to Woodstock, where she obtained a bachelor of arts degree from Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt.         Mr. Albright, whose centennial is to be observed next year with retrospectives at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, died in 1983.         After Alicia Patterson died in 1963, Mrs. Albright helped establish and became a major benefactor of the Alicia Patterson Foundation, which awards fellowships to print journalists and photographers.         Mrs. Albright was also a supporter of the Pentangle Theater in Woodstock, the River City Arts and White River Opera House in White River Junction, Vt., the Hood Museum in Hanover, N.H., and the Art Institute of Chicago. Dartmouth College named her a Lathrop Fellow in honor of her support for its arts collection.         Besides her daughter Alice, Mrs. Albright is survived by another daughter, Dinah Albright Rojek of South Woodstock, Vt.; two sons, Joseph Medill Patterson  Albright of Moscow and Adam Medill Albright of Richmond, Mass., 10 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.       
         Lois Shapiro, a publishing executive who helped handle best sellers like "The World According to Garp" by John Irving, "Faces at the Bottom of the Well" by Derrick Bell and "Passages" by Gail Sheehy, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. She was 57 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a form of bone marrow cancer, her family said.         She was director of publicity and advertising at E. P. Dutton from 1970 to 1982. She then joined Basic Books, a subsidiary of HarperCollins, as associate publisher, senior vice president and director of publicity and rights. She retired last September but remained a consultant.         She was born in Waterbury, Conn., and graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1960.         Ms. Shapiro is survived by her husband, Joel Belsky; a stepson, Peter Belsky  of Manhattan, and three brothers, Martin, of Norwich, Conn., Robert, of Miami, and Norman, o Kingston, R.I.       
         Elizabeth Clementine Miller Tangeman, a philanthropist and matriarch of a leading Indiana industrial family, died on Wednesday at her home in Columbus, Ind. She was 90.         At her death she was chairwoman of the Irwin-Sweeney-Miller Foundation of Columbus, a major regional donor to the arts, Christian education, social services, child welfare and community development. A family foundation, it reported grants of more than $1.65 million in the 1992 fiscal year.         In 1919, the Miller family founded the Cummins Engine Company of Columbus, which grew into the world's largest independent maker of diesel engines, with annual revenue of more than $4 billion and a payroll of more than 23,000. The company earned a national reputation for corporate good works, including paying  for renowned architects to design public buildings for Columbus, leading the town to style itself "the Athens of the prairie."         Born in Columbus, Mrs. Tangeman graduated cum laude from Smith College in 1927. She served as a trustee of Butler University, the Christian Theological Seminary and Union Theological Seminary.         She had a lifelong interest in Scouting and was a past director of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. and a trustee of the World Foundation for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. Her dedication to music led her to help establish the Institute of  Sacred Music at Yale University in 1973.         Mrs. Tangeman is survived by a stepson, John T. Tangeman of Kansas City, Mo.; a brother, J. Irwin Miller, the former chairman of Cummins Engine, and a stepgranddaughter. Her husband, Prof. Robert S. Tangeman, died in 1964.       
         Dr. Elizabeth Monroe Boggs, a co-founder and past president of the Association for Retarded Citizens, died on Saturday at Cooper Medical Center in  Camden, N.J. She was 82 and a resident of Hampton, N.J.         She died of injuries sustained on Jan. 21 when she lost control of her car on an icy road near her home, said Dr. Deborah Spitalnik, a close friend and colleague.         Dr. Boggs, who became known around the country as the First Lady of the A.R.C., was active as a volunteer and advocate for four decades.  She served as  president of the organization in 1958, when it was known as the National Association for Retarded Children.         Since it was founded in 1950, the association, which now has its headquarters in Arlington, Tex., has grown to about 140,000 members, 46 state chapters and a  staff of 45. The membership consists of parents, professional workers and advocates for the mentally retarded, with the mission of promoting services, research, public understanding and legislation.         Dr. Boggs was the principal architect of Federal legislation that expanded the definition of disabilities to include people with physical handicaps. Previously, certain Federal programs served only people who were mentally retarded. She also helped develop legislation in Trenton that led to turning the New Jersey Division of Mental Retardation into the Division of Developmental Disabilities, again benefiting a broader population.         President John F. Kennedy named her to a Federal panel that studied the problems of mental retardation and advised on what action to take. The recommendations led to legisLation.         Dr. Boggs, who described herself as a "nonprofessional mover and shaker," was born in Cleveland and graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1935.         Her chosen field was theoretical chemistry. She went to England and received  a Ph.D. from Cambridge University. She began her career in World War II as a researcher at what is now Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.         She married Dr. Fitzhugh Boggs, a fellow scientist, in 1941 and gave birth to their son, David, in 1945. It soon became apparent that David had sustained brain damage during a severe illness he suffered in infancy.         She took courses in special education and joined with other parents to organize on the county and then the state level. David's mental retardation left him with only limited use of his arms and legs, but Dr. Boggs and her husband tried to care for him at home. When they had to place him in a residential center in 1952, she made a hard choice between the laboratory coat and the mantle of public advocate.         Dr. Boggs is survived by David, a resident of the Hunterdon Developmental Center in Clinton, N.J. Fitzhugh Boggs died in 1971.       
         Irene Arnold, a lawyer and teacher who spent her life in the service of the retarded and other victims of circumstance, like war and persecution, died on Jan. 4 at the DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan. A Clinton resident, she was 88.         Mrs. Arnold was the founder of Retarded Infants Services, a nonprofit agency  that she headed from 1956 to 1972. The Manhattan agency, which has since been renamed the Center for Family Support, provides services and volunteers to help  families keep seriously retarded and handicapped children in the home, a novel approach at the center's founding.         Mrs. Arnold later expanded services to find foster parents for children whose families could not care for them.         After leaving the agency in 1972, Mrs. Arnold worked for the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. In 1977, she joined the New York State Department of Mental Retardation as a human-rights officer.         Finally, as a hearing officer, she listened to the "not in my backyard" objections from neighbors over the placing of group homes for the retarded. She  retired in 1980.         Irene Lowy was born on the Lower East Side and graduated from New York University. While teaching high school English, she attended Brooklyn Law School at night. With her law degree, she opened a small practice, but had little enthusiasm for cases of money-minded clients. She found her calling during the London Blitz in World War II, when she did the legal work that took hundreds of  children away from the air raids to safety in the United States on behalf of Eleanor Roosevelt's Committee for the Care of European Children.         She subsequently went to Europe working for the American Friends Service Committee, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Joint Distribution Committee. She joined teams of pediatricians and social workers who collected uprooted children and sent them to the United States.         She also rescued children from Buchenwald and recounted her experiences at the camps in a memoir in the collection of the Holocaust Museum in Washington.         Mrs. Arnold's husband, Dr. Newton Arnold, died in 1979. They had no children.       
         Liz Williamson, a jazz dance authority, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Wonza Sinclair.         Ms. Williamson performed with Alvin Ailey's first company in 1958, dancing in the premiere of "Blues Suite," which started Ailey's choreographic career in  New York. She also danced with Donald McKayle and the Merry-Go-Rounders, and performed as a solo artist. She appeared on television, in films and in musicals, including City Center revivals of "Finian's Rainbow" and "Carmen Jones."         Ms. Williamson was born in Winston-Salem, N.C.She received a bachelor's degree in romance languages from Radcliffe College and a master's degree in dance from New York University. She wrote about the history of jazz dancing and  taught around the world, at schools and festivals that included the International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss., in 1986 and 1990. In 1973, she was the first artist-in-residence at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, where she choreographed "The Many Faces of Jazz," a piece with a cast of 65 dancers. She continued to teach up until her death.         Ms. Williamson's husband, William Elliott Williamson, died in 1991.         In addition to her daughter, of Brooklyn, she is survived by a grandson.       
         Dorothea J. Steindl, who espoused Jewish causes for more than four decades, died on Monday at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y., of cancer. She was 71.         Mrs. Steindl was born Dorothea J. Kahn in Far Rockaway, Queens. In 1953, she  joined the Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training, which assists Jewish people around the world. She helped organize its White Plains chapter and was a vice president of the Westchester Region and a national board member.         Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, she lobbied for Jewish emigration from the country as a member of the Greater New York Conference for Soviet Jewry. More recently, she worked to help Jewish immigrants settle in New York.         Mrs. Steindl is survived by a daughter, Ethel J. Steindl of Manhattan, and her companion, Ira Adler of Scarsdale. Her husband, Emanuel Steindl, a Westchester real-estate developer, died in 1980.       
         Lady Caroline Blackwood, a writer of wry, macabre novels and essays, and a beguiling Anglo-Irish aristocrat who married the painter Lucian Freud and the poet Robert Lowell, died yesterday in the Mayfair Hotel in Manhattan, where she  stayed the last few weeks while she was ill. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Ivana Lowell.         She published nine books and was best known and much admired in Britain. Among her works was "The Stepdaughter," a short epistolary novel about an abusive woman abandoned by her husband and left with his hideous daughter. Another novel, "The Fate of Mary Rose," was about an increasingly deranged mother's fatal obsession with her daughter's safety.         Her most recent book, "The Last of the Duchess," was an eccentric, Kafkaesque account of her vain attempt to visit the ailing Duchess of Windsor. It revolved  mostly around the Duchess's powerful lawyer, Suzanne Blum, portrayed in the book as obsessed with her client to the point of erotic fantasy.         British critics noted the "brilliant irony" and "rather brilliant bitchiness" of her writing, comparing it with the work of Muriel Spark and Iris Murdoch, among others. In her prose and in person, she exhibited a razor-sharp wit and offbeat sensibility. A dramatic woman, delicately built, intense and vulnerable, she was a famous beauty in her youth, and in later years remained striking for her extraordinary eyes, which Mr. Freud made into giant spheres in his hypnotic  portraits.         One portrait played a curious role in her life, as she related in an interview last year. During the 1950's, when she and Mr. Freud were living in Paris, "Lucian got a call out of nowhere from a mistress of Picasso's who asked  him if he could come round and paint her," she said. "The woman wanted to make Picasso jealous. Lucian very politely said maybe he could paint her portrait later, but not now because he happened to be in the midst of doing his wife's portrait."         That picture, she said, was "Girl in Bed," a work that years later also figured in the death of Robert Lowell, her third husband. Their marriage was in  tatters when, the story goes, Lowell left her in Ireland and flew to New York City. When his taxi arrived at his apartment on West 67th Street, the driver found Lowell slumped over. A doorman summoned Elizabeth Hardwick, the writer and editor, whom Lowell had left to marry Lady Caroline; she happened to live in the same apartment house. Ms. Hardwick opened the taxi door to be confronted with her former husband's corpse. He was clutching "Girl in Bed."         Lady Caroli'e moved amo'g several worlds: from the insular Anglo-Irish upper  classes, which she largely rejected for the smart set of postwar England and then for the liberal intelligentsia of New York City in the 1960's and 70's. During much of the last 35 years, she lived in the United States, splitting her time in recent years between an apartment in Manhattan and a house in Sag Harbor, L.I., that once belonged to President Chester A. Arthur.         Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood was born in London on July 16, 1931.  She was descended on her father's side from the great 18th-century dramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan and was a Guinness on her mother's side. (She liked to joke that she found stout undrinkable.) She grew up in the ancestral stone mansion, Clandeboye, in County Down in Northern Ireland.         Her great-grandfather, Lord Dufferin, was an eminent Victorian rumored to have been Disraeli's illegitimate son. Queen Victoria made him Viceroy of India, where he used to sit on his throne, fanned by peacock feathers. "Kipling loved my great-grandfather and wrote lots of very bad poems to him," Lady Caroline said. "He had a fatal effect on poets."         Her mother, Maureen, the Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, is a flamboyant figure in London who, according to one newspaper account, gave a black eye to Sir Oswald Mosley, the English Fascist, after he made a pass at her in Antibes.  Her father, Basil, the Marquess, was a friend of Evelyn Waugh and part of the circle described in "Brideshead Revisited." He was killed in Burma during World  War II, when Caroline was 12.         Like other women of her class, she skipped college; she moved to London and worked for Claud Cockburn, the influential left-wing journalist. She recalled meeting Mr. Freud at that time at a party memorable because the painter Francis  Bacon caused a row when he hooted down Princess Margaret, who had just started singing "Let's Do It." She and Mr. Freud then became part of the group that included Bacon, Cyril Connolly and the other artists and writers who gathered nightly to drink at the Gargoyle and Colony Clubs.         When her marriage to Mr. Freud ended in 1956, she installed herself at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. She got a tiny part in the television series "Have Gun Will Travel." Stephen Spender asked her to write an article for Encounter magazine about California beatniks, and it was ' sendup that launched  her writing career.         She next moved to New York and married Israel Citkowitz, an American composer and pianist, and a student of Aaron Copland, 20 years her senior. They were divorced in 1972, when she married Lowell, but they remained close.         During the next years she endured a series of Job-like catastrophes: the death of Citkowitz; Lowell's crippling manic depression and early death; the death from AIDS of her brother, Sheridan, to whom she was very close; the death of her eldest daughter, Natalya, after a drug overdose, and her own bout with cervical cancer, for which she had an operation that left her in constant pain.         Throughout, she maintained her dark humor and creatively transformed her experiences into her novels and essays. "I think it's partly Irish," she once explained. "Irish people are very funny but have this tragic sense.         "As Cal wrote," she added, referring to Lowell, "if there's light at the end  of the tunnel, it's the light of the oncoming train."         In addition to her daughter Ivana, of Manhattan, she is survived by her mother, of London; a sister, Lady Perdita Blackwood, of Ulster; another daughter, Evgenia Citkowitz of Los Angeles, and a son, Sheridan Lowell of Manhattan.       
         Eva Hart was 7 years old and bound for a new life in Canada when her father woke her in the middle of the night, carried her outside in a blanket and told her, "Hold Mummy's hand and be a good girl."         It was the last thing he ever said to her, and she never saw him again. Later that night, wide awake and clinging to her mother in a lifeboat, the little girl watched as the Titanic rose straight up on her bow and plunged to the bottom of  the sea, carrying her father and more than 1,500 other passengers and crew members to their deaths in the North Atlantic.         As one of only 705 Titanic passengers who survived, Eva Hart never forgot what she had seen and heard that night. When she died on Wednesday at a hospice  in London at the age of 91, she was regarded as last link of living memory with  the maritime disaster that rocked the world on April 15, 1912.         Of the eight remaining survivors, seven were too young at the time to know what was happening, according to Karen Kamuda of the Titanic Historical Society  in Springfield, Mass., and one, nearing her 100th birthday, no longer remembers.         But even during Mrs. Hart's last years, her memory remained vivid and chilling.         "I saw that ship sink," she said in a 1993 interview. "I never closed my eyes. I didn't sleep at all. I saw it, I heard it, and nobody could possibly forget it."         There have been shipwrecks with greater loss of life before and after the Titanic, but none have clamped such a chilling grip on the popular imagination.         That is partly because the Titanic was on her maiden voyage carrying many prominent and wealthy passengers, but it is mainly because of a well-publicized  exercise in hubris.         The White Star Line had proclaimed the Titanic the "unsinkable ship," a claim that caused Miss Hart's mother such apprehension that even as they walked up the gangplank, her daughter later recalled, she renewed her warning that calling a ship unsinkable was "flying in the face of God." She was so convinced of impending doom, her daughter later maintained, that she slept during the day and stayed awake in her cabin at night fully dressed.         The iceberg that sliced the Titanic's hull below the waterline belied White Star's claims. The network of massive bulkheads that supposedly made the Titanic unsinkable had not been extended high enough. Water gushing into one compartment simply flowed over the top of the bulkheads.         Returning to England, where her mother remarried, Miss Hart was plagued with  nightmares until, after her mother's death when she was 23, she confronted her fears head on, returning to sea and locking herself in a cabin for four days until the nightmares went away.         She held several jobs, becoming a professional singer in Australia, working as a Conservative Party organizer and serving as a magistrate in England. She described her life in a 1994 autobiography, "In the Shadow of the Titanic."         Until recent years, Miss Hart chose not to talk about the disaster, but when  she did open up, she was outspoken, denouncing efforts to salvage artifacts from the Titanic as "grave robbing," and excoriating White Star officials for failing to provide enough lifeboats.         "If a ship is torpedoed, that's war," she once said. "If it strikes a rock in a storm, that's nature. But just to die because there weren't enough lifeboats,  that's ridiculous."         Her anger was fueled by memory.         "I can remember the colors, the sounds, everything," she said. "The worst thing I can remember are the screams."         But even worse, she conceded, was the silence that followed.         "It seemed as if once everybody had gone, drowned, finished, the whole world  was standing still. There was nothing, just this deathly, terrible silence in the dark night with the stars overhead."         Miss Hart, who never married, leaves no immediate family. The remaining Titanic survivors are Edith Brown Haisman, Barbara West and Millzina Dean, all of England; Michael Navratil and Louise Laroche of France, and Eleanor Shuman, Winnifred Tongerloo and Lillian Asplund of the United States.       
         Maria A. Rudzinska, a protozoologist who used electron microscopy to uncover  the eating habits of the parasite that causes malaria, died last Friday at her home in Manhattan. Dr. Rudzinska, who was an emeritus professor of parasitology  at Rockefeller University, was 92.         She came to Rockefeller in 1951, at a time when the use of the electron microscope in biology was in its infancy. She trained with the cell biologists Keith Porter and George Palade and then joined the laboratory of William Trager, a leading parasitologist.         It was in Dr. Trager's lab that she used the microscope to show that the malaria protozoa, a one-celled organism that enters the human body through mosquito bites, consumes red blood cells by ingesting portions of them into parts of its cell called vacuoles.         "It is a common way for cells to feed," said Dr. Trager, now an emeritus professor of parasitology at Rockefeller. "But no one had guessed that this was  the way malaria parasites feed."         Dr. Trager said her work also confirmed that the parasite entered the blood cell before eating it. "There was some controversy as to whether the parasite was inside the cell or not," he said. "At the level of the light microscope, it  was not easy to be sure."         Her research helped scientists find ways to treat the disease, he said.         The malaria parasite was not Dr. Rudzinska's favorite protozoa, however, Dr.  Trager said. That distinction fell to an organism called tokophrya. Unlike most  single-cell organisms, which live a rather mundane life restricted largely to dividing, tokophrya, she discovered, has specific life cycles.         "As a baby, it's a swimming little thing," Dr. Trager said. "But then it settles down, forms a stalk, and metamorphoses into quite a different-looking creature." It also has a reproductive cycle, and a period of old age.         "The thing she found was, if you give it a lot to eat, this process of aging  was greatly accelerated," Dr. Trager said. Overfed, tokophrya grew old faster and died earlier. The organism has been used by researchers who study the aging  process.         Dr. Rudzinska, who was so identified with the protozoa that she once received a post card at the laboratory addressed only to "Dr. Tokophrya," occasionally had difficulty finding specimens, which proliferate in fresh water ponds. After  one steady source on Long Island dried up, she found some closer to home -- in a fountain on the Rockefeller campus.         Dr. Rudzinska became an emeritus professor in 1975, but was still active in the lab. In her later years, she worked with Harvard researchers to discover how the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is carried by deer ticks.         She was born in Dabrowa, Poland, and earned advanced degrees in biology and zoology from the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. During World War II, she taught at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lvov, and participated in underground  teaching during the Nazi occupation.         After the war she came to the United States with her husband, Alexander Rudzinski, an international lawyer who was a member of the Polish delegation to  the fledgling United Nations. When the Communists took over the Polish Government, however, Mr. Rudzinski resigned, and the couple were granted asylum  in the United States.         Her husband died about five years ago.       
         Elizabeth McCall Cain, a figure in Manhattan's social world who was active in arranging benefits for educational and cultural institutions, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was liver cancer, her brother, Julien L. McCall, said.         Mrs. Cain was on numerous charitable committees, including the Institute of  International Education and the New York Public Library.         She attended Converse College in Spartanburg, S.C., and in 1944, married Arthur A. Houghton Jr., the chairman of Steuben Glass. They divorced in 1972. Two years later, she married Walker O. Cain, an architect.         She is survived by a daughter, Hollister Douglas Houghton of Boca Grande, Fla.; two brothers, Arthur C. McCall of Greenville, S.C., and Julien McCall of Hunting Valley, Ohio. Mr. Houghton died in 1990 and Mr. Cain in 1993.       
         Eleanor Clark, an author best known for the evocative range of her accounts of oystering in Brittany and of the streets of Rome, died on Friday at a retirement home in Boston. She was 82.         Miss Clark, the widow of Robert Penn Warren, was a master stylist whose works won critical acclaim and inspired a devoted private following. Her writings included reviews, essays, children's books and novels.         In a review in The New York Times, Anatole Broyard called a 1975 reissue of  her 1952 book "Rome and the Villa" "perhaps the finest book ever to be written about a city."         But the most telling tributes came from the generations of American and other tourists who followed her steps -- page by dogeared page -- through the city, marveling at each architectural feature that triggered her soaring ruminations on everything from ancient history and early Roman poetry to modern social conditions.         Although she was sometimes described as a travel writer, "Rome and a Villa" is not a traditional travel book. Nor is "The Oysters of Locmariaquer," a somewhat similar book that used oystering in Brittany as a springboard to an excursion through history and culture, and won the 1964 National Book Award for  arts and letters. Each reflected deep scholarship and a lively intuition.         Both in those books and in her norels, including "Baldur's Gate" (1970) and "Camping Out" (1986), Miss Clark seemed especially moved by landscape, an interest that was grounded in her childhood amid the rolling hills around Roxbury, Conn., her daughter, the poet Rosanna Clark, said yesterday.         Born in Los Angeles, Miss Clark was a descendant of early New England settlers. Her father was a mining engineer, and she seems to have inherited her  literary and scholarly bent from her mother, a Vassar graduate steeped in comparative literature.         Miss Clark also attended Vassar and spent much of her time during her college years on visits to Manhattan. She later became a conspicuous part of the city's  intellectual left, writing for The Partisan Review, The New Republic and The Nation. She was viewed as independent-minded with a youthful social conscience and regarded herself for a time as "a Trotskyite sympathizer."         During a trip to Mexico in 1937 she became a translator for Trotsky and was married to one of his secretaries for a brief time.         During World War II she worked for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, interviewing French and Italian diplomats. It was at a party at Katherine Anne Porter's home in the spring of 1944 that she met Mr. Warren, then in the last stages of an unhappy first marriage.         Although she recounted later that she had pursued him, once confiding that it had taken all her guile to get a simple good-night kiss, at the first meeting he seems to have been more taken with her than she with him.  She left the party with one of his friends, the poet Denis Devlin, and, as Mr. Warren later railed  in recounting the meeting to his children, "a bunch of other drunken Irishmen."         After their marriage in 1952, they traveled widely and found a formula for pursuing their separate literary careers. Working in different studies of the converted 17th-century barn that served as their home in Fairfield, Conn., they  wrote from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M. daily, she using the typewriter in the companionship of their cat, he writing in longhand accompanied by their dog.         When Miss Clark was stricken with macular degeneration and almost totally lost her eyesight (a setback described in "Eyes, Etc.," her 1977 memoir), her husband began reading to her at night. He died in 1989.         In addition to her daughter, of Needham, Mass., she is survived by a son, Gabriel, a sculptor, of Wood River Junction, R.I., and four grandchildren.
