         Selma Tamber Eisenman, a Broadway producer and manager, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack, said a nephew, Martin Poll of Los Angeles.         Ms. Tamber produced several Broadway and Off Broadway shows, including "Boccaccio 70" and "Viva Madison Avenue." She also managed artists like Hanya Holm, the choreographer of "Kiss Me, Kate," "My Fair Lady" and "Camelot," and helped further the careers of the composers and lyricists Richard Adler and Stephen Sondheim.         Ms. Tamber was born in New York City. In the 1930's, she supervised various Broadway musicals as the head of the department of composers and arrangers for the music publisher Chappell-T. B. Harms, where she worked with composers like George Gershwin and Cole Porter. She later became the executive assistant to the producers Herman Levin, Lemuel Ayres and Saint Subber.         Ms. Tamber is survived by another nephew, Alvin Poll, of Cranbury, N.J., and four grandnephews.       
         Laura Mondadori, a member of a prominent Italian publishing family, died on Wednesday at her home in Milan, Italy. She was 67 years old.         The cause of death was not available.         Mrs. Mondadori, who was known as Mimma, was the daughter of the late Arnoldo Mondadori, who founded a publishing empire in Italy 80 years ago. She was a significant shareholder in the holding company that controls Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A., Italy's largest publisher of books, magazines and newspapers, including the influential daily La Repubblica. She was also president of the Arnoldo and Alberto Mondadori Foundation, which supports writers and intellectuals.         She is survived by her son, Leonardo, of Milan; a sister, Cristina, also of Milan, and three grandchildren.       
         Marie Jastrow, who wrote two critically praised books describing immigrant life in turn-of-the-century New York, died at her home in Tucson, Ariz., on March 30. She was 93 years old.         Mrs. Jastrow was 82 when her first book, "A Time to Remember: Growing Up in New York Before the Great War," was published in 1979 by W. W. Norton. It was followed in 1986 by a sequel, also published by Norton, "Looking Back: The American Dream Through Immigrant Eyes 1907-1918."         Reviewing "A Time to Remember" in The New York Times Book Review, Caroline Seebohm wrote: "This kind of document grows more and more precious with the years. Her vivid descriptions evoke more than just a lost age -- they evoke a certain feeling for America that cannot quite be duplicated."         Mrs. Jastrow was born in the Prussian city of Danzig, which is now Gdansk, Poland. She lived in Yugoslavia before moving to the United States with her family in 1907, at the age of 10. They settled in the Yorkville area of Manhattan.         In a 1979 interview Mrs. Jastrow recalled: "We enjoyed Yorkville when it was a melting pot for immigrants from all over Europe. It was a wonderful time. People were poor in money, but no one felt poor otherwise.         "We lived on East 81st Street. Fleischmann's Vienna Bakery was next door. It was managed by Raoul Fleischmann, who later became the publisher of The New Yorker. P.S. 96 was across the street."         Mrs. Jastrow said she had been writing since she was a young girl, but had always received rejection slips. "I concentrated on short stories, which I must say are very good," she said.         She is survived by her son, Robert, an astonomer, author and professor of earth sciences at Dartmouth College; a daughter, Dorothy Heller of Creston, N.C., and a sister, Yolanda Pesce, of Tucson.       
         Dame Peggy Ashcroft, an actress who was in the forefront of British theater for more than half a century, died yesterday in London. She was 83 years old.         She suffered a stroke on May 23 and was unconscious in the Royal Free Hospital since then, a spokeswoman for the hospital said.         Dame Peggy was in the Old Vic company in the early 1930's, frequently appearing with John Gielgud in the 1930's and 40's. She often performed in the West End of London in the 1950's and with the Royal Court, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1956 and in 1962 she became the first British actress to have a theater -- the Ashcroft, in her hometown, Croydon -- named after her in her lifetime.         When she was in her mid-70's Dame Peggy won her greatest international acclaim from roles involving two visits to India. She played a saintly, enigmatic Englishwoman in David Lean's film of E. M. Forster's novel "A Passage to India" and then was cast as a doubting former missionary in a television mini-series, "The Jewel in the Crown," based on Paul Scott's "Raj Quartet."         She won a 1984 Academy Award as best supporting actress for the film; the New York Film Critics Circle voted her best actress. The two performances brought her Britain's top film and television awards. She had previously won a string of awards as the finest actress on the British stage, and in April she won a special Laurence Olivier Award, London's major theatrical prize, for lifetime achievement in the theater. A Juliet to Remember         Dame Peggy was praised as a natural actress who projected an inner serenity and moral gravity. She illumined all of Shakespeare's young leading women and was hailed as the finest Juliet of her generation, artfully attuning her performances to Gielgud and Olivier versions of Romeo and Mercutio as the actors alternated in the roles throughout a season.         Detractors called some of her early performances too genteel and cool, too English bourgeois, but over the decades she displayed increasing versatility in plays by Shaw, Sheridan, Chekhov, Wilde and Ibsen. With uncommon ease she worked closely with new generations of theater people and in later years played Shakespearean matrons and roles created by Edward Albee, Marguerite Duras, Harold Pinter and Beckett.         Her talents included portraying the rejected, the lonely and the oppressed with unsentimental sympathy. As Winnie in Beckett's "Happy Days," she was required to spend the first half of the performance buried up to her waist, the second half to her neck. It's "the greatest part ever written," she said, "nearer to Everywoman than any other I can think of, and like climbing Everest to perform."         In approaching hundreds of roles, including 10 leads in a season at the Old Vic, she tirelessly sought psychological truths. "Acting," she said in 1985, "is a mysterious business, so complicated, so tender a subject, there are no rules, and I think one works instinctively."  'Shimmering Radiance'         Defining her art in "Peggy Ashcroft," a 1988 biography, the critic Michael Billington cited her ear for language, her emotional identification with characters and avoidance of vulgarity and affectation.         Sir John Gielgud spoke of the actress's "shimmering radiance and a kind of forthright, trusting quality." The director Peter Hall said she maintained in old age an "extraordinary immediacy and passionate naivete." Harold Pinter said, "This flame of life she possesses informs all she does."         Dame Peggy appeared in only a few movies. Her most memorable early one was a vignette in Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 thriller, "The 39 Steps," as a farmer's wife who bravely aids the hero (Robert Donat).         In making films she missed the theater's long, searching rehearsals. The problem with films, she said, "is that you have to imagine everything in sufficient detail before you begin."         "With the theater," she added, "there is time to try things out. With filming, it is hit or miss."         She said appearing in films was "instant acting" because a film actor might have to begin at the end of a scene or a movie and not be able to build a role. "Also, you're in the hands of a director and an editor who can cut and shape, and you have no idea how," she said. "And, of course, there's no sharing with an audience, no rapport."         Dame Peggy said she had no desire to retire. "Just a rest after the rather full years I had in India," she said in 1985. "Then I'll wait and see what television or film or the theater bring."         She cherished privacy and granted few interviews, once explaining gently, "I'm not interested in myself, very." But she was outspoken in protesting injustices and inhumaneness, at home or abroad. She criticized apartheid in South Africa and protested the sentencing of a Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovsky, and political arrests in Czechoslovakia.         Edith Margaret Emily Ashcroft was born on Dec. 22, 1907, in Croydon, a London suburb, to William Worsley Ashcroft, an estate appraiser, and the former Violetta Maud Bernheim. Her father was killed in World War I when she was 10 and her mother died when she was 18, leaving her elder brother, Edward, as her only close relative.         She studied at the Woodford School in Croydon and after discovering "it was very exciting to become someone else," she said, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Her varied roles included Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello in 1930, stardom as Juliet and Shakespeare's other golden girls, as she called them, and title roles in Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," John Drinkwater's "Mary Stuart" and Arthur Schnitzler's "Fraulein Elsa."         A 1989 biography of Paul Robeson by Martin Bauml Duberman revealed that Dame Peggy and the actor had had an affair during the run of "Othello," and quoted her as saying, "How could one not fall in love in such a situation with such a man?"         Later roles included an alcoholic mother in "Edward, My Son," in both London and New York; an unloved spinster in "The Heiress," leading parts in Brecht's "Good Woman of Setzuan," Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and "Rosmersholm" and the 10-hour tour de force as Margaret of Anjou in the Royal Shakespeare Company's "Wars of the Roses."         Dame Peggy was married and divorced three times. She is survived by two children, Nicholas, a director, and Eliza, by her third husband, Jeremy Hutchinson, a lawyer. Her previous husbands were Rupert Hart-Davis, a publisher, and Theodore Komisarjevsky, a director.       
         Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter who was married to the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure after suffering from lymphoma, a family spokesman said.         For the last 40 years, she had worked for charitable causes, including the Girl Scouts, the Endowment Fund of Mount Vernon and the Abigail Adams Smith Museum in Manhattan.         In 1946, she became a reporter at The Washington Times-Herald, now defunct. She wrote a sociey column, "Under My Hat," and later wrote a syndicated column, "From the Capital." She was also a commentator for the Columbia Broadcasting System.         She and William Randolph Hearst Jr., chairman of the Hearst Corporation, were married in 1948. Her first marriage, to Igor Cassini, the designer, ended in divorce.         Mrs. Hearst, who left the newspaper business in 1956, wrote "The Horses of San Simeon," (San Simeon Press, 1985), a book about breeding and raising horses.         She was a graduate of the College of Notre Dame of Maryland in Baltimore.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, William Randolph Hearst 3d, publisher of The San Francisco Examiner, and Austin, of Manhattan, vice president of Hearst Entertainment and Syndication, a division of the Hearst Corporation, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.         Correction:  June 25, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter whose husband is the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, misstated the occupation of her first husband, Igor Cassini. He was a newspaper columnist. (Oleg Cassini, the designer, is Igor Cassini's brother.)       
         Nedda Casson Anders, a publisher and writer who edited the first Weight Watchers cookbook, died on Wednesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 70 years old, her family said, and lived in Manhattan and Tamarac, Fla.         Her son, Richard, said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Anders, who was born in the Bronx and grew up in Brooklyn, first worked for M. Barrows publishing, where she wrote and edited books on cooking and crafts. In the mid-1950's she and her husband, George Anders, who died in 1987, began their own publishing company, Hearthside Press, which specialized in works on cooking, crafts and gardening.         Among the books she wrote were "Complete Cookbook for Infra-Red Broiler and Rotisserie," published by M. Barrows, and "Casserole Specialties" and "Chafing-Dish Specialties," both for Hearthside. Reviewers praised her recipes as clearly written and easy to follow.         But her biggest success was the editing of "The Weight Watchers Program Cookbook" by Jean Nidetch, which sold millions of copies.         In addition to her son, Richard, of Boston, she is survived by two sisters, Judy Halpern of Fresh Meadows, Queens, and Toby Halpern of Malverne, L.I.; a brother, Walter Casson of Rockville Centre, L.I.; and two grandchildren.       
         Natalia Ginzburg, an author commonly ranked with Umberto Eco as one of Italy's most important writers of fiction, died on Monday at her home in Rome. She was 75 years old.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for her publisher, Einaudi, said yesterday.         Although once dismissed as a minor writer because of her preoccupation with family life, Miss Ginzburg had seen her six works of fiction, a play ("I Married You for the Fun of It"), essays, a biography of the 19th-century novelist Alessandro Manzoni and translations of Flaubert and Proust recognized in recent years as the creations of a major artist.         Miss Ginzburg was born in Palermo, Sicily. Her mother was Catholic; her father, a professor of anatomy, Jewish. Her formative years were spent in Turin. There, she met and married Leone Ginzburg, a teacher of Russian and a leader of the anti-fascist intellectuals who in the late 1930's formed the core group of the Einaudi publishing house.         From 1940 to 1943, the Ginzburgs were confined to a small village east of Rome because of their Jewish heritage. It was during this time that Natalia Ginzburg published her first book, "The Road to the City," using the pseudonym Alessandra Torninparte in order to circumvent laws restricting the activities of Jews. 'I Got to Know Grief'         In 1943, her husband was arrested and imprisoned for anti-fascist activities. His death in prison a few months later was never explained by the authorities. "I got to know grief very well -- a real, irremedial and incurable grief that shattered my life," she recalled in an essay written in 1986, "and when I tried to put it together again I realized that my life had become irreconcilable with what had gone before. Only my vocation remained unchanged. At first I hated it, it disgusted me, but I knew very well that I would end up returning to it, and that it would save me."         After the war, Miss Ginzburg returned to Einaudi as an editor and continued to write. She won several Italian literary prizes and gained international recognition with the publication of "Voices in the Evening," a novel (1961), and an autobiography, "Family Sayings" (1963).         In "Family Sayings," she mingled her family story -- dominated by her impatient scientist father and ever-cheerful mother -- with the events of Italian history in the period between the two world wars. In a preface to the book, Miss Ginzburg wrote: "Possibly some people may not be pleased to find themselves described in the book under their own names. To such I have nothing to say."         Her biography of Manzoni, which Mary McCarthy called an "original and engrossing work," stood the old-style heroic genre on its head. While admiring Manzoni's literary achievements, her study also lays bare Manzoni's shocking indifference to his children.  Taking Sides in an Adoption         Miss Ginzburg's last book created an uproar. "Serena Cruz, or True Justice" recounts an explosive adoption case that divided Italy in 1989. In the dispute, a Filipino girl was taken from her adoptive Italian parents on grounds that the adoption was illegal. Miss Ginzburg strongly sided with the adoptive parents, arguing that their nurturing the child for 14 months should have entitled them to keep her.         In a profile of Miss Ginzburg in The New York Times Magazine in 1990, the American writer Mary Gordon recalled having asked her to account for the quality of understatement that characterizes her work.         "I was the little sister," Miss Ginzburg replied. "When you are the youngest in the family, people are always telling you to hurry up, to get to the point, say what you mean. I think that's why I write the way I do."         Asked what kind of writer she would have become had her life not been disrupted by the war, she told Ms. Gordon: "Of course I wrote about the war. I was formed by the war because that was what happened to me. I think of a writer as a river: you reflect what passes before you. The trees pass, and the houses; you reflect what is there."         "I write about families," she continued, "because that is where everything starts, where the germs grow." Likened to Chekhov         The subtlety and economy of Miss Ginzburg's style has prompted critics to liken her to Chekhov. "When I write something I usually think it is very important and that I am a very fine writer," she wrote in an essay for The New York Times Book Review in 1986. "But there is one corner of my mind in which I know very well what I am, which is a small, a very small writer."         In 1983, Miss Ginzburg was elected to the Italian Parliament as a representative of a left-wing party unaffiliated with the Communists. She served only one term. "I did it because I like to learn about things," she told Ms. Gordon. "I like to learn about them so that I can write about them."         In 1950, she married Gabriele Baldini, a professor of English literature at the University of Rome. He died in 1969. She is survived by her four children, Alessandra, Carlo, Leone and Susanna. Funeral services are to be held tomorrow.       
         Doris Lilly, the author of "How to Marry a Millionaire" and a former newspaper society columnist, died on Wednesday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Kurt von Schuschnigg, a friend and the executor of her estate.         Ms. Lilly was a witty participant in the social whirl of charity balls and nightclubs she featured in her books and as a gossip columnist for The New York Post, the McNaught Syndicate and WPIX television in New York. An Inspiration to Capote         "If it were true that money grew on trees, all my friends would be married to apes," she said. She once conceded that her columns were sometimes "silly" and that the people she wrote about were sometimes "shallow." But, she said, "they're pleasant and they smell good and they eat well and drink good wines, and that's all right."         Friends said she was the inspiration for the Holly Golightly character in Truman Capote's book "Breakfast at Tiffany's."         Her own first book, "How to Marry a Millionaire" (Putnam, 1951), became a hit movie starring Marilyn Monroe. Later, doing the updated "How to Marry a Billionaire" (Delacorte, 1984), she said: "A million dollars isn't much money these days. You can't even get a decent house for that."         Ms. Lilly's often provocatively titled books included "How to Make Love in Five Languages" (Bobbs-Merrill, 1965), "Glamor Girl" (Woodhill, 1977, with Robin Moore as co-author) and "Those Fabulous Greeks: Onassis, Niarchos and Livanos (Cowles, 1970). 'Never Fond of Poverty'         "She was never fond of poverty," wrote Cindy Adams, the New York Post columnist. Remarking on Ms. Lilly's skills in meeting rich people, Ms. Adams wrote that "when the rest of us were in camel's hair," Ms. Lilly received a prized sable coat from a male admirer "who was a little bit married."         Ms. Lilly herself never married anyone, millionaire or otherwise. But she did socialize with the famous and powerful. Even in her youth as a contract actress for Cecil B. DeMille, she had an eye for up and coming people. She dated Ronald Reagan when he was between marriages to Jane Wyman and Nancy Davis.         Three years ago, two letters that Mr. Reagan sent Ms. Lilly were auctioned at Sotheby's to Malcolm Forbes, the publisher, for $4,400. She said that "these letters were written during the period we saw each other, which went on for three years."         Ms. Lilly, who was born in South Pasadena, Calif., attended public schools in Santa Monica. She had a continuing magazine career, working variously as beauty editor of Town and Country and a contributor to McCall's, Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and, at the time of her death, Avenue.         She was a columnist for The Post from 1968 to 1978, and a commentator for WPIX from 1974 to 1977. She was also a frequent guest on the Merv Griffin Show and television panel shows.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Helene Mullins Johnson, a poet, died on Oct. 26 at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Gerald Phelan, a friend.         Mrs. Johnson first had her poems published in The Pagan, a Greenwich Village magazine, in the 1920's. After Thornton Wilder introduced her to his publisher, Harper's published her first novel, "Convent Girl," and her first volume of poems, "Earthbound," in 1929. Her verse also appeared in The New York Times, The New Yorker, Commonweal, Saturday Review and other publications. Her final collection of poems, "Mirrored Walls," was published in 1970.         There are no survivors.
