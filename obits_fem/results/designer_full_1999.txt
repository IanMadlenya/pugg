         Clare Potter, a leading American fashion designer of the 1930's and 40's known for imaginative use of color and simplicity of line, died Jan. 5 at her home in Fort Ann, N.Y. She was 95.         Along with Claire McCardell and Tina Leser, Ms. Potter was one of the designers credited with inventing American sportswear, a style that has influenced designers all over the world. She was a featured designer at Lord & Taylor when the store was headed by the legendary Dorothy Shaver, and received the first Lord & Taylor Design Award in 1938 for ''distinguished designing in the field of sports clothes for women.'' She also received a Neiman Marcus Award in 1939 and a Coty Fashion Critics Award in 1946. In 1939, she designed a blue wool dress for Eleanor Roosevelt to wear to meet King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England.         Several of Ms. Potter's designs are  in an exhibition called, ''Designing Women: American Style 1940-1960,'' at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.         ''She was incredibly important,'' said Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''She was one of that first group in the 1930's of designers recognized by name. She was recognized by American women for getting rid of ornamentation. She wasn't the boldest, like Claire McCardell, but she was known for color and simple textures, for a discreet style of dressing, for sophisticated sportswear.''         An aristocratic-looking woman who loved sports, particularly horseback riding, Ms. Potter designed for women like herself who favored casual clothes that were simple yet sophisticated. ''Large numbers of American women want clothes that are refined,'' Ms. Potter said in a 1948 interview with The New York Times. ''I aim to give them in a medium-priced, ready-to-wear costume what they would find in custom-made styles.''         Among the styles she was known for were the two-piece swimsuit consisting of a bra and bloomers, the evening sweater and the sidesaddle-draped skirt. Even for evening, her designs tended to be as casual as a shirt and skirt or pants and a tunic. One outfit of the 1940's combined a rose-colored blouse, a pale blue floor-length skirt and a green belt.         ''She did forward-looking active sports clothes, sundresses, trousers, bathing suits and evening sweaters,'' said Valerie Steele, the chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. ''She wasn't influenced by Paris, but by the modern American leisure life style.''         Ms. Potter was born in Jersey City in 1903. Her affinity for color could be traced to an interest in art she developed while in high school, where she was art editor of the school paper, and continued with studies at the Art Students League. Although she did not know how to sew, she took a draping course and produced what she later described as ''my first weird costume,'' consisting of a long, slinky red wool dress with huge silk sleeves that she dyed to match.         She went on to study at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and after graduation found a job with a dress manufacturer. In 1948 she went into partnership with Martha Stout, a former magazine editor, in a ready-to-wear company called Timbertop. The name came from the turkey farm in West Nyack, N.Y., where Ms. Potter lived with her husband, J. Sanford Potter, an architect.         By the mid-1950's she was in business on her own, working from a barn on her farm with her husband drafting the patterns for her clothing. ''It was very chic to go out there and buy things in a lovely spot,'' recalled Virginia Wagoner Booth, who was then a buyer for Lord & Taylor and became a lifelong friend.         In the late 1950's, Mr. Potter designed and built a Japanese-style house in Fort Ann on Lake Nebo, where the couple grew camellias and raised Dalmatians.         ''They kept horses down in Virginia,'' Ms. Booth said, ''and went down every weekend in the fall to hunt. Clare remained physically active almost until the end. When she took to her bedroom, she could look out at the lake and see the birds. She loved to watch and feed the birds.         ''When Sandy died four years ago,'' she added, referring to Mr. Potter, ''we scattered his ashes on the property. We'll do the same thing with hers.''         Ms. Potter left no survivors.       
         Muriel Bentley, an early member of Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater) who was praised for her comic gifts and witty dancing, died on Monday at the Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 82 and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Bentley was probably best known for her long association with Jerome Robbins. She originated the role of the sassy, purse-toting woman in Robbins's ''Fancy Free.'' Speaking of the character in an interview in The New York Times last year, Ms. Bentley probably inadvertently described her own great charm best. ''My role was modeled after me,'' she said. ''The way I walked, the way I talked. It was like patent leather, shiny and bright and crisp.''         She also performed lead roles in major ballets by Agnes de Mille and Antony Tudor at Ballet Theater, where she danced as a company member from 1940 to 1946 and as a guest artist from 1954 to 1956.         Ms. Bentley created the role of the villainous Stepmother in ''Fall River Legend,'' de Mille's 1948 ballet about Lizzie Borden. Describing the character as ''an incarnation of evil,'' John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, commented that Ms. Bentley had played the role so superbly that ''if the girl had not committed the murder herself almost anybody in the audience would gladly have done it for her.'' She also appeared as a risque young lady in de Mille's 1943 ballet ''Tally-Ho.''         Born in New York, Ms. Bentley studied with teachers like Vecheslav Swoboda, Leon Fokine, Anton Dolin and Ruth St. Denis, and also trained at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School. While still a teen-ager, she danced with St. Denis in 1931 in ''The Prophetess.'' In 1936-37, she performed Spanish dance with Jose Greco, moving on to the Metropolitan Opera Ballet before joining Ballet Theater.         At Ballet Theater, Ms. Bentley also danced major roles in Leonide Massine's ''Capriccio Espagnol,'' in de Mille's ''Three Virgins and a Devil,'' and in Tudor's ''Judgment of Paris,'' ''Undertow'' and ''Gala Performance.'' Ms. Bentley joined Robbins's Ballets: U.S.A. in 1958, performing in ballets that included ''N.Y. Export: Op. Jazz,'' ''The Concert'' and ''Moves.''         Ms. Bentley also performed in Broadway musicals, among them ''Call Me Madam'' and ''West Side Story.''         Ms. Bentley retired from the stage in the early 1960's and worked for a time in New York as an interior designer and a theatrical agent before moving to Los Angeles in the 1970's.         She continued to work into the late 1980's in performing arts management.         She has no immediate survivors.

         Michi N. Weglyn, author of an acclaimed book about the internment of Japanese-Americans in the United States during World War II, died last Sunday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 72.         She had cancer, said Si Spiegel, the executor of her estate.         Ms. Weglyn's book, ''Years of Infamy: The Untold Story of America's Concentration Camps'' (University of Washington Press, 1976), was praised by an American Ambassador to Japan, Mike Mansfield. He called it ''a conscience-wrenching book of major significance,'' and said that ''every American concerned with human liberty should know of this bleak period of our national history.''         Ms. Weglyn herself was interned in one of the camps as a teen-ager.         Frank Freidel, a professor of American history at Harvard University, wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Japanese-Americans in the western United States, numbering over 100,000, ''became the scapegoats for the attack on Pearl Harbor.''         '' 'Years of Infamy' gives an appalling view of the privation, neglect and even brutality that the bewildered Japanese-Americans underwent in the camps,'' he wrote. Ms. Weglyn's account, he said, ''based largely on Government documents, is decidedly grimmer than most earlier books on this disgraceful subject.''         In later years Ms. Weglyn worked in behalf of former internees who had not received compensation from the United States Government.         Ms. Weglyn was born in Stockton, Calif., to Tomojiro Nishiura, who was a farmer, and the former Misao Yuasa.         She attended Mount Holyoke College in 1944 and 1945 and Barnard College in 1947 and 1948.         In the 1950's and 60's, under the name Michi, Ms. Weglyn was a designer and manufacturer of theatrical costumes.         Her husband, Walter M. Weglyn, died in 1995. Surviving are a sister, Tomi Fujita, and a nephew, Walter Fujita, both of Los Angeles.       
         Ruth Whitney, the editor who steered Glamour magazine for 31 years and influenced several generations of women during three important decades in American feminism, died yesterday at her home in Irvington, N.Y. She was 71.         The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, said her daughter-in-law, Christina Ferrari.         Mrs. Whitney was the editor in chief of Glamour, a magazine owned by Conde Nast Publications that now has a circulation of 2.1 million readers, from 1967 until last September. Part of her mission, she said, was to make feminism accessible, not intimidating, to American women.         Her reputation for frankness reached into the pages of Glamour, where -- along with the standard fare of women's magazines, like frothy fashion spreads and light service articles -- she published articles about sexuality, politics and women's health issues that other women's magazines had generally avoided. And her editorial decisions -- like putting a black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, a first in the women's magazine industry -- sometimes caused a stir in magazine circles.         In an interview a week before she retired last September, Mrs. Whitney explained her goal as editor in chief of Glamour: ''I always felt that I had a mission. I wanted to broaden the scope of a magazine to go with women's lives. I never wanted to appeal to everyone. That's not what we were about, and that's not the secret of our success. But I really wanted to make women feel good about themselves, not just about what they wore.''         Mrs. Whitney's origins were more humble than glamorous. She was born Ruth Reinke is Oshkosh, Wis., on July 23, 1928. Her mother, Helen, was a housewife, and her father, Leonard, was a designer of gravestones and mausoleums, but the only effect her father's choice of career had on her, she said last year, was that she learned to drive in a cemetery.         She was awarded a scholarship to Northwestern University, where she met Daniel Whitney, a journalism student; they married shortly after her 21st birthday. Unlike her husband, who attended journalism school but eventually ran his own advertising agency, Mrs. Whitney decided against professional journalism training and went straight to work for Time Inc. as a promotional copywriter. She didn't last long in the job.         ''It was an election year and I was madly for Adlai,'' she said. ''And the company was not madly for Adlai. So I got more and more sullen and eventually they fired me.'' To her dismay, the young Mrs. Whitney found that she could not get a job writing for Newsweek or Fortune.         ''What I always say next,'' she said, ''was that if you had a uterus, you couldn't write for those magazines.'' She found a job in women's magazines and, at 28, became editor in chief of a now-defunct magazine called Better Living, then of Seventeen. She arrived at Glamour in 1967.         During her tenure the magazine won four National Magazine Awards, including two for general excellence, in 1981 and 1991, and one in the public interest category in 1992, for a series conceived by Mrs. Whitney on the availability and safety of abortions in America. Until her death, she served on the board of the NOW Legal Defense Fund.         While she was editor, she kept a low profile. She never ran an editor's note at the front of the magazine and refused parties for her 20th, 25th and 30th anniversaries as editor in chief. When S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance Publications, the parent company of Conde Nast, asked her what she would like for her 25th anniversary, she asked that he establish two scholarships in her name at the Newhouse School of Journalism at Syracuse University.         Despite her low-key manner, she was fond of controversy. When she wanted to feature the black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, the issue was debated at every level of the company, all the way up to the president. ''I never shied away from controversy,'' Mrs. Whitney said last year. ''It's always good for you.''         And she was a champion of women who confronted authority. In October  1991, just as Anita Hill began testifying on Capitol Hill against the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, Mrs. Whitney closed the December issue of the magazine -- with its special feature on notable women of the year -- and went home to watch the hearings. On Sunday she called her production manager and said that she wanted to reconfigure the issue to include Ms. Hill as one of the notable women, which she did, beating most monthly magazines to an interview with Ms. Hill.         Gloria Steinem, a former contributing editor to Glamour, said that decisions like those defined the magazine under Mrs. Whitney. ''She was always trying to get as much real information into the pages of a fashion and beauty magazine as she possibly could,'' Ms. Steinem said.         The combination of fashion and service with strong editorial articles worked especially well on the newsstand. Glamour is second in circulation in its field only to Cosmopolitan. Conde Nast is a privately held company and does not disclose the earnings of its magazines, but in 1997 Steven T. Florio, the chief executive officer, said that Glamour's annual profits were in the ''tens of millions of dollars.''         Richard B. Stolley, the first managing editor of People and now the senior editorial adviser at Time Inc., said that Mrs. Whitney's rare longevity in the magazine industry could be attributed to her forward thinking.         ''She truly tried to turn her readers into not only capable women,'' he said, ''but functioning citizens of America, with all the knowledge and concerns that she felt young women ought to have. And of course she was right.''         The magazine business was long a family enterprise. Mrs. Whitney's husband served as her sounding board on all editorial matters until his death in 1995. Her son, Philip, who survives her, was until last year an executive at Money magazine; his wife, Christina Ferrari, is the managing editor of Teen People magazine. She is also survived by a brother, Leonard Reinke, of Oshkosh.       
         Patricia Zipprodt, the Tony Award-winning costume designer whose career extended from theater to dance to opera to film and television, died on Saturday at her home in  Greenwich Village. Ms. Zipprodt was 74.         The cause was cancer, according to her sister, Constance Zonka of Chicago.         Quite simply, as a headline writer once put it, Ms. Zipprodt had the gift of garb. In her youth she studied art, and then one day at the ballet she discovered her calling. She wanted to make the dresses.         ''I'll design for the ballet,'' she recalled telling herself. ''I'll paint with fabric.''         Years later she described a play as a painting that moves. ''Instead of it holding still and you look at it, you hold still and it scrolls by,'' she said.         Although she realized her early dream of designing costumes for ballet, she also designed for scores of Broadway shows, won Tony Awards for ''Fiddler on the Roof'' (1964), ''Cabaret'' (1966) and ''Sweet Charity'' (1985), along with many other prizes.         Her costumes graced musicals like ''Pippin'' (1972) and ''Chicago'' (1975), Broadway plays like ''Plaza Suite'' (1968), ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' (1983) and ''The Glass Menagerie'' (1983).         Off Broadway, her credits included ''Our Town'' (1959), ''The Balcony'' (1960), ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad'' (1962) and ''The Blacks'' (1962).         She did wardrobes for the Boston Opera, the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera and for American Ballet Theater, the New York City Ballet, the Houston Ballet and Ballet Hispanico.         In Hollywood she left her imprint on ''The Graduate'' (1967). On television she designed costumes for productions like ''The Glass Menagerie'' on ABC in 1973 and ''Alice in Wonderland'' on WNET in 1983.         Analyzing Ms. Zipprodt's talent, the actor Joel Grey, who worked with her in ''Cabaret'' in 1966, said: ''Her hands were all over the work, whether or not it had to do with making a diaper for Father Time or this very tattered but elegant master-of-ceremonies tail coat.''         Ms. Zipprodt's costumes for ''The Blacks'' brought her to the attention of Jerome Robbins, who hired her when he made his debut as a director with ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad.'' He called on her again for his next show, the hit ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' From Robbins, she said, she learned how to use color to help the audience track the main characters.         In 1990 she spent six months researching and designing more than 300 costumes for the 38-member cast of ''Shogun,'' the muscial based on the James Clavell novel about a shipwrecked 17th-century English navigator who is pivotal in a power struggle among five Japanese overlords.         Despite a million-dollar budget, the assignment, Ms. Zipprodt said, was harder than her work on ''Sunday in the Park With George'' (1984), when the challenge was to design costumes that suggested pointillism without actually using dots; or on the 1977 Metropolitan Opera production of ''Tannhauser,'' which called for more than 200 people to appear onstage at one point.         For ''Shogun'' Ms. Zipprodt traveled to Japan, studied the weaving industry in Kyoto that dated back to the world of ''Shogun'' and visited and photographed Kabuki theaters, samurai-movie studios, gardens, castles and textile mills.         In New York she sought out Japanese women to consult on tradition and custom and experimented in a workshop on West 22d Street with ways to duplicate ancient decorative techniques. (The show was fated to run for only 72 performances.)         Ms. Zipprodt was born in Chicago on Feb. 24, 1925. She was the eldest of three daughters of Agnes Irene Turpin and Herbert Edward Zipprodt, an advertising executive. In 1947 she earned a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College in Massachusetts.  After graduation, she returned to Chicago and fell in love with Lieut. Col. Robert O'Brien Jr., an Army cavalryman, but declined his proposal because she felt she must go to New York to discover if she had artistic talent.         By the 1950's Ms. Zipprodt was living the bohemian life in New York, where she painted at the Art Students League, studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and waited on tables at Schrafft's until her visit to the ballet altered her life forever.         About seven or eight years ago, after Colonel O'Brien had married, retired and become a widower, he came across a biography of Ms. Zipprodt in a copy of Playbill in Washington. It mentioned that she was an artist in residence at Brandeis University's theater department. The colonel called Brandeis and asked for her phone number, which the university would not give out. So he told the university to call her and pass along a message: ''Bob O'Brien called, and I want to marry her.'' The university did as instructed.         Ms. Zipprodt and the colonel were married on June 5, 1993. She lived in  Upperville, Va., and in New York. Colonel O'Brien died in 1998. Ms. Zipprodt was inducted into the Theatrical Hall of Fame in 1992.         As meticulous as she might be, as committed to researching history, assessing color, collecting swatches, cords and tassels and overseeing the  construction of costumes, Ms. Zipprodt never forgot that her quest for authenticity and beauty was in the service of the hectic and sometimes harrowing institution of show business.         ''Velcro,'' she once said, ''is our favorite word.''       
         Altina Schinasi Miranda, who is credited with designing the flared-frame Harlequin eyeglasses, which first came into vogue in the late 1930's and which have made kitschy comebacks from time to time, died on Thursday at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 92.         Mrs. Miranda came up with the idea for the pointy glasses while working as a window display designer on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. In an optician's window nearby, she noticed the humdrum round eyeglasses for women and decided to design something different.         Her new glasses were initially rejected by the major manufacturers, but Mrs. Miranda allied herself with a stylish optical shop, Lugene, on Madison Avenue, where one of the first pairs was sold to the writer Clare Boothe Luce. Other New York trendsetters followed Mrs. Luce's lead, and by the late 1930's, Harlequin glasses were the rage.         Mrs. Miranda's glasses were hailed by magazines like Vogue and Life, and she decided to establish her own company to distribute them. In 1939 she received an American Design Award from Lord & Taylor for the Harlequins, which remained fashionable through the 1950's and enjoyed a resurgence of hip popularity in the early 1990's.         ''If you look at any 'I Love Lucy' rerun, if Lucille Ball is wearing glasses, they are Harlequin glasses,'' said David Mayhew of Maplewood, N.J., a friend of Mrs. Miranda's family.         Mrs. Miranda was born on Aug. 4, 1907, in a Manhattan mansion to Moussa and Laurette Schinasi. Mr. Schinasi, once a poor Turkish immigrant, had become a millionaire through his patented cigarette-rolling machine, which led to the establishment of a company that manufactured ''ready rolled'' cigarettes.         In the mid-1940's Mrs. Miranda sold her eyeglass interests and moved to Los Angeles. She later became a filmmaker, producing a film about George Grosz, the Weimar artist, with whom she had once studied.         In 1981 she relocated to Santa Fe  and continued work as a visual artist until her health began to decline in recent years.         She is survived by her husband, Celestino Miranda; a son, Terry Sanders of Los Angeles, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Perriand, the French designer who created furniture with Le Corbusier in the 1920's and 30's and was rediscovered as a modernist legend in her own right in the 1980's and 90's, died at her home in Paris on Oct. 27. She was 96.         Through a productive career spanning eight decades, Ms. Perriand designed tubular ''equipment for living'' with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, bamboo furniture in Japan, lobbies for Air France in London and Tokyo, workers' housing in the Sahara and ski resort interiors in the French Alps.         Her ideas about flexible space, free-form shapes, natural materials and furniture designed to make ''space sing'' made her a modernist with a humanist agenda. The legs on her dining table were splayed, for example, so that people sitting at the ends could stretch their legs.         Preferring to be known as an interior architect instead of a furniture designer, Ms. Perriand subscribed to the modernist notion that furnishings and architecture needed to be developed as a single entity.         Her collaborations were often especially productive. The primary-colored bookcase with cupboards painted by Sonia Delaunay for the dormitory for Tunisian students at the Cite Universitaire in Paris and the lighting table (table and fluorescent overhead lights in one) she designed with Jean Prouve in 1953 are prized by collectors and sometimes reproduced without authorization.         ''For nearly three quarters of a century, Perriand has been one of the major innovators in French design, and her career embraces much of the history of 20th-century design in France,'' said Mary McLeod, an architectural historian at Columbia University.         Ms. Perriand was born in Paris on Oct. 24, 1903. Her early talent for drawing led her to the Ecole de l'Union Central des Arts Decoratifs. By 1926 she had been selected to exhibit her work at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs, from which the name of the Art Deco movement derives.         Her ''bar under the roof,'' an installation featuring a built-in chrome-walled bar counter and card table with pool-pocket drink holders, caused a sensation at the 1927 Salon d'Automne and established her as an avant-garde talent to watch.         Believing that she had nowhere to go but to the top, as she told Roger Aujame, a friend and former Corbusier Foundation director who is working on a catalog of her works, Ms. Perriand sought a job at Le Corbusier's studio. His initial withering response, ''We don't embroider cushions here,'' has become part of modernist lore. But once he went to see her bar installation, Le Corbusier hired her on the spot.         The years from 1927 to 1937 that she spent working with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret were formative and soon, like Corbusier, Ms. Perriand was making manifesto-style declarations about ''the new man'' and wearing her signature necklace of steel ball bearings. But it was her love of nature, especially the mountains where she often retreated, and her pragmatism that tempered the strict angularities of their furniture classics like the chaise longue and the famous cube-shaped Grand Confort chair.         In 1940 Ms. Perriand was invited to Japan, where she used traditional materials like bamboo, pine and woven straw to make modern shapes. When war broke out, she moved to Vietnam; unable to get a return visa to France, she worked for the colonial government. There she met Jacques Martin, a local official, whom she married in 1943. (An earlier, brief marriage in 1926 ended in divorce.) The couple had one daughter in 1944, Pernette Perriand, now an architect in Paris. Mr. Martin died in 1986.         Ms. Perriand returned to Paris in 1946 and was soon working on a wide range of projects, from ski resorts to student housing. Fiercely independent, she rejected frequent requests to furnish interiors designed by other architects. But she was eager to work with Mr. Prouve, the designer and manufacturer who collaborated with her and produced several of her designs from 1951 to 1953. She also collaborated again with Le Corbusier on the Unite d'Habitation housing project in Marseilles.         Ms. Perriand continued to travel to Japan and Brazil for inspiration, but spent much of her time from 1967 to 1982 working on the Arcs, a vast compound of ski resorts in the Alps.         In the 1980's the retrospectives of her work began, first at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in 1985 and then at the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Design Museum in London in 1996 and the Architectural League in Manhattan in 1997. But Ms. Perriand looked ahead, not back, and at the time of her death was exploring the possibilities of new materials for the 21st century.         At a league lecture, Ms. Perriand told the young design students there, ''We are leaving the age of oak and entering a period that will be defined by lightness, suppleness and the ephemeral.''       
         Charlotte Perriand, the French designer who created furniture with Le Corbusier in the 1920's and 30's and was rediscovered as a modernist legend in her own right in the 1980's and 90's, died at her home in Paris on Oct. 27. She was 96.         Through a productive career spanning eight decades, Ms. Perriand designed tubular ''equipment for living'' with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, bamboo furniture in Japan, lobbies for Air France in London and Tokyo, workers' housing in the Sahara and ski resort interiors in the French Alps.         Her ideas about flexible space, free-form shapes, natural materials and furniture designed to make ''space sing'' made her a modernist with a humanist agenda. The legs on her dining table were splayed, for example, so that people sitting at the ends could stretch their legs.         Preferring to be known as an interior architect instead of a furniture designer, Ms. Perriand subscribed to the modernist notion that furnishings and architecture needed to be developed as a single entity.         Her collaborations were often especially productive. The primary-colored bookcase with cupboards painted by Sonia Delaunay for the dormitory for Tunisian students at the Cite Universitaire in Paris and the lighting table (table and fluorescent overhead lights in one) she designed with Jean Prouve in 1953 are prized by collectors and sometimes reproduced without authorization.         ''For nearly three quarters of a century, Perriand has been one of the major innovators in French design, and her career embraces much of the history of 20th-century design in France,'' said Mary McLeod, an architectural historian at Columbia University.         Ms. Perriand was born in Paris on Oct. 24, 1903. Her early talent for drawing led her to the Ecole de l'Union Central des Arts Decoratifs. By 1926 she had been selected to exhibit her work at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs, from which the name of the Art Deco movement derives.         Her ''bar under the roof,'' an installation featuring a built-in chrome-walled bar counter and card table with pool-pocket drink holders, caused a sensation at the 1927 Salon d'Automne and established her as an avant-garde talent to watch.         Believing that she had nowhere to go but to the top, as she told Roger Aujame, a friend and former Corbusier Foundation director who is working on a catalog of her works, Ms. Perriand sought a job at Le Corbusier's studio. His initial withering response, ''We don't embroider cushions here,'' has become part of modernist lore. But once he went to see her bar installation, Le Corbusier hired her on the spot.         The years from 1927 to 1937 that she spent working with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret were formative and soon, like Corbusier, Ms. Perriand was making manifesto-style declarations about ''the new man'' and wearing her signature necklace of steel ball bearings. But it was her love of nature, especially the mountains where she often retreated, and her pragmatism that tempered the strict angularities of their furniture classics like the chaise longue and the famous cube-shaped Grand Confort chair.         In 1940 Ms. Perriand was invited to Japan, where she used traditional materials like bamboo, pine and woven straw to make modern shapes. When war broke out, she moved to Vietnam; unable to get a return visa to France, she worked for the colonial government. There she met Jacques Martin, a local official, whom she married in 1943. (An earlier, brief marriage in 1926 ended in divorce.) The couple had one daughter in 1944, Pernette Perriand, now an architect in Paris. Mr. Martin died in 1986.         Ms. Perriand returned to Paris in 1946 and was soon working on a wide range of projects, from ski resorts to student housing. Fiercely independent, she rejected frequent requests to furnish interiors designed by other architects. But she was eager to work with Mr. Prouve, the designer and manufacturer who collaborated with her and produced several of her designs from 1951 to 1953. She also collaborated again with Le Corbusier on the Unite d'Habitation housing project in Marseilles.         Ms. Perriand continued to travel to Japan and Brazil for inspiration, but spent much of her time from 1967 to 1982 working on the Arcs, a vast compound of ski resorts in the Alps.         In the 1980's the retrospectives of her work began, first at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in 1985 and then at the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Design Museum in London in 1996 and the Architectural League in Manhattan in 1997. But Ms. Perriand looked ahead, not back, and at the time of her death was exploring the possibilities of new materials for the 21st century.         At a league lecture, Ms. Perriand told the young design students there, ''We are leaving the age of oak and entering a period that will be defined by lightness, suppleness and the ephemeral.''
