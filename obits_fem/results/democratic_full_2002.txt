         Astrid Lindgren, the Swedish writer whose rollicking, anarchic books about Pippi Longstocking rattled some tradition-bound Swedes when they first appeared almost 60 years ago but came to captivate millions of children around the world, died yesterday at her home in Stockholm. She was 94.         Mrs. Lindgren, who began publishing in the 1940's, became one of the world's most widely translated authors. In addition to being a beloved cultural figure in Sweden, she was also a powerful political force, successfully lobbying on issues like tax reform and improved conditions for farm animals.         Although Mrs. Lindgren produced more than 70 books for young people, she was best known as the author of the classic ''Pippi Longstocking,'' first published in Sweden in 1945 and in the United States five years later. The title character is a 9-year-old carrot-haired enfant terrible who lives cheerfully by herself in the ramshackle Villa Villekulla and befriends her better behaved, better groomed neighbors, Tommy and Annika.         ''She had no mother and no father, and that was of course very nice because there was no one to tell her to go to bed just when she was having the most fun, and no one who could make her take cod liver oil when she much preferred caramel candy,'' the book begins.         ''Pippi'' and its sequels have together sold millions of copies and been translated into more than 50 languages. The sheer subversive quality of the books, whose brazen young heroine does exactly as she pleases, made them unusual for juvenile literature.         ''Bertrand Russell has written that a child dreams about power as grown-ups dream sexual wish dreams,'' Mrs. Lindgren said in a 1985 interview. ''This is a child who has power. That is wonderful, for children to think, 'Oh, if I were like Pippi! I could say to Father, '' 'You don't do that!' ''         ''She has power, but she never misuses that power,'' Ms. Lindgren said, ''which I think is the most splendid thing, and the most difficult.''         Mrs. Lindgren was born Astrid Anna Emilia Ericsson on Nov. 14, 1907, the second of four children of Samuel August and Hanna Jonsson Ericsson, in Vimmerby, in southern Sweden. Her father was a tenant farmer, and Mrs. Lindgren grew up outside Vimmerby at Nas, a 500-year-old farm, in an old red house surrounded by apple orchards.         ''Rocks and trees were as close to us as living beings, and nature protected and nurtured our playing and our dreaming,'' she wrote in a 1973 memoir. ''Whatever our imagination could call forth was enacted in the land around us -- all fairy tales, all adventures we invented or read about or heard about, all of it happened there, and only there. Even our songs and prayers had their places in surrounding nature.''         The pastoral idyll of Mrs. Lindgren's youth came to an end in 1926, when, 19 and unmarried, she became pregnant. She fled to Copenhagen, where she gave birth to a son, Lars, and later settled in Stockholm.         To support herself, she took a secretarial job at the Royal Automobile Club in Stockholm. (Among Mrs. Lindgren's lesser known writing is the 1939 work ''Twenty-Five Automobile Tours in Sweden.'') In 1931 she married a co-worker, Sture Lindgren. Mrs. Lindgren, who was widowed in 1952, is survived by a sister, Stina Hergin; her daughter, Karin Nyman; seven grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.         It was Karin who first conjured up Pippi. In 1941 when she was 7 she was sick in bed with pneumonia. Night after night she nagged her mother to tell her a story.         ''What should I tell?'' the exhausted Mrs. Lindgren asked one evening.         ''Tell about Pippi Langstrump'' -- Pippi Longstocking -- Karin replied, coining the name on the spot.         Her mother gamely complied.         ''I didn't ask her who Pippi Longstocking was,'' Mrs. Lindgren told The New Yorker in 1983. ''I just began the story, and since it was a strange name it turned out to be a strange girl as well.''         Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Efraim's daughter Longstocking was indeed a strange girl. Her fiery hair stuck straight out from either side of her head in two tight braids. She wore one black stocking and one brown, with black shoes twice as long as her feet. Her mother was long dead; her sailor father had been lost at sea, though Pippi was confident he had come ashore on a South Sea island where ''he had become king of all the cannibals.'' She had a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nilsson for company and a trunkful of gold pieces to provide for her wants.         Like many heroes of traditional Scandinavian lore, Pippi was fearless, ageless and endowed with superhuman strength.         But above all, Pippi was rude:  deeply, outrageously, satisfyingly rude. Invited to a fancy coffee party, she devoured an entire cream cake before the assembled guests.         The sequel ''Pippi Goes on Board'' was published in Sweden in 1946, followed by ''Pippi in the South Seas'' in 1948, ''Pippi on the Run'' in 1971 and several other Pippi stories not translated into English.         In the 1970's she stepped into public life to protest Sweden's income tax laws, which sent self-employed artists like Mrs. Lindgren and the director Ingmar Bergman reeling under a staggering tax burden. A lifelong supporter of the ruling Social Democratic Party, Mrs. Lindgren published a caustic newspaper satire before the 1976 election in which she calculated that, because of competing local and federal taxes, her income was taxed at an annual rate of 102 percent. The Social Democrats, in power for more than 40 years, were defeated, and tax cuts followed, events Mrs. Lindgren was sometimes credited with bringing about.         Although Mrs. Lindgren's career made her wealthy, she continued to live modestly in the same Stockholm apartment where ''Pippi Longstocking'' was first written, rising early to write in bed before going off to her editing job. She regarded her status as one of Sweden's best loved celebrities with characteristic quiet humor.         ''Perhaps this is because in Stockholm drunks come up and hug me all the time,'' she said in 1994. ''And I cannot be that impressed with anyone, except for God.''       
         Elisabeth Mann Borgese, a multifaceted writer, defender of marine resources and founder of the International Oceans Institute based in Malta, died on Feb. 8 while on vacation in St. Moritz, Switzerland. She was 83 and lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia.         Professor Borgese was the last surviving child of Thomas Mann. She was a pianist by training, a multilingual political scientist and a writer of fiction and of oceanic yearbooks.         She helped organize the international Peace in the Oceans Conference of 1970, the first of 30 such meetings worldwide. She was an enduring presence at those gatherings, which brought about the United Nations Law of the Seas treaty in 1982.         Elisabeth Mann was born in Munich, the second youngest of three girls and three boys of Thomas and Katia Pringsheim Mann. (W. H. Auden became her brother-in-law when the poet married her sister Erika to provide her with a British passport.)         Hoping to become a musician, Elisabeth studied the piano and cello, receiving a diploma from the Conservatory of Music in Zurich in 1938.         The Mann family had left Germany after Hitler came to power, moving first to Switzerland and, in 1938, to the United States. In 1939, Elisabeth married Giuseppe A. Borgese, a professor 36 years her senior who had fled Fascist Italy; he died in 1952.         She became a United States citizen in 1941 but took Canadian citizenship in 1983. She worked as an editor and researcher in Chicago, including two years as executive secretary of the board of the Encyclopedia Britannica in the mid-1960's.         She served as a senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, Calif., before joining the faculty at Dalhousie University in Halifax in 1979, first as a political science professor and later as an adjunct law professor.         In the 1970's, Professor Borgese formed the International Oceans Institute, which has since grown to 20 centers.         She is survived by two daughters, Angelica Borgese of Manhattan and Turkey, and Dr. Domenica Borgese of Milan; a son, Marcel Deschamps of Halifax; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''         She advised millions of readers on problems ranging from acne to alcoholism to AIDS, often in spirited competition with her identical twin sister, who wrote the advice column Dear Abby.         At the time of Mrs. Lederer's death, her column was carried in more than 1,200 newspapers around the world, with a readership of 90 million, according to Creators Syndicate, her distributor. A 1978 World Almanac survey named her the most influential woman in the United States.         ''I would rather have my column on a thousand refrigerator doors than win a Pulitzer,'' she once said.         A petite, elegant woman who favored high heels and silk, Mrs. Lederer had delicate features and a voice of pure ground glass.         An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail. The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers. Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancé's father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.         But even then, Mrs. Lederer discussed more controversial issues. During her first year she responded to a letter about homosexuality, taboo advice-column fare in the 1950's. The paper in St. Joseph, Mich., refused to print the column; the publisher told her he planned to run an announcement on Page 1 that the column would not be appearing that day because the subject matter was unfit for a family newspaper.         ''I called the publisher up and said, 'This is a human problem, and that is what I do,' '' she told The New Yorker in a 1995 interview. The publisher held firm.         ''I said: 'Fine. Then everyone in St. Joe is going to buy The Detroit Free Press to see what you won't print.' I called The Free Press and told them to get ready for a lot of extra sales.         ''From then on, boy,'' she added, ''that St. Joe paper printed every damn word I wrote.''         Early in her newfound career, Mrs. Lederer often phoned her twin sister, Pauline Phillips, for help with her replies. Mrs. Phillips, who lived in California, proved so good at coming up with pithy one-liners that within a few months she began writing her own advice column in The San Francisco Chronicle under the name Abigail Van Buren. As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m.         She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of goodwill to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         Fans and Powerful Enemies         After the column on her divorce, she received more than 35,000 letters of encouragement from readers, had the linings removed from her fur coats, and kept on going.         ''A divorce,'' she once said, ''is nothing compared with the problems I see in my everyday mail.''         Although those problems would progress from Saturday-night dating woes to late-20th-century ills like domestic violence and crack, Mrs. Lederer was sometimes astonished to discover the everyday things that could inflame the passions of her readers.         She once threw her column open to a discussion of whether toilet paper should be hung with the free end coming over or under the roll; 15,000 letters later, Mrs. Lederer (herself in the ''under'' camp) had to call a moratorium on further debate.         Occasionally Mrs. Lederer's work was the source of public embarrassment. In 1982, she admitted to having recycled 15-year-old letters for use in a number of current columns. In 1993 she was discovered to have embellished a letter about fraudulent charities by adding condemnatory remarks of her own.         And a 1995 interview with The New Yorker in which she called Pope John Paul II ''a Polack'' drew widespread criticism.         She apologized for the incidents in print, resolving to do her customary penance, ''40 lashes with a wet noodle.''         And while her column made Mrs. Lederer powerful friends, from prominent educators and executives to presidents, it also brought her bitter enemies.         Among her detractors were the National Rifle Association, which opposed her advocacy of gun control; groups opposing abortion, which deplored her abortion-rights position; and animal-rights organizations, angered by her support for the use of animals in medical research.         ''Those three groups really despise me, and I'm very proud of it,'' she said in 1993.         All in all, she said, being Ann Landers proved far more involving -- and more gratifying -- than she could ever have anticipated when she brought home her first stack of letters in 1955.         ''I cannot imagine a career that could be more rewarding,'' Mrs. Lederer said in a 1990 interview. ''There is enormous satisfaction in knowing that I've been able to touch the lives of millions of people. Where does anybody get a job like this?''         Mrs. Lederer, who owned the rights to the Ann Landers name, often said she did not expect anyone to replace her after her death. There would be no newspaper contest, no tales of disputed walnuts. ''There will never be another Ann Landers,'' she told The New Yorker. ''When I go, the column goes with me.''       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago.

As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m. She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of good will to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.         Fans and Powerful Enemies         After the column on her divorce, she received more than 35,000 letters of encouragement from readers, had the linings removed from her fur coats, and kept on going. ''A divorce,'' she once said, ''is nothing compared with the problems I see in my everyday mail.''         Although those problems would progress from Saturday-night dating woes to late-20th-century ills like domestic violence and crack, Mrs. Lederer was sometimes astonished to discover the everyday things that could inflame the passions of her readers.         She once threw her column open to a discussion of whether toilet paper should be hung with the free end coming over or under the roll; 15,000 letters later, Mrs. Lederer (herself in the ''under'' camp) had to call a moratorium on further debate.         Occasionally Mrs. Lederer's work was the source of public embarrassment. In 1982, she admitted to having recycled 15-year-old letters for use in a number of current columns. In 1993 she was discovered to have embellished a letter about fraudulent charities by adding condemnatory remarks of her own. A 1995 interview with The New Yorker in which she called Pope John Paul II ''a Polack'' drew widespread criticism.         She apologized for the incidents in print, resolving to do her customary penance, ''40 lashes with a wet noodle.''         While her column made Mrs. Lederer powerful friends, from prominent educators and executives to presidents, it also brought her bitter enemies.         Among her detractors were the National Rifle Association, which opposed her advocacy of gun control; groups opposing abortion, which deplored her abortion-rights position; and animal-protection organizations, angered by her support for the use of animals in medical research. ''Those three groups really despise me, and I'm very proud of it,'' she said in 1993.         All in all, she said, being Ann Landers proved far more involving -- and more gratifying -- than she could ever have anticipated when she brought home her first stack of letters in 1955. ''I cannot imagine a career that could be more rewarding,'' she said in 1990. ''There is enormous satisfaction in knowing that I've been able to touch the lives of millions of people. Where does anybody get a job like this?''         Mrs. Lederer, who owned the rights to the Ann Landers name, often said she did not expect anyone to replace her after her death. There would be no newspaper contest, no tales of disputed walnuts. ''There will never be another Ann Landers,'' she told The New Yorker. ''When I go, the column goes with me.''       
         Representative Patsy T. Mink, a liberal Democrat from Hawaii who was likely to be elected to a 13th term in November, died Saturday at the Straub Clinic and Hospital in Honolulu. She was 74.         The cause was viral pneumonia brought on by chickenpox, said Andy Winer, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Hawaii.         As a member of Congress from 1965 until 1977, and again from 1990 until her death, Ms. Mink was a champion of women's rights, education, civil rights and labor unions.         One of her primary legislative achievements came in 1972, when she was one of the sponsors of Title IX of the federal Education Amendments, which mandates equal financing for women's athletics and academics at institutions receiving federal money.         ''It's rare as a legislator that you fight for legislation you believe in and stay around or live long enough to see it come to fruition,'' Ms. Mink said in 1995, in a meeting with some of the nation's top female basketball players.         Ms. Mink was known as articulate and strong-willed, and willing to fight for causes large and small.         In 1967, she and two other congresswomen tried to get into the House gym, after hearing about a form letter inviting members to use what was at the time an exclusively male preserve. They were turned away by the gym's director, who news reports said was ''horrified'' by their transgression.         Several years later, she took on Dr. Edgar F. Berman, a member of the Democratic Party's committee on national priorities, who claimed that women's ''raging hormonal imbalance'' made them unfit for executive positions in business and politics. Dr. Berman eventually resigned from the committee.         Ms. Mink, however, stopped short of associating herself with the women's liberation movement.         ''Just because I'm interested in women doesn't mean I'm for women's liberation,'' she told The New York Times in 1970. ''I support all groups when what they do coincides with what I believe in.''         Patsy Takemoto was born in Paia, a sugar plantation town on the island of Maui, on Dec. 6, 1927. As a senior at Maui High School she was elected student body president, and by the time she graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1948, her interests had shifted from medicine to the humanities.         In 1951, she graduated from the University of Chicago Law School. That same year, she married John F. Mink, a doctoral student in geology. The couple moved to Honolulu, where Ms. Mink opened a law office and became the first Japanese-American woman licensed to practice law in Hawaii, Mr. Winer said.         In 1956, Ms. Mink was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Legislature. In 1958, she was elected to the Hawaii Senate.         In her first period in Congress, Ms. Mink was an early critic of the Vietnam War, prompting some opponents to call her Patsy Pink.         In 1972 she and Representative Bella S. Abzug of New York traveled to Paris, where they met with North Vietnamese officials to discuss the prospects for peace.         In 1967, in a speech before the House of Representatives, Ms. Mink argued against harsh punishments for people who burned the American flag.         ''America is not a country which needs to punish its dissenters to preserve its honor,'' she said. ''America is not a country which needs to demand conformity of all its people, for its strength lies in all our diversities converging in one common belief, that of the importance of freedom as the essence of our country.''         In 1976, after 12 years in Congress, Ms. Mink sought a seat in the United States Senate. She lost the Democratic primary to Spark M. Matsunaga. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed her assistant secretary of state for oceans and international, environmental and scientific affairs.         Ms. Mink returned to Congress in 1990 after winning a special election for the seat vacated by Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat, who was appointed to the Senate after Mr. Matsunaga's death. She discovered that many of her fellow Democrats had shifted toward more centrist positions.         ''She saw it as an opportunity to teach lessons,'' said Representative Neil Abercrombie, Democrat of Hawaii. ''She never thought for a moment of not working with people who didn't agree with her ideologically.''         In her final term, Ms. Mink raised questions about the creation of the Homeland Security Department, saying she feared that the new legislation could be used to undermine civil rights.         ''She had already been through that as a Japanese-American, seeing people put into detention camps on the basis of what they supposedly were as opposed to what they had actually done,'' Mr. Abercrombie said.         Ms. Mink is survived by her husband; their daughter, Gwendolyn; and a brother, Eugene Takemoto.
