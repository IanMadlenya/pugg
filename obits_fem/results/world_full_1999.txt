         Betty Bryant, who had such a satisfying childhood career in the backwaters of show business that she never bothered to try to top herself in the Broadway mainstream, died on Jan. 15 at her home in Park Ridge, Ill.         She was 76 and was recalled as the third generation of a family of showboat performers who brought corn  pone and culture to riverside mid-America.         If her life wasn't actually written by Edna Ferber or set to music by Jerome Kern, it was surely because Miss Bryant was only 4 when Ferber's novel ''Show Boat'' came out in 1926, two years before Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d translated it to the Broadway stage.         By then Miss Bryant was an experienced on-board performer, one who had made her acting debut at the age of 6 weeks, stoically (she didn't cry) portraying the slave girl Eliza's baby in the dash across the ice in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.''         If ever an actress was at home in the theater it was she.         The family showboat was both her home and her stage, and for 20 years, until World War II helped bring the showboat era to an end, she spent her springs, summers and falls going from town to town along the Ohio River and its tributaries, sometimes stopping for several weeks in bigger river cities like Pittsburgh or Cincinnati.         During the off-season, with the boat tied up in West Virginia, the family would visit New York or Chicago, sometimes staging variety acts, sometimes just taking in the theatrical sights.         With her mother as her tutor, Miss Bryant managed to get her high school diploma from a cooperating school that monitored her progress.         Based on Miss Bryant's 1994 book ''Here Comes the Showboat'' (University Press of Kentucky), hers was an idyllic life and one she was certainly born to.         To say that show business was in her blood would be something of an understatement. Her grandfather, Sam Bryant, a onetime gardener at Buckingham Palace, had no known theatrical inclinations until he fell in love with a young Gilbert and Sullivan actress named Violet Chapman, who had inclinations enough for both of them.         After the couple married and came to the United States in 1884, it didn't take many years of nagging before Lady Violet, as she preferred to be known, had persuaded her husband to seek thespian adventure, initially, as it turned out, in a horse-drawn traveling medicine show in which Dr. Sam, as he was known, would hawk a cure-all mixture of gasoline and red pepper on the first night in a town, then stage a tent show on the second.         The couple's children, Billy and Florence, were part of the dodge from the beginning and by the time the family graduated to vaudeville a few years later, they had become the Four Bryants.         A chance summer booking on a turn-of-the-century Mississippi River showboat gave them the river bug. Within a few years, Dr. Sam and Captain Billy, as his son was soon known, had acquired first the Princess and then, in 1918, Bryant's New Showboat.         By then, Captain Billy had married the floating troupe's piano and calliope player, Josephine Costello, who gave birth to Betty four years later.         From her start in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' Miss Bryant swiftly advanced to other roles and vaudeville turns, including impressions of George M. Cohan and Eddie Cantor.         As the only member of her generation among the now six Bryants (although Aunt Florence was increasingly an absentee actress), she played boys as often as girls, but regardless of the sex, she soon learned, her forlorn character was sure to die before the final curtain.         That's because the Bryant plays tended to be heavy, heart-rending  melodramas, which never failed to delight their small-town audiences.         Captain Billy did stage an abridged version of ''Hamlet'' once,  but after he got a look at the dazed audience on its way out, he quickly reverted to more familiar fare, replacing it with ''Ten Nights in a Barroom,'' a sure audience pleaser, partly, no doubt, because Miss Bryant died so convincingly.         By the time she graduated to grown-up roles, Miss Bryant had mastered the psychological subtleties of the showboat method of melodrama.         As she wrote in her book, ''A dependable leading lady must be able to run, duck, fall, get up, fall again, crawl over a bed and under a dresser, scream, swing by a rope, deliver an uppercut, struggle and kick and still have enough breath left to say, 'If this is aristocracy, thank God I'm a country girl.' ''         At 20 she married a fellow showboat actor, Jat Herod, a jazz violinist who joined the Army and was soon entertaining troops, as he and his wife continued to do after the war.         She is survived by two daughters, JoAleene Miranda of Des Plaines, Ill., and Mary Perry of Park Ridge, and three grandchildren.         After their divorce in 1962, Miss Bryant, who never tried to win acting jobs in New York or Hollywood, settled in Park Ridge, where she directed amateur theatrical productions and frequently gave lectures on what it was like to grow up on a showboat.       
         Sarah (Sadie) Delany, the last of the storied Delany sisters, died peacefully in her sleep at age 109 yesterday at her home in Mount Vernon, N.Y., spokesmen for her family said.         She was the oldest survivor of one of America's most remarkable families, the daughter of a man who had been born a slave, and the first colored woman -- the term she preferred -- ever permitted to teach home economics in white New York City schools.         Miss Delany and her younger sister, Dr. A. Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, were always celebrated in Harlem, where they lived and flourished from 1916 to 1957, after leaving their native Raleigh, N.C.         Dr. Delany, who received her doctorate in dental surgery from Columbia in 1923, was the second black woman licensed to practice dentistry in New York State. She had an office in Harlem and was known to thousands of people only as ''Dr. Bessie.'' She charged $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling and never raised her rates in 27 years of practice.         The sisters gained widespread fame after the publication in 1993 of a memoir they called ''Having Our Say; The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years.'' They wrote it with Amy Hill Hearth as an oral history from their early days in the Jim Crow South to their arrival in New York City during the Harlem Renaissance to their life in a white suburb.         The book, now part of curriculums at hundreds of colleges and high schools, was on the New York Times hardcover best-seller list for 28 weeks and on the paperback list for 77 weeks. They followed it in 1995  with ''The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom.''         In 1995, ''Having Our Say'' was adapted by Emily Mann into a Broadway play that was nominated for three Tony awards. The play followed the sisters in virtually nonstop conversation while they prepared an annual meal celebrating their father's birthday in the home they owned on a dead-end street in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         The sisters lived in that house from 1957 to 1995, and Miss Delany  remained there after Dr. Delany died in 1995 at 104. ''She is my right arm,'' Miss Delany had told an interviewer shortly before her sister's death. ''If she were to die first, I'm not sure I would want to go on living because the reason I am living is to keep her living.''         But Sadie, as her friends called her, kept going, just as the Delany sisters always had. Her last book, with Ms. Hearth, ''On My Own at 107: Reflections on a Life Without Bessie,'' appeared in May 1997.         The sisters liked to say that Dr. Bessie was the acerbic one, who was convinced it was her duty to tell people the truth, whether it concerned race relations or their molars. Sadie would say to her, ''Bessie, don't you realize that people don't want to hear the truth?''         If Dr. Bessie was the vinegar, then Miss Sadie was the molasses, with an uncommon talent for getting along  and for being as sweet as the candy she used to make for extra money as a young teacher.         The Delanys were a mix of hard-working African, white and American Indian stock, a family that was rich in everything but money, reserved, aristocratic and irrepressible even as they suffered through segregation.         Sadie Delany always thought of herself as a ''colored woman'' or, if one insisted on labels, a Negro. She never saw herself as black -- that did not describe her color, she used to say -- nor did she care for the term African-American.         Henry Beard Delany, their gentle, scholarly father, was born into slavery in 1858. The Delanys were house slaves of a St. Marys, Ga., family named Mock, who taught them to read and write. Henry Delany later attended St. Augustine's School in Raleigh and became the first Negro bishop of the Episcopal Church. He met his future wife, Nanny James Logan, at St. Augustine's. Sarah Louise Delany, their second child, was  born Sept. 19, 1889, at an aunt's home in Lynch's Station, Va. She grew up with two sisters and six brothers on  the campus of St. Augustine's, where their father was vice principal.         Happy though they might have been, the South around them was not. The former Confederate states were still reacting to the loss of the war nearly 50 years before. The sisters took different approaches to the Jim Crow laws passed across the south around 1914. In ''Having Our Say,'' Sadie Delany wrote:         ''I'll tell you how I handled white people. There was a shoe store in Raleigh called Heller's. The owner was a Jewish man, very nice. If you were colored, you had to go in the back to try on shoes, and white people sat in front. It wasn't Mr. Heller's fault; this was the Jim Crow law. I would go in there and say, 'Good morning, Mr. Heller, I would like to try on those shoes in the window.' And I would say, 'Where, Mr. Heller?' And he would gesture to the back and say, 'Back there.' And I would say, 'Back where?' Well, I'd just worry that man to death. Finally, he'd say, 'Just sit anywhere, Miss Delany!' And so I would sit myself down in the white section, and smile.         ''Now Bessie thinks that I shouldn't play dumb like that,'' she recalled. ''But I don't care. I got to sit in the white section.''         Sadie Delany liked to say that  when she got her master's degree in education from Columbia in 1925, a white teacher there observed, ''That Sarah Delany. You tell her to do something, she smiles at you, and then she just turns around and does what she wants anyway.''         In this, Miss Delany said, she was ''just like Papa.''         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1910. Her first job was working for the black school system in Wake County, N.C., teaching subjects like sanitation, how to can food and how to care for newborn infants.         Years later, she remembered her students: ''They looked up to me and I showed them it was possible to live a better life, despite what white people were trying to do to us.'' She proudly recalled driving Booker T. Washington around when he visited.         The Delany sisters first saw New York City in 1915, on a visit with their mother. Their father agreed to let them move to New York to attend college. Sadie Delany moved first, in  1916, and Bessie came along a year later. It was one of the rare times when the sisters were separated. Eventually, 9 of the 10 Delany children moved to New York, and all received college educations. Only Lemuel, the oldest, stayed in the South. The sisters are survived by 13 nieces and nephews.         At one point, Sadie, Bessie, Julia, Hubert and Lucius Delany lived together at 2505 Seventh Avenue and West 145th Street in Harlem, each paying a $9 share of the monthly rent. Their neighbors complained.         ''They thought we were running a fast house!'' the two sisters recalled.  ''We don't know why it didn't occur to them that we were brothers and sisters, except that they must have had unclear minds. So we had a little talk with the super and straightened out the whole mess.'' The Delanys had quite a few such talks over the years with people who did not understand them, and they always straightened out the mess.         While she was teaching at Public School 119, Sadie Delany found she could not support herself on the salary, so she started baking cakes and selling them for a nickel a slice to other teachers. She also made lemon and cinnamon lollipops, which she sold for a penny a piece.         People liked her cakes and candies so much that she rented a loft on 121st Street in the late 1920's and made homemade chocolate fondant, a soft, creamy affair. Called ''Delany's Delights,'' it was soon sold all over New York, including Abraham & Straus, at $2 a pound. She closed her business down after the 1929 stock market crash. ''People had no money for chocolate fondant, that's for sure,'' she said.         After years of teaching at predominantly black grade schools, Miss Delany wanted to teach high-school level domestic science, as home economics was then called. She had a master's from Columbia, after all. No Negro had ever done that before. She applied for a job, and received a letter from the Board of Education asking to meet her.         She knew that if the board members saw her, they would not hire her. So she skipped the appointment, sent a polite letter explaining there had been a ''mixup,'' and just showed up at the all-white Theodore Roosevelt High School on the first day of class.         ''They just about died when they saw me,'' she recalled. ''A colored woman!''         She kept the job and spent the rest of her career teaching at excellent high schools before retiring in 1960. Among them were Girls' High School in Brooklyn, Evander Childs High School in the Bronx and Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, where she taught adults at night.         It was lonely, she said. Some of her  fellow teachers, who were all white,  were friendly, she said, ''but you couldn't count on any of them being your real friend.''         She told Ms. Hearth: ''New York was no piece of cake for a colored person, but it was an improvement over the South, child. But don't go thinking I don't love the South. I was born there, and I expect to be buried there, right next to my Mama and Papa. Raleigh will always be home.''         ''Sadie is molasses without even trying,'' her sister once said. ''She can sweet-talk the world, or play dumb, or whatever it takes to get by without a fuss.'' ''         But sometimes the molasses could boil. The Board of Education once sent her what she called a ''nasty'' letter. She had lived for so long that the bean counters had become convinced that she must have died and that somebody else was cashing all those pension checks. She was furious, but as usual straightened it all out.         Toward the end of her life, Sadie Delany did not want anybody to think that she and her sister were just a couple of old women letting life slip by as they sat in their rocking chairs. ''Why, we don't even own a rocking chair,'' she said.         She said she woke up every morning at 6:30, smiled and said, ''Thank you, Lord, for another day.'' Then she would wake up Bessie, a late sleeper, who would open her eyes and say, ''Oh Lord, another day?''         Then they would prepare their food, consuming as many as seven different vegetables a day and lots of fresh fruit. They took vitamin supplements, boiled their water despite assurances that people could drink Mount Vernon water and live. They took up Yoga. They ate milk shakes for dinner, watched the nightly news on public television, said their prayers (extra ones for the people Bessie didn't like) and went to bed.         They believed that their simple lives and good food contributed to their longevity. Bessie said another reason was they ''never had husbands to worry us to death.''         But Sadie Delany said, ''Life is short, and it's up to you to make it sweet.''       
         Rita Valentine Tishman, a New York benefactor of Jewish and civic causes, died on Jan. 21 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 91.         She was decorated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt for leading the New York State women's division of the War Bond drive in the 1940's. Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson cited her work in civil rights.         She was a founding chairman, with Dore Schary, of Friends of Democracy, which championed human rights after World War II. She inspired the Rita V. Tishman Award, given annually by the Anti-Defamation League, recipients of which have included Betty Ford and Mary Lindsay.         She was a past president of the community-based National Council of Jewish Women, which supports the Lighthouse, day centers for the elderly and Libraries on Wheels. She also was a volunteer for the American Jewish Committee, the United Jewish Appeal and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and was an honorary chairman of all three.         Mrs. Tishman graduated from Smith College. She was the widow of Norman Tishman, former president of the Tishman Realty and Construction Company, who died in 1967.         She is survived by a son, Peter V. Tishman of Manhattan; two daughters, Margot T. Linton and Valerie T. Diker, both of Manhattan, 10 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  February 2, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary on Friday about Rita V. Tishman, a New York benefactor of Jewish and civic causes, referred incorrectly to a Jewish women's organization she served as president, and to an organization it sponsored for the blind. She headed the National Council of Jewish Women New York Section, not its umbrella group, the National Council of Jewish Women Inc. The New York Section established the Jewish Guild for the Blind; the guild is not associated with the Lighthouse.       
         Margaret Wentworth Owings, a California artist and conservationist who fought for the survival of sea otters, sea lions, mountain lions and other wild creatures, died on Jan. 21 at Wild Bird, her clifftop home above the Pacific in Big Sur, Calif. She was 85.         The cause was heart failure, reported the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which recently published a paean by her to Mother Nature.         Mrs. Owings, a former member of the California Parks Commission, led campaigns to protect the world's forests and oceans. The National Audubon Society honored her with a medal in 1983 and last year listed her among 100 individuals who had done the most to shape the environmental movement, along with Barry Commoner, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, William O. Douglas, Lady Bird Johnson, Stewart Udall and Morris K. Udall.         A native of Berkeley, Calif., she graduated from Mills College in 1934 and completed graduate studies in art the next year at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University. She had one-woman exhibitions of her stitchery at galleries and folk-art museums but largely set aside her art to work for conservation.         She and her second husband, Nathaniel Alexander Owings, a founding partner of the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, fought to keep the developers away from the wild beauty of Big Sur.         Seasonal residents of Santa Fe, N.M., they also assembled a collection of the art and Pueblo culture of the Southwest, now part of the collection of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.         Mrs. Owings was the founder and first president of Friends of the Sea Otter and won a battle to end the bounty-hunting of mountain lions in her state. As a member of the Point Lobos League she was instrumental in saving the beaches between the Carmel River and Point Lobos State Preserve, near Monterey.         She sat on the council of the Save-the-Redwoods League and the Big Sur Land Trust. She was a past trustee of Defenders of Wildlife, the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation and the Environmental Defense Fund, and a founder of the Rachel Carson Council.         She wrote about her experiences and spent the last months of her life compiling her writings and artwork. The resulting book, ''Voice From the Sea: Reflections on Wildlife and Wilderness'' was published weeks before her death.         Nathaniel Owings, who designed their home, Wild Bird, died in 1984.         Mrs. Owings is survived by a daughter, Wendy M. Benjamin, of Durango, Colo., from her previous marriage to Malcolm Millard, a resident of Carmel, Calif.; three stepdaughters, Natalie O. Prael and Jennifer O. Dewey, both of Santa Fe., and Emily O. Kapozi, of Novato, Calif.; a brother, William Wentworth, of Walnut Creek, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  February 2, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary on Sunday about Margaret Wentworth Owings, a California conservationist, omitted the name of a surviving stepson. He is Nathaniel O. Owings of Santa Fe, N.M.       
         Clare Potter, a leading American fashion designer of the 1930's and 40's known for imaginative use of color and simplicity of line, died Jan. 5 at her home in Fort Ann, N.Y. She was 95.         Along with Claire McCardell and Tina Leser, Ms. Potter was one of the designers credited with inventing American sportswear, a style that has influenced designers all over the world. She was a featured designer at Lord & Taylor when the store was headed by the legendary Dorothy Shaver, and received the first Lord & Taylor Design Award in 1938 for ''distinguished designing in the field of sports clothes for women.'' She also received a Neiman Marcus Award in 1939 and a Coty Fashion Critics Award in 1946. In 1939, she designed a blue wool dress for Eleanor Roosevelt to wear to meet King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England.         Several of Ms. Potter's designs are  in an exhibition called, ''Designing Women: American Style 1940-1960,'' at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.         ''She was incredibly important,'' said Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''She was one of that first group in the 1930's of designers recognized by name. She was recognized by American women for getting rid of ornamentation. She wasn't the boldest, like Claire McCardell, but she was known for color and simple textures, for a discreet style of dressing, for sophisticated sportswear.''         An aristocratic-looking woman who loved sports, particularly horseback riding, Ms. Potter designed for women like herself who favored casual clothes that were simple yet sophisticated. ''Large numbers of American women want clothes that are refined,'' Ms. Potter said in a 1948 interview with The New York Times. ''I aim to give them in a medium-priced, ready-to-wear costume what they would find in custom-made styles.''         Among the styles she was known for were the two-piece swimsuit consisting of a bra and bloomers, the evening sweater and the sidesaddle-draped skirt. Even for evening, her designs tended to be as casual as a shirt and skirt or pants and a tunic. One outfit of the 1940's combined a rose-colored blouse, a pale blue floor-length skirt and a green belt.         ''She did forward-looking active sports clothes, sundresses, trousers, bathing suits and evening sweaters,'' said Valerie Steele, the chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. ''She wasn't influenced by Paris, but by the modern American leisure life style.''         Ms. Potter was born in Jersey City in 1903. Her affinity for color could be traced to an interest in art she developed while in high school, where she was art editor of the school paper, and continued with studies at the Art Students League. Although she did not know how to sew, she took a draping course and produced what she later described as ''my first weird costume,'' consisting of a long, slinky red wool dress with huge silk sleeves that she dyed to match.         She went on to study at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and after graduation found a job with a dress manufacturer. In 1948 she went into partnership with Martha Stout, a former magazine editor, in a ready-to-wear company called Timbertop. The name came from the turkey farm in West Nyack, N.Y., where Ms. Potter lived with her husband, J. Sanford Potter, an architect.         By the mid-1950's she was in business on her own, working from a barn on her farm with her husband drafting the patterns for her clothing. ''It was very chic to go out there and buy things in a lovely spot,'' recalled Virginia Wagoner Booth, who was then a buyer for Lord & Taylor and became a lifelong friend.         In the late 1950's, Mr. Potter designed and built a Japanese-style house in Fort Ann on Lake Nebo, where the couple grew camellias and raised Dalmatians.         ''They kept horses down in Virginia,'' Ms. Booth said, ''and went down every weekend in the fall to hunt. Clare remained physically active almost until the end. When she took to her bedroom, she could look out at the lake and see the birds. She loved to watch and feed the birds.         ''When Sandy died four years ago,'' she added, referring to Mr. Potter, ''we scattered his ashes on the property. We'll do the same thing with hers.''         Ms. Potter left no survivors.       
         Dr. Katherine Bain, a pediatrician who became a high-ranking and an outspoken Washington official concerned with the well-being of infants and children, died on Jan. 10 in a Washington nursing home she entered in October. She was 101 and had lived in Washington since 1940.         Dr. Bain's family said that she was the author or a co-author of reports that led to the development of child-proof safety caps for medicines and for chemicals in the home, safety-release standards for the doors of refrigerators in order to keep children from being trapped and suffocated, and some of the first Federal guidelines for the nutrition of children.         Her family said that she had carried out a pioneering survey of breast-feeding practices in American hospitals' nurseries and that her findings had led to changes in doctors' opinions of nursing.         In 1940, she joined the Children's Bureau, an agency that was then part of the Department of Labor and is now part of the Department of Health and Human Services. She was the bureau's deputy chief from 1958 to 1964 and became assistant to the director of the Public Health Service in a reorganization in 1969. She devoted herself to children's welfare issues in foreign countries for the next four years and retired.         In a report in The Journal of Pediatrics in 1954, Dr. Bain presented statistics that pointed up the carelessness of American families in protecting children in the home.         Analyzing data supplied by the National Office of Vital Statistics, she said that 400 children under the age of 5 died each year in the United States from accidental poisoning. That rate was four times the rate reported for England and Wales.         Two-thirds of the deaths from accidental poisoning could be prevented, Dr. Bain said, if aspirin, barbiturates, kerosene, lye, lead and arsenic compounds were kept out of the hands of small children.         In a report issued in 1944, Dr. Bain said that World War II had intensified the need for regular advice to mothers on how to keep their babies well. ''We have a bumper crop of babies,'' she said. ''Nearly three million will be born in the United States this year. At the same time we have a shortage of doctors and nurses for the civilian population. About 50 percent of our younger practicing physicians have gone into the armed forces.'' Dr. Bain said the United States would have to work hard and fast to increase its number of clinics aimed at keeping babies well.         After the war, she bemoaned disparities in medical care available in different parts of the United States. Speaking to 500 child health and welfare experts in 1948 in Chicago, she said that a survey had found ''that 1,000 children in Illinois have on an average day twice as much medical care as 1,000 children in Alabama.''         ''One can only conclude,'' Dr. Bain added, ''that children in Alabama are receiving at the most only one-half as much care as they need.''         The honors Dr. Bain received included an award in 1960 from the New York Infirmary for work she had done in pediatrics and public health.         Dr. Bain was born in St. Louis, received a bachelor's degree in 1920 from the University of Missouri and her medical degree in 1925 from Washington University in St. Louis. She spent 13 years in private pediatric practice in St. Louis before going to Washington.         She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Dr. Judith Silberpfennig Kestenberg, a psychoanalyst specializing in child development and the emotional state of Holocaust survivors and their children, died Saturday at her home in Sands Point, N.Y. She was 88.         Dr. Kestenberg headed Child Development Research, which she founded 30 years ago, and Holocaust Child Survivor Studies, both based in Sands Point. With her husband, Milton, she started the research center's International Study of the Organized Persecution of Children.         She and her associates traveled all over the world to collect taped interviews with more than 1,500 child survivors of the Holocaust and their children, as well as the children of Nazis. Fluent in French, German and Polish, she wrote two German books used to teach German children about the Holocaust.         Judith Silberpfennig was born in Tarnov, Poland, and trained in medicine, neurology and psychiatry in Vienna. She came to New York in 1937 and completed her training at Bellevue Hospital and the New York Psychological Institute.         Her husband was born in Lodz, Poland, and became a lawyer there before coming to the United States in 1939. He managed real estate in New York and, after World War II, sued in German courts to seek compensation for Holocaust victims and also organized aid for their children.         They were married in the mid-1940's and became a team in their Holocaust pursuits when he started representing the victims, especially children, before the courts and found that many of them had only vague memories of their ordeals.         Dr. Kestenberg, a professor emeritus at New York University Medical School, taught generations of psychiatrists, psychologists, psychoanalysts and other experts on development, mental health and dance-movement therapy. She also was on the staff and faculty at Long Island Jewish Hospital.         She published seven books and some 150 professional articles. Most recently she edited, with Dr. Charlotte Kahn, ''Children Surviving Persecution: An International Study of Trauma and Healing'' (Greenwood, 1998).         Her other books in print include ''Sexuality, Body Movement and the Rhythms of Development'' (Aronson, 1995); with Dr. Ira Brenner, ''The Last Witness: The Child Survivor of the Holocaust'' (American Psychiatric Press, 1996), and, as editor with Dr. Eva Fogelman, ''Children During the Nazi Reign: Psychological Perspective on the Interview Process'' (Greenwood, 1994).         Milton Kestenberg died in 1991. Dr. Kestenberg is survived by a son, Howard, of Foxborough, Mass.; a daughter, Janet Kestenberg of West Chester, Pa., and four grandchildren.         Her work at Child Development Research is being continued by Dr. Fogelman and associates.       
         Mirra Komarovsky, a sociologist who was an innovative authority on gender, family and education, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 93.         Professor Komarovsky retired in 1970 after 32 years on the faculty of Barnard College. But she returned to Barnard in 1978 and became the chairwoman of its women's studies program for a time.         She was an advocate for women who has been credited with having initiated the contemporary analysis of gender roles with her book ''Women in the Modern World: Their Education and Their Dilemmas'' (1953, Irvington).         In that work she wrote that by making the purposes of women's education clearer, barriers to the attainment of a good life could be removed. As to the respective merits of training for a career and of education meant only for a homemaker, she wrote: ''To disagree with the antifeminist does not necessarily make one a feminist. We can reject the antifeminist program without having to embrace the old-fashioned feminism with its militant hostility towards, and its disparagement of, the homemaker.''         In 1991, Ellen V. Futter, who was Barnard's president at the time, said Professor Komarovsky's ''research has been crucial to our understanding of today's women and the choices they make.''         In that year Professor Komarovsky received the Distinguished Career Award of the American Sociological Association. Earlier, in 1973 and 1974, she was the second female president of the association, which was founded in 1905.         In her book ''Women in College: Shaping New Feminine Identities'' (1985) she described changing views of work, family and men that were held by students in the class of 1983 at Barnard, a women's college.         Reviewing that book in The New York Times Book Review, Adele Simmons, then president of Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., wrote: ''The impact of the women's movement on higher education becomes apparent to even the most skeptical reader.'' She noted that Professor Komarovsky observed bleakly that, as Dr. Simmons put it, ''while attitudes have changed, institutions have not. The gains of the last decade, she warns, will only be secure when society develops permanent measures to support women in the workplace as well as in the home.''         In researching the book, Professor Komarovsky used interviews, questionnaires and surveys to study the attitudes of more than 200 students in the Barnard class of 1983. Fully two-thirds of those young women were afflicted with what she called ''culture shock'' that differed from student to student. As Dr. Simmons put it, ''Ideas about virginity, femininity, sexual preferences and study habits all came under scrutiny as students' friendships evolved and intellectual challenges arose.''         Professor Komarovsky found that 76 percent of the female students planned, at the time they entered Barnard, on combining career, marriage and children in the coming years. And by the time the class graduated, fully 85 percent of its members had come to have that threefold ambition.         Two observations of Professors Komarovsky's that Dr. Simmons found intriguing were her finding that the most highly career-minded students had mothers who had not worked and regretted it -- or mothers who worked and enjoyed it; and her suggestion that the young women sought a mixture of sensitivity, self-awareness and masculinity in men.         Professor Komarovsky also found that most of the women she surveyed found it hard to attain relationships that they considered satisfactory with men, although those women had had chances to interact with men from a variety of backgrounds.         Rather similarly, Professor Komarovsky wrote, on the New York Times Op-Ed page in 1981: ''Young women are becoming aware that the call to equal opportunities for women outside the home is an empty slogan as long as the society insists on traditional role segregation within the family. Some women react to this discovery with equanimity, others with frustration, resignation or indignation. But the real touchstone of their aspirations is the longing for a society in which the rhetoric of equality will be realized as fact. There is no denying that this would require major institutional changes.''         What to do? ''We have much to learn from Sweden,'' Professor Komarovsky wrote: ''Modified work patterns for both sexes, housing patterns permitting more-cooperative ties among child-rearing families, accessible child-care centers of high quality for all economic classes.''         Over the years, she also wrote about various aspects of sociology, including theory and methodology.         She was born in Baku, on the Caspian Sea, in what was then Russia, to Mendel Komarovsky and the former Anna Steinberg, and she was raised largely in Baku. When she was 17, she and her family emigrated to the United States. She attended a high school for a year in Wichita, Kan., where some members of her family lived, and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in 1926 from Barnard, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was taught by the anthropologists Ruth Benedict and Franz Boas.         Nonetheless, as the book ''Women in Sociology'' (1991, Greenwood), edited by Mary Jo Deegan, reports: ''Komarovsky was puzzled'' by Barnard's ''extolling intellectual excellence while discouraging women from pursuing careers.''         She received a master's degree in 1927 and a doctorate in 1940, both in sociology, and both from Columbia. Her doctoral thesis was published as a book, ''The Unemployed Man and His Family'' (1940).         Earlier, she was a co-author of the book ''Leisure: A Suburban Study'' (1934). In addition, before joining the Barnard faculty as an instructor in 1938, she taught at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and was a research assistant at the Yale University Institute of Human Relations, at Columbia, and at the International Institute of Social Research in New York.         She was chairman of the sociology department at Barnard from 1949 to 1968 and was president of the Eastern Sociological Society in 1955 and 1956.         But she recalled years later that in the 1940's and even later, choosing women's issues to do research on was at a cost to her. The field lacked academic glamor and was not likely to further a career.         An early marriage, in 1926, ended in divorce in 1928. In 1940, she married Marcus A. Heyman, who died in 1970.         Her survivors include a sister, Dolly Cheser of Rockville Centre, L.I., and five nieces and one nephew.       
         Gertrude B. Elion, a pioneer in drug research who shared a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988, died on Sunday in Chapel Hill, N.C., where she lived. She was 81.         Ms. Elion developed drugs for use in a vast array of conditions. They included drugs for herpes, leukemia, malaria, gout, immune disorders, and AIDS, and immune suppressants to overcome rejection of donated organs in transplant surgery. In perfecting one compound after another, Ms. Elion worked for four decades with Dr. George H. Hitchings, who died a year ago.         Ms. Elion broke down sex barriers in the male-dominated world of scientific research, becoming one of the rare women to win a Nobel Prize and, even rarer, a scientist who did not have a doctorate.         Ms. Elion shared the Prize with Dr. Hitchings, who hired her as a $50-a-week assistant in 1944. Also sharing the Prize was Sir James Black of Britain, who discovered two classes of drugs, beta blockers, for high blood pressure and heart disease, and H-2 antagonists, for ulcers.         Seldom does the Nobel committee in Stockholm honor employees of pharmaceutical companies, but all three that year worked or had worked for such a company. Ms. Elion and Dr. Hitchings collaborated throughout their careers at the company known today as Glaxo Wellcome. In awarding the Prize to the three scientists, the Nobel committee said their work ''had a more fundamental significance than their discovery of individual drugs.''         Ms. Elion was noted for her precise work, intellectual brilliance and ability to work with others.         Few scientists matched the wide array of drugs that Ms. Elion and Dr. Hitchings developed. The drugs include acyclovir (Zovirax) for herpes; azathioprine (Imuran) to help prevent rejection of transplanted organs and in treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis; allopurinol (Zyloprim) for gout; pyrimethamine (Daraprim) for malaria and trimethoprim (a component of Septra) for bacterial infections.         The two worked in lock step for much of their careers, but Dr. Hitchings was always one step ahead of Ms. Elion; as he moved into a new job, she filled the old one.         The two scientists wrote many papers together, sometimes with her name first, sometimes his. As Ms. Elion said, ''He had two arms of research and I was one of them.''         In 1991, President George Bush awarded Ms. Elion a National Medal of Science, saying her work had ''transformed the world.''         Gertrude Belle Elion was born in New York City on Jan. 23, 1918, and graduated with highest honors in chemistry from Hunter College in 1937. Ms. Elion decided to go into medical research as a teen-ager after her grandfather died of cancer and her father, a dentist and Lithuanian immigrant, encouraged her to develop a career. Her mother was from Russia.         But unable to find a laboratory position because she was a woman, Ms. Elion took a succession of jobs. First, she worked as a laboratory assistant in biochemistry. Then she worked as a food analyst, checking the acidity of pickles and making sure the berries slated for jam were not moldy. Next, she taught chemistry and physics in the New York City school system before earning a master's degree in chemistry at New York University in 1941.         After working for Johnson & Johnson for two years, Ms. Elion, helped by labor shortages in World War II, joined what was then Wellcome Research Laboratories, in Tuckahoe, N.Y., as a biochemist. Ms. Elion later became head of the company's experimental therapy department.         She retired in 1983, but continued working, helping to oversee work on the development of AZT as the first drug against H.I.V., the AIDS virus. Ms. Elion also served on the faculty of Duke University and the University of North Carolina.         While working for the drug company, Ms. Elion felt that her lack of a doctorate was a disadvantage, so she began a Ph.D. program at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. She took courses at night, commuting an hour and a half each way. But she eventually had to quit because she was told she would have to attend school full time to get a Ph.D., and she could not afford to give up her job.         When she gave her first scientific paper at a major meeting, she said she got into an argument with a distinguished scientist and stood her ground because ''I knew I was right.''         Ms. Elion never married. She was once engaged, but her fiance died of a heart infection. Ms. Elion said she would not have advanced in her career if she had chosen to marry and have children because women were not encouraged then to work while their children were young.       
         Sarah Kane, a provocative playwright whose bleak view of the limitations of human relationships and graphic dramatizations of violence and sex earned her a reputation as an enfant terrible of the British theater, died on Saturday at King's College Hospital here. She was 28.         She was found hanged in her room at the hospital, where she was being treated for depression, friends said. The police said they considered the case a suicide.         Ms. Kane exploded onto the London theater scene at 23 with her nihilistic first play, ''Blasted,'' a precocious debut that shocked critics and brought her tabloid denunciations as a promoter of depravity. The play depicted a rampaging soldier raping another man and then gouging out his eyes, eating his tongue and forcing him to cannibalize a dead baby.         No play or playwright had caused such outrage since Edward Bond had an infant being stoned to death in a baby carriage in his play ''Saved'' 30 years earlier on the same Royal Court stage. The theater, which has had a policy of presenting bold new playwrights since its 1956 success with John Osborne's groundbreaking  ''Look Back in Anger,'' stuck by Ms. Kane and staged two of the three other plays she was to write in her short, high-profile career.         One of them, last May's ''Cleansed,'' brought forth a fresh cascade of negative comment with scenes that included the injection of heroin into an eyeball, a savage amputation and a rape with a broom handle. Her other works were  ''Phaedra's Love,'' an adaptation of Seneca, produced at the Gate in 1996,  and ''Crave,'' which opened at last year's Fringe Festival in Edinburgh before moving on to the Royal Court.         Early performances of ''Crave'' listed a pseudonymous author, an effort on her part to free the play from the unwanted celebrity that ''Blasted'' had brought her. She said she had been wounded by the bad publicity, and according to a newspaper account, confided to a friend that ''the only good journalist is a dead journalist.''         While the dominant view of her work was typified by The Daily  Mail's verdict that ''Blasted'' was ''a disgusting feast of filth,'' there were critics who found courage and honesty in her work. One classed her tormented visions as ''the bleached language of truth and poetry'' depicting a world in which love and violence are intertwined.         Reviewing ''Cleansed,'' Benedict Nightingale of The Times of London wrote: ''She is not the gloating opportunist that some reviewers of 'Blasted' thought. She has no less integrity than Pinter or Bond, but, God knows, I would hate to live in her head.''         In contrast to the ferocity of her words, in person she was a pale, thin, soft-spoken presence, living alone in Brixton in South London and writing feverishly in the early morning hours instead of sleeping. She spoke of her moments of mental affliction with a grim appreciation, saying:  ''Many people feel depression is about emptiness, but actually it's about being so full that everything cancels itself out. You can't have faith without doubt, and what are you left with when you can't have love without hate?''         The daughter of a journalist, Ms. Kane grew up in Brentwood in suburban Essex County, east of London, in a household that went through an obsessive Christian redemption process during her youth. At 17 she turned her back on religion, saying that her family's experience was ''a spirit-filled, born-again lunacy.''         To critics of her dramas' dependence on savagery, she said: ''The reading I did in my formative years was the incredible violence of the Bible. It was full of rape, mutilation, war and pestilence.''         She was drawn to theater as a teen-ager, directing school productions of Chekhov's ''Bear'' and Joan Littlewood's ''Oh, What a Lovely War!'' She went on to Bristol University, where she graduated with honors in drama, and to Birmingham University, where she got a master's degree in playwriting.         She was a writer in residence at the experimental company Paines Plough, working with emerging writers at the urging of her friend and fellow playwright Mark Ravenhill, the author of ''Shopping and . . .,'' which played at the New York Theater Workshop last year. She ran workshops in Bulgaria and Spain with the Royal Court International summer school, and her plays were produced by a number of continental companies.         ''People in Britain never realized the extent of her fame throughout Europe,'' said Michael Billington, the  drama critic of The Guardian. ''Wherever I went, I found an extraordinary curiosity about her work and what it said about contemporary Britain.''         Mr. Ravenhill said that Ms. Kane ''talked about suicide all the time -- so much so that it became a joke.'' Her last play ''Crave,'' ends with a suicide, and, interviewed about the play recently, Ms. Kane said: ''Some people seem to find release at the end of it, but I think it's only the release of death. In my other plays it was the release of deciding to go on living despite the fact that it's terrible.''       
         Molly Harrower, a clinical psychologist who devised a Rorschach test for use in group therapy, died Feb. 20 at her home in Gainesville, Fla. She was 93.         Dr. Harrower developed her own set of inkblot cards to administer to groups of Canadian military recruits in World War II. Known as the Harrower Blots, the tests were used to help analyze personality traits through a subject's interpretation of a standard series of inkblot designs.         She also refined diagnostic tests to measure tolerance for stress.         With Dawn Bowers, she edited ''The Inside Story: Self-Evaluations Reflecting Basic Rorschach Types'' (Erlbaum, 1987.)         Among her other titles were ''Appraising Personality'' (1952), ''Personality Change and Development'' (1958), ''The Practice of Clinical Psychology'' (1962), ''Psychodiagnostic Testing: An Empirical Approach'' (1965) and ''The Psychologist at Work'' (revised edition, 1971). She also wrote ''The Therapy of Poetry'' in 1974 and contributed to ''The Quest for the Nazi Personality: A Psychological Investigation of Nazi War Criminals.''         Dr. Harrower, a native of South Africa, was educated in England and graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of London in 1928. She briefly studied dance and painting in France but was persuaded to continue her education on a fellowship at Smith College with the theorist Kurt Koffka, a founder of Gestalt theory.         Working for Koffka, she obtained her Ph.D. at Smith in 1934. The association prompted her book ''Kurt Koffka: An Unwitting Self-Portrait,'' reprinted in 1983.         Over the years, she was in private practice in New York, worked as a psychologist for Federal agencies and taught at universities in various parts of the country before moving to the University of Florida in 1968. She retired in the mid-1970's.         Her husband, Mortimer Lahm, died in 1967.       
         Marion Boyars, an independent publisher whose eclectic and internationally minded list of authors included at least four Nobel Prize winners, died on Monday at her home in London. She was 71.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         In an industry increasingly populated by conglomerates with deep pockets and a penchant for books that appeal to as wide an audience as possible, Mrs. Boyars was rare in her insistence on publishing only what she liked, whether the book was likely to sell or not. ''Most of my publishing is out of enthusiasm,'' she told The New York Times in 1995.         Over the years, often working on a shoestring and struggling to stay afloat, she published some 500 books by such writers as Eudora Welty, Julio Cortazar, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Georges Bataille, Tim O'Brien, Pauline Kael and Ingmar Bergman,  works translated from more than 20 languages. Among the Nobel Prize winners on her list were Heinrich Boll, Elias Canetti, Kenzaburo Oe and Eugenio Montale.         She was born Marion Asmus in New York, and grew up there and in Switzerland. After graduating from Keele University in Staffordshire with a degree in politics, philosophy and economics, she married George Lobbenburg, an American who ran a successful clothing company in Britain. The couple had two daughters.         Divorced in her early 30's, she answered an advertisement in The Bookseller, a London trade magazine, and ended up buying a 50 percent stake in a firm run by the independent publisher John Calder. The two set up business in London under the name Calder & Boyars, publishing works by such authors as Samuel Beckett, Marguerite Duras, Henry Miller, Eugene Ionesco and William S. Burroughs. They also specialized in the writings of modern composers, publishing works by Cage, Ives and Stravinsky, and social commentators including Ivan Illich and Robert Heilbroner.         In an international cause celebre, the company was brought to court here and charged with obscenity in 1966 after publishing ''Last Exit to Brooklyn'' by Hubert Selby Jr. It lost the original case in the Old Bailey but won on appeal two years later after a successful argument by a young John Mortimer.         But Mrs. Boyars, who by then had married her second husband, Arthur Boyars, fell out with her business partner. Taking along the firm's big money-maker, Ken Kesey's ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' among other things, she eventually set up Marion Boyars Publishers, with offices in London and on East 39th Street in Manhattan.         She published about 25 new books a year, becoming a fixture at the annual Frankfurt Book Fair and  mining world literature for anything worthy of publication in English.         Mrs. Boyars formed close friendships with many of her authors. When Michael Ondaatje -- who by then was published by another company -- won the Booker Prize for ''The English Patient'' in 1992, he publicly thanked her for helping to start his career.         She is survived by Mr. Boyars and her two daughters, Susan Quateman of Beverly, Mass., and Catheryn Kilgarriss of London, who is now managing her publishing house.         Correction:  February 11, 1999, Thursday  An obituary last Thursday about Marion Boyars, an independent publisher with offices in London and New York, misspelled the surname of her first husband. He was George Lobbenberg, not Lobbenburg. The obituary also misspelled the surname of one of her daughters. She is Catheryn Kilgarriff, not Kilgarriss.       
         Lili St. Cyr, the tall, blond beauty who left almost nothing to the imagination when she stepped dripping wet out of her signature onstage bubble bath, died on Jan. 29 at her apartment in Hollywood. She was 80.         In a field that began when a Syrian beauty who called herself Little Egypt danced her way into legend at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, Miss St. Cyr was a master of elegant invention.         Her well-choreographed acts included portrayals of famous seductresses, few of whom could hold a candle to Miss St. Cyr.         A woman who welcomed the attentions of well-heeled stage door Johnnies, she had dalliances with the likes of Orson Welles and Victor Mature, but it was her romances with comparatively obscure businessmen that kept her in jewels, furs and lavish hotel accommodations.         But then, as Miss St. Cyr once put it: ''Sex is currency. What's the use of being beautiful if you can't profit from it?''         For all that, her six husbands included a waiter, a dancer, a sometime actor and the restaurateur Armando Orsini, who got his start with financing from Miss St. Cyr.         A native of Minneapolis whose name was originally Willis Marie Van Schaack, Miss St. Cyr moved to Pasadena, Calif., when she was 7, dropped out of school after the ninth grade and was working as a waitress at a Chinese restaurant when she got her start as a showgirl. It didn't take her long to realize that the big money in burlesque lay in nudity.         Adopting the name St. Cyr after reading about the French military academy, she made her first splash at the Gayety Theater in Montreal in 1944 and remained a regional phenomenon for seven years.         She got her big break in Hollywood in 1951 when she was charged with indecent exposure during a bubble bath performance at Ciro's nightclub. By the time she beat the charge in court, the publicity had made her a headliner and led to series of low-budget movies, among them ''The Son of Sinbad'' (1955).         Although she once made as much as $7,000 a week, drug use marred her later years, her money ran out and she was supported by friends and the occasional sale of her photographs.         She is survived by a sister, Rosemary Minsky of Los Angeles.       
         Indrani, a distinguished dancer who familiarized Americans with several styles of India's classical dance as a performer and teacher, died on Friday in Beekman Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Sukanya Wicks, said.         Indrani was an artist of international repute and often appeared before heads of state in her native India and abroad. But she also became a highly respected figure in the dance world of New York after her debut there in 1960. The hallmark of her dancing, a blend of dramatic vibrancy and technical refinement, carried over to her teaching at American colleges and festivals.         Although she had a home in New Delhi until recently, she spent most of the last two decades in the United States, where she toured extensively. In 1961, Indrani was the first dancer presented on a national tour by the Asia Society. She had been on the faculty of the Juilliard School since 1976.         ''Indrani was an exquisite dancer, a great teacher and a true rasika, in the largest spirit of that word, meaning a lover of the arts,'' Rachel Cooper of the Asia Society said yesterday. Ms. Cooper, associate director of the society's performing arts and public programs, also praised Indrani's role as a producer of concerts in New York by younger Indian dancers. She said the society had planned to give Indrani a lifetime achievement award. ''The event will now be a memorial as well,'' Ms. Cooper said.         Unlike many Indian dancers of her generation, Indrani did not specialize in a single school of classical dance but studied with leading gurus in India to master the contrasting styles of Bharata Natyam, Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam and Orissi.         In the 1950's, Indrani was the first professional dancer to perform Orissi onstage; Orissi, then a neglected dance form, was inspired by temple sculpture in the state of Orissa, in eastern India. Indrani was instrumental in the revival of Orissi, introducing it to audiences in India by touring widely there and doing the same abroad when she performed as a soloist or with her ensemble of musicians and dancers.         In championing rarely seen or forgotten classical dance forms, Indrani followed naturally in the footsteps of her mother, Ragini Devi, an American-born dancer who was internationally known for her leading role in the revival of classical dance in India in the 1930's.         As Esther Sherman in Petoskey, Mich., the future Ragini Devi was already in love with Indian dance when she met Ramlal Bajpai in Minneapolis. After she married Bajpai, an Indian scientist and activist for Indian independence, she traveled to India to study dance in 1930. Their daughter, Indrani, was born that year in Madras. In her book ''Dance Dialects of India,'' Ragini Devi described how she would take the infant Indrani on her own visits to gurus. As a dancer, Indrani was her  ''alter ego,'' Ragini Devi wrote. ''Her dance career is a continuation of mine.''         Ragini Devi, who died in 1982, made her last stage appearance at a memorable concert in 1979 at New York University. She was joined by Sukanya, Indrani's daughter and also a dancer, as well as Indrani. The vivacity of all three generations came into play.         Indrani's playfulness and gaiety at that performance were typical of her vivid personality. In the dramatic Kuchipudi solos, Indrani's quick shifts in characterization were always subtle and deep.         Having started at age 5 in her mother's company, she was steeped in the content of classical dance. As a professional, she began with Bharata Natyam, where she could display the rhythmic complexity of her footwork. But mime within this style and in others allowed her to exhibit her brilliant dramatic gifts.         The Indian Government sponsored Indrani's tours. Her warmth and artistry, as well as the beauty of her costumes and presentations, made her a perfect choice. In 1961 she performed for President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during Nehru's official visit to Washington. Indrani received the Indian Government's national award, Padma Shri, and the Sangeet Natak Akadami Award in the performing arts.         Indrani married Habib Rahman, who was named India's chief architect and who died in 1995. In addition to her daughter, of Orr's Island, Me., she is survived by her son, Ram Rahman, of New Delhi, and two grandsons, Wardreath Wicks of Orr's Island, and Habib Wicks of New York City.       
         Iris Murdoch, a prodigiously inventive and idiosyncratic British writer whose 26 novels offered lively plots, complex characters and intellectual speculation, died yesterday at a nursing home in Oxford, England. She was 79 and had Alzheimer's disease.         Her struggle with Alzheimer's was documented recently in ''Elegy for Iris,'' a memoir by her husband, the critic and novelist John Bayley, who was at her bedside when she died.         Miss Murdoch's first novel was published in 1954 and in a career that lasted for more than four decades, her fiction received many honors, including the Booker Prize for ''The Sea, the Sea,'' the Whitbread Literary Award for Fiction for ''The Sacred and Profane Love Machine'' and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for ''The Black Prince.'' Although she was made a Dame of the British Empire, she rarely garnered the attention given to gaudier contemporaries. She spent much of her career quietly teaching and writing, away from lecture tours, prize committees and television appearances.         Along with novels, she produced a half a dozen works on philosophy, several plays, critical writing on literature and modern ideas and poetry.         Miss Murdoch had a background in philosophy -- she knew and wrote about Jean-Paul Sartre, studied with Ludwig Wittgenstein and was a lecturer in philosophy at Oxford University -- and her fiction grappled with such questions as the nature of good and evil. This led many who knew her work superficially to assume that her novels were philosophical explorations of the origins of morality and behavior and too esoteric or intellectually rigorous for a general audience.         In fact, many of Miss Murdoch's novels are exuberantly melodramatic, offering bemused records of romantic or erotic follies, as well as more somber battles between individuals representing moral good and its opposite. Her characters, drawn largely from the middle class, are described with loving exactitude and in such depth that their struggles to define what it means to live a good life take on dramatic force.         In Books, Happiness And Moral Lessons         Far from viewing fiction as another and lesser way of dealing with philosophical questions, Miss Murdoch argued that literature was meant ''to be grasped by enjoyment,'' and that the art of the tale was ''a fundamental form of thought'' in its own right. The ideal reader, she told one interviewer, was ''someone who likes a jolly good yarn and enjoys thinking about the book as well, about the moral issues.'' In another interview she went further, asserting that good art offers ''uncontaminated'' happiness that also teaches ''how to look at the world and to understand it; it makes everything far more interesting.''         Her belief in literature had its inception in her happy and book-filled childhood. Jean Iris Murdoch was born in Dublin on July 15, 1919, the only child of British and Irish parents. When she was a year old her family moved to London, where her father, Wills John Hughes Murdoch, joined the civil service. In interviews she remembered that as a child she had existed ''in a perfect trinity of love.'' Her mother, the former Irene Alice Richardson, who had trained as an opera singer, was a ''beautiful, lively, witty woman with a happy temperament.''         Her father began discussing books with her early on and encouraged her to read widely. She progressed rapidly from Lewis Carroll (one of her favorites) and Robert Louis Stevenson to more adult fare. Her great pleasure in reading, and her early attempts to write stories led to the conviction, which she formed as a child, that she would become a writer.         She attended boarding school in Bristol, and in 1938 entered Somerville College, a women's college at Oxford, where she studied the classics, ancient history and philosophy. She graduated with honors in 1942 and immediately took a job with the Treasury. In 1944 she began working for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which helped Europeans displaced by World War II. The somber experiences of the war had a profound impact on her thinking. Close friends died while in service, and her work, often on the front lines, with poor and elderly refugees was hard but instructive.         If her childhood had been mostly idyllic, there was, she later noted, at  least one shadow falling across her memories of those years: her family members were largely ''wanderers,'' cut off from their Irish relations and their roots. Working with refugees led her to reflect further on the place of the exile in modern society, as well as on the sources of evil, raising questions that she would pursue in many novels.         After leaving the United Nations, Miss Murdoch took up further study in philosophy at Cambridge University, where she worked with Wittgenstein. While she expressed no lasting allegiance to his school of thought, she said her studies with him  spurred her development as a writer.         In 1948 she became a fellow and tutor at St. Anne's College at Oxford, where she remained for 15 years as a lecturer in philosophy. It was a particularly heady time for anyone concerned with the study and application of philosophical thought; new schools of philosophy were contending for primacy and often combative works were being produced to define these emerging disciplines.         Miss Murdoch had met Sartre, the most visible proponent of existentialism, while working with refugees in  Belgium. Existentialism, with its focus on individual will, appealed to her, but she found its emphasis on the primacy of the self disturbing.  Her first published work, ''Sartre: Romantic Rationalist'' (1953), was a serious, clear explanation of existentialism and its place in contemporary thought. While it was balanced, it was not uncritical: Miss Murdoch felt that existentialism encouraged an almost hermetic focus on the self, ignoring the corrosive implications of such a perspective on society.         Her study paid special attention to Sartre's fiction. She had already written and discarded several novels, but now she had become absorbed with how fiction expressed ideas and the ways fiction and ideas could best be blended. ''Under the Net,'' her first published novel, appeared to generally positive reviews. It focused on the picaresque adventures of a free-spirited Irishman making the rounds of some of the more raffish areas of London and Paris. A reviewer in The Times Literary Supplement said the work seemed to announce the emergence of ''a brilliant talent.''         The novel signaled the beginning of an industrious and prolific career.  Miss Murdoch published, on average, a novel every two years for the next four decades. Her work, while varied in setting and tone, rarely moved far from several central preoccupations and themes.         She first encountered existentialist writings while working with refugees, and she drew deeply from her fascination with those experiences in  her second novel, ''Flight From the Enchanter'' (1956). It concerns the  well-intentioned, conventionally liberal Rose Keep, who attempts to offer solace to two Polish brothers, refugees from the war. Her efforts founder because she cannot see the brothers as something more than symbols of displaced, wounded humanity.         Revisiting Themes Of Pure Love         The double-edged nature of love figures often in Miss Murdoch's fiction. True love, she asserted in the essay ''The Sublime and the Good,'' was perhaps the best way to overcome isolation and the absorption with one's crippled and constricted self. ''Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real,'' she argued.         Many of the figures in her fourth novel, ''The Bell'' (1958), are crippled by their inability to clearly see, and thus to truly love, those around them. ''The Bell'' reached a new level of sophistication for Miss Murdoch, displaying elements that would  become hallmarks of her fiction: effortless shifting between the grim and the humorous; deft marshaling of a large, varied cast of characters and numerous subplots, and creation of fables or myths that could suggest the struggle between true and diminished forms of love.         In many of Miss Murdoch's novels, romantic disasters, suicides and even murder are set in motion by a character who is brilliant and ferociously self-absorbed. Such figures, usually men, often go beyond egotism into evil.         In ''A Fairly Honorable Defeat'' (1970), a biologist who helps create biological weapons sets out to destroy those around him. But goodness, Miss Murdoch suggests, while imperiled, is also resilient.         In ''The Sacred and Profane Love Machine'' (1974), the only character who comes close to true altruism is destroyed. But the novel suggests that her death may have opened the  hearts of those around her to a better, more responsible life.         ''The Sea, the Sea'' (1978), which received the Booker Prize, is considered one of Miss Murdoch's best novels. Its protagonist, a retired theatrical director trying to win back his first love, is not so much evil as simply self-absorbed and dangerously certain of his limited view of the world.         ''A Severed Head'' (1961) was a black farce about infidelity, incest and violence.         Storytelling And Large Truths         Miss Murdoch was always balancing the demands of storytelling with the more urgent need to examine how the truth of a fleeting life reflected the larger, permanent truths of  existence.         ''The Red and the Green'' charts the fates of two friends who find themselves on opposite sides during Ireland's 1916 Easter rebellion against British rule.         ''The Nice and the Good'' follows  the efforts of a decent man to uncover the reasons for a colleague's suicide and extricate himself from the seamy web of blackmail and the occult that he uncovers.         ''Italian Girl'' traces the struggle of a young man to liberate himself from the corrosive effects of family secrets and a shallow, destructive image of love.         The tension generated by this iconoclastic approach to fiction has made Murdoch's novels unique and controversial. Her fiction takes a distinctive vigor and texture from its combination of the usual elements of a tale with a sustained, sophisticated inquiry into such concepts as the defining characteristics of goodness, the nature of morality, the place of faith in everyday life and the conflict between spiritual and carnal love.         When most other writers were content to dwell on the heated specifics of individual lives or to simply offer a catalogue of society's ills, Miss Murdoch dared to suggest that fiction should be a means of dealing with life's largest and most basic issues and a way to learn about moral behavior.         This quest ''for a passion beyond any center of self,'' as David Bromwich wrote in The New York Times Book Review, made her fiction unlike that of any other contemporary Western writer. It also let her in for  both considerable acclaim and criticism. Harold Bloom, while praising her ''formidable combination of intellectual drive and storytelling exuberance'' in a review of her novel ''The Good Apprentice'' in The Times, and noting her ''mastery'' in ''representing the maelstrom of falling in love,'' also found that her narrative voice often lacked authority, ''being too qualified and fussy.''         Anthony Burgess, while noting the highly original ''synthesis of the traditional and revolutionary'' in her work and praising her talent for creating stories that were ''both thoroughly realistic yet at the same time loaded with symbols,'' also argued in his 1967 book ''The Novel Now'' that her characters were too often ''caught up in a purely intellectual  pattern.'' In a memorable phrase, he contended that, while Miss Murdoch had a rare ability ''to dredge that world of the strange and mysterious'' that rested ''on the boundary of the ordinary,'' her work rarely offered a convincing portrait of the more common realms of life.         In a body of work so large, both admirers and critics were bound to find material to advance their arguments, and this was true as well in her later novels, such as ''The Message to the Planet'' (1989) and ''The Green Knight'' (1994).         But neither criticism nor praise seemed much to affect her. She said that she never read her reviews. She rarely read modern writers, preferring the British and European novelists of the 19th century (Jane Austen,  Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Henry James, Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky), with whom she felt an affinity, describing them as ''moralistic writers who portray the complexity of morality and the difficulty of being good.''         She lived for many years in the small village of Steeple Aston, near  Oxford, in a house crowded with books and paintings. The quiet life there, and in the house in Oxford to which she moved in 1986, has been described memorably by her husband, an Oxford don, in ''Elegy for Iris,'' his memoir of their lives together.         John Bayley fell in love with Iris Murdoch when he was in his late 20's and she was in her early 30's; she passed his window on a bicycle. ''I indulged the momentary fantasy that nothing had ever happened to her; that she was simply bicycling about, waiting for me to arrive,'' he wrote. ''She was not a woman with a past or an unknown present.'' They were married in 1956; he is her only close survivor.         The novelist Mary Gordon, reviewing ''Elegy for Iris'' in The Times, touched on their relationship. ''Radical privacy, sealing compartments of her life off from each other, was always a condition of Iris Murdoch's selfhood, and anyone who married her had to deal with that. From the beginning, she had friendships that she kept from Bayley, and love affairs that he was meant to understand had nothing to do with him. There are some hints that this was not always easy, but Bayley rose to the challenge.'' Ms. Gordon then quotes Mr. Bayley's memoir: ''In early days, I always thought it would be vulgar -- as well as not my place -- to give any indications of jealousy, but she knew when it was there, and she soothed it just by being the self she always was with me, which I soon knew to be wholly and entirely different from any way that she was with other people.''         Slipping Into A Baffling Darkness         In 1995 Miss Murdoch told an interviewer that she was experiencing severe writer's block, noting that the struggle to write had left her in ''a  hard, dark place.'' In 1996, Mr. Bayley announced that she had Alzheimer's disease, which she had suffered for five years by the time she died. Her final three weeks were spent in a nursing home. If ''Elegy for Iris'' offers a moving evocation of a great love story, it also provides a grim record of watching the personality of a loved one gradually dwindle under the burden of fear, bafflement and grief.         She was, Miss Murdoch confided to one of her friends, ''sailing into the darkness.'' Mr. Bayley's descriptions of his struggle to understand his wife's suffering, to find ways to ameliorate it and to come to grips with the physical demands of his new responsibilities and to understand the conflicting emotions aroused in him by the experience are exact, penetrating and unsparing. Miss Murdoch became like ''a very nice 3-year-old,'' her husband said, and she needed to be fed, bathed and changed.         The note on which the book concludes, however, is one of reconciliation, and of a painfully won serenity. ''Every day,'' Mr. Bayley wrote of their lives together in Miss Murdoch's last years, ''we are physically closer. . . . She is not sailing into the dark. The voyage is over, and under the dark escort of Alzheimer's, she has arrived somewhere. So have I.''       
         Bidu Sayao, a Brazilian soprano whose gossamer voice and vivacious personality made her one of the most popular stars of the Metropolitan Opera from the late 1930's through the 40's, died yesterday at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport, Me. She was 94 and lived in Lincolnville, Me.         The diminutive Miss Sayao, restricted by her small voice to the lyric and coloratura repertory, often expressed regret that she could not sing such heavier roles as Tosca and Butterfly. But her interpretations of Manon, Violetta in ''La Traviata,'' Mimi in ''La Boheme'' and Susanna in ''Le Nozze di Figaro,'' among other roles, received consistent praise, with critics stressing her expressiveness, sensibility, girlishness and excellence of phrasing.         Balduina de Oliveira Sayao was born on May 11, 1902, into a wealthy family in Rio de Janeiro. Although her childhood dramatizations in front of a mirror convinced her that she had a future as an actress, the family conviction that it was a metier for loose women dashed that hope. Piano lessons, too, were a decided failure, but when she was 13 a music-loving uncle helped arrange lessons with a celebrated former soprano, Elena Theodorini.         After several years of study and  appearances at the court of Romania, her teacher's native country, Miss Sayao studied recital repertory in France with the tenor Jean de Reszke. An eventual audition in Rome led to an engagement as Rosina in ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia,'' and by her late 20's she had sung at many opera houses in Europe and South America.         In a review of her first performance in the United States, a Town Hall recital on Dec. 30, 1935, Noel Strauss of The New York Times wrote that Miss Sayao's voice ''if light, was one of pronounced sweetness; silky and caressing when used at its best.''         Soon afterward, Arturo Toscanini, who was preparing an all-Debussy program for the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra -- precursor of the New York Philharmonic -- engaged the young soprano whose years in France had perfected her pronunciation, and gave her one week to learn ''La Demoiselle Elue.'' A short time later the Metropolitan Opera, which had recently lost Lucrezia Bori, a stalwart of French repertory, to retirement, invited Miss Sayao to sing the title role in ''Manon'' in February 1937.         In The Times, Olin Downes wrote of the debut, ''Miss Sayao triumphed as a Manon should, by manners, youth and charm, and secondly by the way in which the voice became the vehicle of dramatic expression.'' The singer never again left the Western Hemisphere. The Met was her base, the San Francisco Opera her alternate headquarters and South America the only foreign territory to hear her in live performance.         A month after her first Met ''Manon,'' Miss Sayao sang the lead role in ''La Traviata.'' Two weeks later she sang her first ''Boheme'' in the house, and Howard Taubman wrote in The Times that she sang with ''freshness and simplicity.''         In all, the soprano sang more than 200 performances of 12 different roles at the Metropolitan. She made several opera and song recordings and gave many recitals. In December 1943 she and the baritone Lawrence Tibbett were soloists with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Artur Rodzinski for the inaugural concert at the City Center of Music and Drama. The United States Government decorated her for her many performances in Army camps and hospitals during World War II.         Miss Sayao resigned from the Metropolitan Opera in April 1952, a month before her 50th birthday. ''I am proud, and I did not want to wait until I was asked to leave,'' she said in an interview in 1987. And in 1957 after a performance of ''La Demoiselle Elue,'' which seemed to bring her career full circle, she abruptly retired, canceling many engagements for subsequent seasons. She told an interviewer years later that it was hard to stop but that being able to smoke again was a pleasure.         The soprano's first marriage, to the Italian impresario Walter Mocchi, who headed the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires for a time, ended in divorce. She and the baritone Giuseppe Danise were married in 1947, and he gave up his career to manage hers.         After her husband's death in 1963, she divided her time between the Salisbury Hotel in Manhattan and her home in Lincolnville. She was  often seen at vocal events in New York City, a tiny woman in high heels, her reddish hair pulled back in the chignon familiar to several decades of opera fans.         On a Metropolitan Opera broadcast in December 1989, the soprano plaintively gave a personal summation of her career: ''I had something appealing, I don't know what. The sincerity of my singing. I give my heart. I give my soul. I give myself.''         Correction:  March 16, 1999, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary of the Brazilian soprano Bidu Sayao on Saturday misstated her age. She was 96, not 94. The obituary also omitted Ms. Sayao's most celebrated recording. The piece, ''Bachiana Brasileira No. 5,'' is a vocalise -- an aria without words -- transcribed for her by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos.       
         Vivian Hallinan, the striking matriarch of one of San Francisco's best-known and most colorful political families, died on Tuesday at a granddaughter's home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 88.         Mrs. Hallinan, the widow of Vincent Hallinan, a fiery socialist lawyer who died in 1995, made a multi-million-dollar fortune by buying apartment buildings during the Great Depression.         ''She didn't trust the stock market, so she didn't get wiped out, and had money to buy buildings real cheap,'' said Shane Hallinan, the granddaughter at whose home Mrs. Hallinan died.         Her profits financed her political causes, which included leftist movements like the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. ''She was aware of the contradiction,'' Shane Hallinan said. ''But she believed she was able to do something to better the world with the money she made.''         A native San Franciscan, Mrs. Hallinan was born Oct. 21, 1910, to Ed Moore and Katherine Lagomarsino Moore. After her parents' brief marriage ended, she was reared by her mother, whose maiden name she adopted, and by a series of immigrant Italian relatives. She attended the University of California at Berkeley.         After her marriage in 1932 to Mr. Hallinan Mrs. Hallinan reared six sons. She wrote about the experience in ''My Wild Irish Rogues'' (Doubleday & Company, 1952).         Politics was her passion as much as parenting, however. She helped her husband with his campaign in 1952 as the Presidential candidate of the Progressive Party. She also held the family together when he spent six months in jail in the 1950's for contempt of court, in connection with his support of the labor organizer Harry Bridges, who was accused of being a Communist Party member.         Mrs. Hallinan, elegant and chestnut-haired, served 30 days for participating in the 1964 civil rights demonstrations in San Francisco. She was also tear-gassed once, in Chile in the early 1980's.         ''She found the experience in jail heartening,'' Shane Hallinan said. ''She was used to being judged by her movie-star looks or her money, and here she was with just all these other women. The other stuff didn't matter, and she liked that.''         With her during that civil rights demonstration were all of her sons, including Terence Hallinan, now the district attorney for San Francisco.  ''Everyone was there except my father, who stayed outside with the bail money,'' said Patrick Hallinan of Kentfield, Calif.         Besides Terence and Patrick, Mrs. Hallinan is survived by three other sons: Matthew, Daniel and Conn, all of Berkeley, and 16 grandchildren.       
         Dr. Hildegard Elizabeth Peplau, a nursing educator who played a major role in developing the theory and practice of psychiatric and mental health nursing, died on March 17 at her home in Sherman Oaks, Calif. She was 89.         Dr. Peplau wrote a seminal text, ''Interpersonal Relations in Nursing: A Conceptual Frame of Reference for Psychodynamic Nursing,''  which was completed in 1948 and published in 1952. It was translated into several languages and left an impact in much of the world.         She introduced the concept of nurse-patient relationship, an interpersonal approach that has since been integrated into nursing education and practice. With this, she was considered a force in elevating nursing to a profession.         Colleagues regarded Dr. Peplau as the ''mother of psychiatric nursing,'' said Dr. Grayce M. Sills, professor emeritus at the Ohio State University College of Nursing and a fellow of the American Academy of Nursing.         Referring to the general acceptance of Dr. Peplau's interpersonal process, Dr. Sills added, ''It has been argued that Dr. Peplau's life and work produced the greatest changes in nursing practice since Florence Nightingale.''         Dr. Peplau's book was also deemed highly unusual at the time because it had been written by a nurse, without a physician as a co-author. Its English version remains in print with a 1991 edition from Springer.         Dr. Peplau was born in Reading, Pa., and witnessed the deadly influenza epidemic of 1918, which defined her understanding of the impact of illness and death on families.         She graduated from Pottstown Hospital School of Nursing in 1931 and from Bennington College in 1942. She served in the Army Nurse Corps as a first lieutenant in World War II and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1947 and a doctorate in education in 1953.         She studied psychology for a certificate from the William Alanson White Institute (1953), and that study inspired her to adapt the interpersonal approach for the nursing profession.         Dr. Peplau directed the graduate program of psychiatric nursing at Columbia Teachers College from 1948 to 1953 and its counterpart at Rutgers University after that. She retired from Rutgers as a professor emeritus in 1974.         She lectured worldwide and wrote articles for many publications. She was also executive director and president of the American Nurses Association, which inducted her into its Hall of Fame last year, and was a board member of the International Council of Nurses, which honored her with its highest award, the Christiane Reimann Prize, in 1997.         Dr. Peplau is survived by a sister, Bertha Reppert, of Mechanicsburg, Pa., and a foster brother, John D. Forster, of Reading.       
         Her hair is boyishly cropped, her clothes are casual, and while riding her bike around Cape Cod she could pass as a college freshman.         But Dr. Lene Vestergaard Hau is no freshman. A teacher at Harvard University and an accomplished experimenter, she has gained a formidable reputation in a branch of science traditionally dominated by men: physics.         Most of all, she is known as the scientist who slowed light down to a walk.         Dr. Lene (pronounced LEE-nuh) Hau, at 39, is rapidly reaching the top of her profession, her colleagues agree. On Feb. 18 the prestigious scientific journal Nature selected for its cover article a paper of which she was the leading author, and it caused a mild sensation.         In their paper, Dr. Hau, with Dr. Steve E. Harris of Stanford University and two of Dr. Hau's Harvard students, reported the results of their experiment in which a beam of laser light was slowed to the astonishingly low speed of 38 miles an hour. (By comparison, light in a vacuum travels about 186,000 miles per second.)         Dr. Hau's laboratory at the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge (where she conducts research with the help of her graduate and post-doctoral students from Harvard) ) is one of a handful of organizations studying the interactions of lasers with a very peculiar kind of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.         It was by shining precisely tuned lasers on such a condensate, or cloud, of ultra-cold sodium atoms that Dr. Hau and her team reduced the speed of a light beam to a pace slower than her bicycle.         The achievement, noted by many newspapers, magazines and broadcasters, was a tour de force of pure physics, and it may also herald great practical applications.         Among them could be the development of optical switches that could enormously improve the performance of computers.         Dr. Hau presides over a half million dollars' worth of apparatus at the Rowland Institute, a research organization founded by the late Edwin H. Land, the inventor of Polaroid instant photography, to support innovative research. Unmarried, Dr. Hau lives near the laboratory and spends most of her time either at the laboratory or pondering the problems her next experiment will present.         ''I find that the shower is a very good place to think things out,'' she said, ''but sometimes I forget what I'm doing. Once I even stepped into the shower with my clothes on.''         Although increasing numbers of women have entered the sciences in recent years, their participation in physics remains very limited. Of several hundred scientists attending a typical physics meeting, only a half dozen or so are likely to be women. Dr. Hau is often asked how she came to be one of them.         ''For one thing,'' she said, ''I was lucky to be a Dane. Denmark has a long scientific tradition that included the great Niels Bohr, one of the founders of quantum theory.         In Denmark, physics is widely respected by laymen as well as scientists, and laymen contribute to physics. For instance, research in quantum mechanics has been supported in Denmark by the makers of Carlsberg beer since the 1920's. I myself was supported as a graduate student for one year by a Carlsberg scholarship.''         Dr. Hau was born in Vejle, a small town not far from the University of Aarhus, on the east coast of Jutland.         ''Neither of my parents had any background in science,'' she said. ''My father was in the heating business and my mother worked in a store. But both of them believed in giving me the same advantages as my brother, which was very important to my education.''         A prodigy who skipped 10th grade, she was immediately accepted at a ''gymnasium,'' a European upper school roughly equivalent to the first two years of college in the United States.         From childhood Dr. Hau was fascinated by mathematics, especially geometry. ''All my life I have needed to visualize things, even abstractions. Without a visualization in my head I'm lost, and geometry is very visual.''         This approach to physics works, she said, even for visualizing mathematical abstractions like Hilbert spaces (named for David Hilbert, a German mathematician), which combine a variety of physical states (or ''wave functions'') into a single mathematical entity.         ''When I first entered Arhus University,'' Dr. Hau recalled, ''I was bored by physics. They just taught us thermodynamics and classical mechanics, and that bored me. But I loved mathematics. I would rather do mathematics than go to the movies in those days.         ''But after a while I discovered quantum mechanics, and that got me interested in physics again, and I've been hooked ever since.''         Quantum mechanics is a system of probabalistic rules governing the discontinuous jumps in behavior of very small particles of matter and energy. Transistors and many other electronic devices work according to these rules.         Dr. Hau was awarded her Ph.D. from the University of Arhus in 1991 after completing a dissertation on the ''channeling'' of electrons along strings of atoms in a silicon crystal, as if the atomic strings were miniature wave guides, like the optical fibers used to guide light.         Along the way she acquired a working knowledge of English, German and French. French proved to be vital to her work during seven months of research she conducted at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva.         ''The scientific papers were written in English, but the meetings announcing the availability of various particle beams were all in French, and without French I would have been lost,'' Dr. Hau said.         ''I loved it at CERN. The people were really passionate about their work. Even at 3 in the morning you would always see people in the labs.''         In 1988, while completing her Ph.D. work, Dr. Hau made her first trip to the United States, looking for a post-doctoral job. By then she had received a one-year stipend from Carlsberg so she could accept a post-doctoral university appointment without pay. Among the scientists she met was Dr. Jene A. Golovchenko, a physicist at Harvard, who also worked at the Rowland Institute.         ''I told Jene what I had been doing and also that I wanted a complete change in direction. I wanted to work on cooling atoms,'' she said. ''He told me he didn't know anything about cooling atoms but said we could work together on it, so I was given a post-doctoral appointment. Later, the Rowland Institute gave me a staff job and my own laboratory.''         Although she is a permanent United States resident, Dr. Hau has not applied for citizenship.         ''I would like to be a citizen so I could vote,'' she said, ''but I would have to give up Danish citizenship, and that would make me feel disloyal. Last week the Danish comedian and pianist Victor Borge performed in Boston for two straight hours -- and it was hilarious -- even though he is 90 years old. Now there's a Dane for you, one to make you feel proud.''         Although much of Dr. Hau's work is done on a blackboard, she is also a ''dirty hands'' physicist who builds and adjusts much of her own complex apparatus.         In 1994, she and Dr. Golovchenko designed and built an ingenious atomic beam source called the ''candlestick,'' which is now a part of Dr. Lau's light-slowing apparatus. The device incorporates a ''wick'' made of gold-plated stainless-steel cloth, which soaks up hot molten sodium metal and wicks the sodium up to a heater that vaporizes it. A jet of hot sodium atoms then shoots out of a pinhole into the cooling apparatus that chills them to a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero.         An atom at room temperature moves at high speed, but when it is bombarded from three directions by laser beams it loses energy and slows down: it cools off. In a complicated series of stages, Dr. Hau's apparatus uses lasers to cool the sodium atoms part way, and then evaporates the fastest (and therefore hottest) of them, saving the coolest in the trap. At the end of this cooling operation (which takes 38 seconds), the cloud of atoms in the trap has been reduced to only 50 one-billionths of a degree above absolute zero, a temperature far colder than any in nature, even in the depths of space.         Because of the Uncertainty Principle -- one of the fundamental rules of quantum mechanics -- the more precisely the momentum (or velocity) of a particle is known, the less precisely is it possible to measure its position, and vice versa. At exactly zero degrees (which in practice could never be reached), a particle would have zero momentum, a precise value. This would mean that the particle's position would be highly uncertain; it might be found anywhere within a large volume of possible places.         The volume occupied by each ultra-cold sodium atom in Dr. Hau's trap expands enormously, so much so that atoms in the trap are forced to overlap and merge into what physicists call a Bose-Einstein condensate (named for the theorists Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein), in which the atoms' quantum wave functions are combined.         Once the condensate is created, a ''coupling'' laser tuned to resonate with the trapped mass of atoms is beamed into the trap chamber so that the atoms and photons of light become ''entangled'' with each other, behaving as if they were a single entity. A pulsed laser probe is then shot into the ''laser dressed'' condensate from a different direction, and some of its light passes through, but at a speed 20 million times as slow as the speed of light in a vacuum.         A table covered with a labyrinth of little mirrors guides a network of beams requiring perfect adjustment, and Dr. Hau and her team work long and tedious hours, sometimes around the clock. Their eyes become strained from exposure to the glaring yellow laser spots reflected from the apparatus.         ''Of course, we have to eat while we work, and we like pepperoni pizza, but we have to be careful to keep the optical system clean,'' she said. ''Each cooling cycle for the sodium atoms takes 38 seconds, and that gives us just enough time to take a bite of pizza, change hands and flip up one of the mirrors in the optical system to prepare for the next cooling cycle. It takes some practice.''         Dr. Hau is considering an experiment to measure localized wave functions in the cooled atom trap, allowing her to explore the structure of the condensate.         ''Some people think it might be dangerous, that the trap might explode. But the most worthwhile physics is often a bit dangerous,'' she said.         ''When you're looking at the computer monitor and you suddenly see what you had hoped you would find,'' she added, ''it's the greatest feeling in the world.''         SCIENTIST AT WORK: LENE VESTERGAARD HAU       
         Harriet M. Waddy, one of the two highest-ranking black officers in the Women's Army Corps in World War II and its wartime adviser on racial issues, died on Feb. 21 in Las Vegas, Nev. She was 94.         In April 1943, First Officer Harriet West, as Harriet Waddy was then known, made a radio broadcast on behalf of the Army, urging black women to get into uniform.         She said that joining the segregated military ''and accepting a situation which does not represent an ideal of democracy'' was not ''a retreat from our fight'' but ''our contribution to its realization.''         The 6,500 black women who joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, created in 1942, and the organization that succeeded it a year later, the Women's Army Corps, joined an institution in which segregation was the official policy. Many were used as uniformed domestic servants, assigned to cleaning officers' clubs. Harriet West tried to ease their distress after she was promoted to major and named an aide to the WAC director, Col. Oveta Culp Hobby.         Major West and Maj. Charity Adams, who commanded the only unit of black Wacs sent overseas in World War II, were the only two black women to attain the rank of major in the wartime WAC.         ''Harriet was charming,'' Charity Adams Earley recalled last week from her home in Dayton, Ohio. ''She looked good, and she was well-disciplined, as we were all trained to be.''         Major West's composure must have been sorely tested when she was dispatched to the South to hear the grievances of black Wacs.         Lula Jones Garrett, a reporter for The Philadelphia Afro-American, who accompanied Major West on a trip from Atlanta to Fort McClellan in Anniston, Ala., in 1944, wrote how Major West ''had been insulted by a white conductor whom she had asked to hand her baggage from the train.''         Major West fought racially insulting Army decrees. On a visit to Wacs at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, she recommended that ''all reference to white and colored personnel be completely eliminated'' from official memorandums on information boards. She said that would bring ''less embarrassment to the colored personnel'' and a ''feeling that a forward step has been made toward democracy.''         Service in the wartime military, in her view, would help blacks gain acceptance. She said that military service would give black women a chance to ''show their ability'' and be ''of future benefit to the whole race.''         Harriet M. Hardin was born in Jefferson City, Mo., on June 20, 1904, and brought up by a grandmother after her mother died. A graduate of Kansas State University, she worked during the Depression as an aide to Mary McLeod Bethune, the director of the National Youth Administration's Division of Negro Affairs and later a civilian adviser to the WAC.         She entered the WAC officer candidate school at Fort Des Moines in 1942. She was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1948 and retired from the armed forces in 1952. Then she worked for the Federal Aviation Administration and counseled troubled girls at a Job Corps center in Oregon.         A longtime resident of Eugene, Ore., Mrs. Waddy moved to Las Vegas in 1998 to live with a friend, Barbara Connolly, when her health declined. She was married four times but left no immediate survivors. In the war years, she was married to Dr. Charles West, a physician. She and her fourth husband, Maj. Edward Waddy, were divorced.         Another friend, Marie Marshall of Eugene, recalled how Mrs. Waddy was still bowling and driving a car into her 90's. Mrs. Marshall viewed her as a strong and independent woman who said, ''The Frank Sinatra song 'My Way' was just perfect.''       
         Ann Corio, the auburn-haired, green-eyed queen of burlesque whose long-running show, ''This Was Burlesque,'' kept alive the art of strippers and the comedy of baggy-pants clowns in the age of the X-rated film, died on March 1 at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. Ms. Corio, a resident of Cliffside Park, N.J., kept her age a closely guarded secret, but was believed to be in her 80's.         A survivor of a shapely sisterhood that included Gypsy Rose Lee, Maggie Hart and Georgia Sothern, Ms. Corio lasted long enough to reach the iconic status that enabled her to present the striptease as a put-on.         ''We emphasize comedy,'' she said one day in 1976 as she discussed her show, which began Off Broadway in 1962 and continued for at least two decades in various productions, tours and revivals with Ms. Corio as author, director, star and interlocutor. ''There is no total nudity. The girls are lovely and artistic, and they're terribly, terribly pretty.         ''What is called burlesque today isn't that at all. Those girls aren't artists. They just take clothes off, and they don't even do that very well. Burlesque is exactly what it says it is. It's from the Italian word burlare, to satirize, to laugh. That's what we do, and we are not offensive.''         Those old enough to remember when strippers in burlesque houses were regarded as hot stuff could recall Ms. Corio as a reigning beauty of the East Coast wheel of burlesque houses that extended from Boston to Washington, with many a whistle-stop in between.         Her fame won her roles in jungle films like ''Swamp Woman'' (1941) and touring stage productions like ''White Cargo,'' in which she sashayed onstage one night in Boston, playing a native girl under a light layer of brown powder and not much more. When she declaimed, ''I am Tondelayo,'' a Harvard undergraduate leaped from his seat and shouted, ''What an actress!''         Legend had it that it was said in Boston, ''You can't graduate from Harvard until you've seen Ann Corio.''         The play had the honor of being banned in Boston, Chicago and Hoboken, N.J.         Of her movies, Ms. Corio said, ''Those pictures always made money, and I made a lot of money. I asked for $10,000 a week and a percentage and got it, but I didn't know they were going to shoot the movie in six days. They didn't want the movie good. They wanted it Tuesday. I was the Queen of the Quickies. Those pictures weren't released, they escaped.''         As burlesque faded away, Ms. Corio toured in shows like ''Rain,'' ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' and ''Once More With Feeling'' until she conceived the idea of ''This Was Burlesque.''         ''We're naughty and bawdy, but never vulgar,'' she said. ''More than half our audience are women. They love it. Even the kids respond to it. To go to a movie these days, you need a computer to figure out the ratings. The whole family can see my show.''         ''Nudity,'' she added, ''is an invasion of privacy on both sides of the footlights.''         Ms. Corio was one of 12 children of Italian immigrants from Naples who settled in Hartford, where, she said, she was once a Sunday school teacher. Her father died when she was  young, and at 16, after working as a dancer, she discovered she could earn more on the burlesque circuit.         In addition to her husband, Michael P. Iannucci, she is survived by two sisters, Helen LaRue of West Hartford, Conn., and Lillian Denote of Bristol, Conn.         ''This Was Burlesque,'' billed as a musical satire based on Ms. Corio's recollections, opened at the Casino East Theater on Second Avenue and 12th Street in Manhattan and ran for 1,509 performances before it moved to the Hudson Theater on Broadway and ran for 124 more. Over the ensuing years, numerous productions played across the country from Miami to Las Vegas to San Juan. The last performance was in St. Petersburg, Fla., in 1991.         In a 1981 review of a revival at the Princess Theater on West 48th Street, Richard F. Shepard of The New York Times wrote: ''Miss Corio, who looks radiant, does it all by the book and, whether you like the book or not, it is to her credit that she catches the flavor of the old burlesque with little attempt to ennoble or elevate it. This is close to the real thing.''         Ms. Corio and her third husband, Mr. Iannucci, a former linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers, made millions from the show. Eventually, they leased the Playhouse on the Mall in Paramus, N.J., where, for many years, they presented legitimate productions and where ''This Was Burlesque'' was eventually filmed as an HBO cable attraction.         Ms. Corio, who retired about eight years ago, recalled that shortly after the show first opened on Second Avenue, the police showed up. ''One night we thought we were being raided, but it was only the cops arriving to escort Mike to the bank. We never had trouble with the police. And I was invited to Gracie Mansion. Mayor Wagner insisted I sit next to him for the photographers.''         As a result of charges that burlesque had become lewd and unsavory, it was banned in New York in 1937. Five years later, it was permitted to return, but without the use of the label and in a restricted format. A court finally lifted the ban in 1955.         Nevertheless, Ms. Corio's efforts to present her show at the 1964-65 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens, were rebuffed by Robert Moses, the pillar of municipal rectitude who presided over the corporation that ran the event.         ''You know, we're really quite mild compared to what children are exposed to on television -- topless bathing suits and all,'' Ms. Corio said.         But the show did not go on.         ''There's nothing really new,'' she said. ''It's comedy, pretty girls, bubble gum, stepping on toes, the kind of stuff you can leave your brains home for. It's burlesque.''         As she once put it, ''We do nothing you wouldn't write home about to your aunt in East Cupcake, Ohio.''         Correction:  March 10, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary of the burlesque performer Ann Corio yesterday misstated the given name of another prominent performer in her field. She was Margie Hart, not Maggie.       
         Barbara Pfeffer, a photojournalist whose pictures appeared in Life, People, Town and Country and other magazines, died March 3 in her Manhattan home. She was 65.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, Doris Pfeffer of Manhattan.         Ms. Pfeffer, a New York City native, graduated from the Juilliard School of Music as a pianist before turning to photojournalism. She also made documentary films on Jewish themes. Her documentary ''Art and Remembrance, the Legacy of Felix Nussbaum,'' about the German-Jewish painter who hid in Belgium during World War II but was caught by the Nazis and killed at Auschwitz, received a CINE award.         ''Jewish Soul, American Beat,'' her documentary about young American Jews, will be broadcast this spring on public television. In June, the Museum of Jewish Heritage will show a retrospective of her photographs.         Besides her sister, she is survived by two former husbands, Jerry Fishman and Carroll Calkins.       
         Helen Priest Rogers, an authority on dance notation, a co-founder of the Dance Notation Bureau and a pioneer in the use of film to preserve choreography, died on Mar. 2 at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in Brattleboro, Vt. She was 85 and lived in West Brattleboro.         Ms. Rogers, who studied modern dance with Martha Graham and performed with the Graham company in 1935, went to Germany in 1936 at Graham's suggestion to learn the new system of Labanotation.         In 1940 she, Eve Gentry, Janey Price and Ann Hutchinson founded the Dance Notation Bureau in New York. It remains one of the world's most important centers for notation research.         Ms. Rogers also believed in recording choreography on film. She made her first dance films at the  Bennington Dance Festivals of the 1930's. After World War II, she taught notation for the American Dance Festival when it was at Connecticut College in New London. From its first season there in 1948 until 1976, when Ms. Rogers turned over her project to other cinematographers, she supervised the filming of 75 productions, including works by  Graham, Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor.         Ms. Rogers, who was married to the Canadian artist Hubert Reginald Rogers, was born in Ogdensburg, N.Y., and attended St. Lawrence University and Columbia University.         She taught dance and notation at various colleges and directed the dance program at Mount Holyoke College from 1953 to 1975.         She is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Scott of Whately, Mass.; a son, Norman Rogers of West Brattleboro; a stepdaughter, Jean Rogers of Provincetown, Mass; a sister, Alice Dunn of Big Arm, Mont.; a brother, Dorman Priest of Amherst, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Vera Tolstoy, a Russian refugee who became a teen-age bride in Czechoslovakia, worked as a hairdresser in Prague, sang Gypsy songs in Paris, sold perfume in New York and spent 25 years with the Voice of America in Washington, died on Monday at her retirement home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. She was 96 and the last living link to her grandfather Leo Tolstoy.         To the world of the early 1900's, Leo Tolstoy was a literary giant who had become the ''hermit of Yasnaya Polyana,'' the luxurious family estate 150 miles south of Moscow where he lived for 48 years and wrote  ''Anna Karenina'' and ''War and Peace.''         To his granddaughter, who grew up on a nearby estate with her mother, Sophia, and father, Ilya, the author's second son, he was simply her beloved bushy-faced dedushka, the jolly man in a peasant shirt who bounced her on his knee and tickled her cheek with his whiskers.         A small, lively woman who could affect a magisterial air, Miss Tolstoy dropped her hereditary title, Countess, after she came to the United States in 1949, but as an aristocratic exercise of noblesse oblige saw no reason to correct friends who continued to address her that way.         Although she sometimes found the name Tolstoy a burden, and even called herself Vera Mansoureva (after her mother's family estate) during her years as a Russian-language broadcaster, she was proud enough of her family connections to regale friends with tales of the old days at Yasnaya Polyana and to give lectures on her family heritage.         As a second-generation descendant of a man who had 13 children (and now has some 200 living descendants) Miss Tolstoy, the youngest of seven surviving siblings, liked to call herself Tolstoy's last granddaughter and never mind that a cousin from the Swedish branch of the family might still be alive.         As she made clear to relatives, the Swedish branch, descended from  Tolstoy's son Leo didn't count since they didn't speak Russian.         For Miss Tolstoy, who was 7 when her grandfather died in 1910 and 10 when the outbreak of World War I gave her father an excuse to desert his family (he eventually settled in the United States and remarried), the aristocratic life was short-lived.         After the Russian Revolution she and her mother made a harrowing escape, eventually landing in Czechoslovakia, where Miss Tolstoy got a job as translator for a wealthy lumber merchant, Odo Bakovsky, and then married him in an Islamic ceremony, giving birth to a son, Serge, in 1922.         Five years later, after her husband had lost his money and, she said, become unfaithful and quarrelsome, she sought to have the marriage declared illegal, explaining that she would rather have an annulment than a divorce because as a prospective single mother she preferred to have an illegitimate Tolstoy than a legitimate Bakovsky.         Miss Tolstoy, whose son had been kidnapped by his father then rekidnapped by her, had to settle for a divorce, but her son, her only immediate survivor, who now lives in Washington, is known as Serge Tolstoy.         After supporting her mother and son by working as a hairdresser in Prague, Miss Tolstoy moved to Paris after her mother's death in the 1930's and worked as a nightclub singer.         It was her aunt Alexandra Tolstoy,  founder of the Tolstoy Foundation in Valley Cottage, N.Y., who sponsored her immigration to the United States in 1949. After a brief stay at the foundation's farm and a stint selling perfume for Elizabeth Arden in New York, she moved to Washington in 1954 and Florida in 1979.         In 1991 she went back to Russia for a family reunion that drew dozens of Tolstoys, including many who had remained in the Soviet Union, to Yasnaya Polyana, a museum that is virtually a shrine.         Finding the house much as she remembered it, including the formal dining room table with its elegant china and fine silver covered by a glass dome and her grandfather's signature wide-brim hat and peasant shirt hanging next to his washstand, Miss Tolstoy was in her element, spotting a photograph taken with her grandfather when she was 3, but not finding every detail to her liking.         When she saw an alabaster monument to Lenin, a distinct incongruity in a museum devoted to a member of the Russian nobility, Miss Tolstoy responded first by using an American barnyard epithet, then reverted to aristocratic type.         ''That statue,'' she said, poking her walking stick at the offensive item, and using her most imperious voice, ''should be taken away.''       
         Grace Zia Chu, who introduced a generation of Americans to Chinese cuisine though her cooking classes in Manhattan and her landmark book ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking,'' died Thursday at a nursing home in Columbus, Ohio. She was 99.         In an era when most Americans believed that chop suey was a classic Chinese dish, Mrs. Chu led her students and readers, step by step, down the complicated byways of Chinese cooking, which, she explained, differed from region to region and, ideally, relied on raw ingredients that did not come from a can. For home cooks bewildered by the unfamiliar ingredients and techniques involved, Mrs. Chu proved to be an ideal guide. Assuming, correctly, that her readers knew precisely nothing about Chinese cuisine, she wrote clearly and simply, tailoring her recipes to the realities of the American kitchen, even if that meant calling for creamed corn in the recipe for chicken velvet corn soup.         Mrs. Chu was born in Shanghai. She was the eldest of the nine children of Zia Hong-lai, a Christian educator and editor, and Sochen Sze. After graduating from the McTyeire School for Girls in Shanghai in 1918, she won a scholarship to Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass., where she earned a degree in physical education in 1924. After returning to China, she taught at McTyeire and taught physical education at Ginling College in Nanjing, and from 1935 to 1947, she was a vice president of the world Young Women's Christian Association.         In 1928, she married Chu Shih-ming, an army officer and an official in the Nationalist Government who at one time was an interpreter and aide-de-camp to Chiang Kai-shek.  When he was posted as a military attache to the Chinese Embassy in Washington in 1941, Mrs. Chu took on the entertaining duties that transformed her into an ambassador for Chinese food.         Mrs. Chu returned to China after World War II but left in 1950 and took up permanent residence in the United States, becoming a citizen in 1955. By that time she had settled in Manhattan, where she began teaching cooking classes at the China Institute. For the next 30 years, she taught at the institute, the Mandarin House restaurant on West 13th Street and at her apartment on West 111th Street.         Her classes later resulted in two cookbooks, ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking'' (1962) and ''Madame Chu's Chinese Cooking School'' (1975).         In ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking,'' Mrs. Chu patiently guided her readers through unfamiliar territory. She listed and described the basic ingredients of Chinese dishes, and the utensils and techniques used to prepare them. She showed how to use a Chinese cleaver, how to hold chopsticks, how to grow bean sprouts at home and how to order a proper Chinese meal in a restaurant. In a concession to American tastes, Mrs. Chu included recipes for chop suey, chow mein and other Chinese-American hybrids, but then pressed on to offer more authentic fare like string beans in bean curd sauce and lobster with black bean sauce, as well as challenging banquet dishes like shark fins with Chinese cabbage.         ''The book may well be the finest, most lucid volume on Chinese cooking ever written,'' Craig Claiborne wrote in The New York Times in 1962. To a generation of Americans familiar with the distinctions among Sichuan, Hunan and Cantonese cooking styles, ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking'' reads like a period piece, but in the early 1960's it was a badly needed instruction manual. It is telling that in his review of the book, Mr. Claiborne had to explain to readers that a wok was ''a Chinese cooking utensil.''         With Arthur Chu, Mrs. Chu wrote ''Oriental Antiques and Collectibles: a Guide'' (1973), ''Oriental Cloisonne and Other Enamels'' and ''The Collector's Book of Jade'' (1978).         Her husband died in 1965, and Mrs. Chu moved to Columbus in 1986. She is survived by her sister, Ruth Zia, of Columbus; two sons, Samuel, of Columbus and Daniel, of New York City; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.         MRS. CHU'S CHICKEN VELVET CORN SOUP  From ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking,'' by Grace Zia Chu  Time: 20 minutes         1 whole chicken breast, uncooked  2 egg whites  1 8-ounce can creamed corn  3 cups clear chicken broth  1 teaspoon dry sherry  1 teaspoon salt  1 tablespoon cornstarch  2 tablespoons minced cooked ham (optional)         1. Slice and mince the chicken breast, discarding the skin and bone.         2. Beat the egg whites until stiff and mix with the minced chicken.         3. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 teaspoons of cold water.         4. Bring the chicken broth to a boil; add 1 teaspoon of salt.         5. Add creamed corn and let boil 1 or 2 minutes.         6. Add pre-dissolved cornstarch, stirring continuously until soup is thickened.         7. Stir the chicken mixture into the soup. As soon as it boils again, the soup is ready.         8. Sprinkle the minced ham on top of the soup before serving.       
         Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild, a patron of Martha Graham and of modern dance in Israel, died on Tuesday at her home in Tel Aviv. She was 84.         The granddaughter of Baron James de Rothschild, the founder of the French branch of the Rothschild banking family, Baroness de Rothschild became a supporter of Graham after seeing performances by her and her company in New York in the early 1940's. She bought the house on East 63d Street in Manhattan that was the company's headquarters for many years and supported the Graham school and its activities.         Baroness de Rothschild began her professional life as a research biologist at a laboratory in Paris. She came to the United States at the start of World War II, studied chemistry and biology at Columbia University and worked in an industrial laboratory.         During the war she worked for the Free French movement in New York and London. She enlisted in the French Army and landed in Normandy after the Allied invasion. She was a liaison between the French and United States forces in Paris, returning to New York at the end of the war.         In her quiet way, Baroness de Rothschild intrigued the Graham dancers, who knew her as Bethsabee, the French version of her first name.         ''For all I know, the tour being my first, wardrobe mistresses are always baronesses,'' Paul Taylor wrote in his autobiography, ''Private Domain.'' ''Bethsabee supervises the laundering and packing of our costumes with quiet efficiency, almost as if born to it, and by looking at her own outfits, you can't tell she's an heiress -- that is, if you don't know that expensive dresses are sometimes the dumpiest.''         Besides supervising the wardrobe, Baroness de Rothschild was involved in a wide range of company activities, including taking a few dance classes with Graham and buying the dancers jewelry one Christmas at a lavish party she gave for the troupe.         Baroness de Rothschild founded the Batsheva de Rothschild Foundation for Arts and Sciences in the early 1950's in New York. The foundation's first project, in 1953, was to sponsor a two-week festival of American modern dance on Broadway. In addition to underwriting Graham tours, the foundation also helped establish the Juilliard Dance Theater, directed by Doris Humphrey, and sponsored a second three-week festival of modern dance on Broadway.         One of the Baroness's greatest contributions to modern dance was the founding of the Graham-based Batsheva Dance Company in 1964 in Tel Aviv. Baroness de Rothschild, who had moved to Israel two years earlier, believed the country needed a professional modern dance company with full-scale sets and costumes and thorough training. She sent several dancers to New York to work with Graham, who agreed to be Batsheva's artistic adviser, and Graham sent dancers to Israel to work with the new company.         Internationally known choreographers like Jerome Robbins and Jose Limon went to work with Batsheva, and the troupe toured extensively in the United States, Europe and Asia. Baroness de Rothschild went on to form a second, more balletically based group, the Bat-Dor Dance Company, in 1967. She withdrew her support from Batsheva in 1974 after the company refused to hire as its director Jeannette Ordman, her protegee and the head of Bat-Dor.         Though she never became an Israeli citizen, she remained immensely loyal to the nation, working as a driver after her car was mobilized during the 1973 war. She supported many Israeli causes through her foundation, giving money to hundreds of emigre scientists and providing housing for new arrivals and loans to the poor in Tel Aviv.         She supported the establishment of the Center for Dance Medicine, the Chamber Music Association, the Chamber Ensemble and the Batsheva Crafts Corporation. She also established the Batsheva Foundation for the Advancement of Science in Israel, an endowed fund of the Israel Academy for Science and Humanities. She was the author of a French book on modern dance, ''La Danse Artistique aux U.S.A.''         Baroness de Rothschild is survived by a brother, Guy, of Paris, and a sister, Jacqueline Piatigorsky of Los Angeles.         She received the Israel Prize in 1989 and was honored in 1997 at a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Bat-Dor Dance Company at the new Tel Aviv House. Those paying tribute included Roni Milo, the Mayor of Tel Aviv, and the choreographers Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor.         Throughout her life the Baroness fascinated people with her innocent grandeur. Graham long remembered an exchange she had with the baroness after they visited the august Rothschild Bank in Paris.         ''It was unlike any bank I had ever seen,'' Graham wrote in her autobiography ''Blood Memory.'' ''No real tellers, no depositors that I could see.         '' 'Bethsabee, where are the depositors?'         '' 'Depositors?'         ''Bethsabee had evidently never been asked that question before.         '' 'We don't really encourage depositors, but yes, we do have one now . . . the Pope.' ''         Correction:  April 23, 1999, Friday  An obituary of Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild yesterday misstated her relationship to Baron James de Rothschild. She was his great-granddaughter, not his granddaughter.       
         Elizabeth Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, who transformed it from a tired magazine into a viable voice in fashion while she battled ovarian cancer and raised awareness of the disease, died yesterday morning at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 51 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.         Ms. Tilberis was highly respected for her ability as an editor, her warmth and her good humor in the face of debilitating treatments to halt the spread of the cancer that ultimately took her life. While hospitalized in December 1993 and again in the summer of 1995, she oversaw each issue of the monthly magazine, which she had taken over in February 1992. Until just a few days before her death, she was working on the June issue.         When Hearst Magazines, which publishes the 132-year-old Harper's Bazaar, hired Ms. Tilberis away from her job as editor in chief of British Vogue, it created a sensation in fashion magazine circles. She became the third reigning British editor of an important New York magazine, following Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue, and Tina Brown, who was then the editor in chief of Vanity Fair and later became the editor of The New Yorker and is now developing Talk magazine.         The fashion world was abuzz with gossip on two topics: speculation that Hearst was paying Ms. Tilberis an annual salary of $1.25 million (never confirmed or denied) and anticipation of a rivalry between Ms. Tilberis and Ms. Wintour, her predecessor at British Vogue, who had recommended Ms. Tilberis as her replacement there. (No outward signs of either hostility or warmth were seen in the years they competed in New York.)         Ms. Tilberis's aim when she took over Harper's Bazaar, she said, was to make it ''the most beautiful fashion magazine in the world.'' She hired talented stylists and famous photographers and brought in Fabien Baron to redesign the look of the magazine. Under his art direction, it developed a strong graphics style,  which was widely copied.         The first issue under Ms. Tilberis's direction, September 1992, had a stunning cover shot by Patrick Demarchelier of the model Linda Evangelista in a stark black dress against a white background with no other headline on the cover than ''Enter the Era of Elegance.'' It was a startling contrast to the usual fashion magazine cover with multiple headlines in different colors. Subsequent issues added text lines and color and eventually looked more like other fashion publications. An exception was this year's February cover of Madonna, also photographed by Mr. Demarchelier, in striking black and red.         Industry reaction to the first change in the magazine was mixed. Some saw it as coolly elegant. Others thought it boring and lifeless. But it won awards, including two National Magazine Awards in 1993.         In 1994, Ms. Tilberis was named editor of the year by Advertising Age and received an award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which was presented to her by Diana, the Princess of Wales. The two women became friends in London, where the Princess of Wales often dropped by the offices of British Vogue and also appeared on its cover twice while Ms. Tilberis was editor. The Princess was also twice on the cover of Harper's Bazaar under Ms. Tilberis's editorship, once during her lifetime and once posthumously.         The September 1994 issue of Harper's Bazaar contained an informative article by Aimee Lee Ball, ''Ovarian Cancer: One Woman's Fight,'' in which Ms. Tilberis linked her use of fertility drugs in the late 1970's to the ovarian cancer that was diagnosed in December 1993. The fertility treatments were unsuccessful. The article described the disease and its treatment, which included nine weeks of chemotherapy, which caused Ms. Tilberis to lose 30 pounds.         In another article in the magazine, in May 1996, Ms. Tilberis described in diary form a bone-marrow transplant she underwent the previous summer to eradicate vestiges of the cancer. In both articles, she chose to find something positive to say about her illness: she had gone from a size 14 to a fashionable size 6 and was pleased that her silver hair was as flattering in its new short length as it had been as a chin-length bob.         She also discussed her battle with the disease in ''No Time to Die,'' a memoir written with Ms. Ball and published last year by Little, Brown. In 1997, Ms. Tilberis became president of the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund.         Elizabeth Kelly Tilberis was born Sept. 7, 1947 in Alderley Edge, a village outside of Manchester, England, to Jane and Thomas Stuart-Black Kelly. Her father was an eye surgeon, who was a pioneer in laser retinal detachment surgery and in developing soft contact lenses in the 1960's.         She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in fashion design from Leicester Polytechnic, a British school comparable to New York's Fashion Institute of Technology. It was there that she met her future husband, Andrew Tilberis, an artist, who was her tutor. She and her husband later adopted two children, Robert, now 17, and Christopher, 14.         In addition to her husband and sons, she is survived by her relatives in England: her mother, of Bath; her sister, Lois Stuart-Black of London, and her brother, Dr. Grant Kelly of West Sussex. Following her graduation in 1970, Ms. Tilberis went to British Vogue as a fashion assistant and worked her way to the top, becoming editor in chief in 1987.         Ms. Tilberis was active on the New York charity social scene, serving as chairwoman of benefits for causes like pediatric AIDS, the New York City Ballet and the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         She was scheduled to receive a Humanitarian Award in June from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which will now be given posthumously, said Fern Mallis, the council's executive director. ''We are pleased that the award was announced earlier and not something added after her death,'' Ms. Mallis said yesterday.         Despite Ms. Tilberis's personal popularity and the publicity her tenure brought to the magazine, Harper's Bazaar never ousted Vogue from its pinnacle as the fashion publication with the largest circulation and the most advertising pages. As time went by under her editorship, the magazine lost some of its specialness and began to look more like other fashion publications. It also lost some high-profile editors and photographers to other magazines.         Unfazed, Ms. Tilberis pronounced herself pleased with the magazine in an interview in 1995. ''I think we made the niche we wanted to make, and I think we are the elegant fashion magazine I wanted to create,'' she said.         In an interview published last year in The Times, Ms. Tilberis discussed the stark contrast between her glamorous job and her illness: ''You can live in the fashion world and go to fashion shows and have your picture taken, et cetera, et cetera. But there's an important balance with what really goes on in life, which is sickness and suffering and people dying. Prior to having cancer, I didn't realize there was this whole different world. It's a great wake-up call.''       
         Dr. Rose Payne, whose research into tissue compatibility at Stanford University over more than three decades helped advance the field of organ transplants, died on April 18 at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Santa Clara, Calif. She was 89 and had been living in Cupertino, Calif.         Dr. Payne, an expert in tissue-typing, was credited with helping identify proteins that play an important role in how well patients accept a graft of tissue, or a blood transfusion, from another person. The proteins, part of the human leukocyte antigen system, may also lend insights into why some people are more susceptible than others to a range of autoimmune diseases, including diabetes and arthritis.         Before the work of Dr. Payne and other scientists who studied the proteins, doctors who transplanted organs had to base their determination of compatibility only on whether the donor and recipient had the same blood type.         Rose Payne was born on Aug. 5, 1909, in Lake Bay, Wash. She attended the University of Washington, where in 1937 she earned a doctorate in bacteriology.         She was hired by Stanford as a research assistant after World War II, one of the few women there at the time. A new career began when Dr. Payne, in her mid-40's, was encouraged by a new administration to pursue her own studies.         She began focusing on leukocytes, trying to establish what caused incompatibility problems.         In 1972, Stanford named Dr. Payne a professor of medicine. Three years later, her status changed again, to professor emerita.         In 1984, the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics named an award in her honor.         In an interview posted on the society's Web site, Dr. Payne recalled what led up to her appointment as professor.         ''I had never asked for anything,'' she said. ''Then, one day, I decided I was old enough and established enough. So I marched right in and asked.''         Dr. Payne, who is survived by a sister, Violet Russell of Seattle, and a nephew, said that, in the end, the appointment did not change her life. ''I already had an international reputation and had done what I wanted to do.''       
         Lucille Lortel, whose pioneering efforts to bring innovative theater and adventurous new playwrights and actors to the American stage earned her the title Queen of Off Broadway, died on Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 and had homes in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         Among the legacies of Miss Lortel's cutting-edge career, which spanned more than 70 years, is the theater that bears her name in Greenwich Village; the still thriving White Barn Theater that she started in Westport in 1947; the Lucille Lortel Room at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, and the funds and fellowships she established to aid the arts. She also leaves a veritable Who's Who of people in international theater -- playwrights, actors, directors, composers and designers -- whose careers were advanced by her daring and her confidence in young talent.         ''If you love the theater you must be innovative,'' she once said. ''You must try new ideas and new faces. That's the only way theater can develop. You can't do it on Broadway because it costs too much. The costs are lower Off Broadway, so you can afford to take a chance, and you must take a chance.''         Forsaking the Footlights For a Backstage Role         Miss Lortel gave up a career as an actress in 1939 in deference to her wealthy husband's wishes and in 1947 began an experimental summer theater for American and foreign plays and playwrights in the barn of the couple's summer estate in Westport. From the start she wanted White Barn, as she called it, to be a sanctuary from commercial pressures, a place where writers could take a chance with their plays and where actors could stretch their talents. It was there that Miss Lortel staged readings, mothered performers like Eva Marie Saint, Geoffrey Holder and Zero Mostel and presented plays by Samuel Beckett, Edward Albee, Eugene Ionesco and Sean O'Casey.         In 1955 her husband, Louis Schweitzer, gave her a Manhattan theater, now known as the Lucille Lortel Theater, as a 24th wedding anniversary gift. The first production in the house, at 121 Christopher Street, then called the Theater de Lys, was Marc Blitzstein's adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ''Threepenny Opera. '' It caused such a sensation that the production ran for seven years and put Off Broadway on the map.         As Stuart W. Little observed in his 1972 book ''Off Broadway: The Prophetic Theater'': ''For thousands of theatergoers, a visit to the de Lys was the authentic Off Broadway experience. Off Broadway meant the discovery of new talent and fresh theatrical experiences in unfamiliar parts of the city. . . .The de Lys at the far end of Christopher Street, near the Hudson River docks, was situated in a borderline neighborhood between the known residential part of the city and the open seaport. The unknown world beyond, in imagination, merged with the pulsing underworld life of 'The Threepenny Opera' and became sinister, exotic, menacing.''         Miss Lortel was frustrated by the success of ''Threepenny Opera'' because she wanted to bring more plays into her theater, so she  persuaded the American National Theater and Academy to support a matinee series as a ''laboratory for innovation.'' The series ran for 20 years and became a legend. A verse adaptation of Alan Paton's novel ''Cry the Beloved Country'' became the first venture of the series in 1956, followed that  season by such groundbreaking productions as Anna Sokolow's Kafkaesque dance-drama ''Metamorphosis'' and May O'Donnell's modern-dance interpretation of Maeterlinck's play ''Pelleas and Melisandre.''         Over the years the series offered ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' a dramatization of Langston Hughes poems with Godfrey Cambridge; adaptations of poetic works by Robert Frost, Archibald MacLeish, W. H. Auden and Conrad Aiken; performances of rarely seen plays by O'Casey, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Albee and William Inge, and presented actors like Richard Burton in ''An Afternoon of Poetry,'' Siobhan McKenna as Hamlet, Helen Hayes in an anthology of Shakespeare and Dame Sybil Thorndike and Sir Lewis Casson in a joint dramatic reading. Terrence McNally and Adrienne Kennedy were among the new writers whose works were presented.         She brought Jean Genet to the attention of American audiences with a production of ''The Balcony,'' which she co-produced at Circle in the Square in 1960. She also oversaw the first American production of a play by Athol Fugard, the South African playwright; it was ''Blood Knot,'' starring James Earl Jones and J. D. Cannon, and it ignited audiences at the Cricket Theater on Second Avenue in 1964. She introduced many plays by Beckett, including ''Rockaby,'' on Theater Row on West 42d Street.         Creating a Setting For Cutting-Edge Work         At the Theater de Lys, she provided a home for such plays as David Mamet's ''A Life in the Theater,'' Sam Shepard's ''Buried Child'' and ''Getting Out,'' early work by Marsha Norman, Caryl Churchill's ''Cloud Nine'' and Wendy Wasserstein's ''Isn't It Romantic.'' The house was renamed the Lucille Lortel Theater in 1981, and has been the setting for Larry Kramer's ''The Destiny of Me,'' for ''Groucho'' and for ''Gertrude Stein and a Companion,'' the recipient of the National Education Film and Video Award for historical biographies.         The 38th volume of John Willis's ''Theater World'' (1981-82) is dedicated ''To Lucille Lortel, whose vibrant spirit and untiring efforts have made immeasurable contributions to all components of the theater by discovering and encouraging new talent, and whose devotion to Off Broadway provided the impetus for its proliferation.''         In 1960 Miss Lortel began sponsoring dramatic productions and seminars at the Library of Congress. The presentations included O'Casey's ''Time to Go,'' Mark Van Doren's ''Last Days of Lincoln'' and Albee's ''Fam and Yam.''         Miss Lortel produced or co-produced some 500 plays, 5 of which were nominated for Tony Awards -- ''As Is'' by William M. Hoffman, ''Angels Fall'' by Lanford Wilson, ''Blood Knot'' by Mr. Fugard, ''Sarafina!,'' an import from South Africa, and ''A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing. Several were produced in Broadway theaters and the others moved to Broadway.         The theater on Christopher Street was only one of many unusual gifts that Mr. Schweitzer lavished on Miss Lortel before his death in 1971. A chemical engineer who made his fortune manufacturing cigarette papers, he also owned the FM radio station WBAI.         In 1957, when his wife told him it was sometimes difficult to find a cab after the theater, he bought a gray Mercedes-Benz. He had been told there was a cab driver named Louis Schweitzer in town and he arranged to get a taxi medallion for the car and for his namesake to act as its part-time driver. When the driver wasn't transporting  Miss Lortel, he was free to use the car as a taxi and split the earnings with the boss.         In 1956, Mr. Schweitzer was the first foreigner in more than 400 years allowed to buy a gondola in Venice. Although traditionally gondolas were identified only by numbers, he was given permission to name his purchase ''Lucille.'' The gondola continued to carry passengers and the gondolier was told that if American visitors used Mr. Schweitzer's name to book a ride, they were to be charged double. ''My friends can afford it,'' he explained.         For some years, the Schweitzers spent part of each winter on a houseboat in Florida. The two-story villa on a raft, anchored off Miami Beach, had two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, servants' quarters and a bar sheltered by a thatched roof.         Lucille Lortel was born in Manhattan on Dec. 16, 1900, the daughter of Harry and Anna Wadler. Lucille was her given name, Lortel an alliterative concoction for the stage. Her father was a manufacturer of women's clothes and frequently traveled to Europe to buy designs that he would copy. For some years, Miss Lortel was tutored at home and although she said, ''I think I went to public school after that,'' she did remember that she never graduated. She attended Adelphi College briefly and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. A 1921 review in ''The Musical Leader'' of her  graduating class's production of D'Annunzio's ''Honeysuckle'' described her as ''an exquisite little creature who seemed to be inspired.'' Later, she studied briefly with Max Reinhardt in Berlin.         Miss Lortel made her Broadway debut in 1925 in the Theater Guild production of George Bernard Shaw's ''Caesar and Cleopatra'' with Helen Hayes as Cleopatra and Lionel Atwill as Caesar. She had a small role, which she said had been added by the director, playing what she described as a whore. She never forgot her unwhorelike lines: ''No no, no, I'll have nothing to do with you,'' addressed to the line of men following her.         She met Mr. Schweitzer in 1930. ''I wasn't interested in getting married,'' she recalled. ''I was involved in the theater.'' Mr. Schweitzer pursued her. During a business trip to France he telephoned and told her he was sending a ticket and that they would get married in Paris. Friends persuaded her to accept -- ''You can always get a divorce,'' they said.         When she arrived in March 1931, the couple discovered that official proclamations of their intended marriage had to be posted for several weeks before the marriage could take place. They sailed back to the United States on the Leviathan and were married by the captain. ''I wouldn't have anything to do with my husband until we came back to New York,'' she said, and even then she waited for two more ceremonies,  one at City Hall and a religious service in Manhattan performed by the Jewish chaplain at West Point.         The year after her marriage, Miss Lortel appeared on stage with Jean Arthur and Claude Rains in ''The Man Who Reclaimed His Head,'' but her husband objected to her absence in the evenings. His unhappiness led to a new activity that continued until 1939 -- acting in movie shorts filmed in Brooklyn in the afternoons. This was followed by a temporary retirement.         ''My husband's mother disapproved of acting, and he was very possessive,'' Miss Lortel said in a 1996 interview. ''After a while, I was getting bored. I thought I'd go nuts so I started readings at Westport, moving the tractors and Ping-Pong table from the barn.''         From a White Barn To Off Broadway         In 1947 Miss Lortel was approached by the actor Canada Lee and Philip Huston, a playwright, who needed a place and a distinguished audience for a staged reading of a new play called ''The Painted Wagon.'' Miss Lortel provided both. This was followed by a request from the agent Audrey Wood, who wanted a showcase for a musical, ''No Casting Today.'' Thus the White Barn was opened with Miss Lortel as its sole backer and hostess, providing room and board for the actors.         She had a permanent stage built, brought in new and innovative troupes like the Dublin Players Company, the Oxford University Players and Mr. Holder and his Trinidad Dance Troupe, established an apprentice school, introduced seminars in Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov, and offered playwrights, actors, designers, composers and directors a chance to spread their wings.         ''When the White Barn began, it was to summer theater what Off Broadway is to the commercial theater,'' the actress and producer Eva Le Gallienneonce said. ''An avowed pioneer, it proved that summer productions could be stimulating, avant-garde and enthusiastically received.''         Nurturing Newcomers And Seasoned Actors         Among the newcomers who got a chance at the White Barn were Peter Falk, Vincent Gardenia, Sada Thompson, George Peppard and Sidney Lumet. Working with them were more established actors seeking challenges  -- Mildred Dunnock, Mr. Mostel, Kim Hunter, James Coco and Peggy Wood.         Mr. Schweitzer initially enjoyed his wife's new enthusiasm and the idea of having actors around the estate in the summer. Later, his enthusiasm waned and although he continued to support her endeavors, it wasn't until his later years that his interest revived.         Miss Lortel was showered with virtually every theatrical award and honor except a Tony, which is given for achievement on Broadway. She received the first Margo Jones Award (1962) and the Lee Strasberg Lifetime Achievement Award (1985), as well as induction into the Theater Hall of Fame (1990) and recognition from the School of the Arts at Columbia University (1996). The first theater chair to be named for a woman bears her name, the Lucille Lortel Distinguished Professorial Chair in Theater at the City University of New York. A permanent tribute to her career is on display at the archives of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The Lucille Lortel Theater Collection, an archive of theatrical history and memorabilia, is on permanent exhibition at the Westport Public Library.         In 1986, the Lucille Lortel Awards were established by the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers to honor outstanding achievements in the Off Broadway theater. Recipients have included the playwright A. R. Gurney, for ''The Cocktail Hour''; John Tillinger, the director; Playwrights Horizons, and Lincoln Center Theater for ''Woza Afrika!''         Miss Lortel, who leaves no immediate survivors, was a generous donor in other theatrical areas. She established the Lucille Lortel Fund for New Drama at Yale University to support the production of new plays at the Yale Repertory Theater (the fund's premiere production was August Wilson's ''Fences''). The Lucille Lortel Fellowship in Playwriting was started at Brown University in Providence, R.I., in 1996. She also donated money for the annual Drama Circle awards and made sizable financial contributions to dance and music groups.         ''Honey, I've got a one-track mind and it's theater, theater, theater,'' she once said. ''I have no time for anything else.''         One of Miss Lortel's favorite possessions in her memento-filled midtown apartment at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, where she lived after her husband's death, was a box covered with notices of plays she had produced. The lid opened to the sound of applause and a voice calling out ''More! More!''         Circulating in a milieu where youth often takes the starring role, she frequently sidestepped the matter of age by saying ''age is a number and mine is unlisted.'' When a gossip column last year reported that Miss Lortel would soon celebrate her 98th birthday, Blanche Marvin, a friend, reported that she was furious.         ''This will kill my love life,'' she said.       
         Dr. Mary D. Ainsworth, a developmental psychologist whose work revolutionized the understanding of the bond between mothers and infants, died in Charlottesville, Va., on March 21. She was 85.         Dr. Ainsworth's research contributed significantly to attachment theory, which emphasizes the importance of intimate human relationships, or attachments, in shaping children's development.         Dr. Ainsworth, who lived in Charlottesville, worked closely with Dr. John Bowlby, the British child psychiatrist whose work on separation, attachment and loss provided the foundation for attachment theory. She carried on his legacy in the United States, conducting systematic studies of attachments between mothers and infants.         ''No one had ever looked at that'' before Dr. Ainsworth's work, said Jude A. Cassidy, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Maryland at College Park. ''There had been little empirical observation.''         Dr. Ainsworth also developed methods for assessing the quality of the mother-infant bond. Attachment theory holds that infants need a ''secure'' attachment to thrive, and that ''anxious'' attachments can lead to problems later in life. ''She looked at a way of measuring which babies were securely attached and which were not,'' Dr. Cassidy said.         Though much of Dr. Ainsworth's research was for an academic audience, it also had a practical side. She argued, on the basis of her research, that picking up a crying baby does not spoil the child; rather, it reduces crying in the future.         ''That was a huge controversy over that,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''It had been thought that picking up a baby spoiled it and led to more crying. Instead, it teaches the baby that the world is a responsive place and leads to less crying long term.''         Psychologists continue to debate the issue.         Dr. Ainsworth's research also found that feeding an infant on demand rather than on a strict schedule led to a more secure attachment between infant and mother.         ''These findings had a big impact on how pediatricians advised mothers in the second half of the 20th century,'' said Robert S. Marvin, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Virginia.         Mary D. Salter was born in Glendale, Ohio, on Dec. 1, 1913, and spent most of her childhood in Toronto. She received her bachelor's degree in 1935, her master's degree in 1936 and her Ph.D. in 1939, all from the University of Toronto. She then was a lecturer in the university's psychology department until 1942, when she was commissioned in the Canadian Women's Army Corps, attaining the rank of major. She returned to the university as an assistant professor in 1946.         In 1950 she married Leonard Ainsworth, a graduate student in psychology. Shortly after their marriage she moved to London, where she began a lifelong partnership with Dr. Bowlby, who was investigating the impact on institutionalized children of prolonged separation from their mothers in early childhood. Dr. Ainsworth later moved to Kampala, Uganda, where she conducted one of the first studies of mother-infant interaction in the first year of life.         In 1955 she moved to Baltimore, where she joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University. She became a full professor there in 1963, a year after she began her study of infant-mother attachment. In the study, she and her researchers conducted four-hour home visits every three weeks for a year with 26 mothers and their infants. It took four years to collect the data and 10 years to analyze it.         ''The depth has never been matched,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''No one has done it as intensively.''         In 1974 Dr. Ainsworth, who was divorced from her husband in 1960, moved to Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, where she was a professor from 1975 to 1984. She retired as professor emeritus in 1984 and remained professionally active until 1992.         She wrote several books and many academic papers, and was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford in 1966 and 1967. She also received several awards from professional organizations. Last year she was awarded the Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Science of Psychology from the American Psychological Foundation.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Sloan of Vancouver, British Columbia.       
         Mary Jane Rathbun, who became known as the grandmotherly Brownie Mary who handed out brownies laced with high-grade marijuana to sick people to relieve their pain and nausea, died on Saturday at a hospital in San Francisco. She was 77 and lived in San Francisco.         Ms. Rathbun campaigned on the local, state and national level to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes. She baked the brownies in the small kitchen of her home in a housing project for the elderly in the largely gay Castro neighborhood of San Francisco. She called them ''original recipe brownies'' and ''magically delicious.'' In one raid on her home in 1981, the police confiscated 54 dozen of them, along with more than 18 pounds of the marijuana, donated by growers.         Ms. Rathbun was arrested three times and was ordered to perform hundreds of hours of community service, which she spent with AIDS patients. Her base of operations in the early years of the AIDS epidemic was San Francisco General Hospital. Working as a volunteer for some 10 years, she devoted untold hours to help care for ''her kids,'' as the patients came to be known.         Her role as a baker was but a small part of her activities. She became a San Francisco fixture for whom the city fathers proclaimed an official Brownie Mary Day in 1992 to honor her work with dying patients in the AIDS ward.         With Dennis Peron, a longtime comrade and prominent marijuana advocate, she published ''Brownie Mary's Marijuana Cookbook and Dennis Peron's Recipe for Social Change,'' which did not include the brownie recipe. They also founded the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club, which is now defunct.         Her first arrest on marijuana charges and a judge's order to perform community service prompted Ms. Rathbun to join the Shanti project, one of the first AIDS support groups. The court action led to ''Free Brownie Mary'' groups, but two more arrests for marijuana possession went unprosecuted.         Mary Jane Rathbun was born in Minnesota and grew up in Chicago.  She settled in San Francisco in World War II, briefly married and had a daughter who died in a car accident. There are no immediate survivors.         By the mid-1990's, Ms. Rathbun could no longer bake because of arthritis and other ailments that kept her in constant pain. She had two artificial knees and, she said, only her own sweet medicine enabled her to walk at all.         Her campaigns and arrests helped build support for the 1996 California State initiative that made the use of marijuana conditionally legal. The measure allowed use with a doctor's consent for patients suffering from AIDS, cancer and certain other serious conditions whose symptoms are said to be alleviated by the drug.         But the law has led to numerous skirmishes between advocates of marijuana and local and the Federal authorities who say that a voter initiative cannot override a Federal ban on marijuana.       
         Michi N. Weglyn, author of an acclaimed book about the internment of Japanese-Americans in the United States during World War II, died last Sunday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 72.         She had cancer, said Si Spiegel, the executor of her estate.         Ms. Weglyn's book, ''Years of Infamy: The Untold Story of America's Concentration Camps'' (University of Washington Press, 1976), was praised by an American Ambassador to Japan, Mike Mansfield. He called it ''a conscience-wrenching book of major significance,'' and said that ''every American concerned with human liberty should know of this bleak period of our national history.''         Ms. Weglyn herself was interned in one of the camps as a teen-ager.         Frank Freidel, a professor of American history at Harvard University, wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Japanese-Americans in the western United States, numbering over 100,000, ''became the scapegoats for the attack on Pearl Harbor.''         '' 'Years of Infamy' gives an appalling view of the privation, neglect and even brutality that the bewildered Japanese-Americans underwent in the camps,'' he wrote. Ms. Weglyn's account, he said, ''based largely on Government documents, is decidedly grimmer than most earlier books on this disgraceful subject.''         In later years Ms. Weglyn worked in behalf of former internees who had not received compensation from the United States Government.         Ms. Weglyn was born in Stockton, Calif., to Tomojiro Nishiura, who was a farmer, and the former Misao Yuasa.         She attended Mount Holyoke College in 1944 and 1945 and Barnard College in 1947 and 1948.         In the 1950's and 60's, under the name Michi, Ms. Weglyn was a designer and manufacturer of theatrical costumes.         Her husband, Walter M. Weglyn, died in 1995. Surviving are a sister, Tomi Fujita, and a nephew, Walter Fujita, both of Los Angeles.       
         Adele Woodhouse Erb Sullivan, who was president general of the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution in the 1960's, died on April 22 in Wilton, Conn., at the home of her daughter, Nancy E. Thorne. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Scarsdale, N.Y.         Mrs. Sullivan was probably best known for her well-publicized trip to Vietnam, at the invitation of Gen. William C. Westmoreland, in 1968. At one point during her tour, two American soldiers spied her getting out of a helicopter in a central highlands combat zone. ''Look, Mom is coming up the hill,'' one of the soldiers was reported to have quipped.         ''That trip to Vietnam meant a great deal to the national society,'' said Sarah King of Murfreesboro, Tenn., who was president general of the D.A.R. from 1983 until 1986. ''Membership grew to 188,000 because of her special leadership and knowledge of public relations.''         The organization's membership peaked at about 212,000 in the mid-1980's, and is now about 175,000, according to Mrs. King. ''We will never again have a leader like her,'' she said. ''She was dynamic, articulate and interested in everything in American life.''         Adele Woodhouse, who was born in Trenton, was a descendant of early Colonial Pennsylvania settlers. The direct lineal ancestor who gave her entry into the Daughters of the American Revolution was Israel Matson of Philadelphia. She was educated in Quaker schools and at Rider College.         She joined the D.A.R. in 1930, and during World War II, she was a leader in the organization's war work, maintaining a service booth in the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan for the armed forces.         In 1953, she became a state regent, directing 177 D.A.R. chapters with 15,000 members.         In 1956, she was elected recording secretary general of the national society, and in 1959, she was elected first vice president general. She was elected president general in 1965, serving one term until 1968, when she was made an honorary president general for life.         Her first husband, Harold E. Erb of Garden City, N.Y., died in 1957, and her second husband, William H. Sullivan Jr. of Scarsdale, died in 1985.         Besides her daughter, Mrs. Sullivan is survived by two granddaughters and two great-grandchildren.       
         Sheila Gruson, an artist who worked as an assistant director  with many opera companies around the world, died yesterday in Tiverton, in Devon, England. She was 48.         The cause was breast cancer, according to her brother, Lindsey.         Ms. Gruson, who lived in Tiverton, was an assistant director with Covent Garden in London and La Fenice in Venice, as well as with opera companies in New York, Hamburg, San Francisco, Seattle and Munich.         Her sculptures were exhibited in England.         Ms. Gruson was born on March 21, 1951, in Tel Aviv, and graduated from Harvard University in 1972. She was a daughter of Sydney Gruson, a former vice chairman of The New York Times Company, who died last year.         Besides her brother, of Kent, Conn., she is survived by her daughter, Nina Lourie, of Tiverton; her mother, Flora Lewis, of Paris, foreign affairs columnist for The International Herald Tribune, and a sister, Kerry Gruson of Miami.       
         Betty Robinson Schwartz, who in 1928 as a 16-year-old high school junior became the first woman to win an Olympic gold medal in track and field, died Tuesday in Colorado. She was 87.         Her son, Richard Schwartz Jr. of Denver, told The Chicago Tribune she had suffered from cancer and Alzheimer's disease in recent years.         Robinson's life story -- which included prodigious athletic glory, a life-threatening accident and an amazing Olympic comeback -- sounded like the product of an overimaginative screenwriter.         Elizabeth (Babe) Robinson was born Aug. 23, 1911, in Riverdale, Ill., a small town south of Chicago. Her career started when a high school teacher and assistant track coach in Harvey, Ill., saw her running for a commuter train (the legend is that she caught it). She later ran 50 yards for him in a school corridor, and a track career began.         These were the nascent days of organized women's track and field at the national level. As she told The Los Angeles Times in 1984: ''I had no idea that women even ran then. I grew up a hick. That is when I found out that they actually had track meets for women.''         Three weeks after being discovered, Robinson made her racing debut in a regional meet and finished second to Helen Filkey, the United States record-holder at 100 meters. In her next meet, the Chicago-area Olympic trials, she equaled the world record of 12.0 seconds (the current world record is 10.49, set by Florence Griffith Joyner in 1988). In her third meet, the United States final trials in Newark, she finished second and made the Olympic team.         In 1928, the year Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, female track and field athletes were allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The 1928 Amsterdam Games would mark the fourth meet of Robinson's career, just four months after she took up the sport at age 16.         A week after qualifying for the Olympics, she and her teammates sailed to Amsterdam and worked out on a quarter-mile linoleum track laid around the ship's deck. In Amsterdam, she finished second in her trial heat and first in her semifinal and became the only American to reach the finals.         The finish was close in the finals, and the judges declared Robinson the winner over the favored Fanny Rosenfeld of Canada in an official time of 12.2. Because the 100-meter race was the first of five women's track and field events at the 1928 Games, Robinson had won the first gold medal handed out in her sport.         ''When the flag went up after the race,'' she said, ''I started crying like a baby.''         Rosenfeld and her Canadian teammates later defeated Robinson and the American team in the 4x100-meter relay, with the United States team taking the silver.         After Robinson won the gold, Douglas MacArthur, then the president of the American Olympic Committee, presented her with a small gold charm shaped like the world. When she returned home, she was honored by ticker-tape parades down Broadway in New York and State Street in Chicago. In her hometown, she received a diamond watch from an adoring public and a silver cup from her high school.         She was still a world-class athlete when a biplane she was riding in with her cousin crashed near Chicago in 1931. Both survived, but Robinson spent 11 weeks in a hospital with severe head injuries and a broken leg and arm. A silver rod and pin were inserted to stabilize the leg, which was placed in a hip-to-heel cast. For four months, she was in a wheelchair or on crutches, and the leg became a half-inch shorter.         ''If I had not been in such good physical condition,'' she said, ''I would not have lived through it.''         As it was, she was out of competition for three and a half years. When she tried a comeback in 1936, she could not bend a knee, so she had to make a standing rather than a crouching start in the 100 meters. Still, she made the Olympic relay team, along with Harriet Bland, Annette Rogers and Helen Stephens. This time in Berlin, the American team -- with Robinson running the third leg -- captured the gold when a member of the record-setting German team fumbled the baton pass before the last handoff. Robinson had completed an improbable comeback.         In 1939, she married Richard S. Schwartz, who owned an upholstery firm. They had two children.         Besides her son, she is survived by her daughter, Jane Hamilton of Denver, and three grandchildren.         Her career included world records at 50, 60, 70 and 100 yards. She was inducted into the National Track and Field, the United States Track and Field and the Helms Halls of Fame. After she stopped running, she was a coach, timer and public speaker.         She never received the publicity and public adulation of such American successors as Babe Didrikson, Wilma Rudolph and Griffith Joyner. Years after her Olympic triumphs, she said: ''I suppose most Americans don't even recognize me. It happened so long ago I still can't believe the attention I get for something I did so long ago.''       
         Maria Stader, a soprano who was best known for the elegance of her Mozart performances, died on Tuesday in Zurich, The Associated Press reported. She was 87 and lived in Zurich.         Ms. Stader made several operatic appearances, most notably as the Queen of the Night in a Covent Garden staging of Mozart's ''Magic Flute,'' a work she also recorded with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Ernst Haefliger. She also made a highly praised recording of Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice.'' But she generally preferred the concert repertory.         Mozart's florid ''Exsultate, Jubilate'' was a particular specialty, and she performed it frequently in New York. It was the vehicle for her New York debut in 1954, as a soloist with the Little Orchestra Society, and she sang it with the New York Philharmonic (under George Szell) in 1964 and at the first Mostly Mozart Festival in 1966. Her performances of Mozart concert arias and her solos in the composer's Masses were also highly regarded. In addition to Mozart, Ms. Stader's repertory included works of Alessandro Scarlatti, Gluck, Bruckner and Mahler.         Ms. Stader was born in Budapest in 1911, but was reared in Switzerland by adoptive parents after she was orphaned during World War I. She began her musical studies in Zurich, and continued them with Hans Keller in Karlsruhe, Germany, and with teachers in Milan and New York. When she won the Geneva International Competition in 1939, the prize was to have included performances in Europe. The tour was canceled after the outbreak of World War II. Ms. Stader remained in Switzerland and finally began her international career in the late 1940's. In 1950 and 1965 she was awarded the Lilli Lehmann Medal for outstanding artistic achievement by the Salzburg Mozarteum.         When she retired from the concert stage in 1969 -- her farewell performance was as a soloist in the Mozart Requiem in New York -- she was still in superb vocal form, but told interviewers that she preferred to leave the stage before she began reading that her voice was not what it was. She was by then married to Hans Erismann, with whom she had two sons.         After she stopped singing, Ms. Stader devoted herself to teaching, principally in Zurich. She wrote a book on Bach arias and an autobiography, ''Nehmt Meinen Dank'' (''Accept My Thanks'').       
         Alice Adams, widely admired for her deft, elegantly observed novels and short stories, died yesterday at her home in San Francisco. She was 72.         She had been treated for heart problems earlier in the week and seemed to have died in her sleep, said her editor, Victoria Wilson.         In 10 novels and five collections of short stories, Ms. Adams created richly textured, artfully constructed novels about women's lives that sometimes mirrored and sometimes anticipated changes in the society as a whole. Admirers particularly praised her ability to capture place and voice and the deceptively artful craft of her writing.         Ms. Adams was born Aug. 14, 1926, in Fredericksburg, Va., grew up in Chapel Hill, N.C., was educated at Harvard, and spent most of her adult life in San Francisco, and her writing in many ways fused the seductive intimacy of the South, the intellectual sophistication of New England and the sense of adventure and openness to new experiences of the West.         ''She was just so deft and had such a wonderful touch,'' said Ms. Wilson, her editor for 25 years at Knopf, where she published all of her short-story collections and all but one of her novels. Another novel, ''After the War,'' has been completed and will be published next year. ''She was a master at condensing so much, with so much resonance, into a short form,'' Ms. Wilson added.         Alice Adams lived a life full of enough energy, contradiction and nuance that it would have made an apt subject for her own fiction. She was the only child of Agatha Erskine (Boyd) Adams and Nicholson Barney Adams. Her father was a Spanish professor at the University of North Carolina, her mother a frustrated writer full of unfulfilled literary aspirations. Ms. Adams described her family as ''three difficult, isolated people.''         She graduated from high school at 15, at which point, she once said, she ''ran into trouble because of that Southern thing that women are supposed to be stupid.''         She went to Radcliffe College, where she graduated at the age of 19 and soon married a fellow Harvard student, Mark Linenthal. The couple spent their first year together in Paris, where she soon realized the marriage was a mistake. ''I loved Paris,'' she said later, ''except I disliked him so much.''         The couple moved to San Francisco in 1948, where she found little time to pursue her writing. Eventually the couple divorced in 1958. Struggling to raise their only son, Peter, who survives her, she began writing seriously soon after while holding a variety of bookkeeping and clerical jobs. She published her first novel, ''Careless Love,'' to mixed reviews and after years of struggling to establish herself published her first short story for The New Yorker in 1969. She became one of the magazine's most distinctive fictional voices, eventually publishing more than 25 short stories there.         She soon established herself as a skillful, widely admired short-story writer and her second novel, ''Families and Survivors,'' the odyssey of a woman who moves from the South to San Francisco and from relationship to relationship, was published by Knopf in 1975. Reviewers either loved it or hated it, but it established her as a serious literary presence. That novel was followed by ''Listening to Billie'' in 1978 and the short-story collection ''Beautiful Girl'' in 1979. The Washington Post Book World compared the book to the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald ''in both style and subject matter.'' She had her greatest success with ''Superior Women'' in 1984, which became a best seller and traced the lives of five Radcliffe women from 1943 to 1983. Admirers saw it as fusing the sensibilities of Jane Austen and Mary McCarthy.         Not everyone was so enamored. Some critics found her work mannered and humorless. But she became a consistent seller, who was widely admired and sometimes imitated by other writers.         ''No one wrote better about the tangled relations of men and women or about the enduring romance of friendship,'' said Fran Kiernan, a former New Yorker editor, who edited Ms. Adams's New Yorker stories for 10 years, beginning with ''Beautiful Girl'' in 1977. ''She was a great romantic, with the highest expectations of life. As a writer, she was unfailingly wise.''         Ms. Adams's stories have appeared in 22 O'Henry Awards collections and in several volumes of ''Best American Short Stories.'' She received an Academy and Institute Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.         Tall and striking looking, with short blond hair, turning gray, Ms. Adams was known for her sense of style as well as for her liberal politics and her wry view of life.         Describing the difficulty of writing as one ages, she said, ''Some smart person once said that what happens is your critical standards rise, and your talent does not necessarily increase in a commensurate way.''       
         Kathleen Kellogg Meserve, an amateur horticulturist from Long Island who produced a series of hardy holly hybrids that have become standard in nurseries and gardens in the United States and Europe, died last Sunday at her home in Vero Beach, Fla. She was 93.         Mrs. Meserve's interest in holly began shortly after World War II when she and her family moved to a 10-acre estate in St. James on Long Island and she chanced to attend a local garden-club lecture about the holly, the evergreen whose glossy, pointed leaves and clusters of red berries decorate gardens and deck the halls at Christmas.         At that time, the hollies used for Christmas foliage were the fragile English variety, Ilex aquifolium, which were grown in the Pacific Northwest and shipped as cut greenery to the East. Mrs. Meserve decided to create a English-style holly that could withstand the harsh winters of the Northeast.         The breakthrough came when Mrs. Meserve cross-bred Ilex rugosa, a low-growing native holly of northern Japan, with the handsome Ilex aquifolium. The results were  blue hollies, hybrids with exceptionally dark blue-green, spine-tipped foliage and excellent hardiness.         ''I didn't foresee my success,'' she later recalled. ''I just wanted to create something that was going to give pleasure and be beautiful.''         Blue Girl, Blue Boy, Blue Prince, Blue Princess and Blue Angel were followed by China Boy and China Girl, each with subtly different characteristics. As recently as 1997, she produced a new hybrid she called Centennial Girl.         The profits from the sale of Mrs. Meserve's holly patents helped to  maintain her estate, which came to be called Holly-by-Golly, and her plants are sold by commercial growers throughout the world.         When honored by the United States Patent Office in 1980 for her contributions to horticulture on the 50th anniversary of the Plant Patent Law, Mrs. Meserve said she held more plant patents than any other person in the country.         The former Kathleen Kellogg was born in Manhattan and graduated from Miss Chandor's School. She took pleasure in telling visitors that her cultivars -- the name for varieties developed and maintained in cultivation -- had been created in a kitchen by an amateur gardener whose formal study of botany ended in the fifth grade.         ''A professor from a leading university with a strong graduate horticulture program visited me once,'' she told an interviewer in 1978 with obvious delight. ''He told me that he was amazed at how his school spent thousands of dollars in research hoping to come up with a new strain, but that here I did it on $15.         ''Not knowing what I was doing was an advantage,'' she said. ''Especially, at the beginning. I didn't know what could be done and what couldn't. So I just did it.''         She once observed, ''Horticulture is the only field in which an amateur can be on the same level as an expert.''         In 1975 the American Horticultural Society honored Mrs. Meserve for her ''outstanding contributions to amateur horticulture'' and six years later she received the Eloise Payne Luquer Medal of the Garden Club of America for her work in hybridizing  hollies and greatly extending their temperature range.         And in 1992 the land of Christmas holly recognized her contributions when the Royal Horticultural Society of Great Britain gave her the Reginald Cory Memorial Cup.         Her husband, F. Leighton Meserve, died in 1968. She is survived by a son, Frederick L. Meserve Jr. of Kennett Square, Pa; two daughters, Anne Davis of Winnetka, Ill., and Marcia Poutiatine of Vero Beach;  seven grandchildren and a great grandchild.       
         Meg Greenfield, the editor of The Washington Post's editorial page, who brought a combination of sharp-eyed analysis and wry wit to bear on a generation of the nation's policy makers and politicians, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. She was 68.         She died of cancer, said The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham. The cancer had been diagnosed three years before, but not until the last six weeks did the disease sap her strength enough to silence her tart editorial voice. Her last column appeared in The Post on March 15.         Fred Hiatt, an editorial-page colleague, said yesterday, ''When it was time for her column, no matter how her body was conspiring against her, she would summon this incredible force of will and turn out a column that the rest of us would envy.''         In four decades as a reporter, editorialist and quietly influential opinion maker in the nation's capital, Miss Greenfield provided a stream of informed commentary that had an impact on the public perception of six Presidential administrations and scores of policy debates, ranging from affirmative action and abortion rights to the Panama Canal treaties and the Persian Gulf war. In 1978, when she was The Post's deputy editorial page editor, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.         In her role as the newspaper's editorial-page editor for the last 20 years and as a columnist for Newsweek magazine for 25 years, Miss Greenfield pored over the details of policy with the passion of a political scientist and wrote of the complex architecture of democracy with reverence. She also perfected a tone of sly mockery and an eye for the absurd, both of which informed the best of her work.         ''Meg has had a big influence,'' said Jodie Allen, who was lured into journalism by Miss Greenfield and is now a senior writer at U.S. News & World Report. ''She set the tone of debate early, before it became conventional wisdom. It's hard to see, because so many things she pioneered, like neoliberalism, are now in the water supply.''         Though capable of a passion for social justice, she sometimes irritated the city's progressive circles with her skepticism about any government's abilities to keep fallible citizens up to some moral mark. She also arched an editorial eyebrow at what she considered blunderbuss attacks on the conservative policies of the Reagan Administration.         A hands-on manager of both the editorial and op-ed pages of The Post, Miss Greenfield also spotted and showcased intellectual talent. Washington writers and commentators, including George Will, Michael Kinsley, Roger W. Wilkins and Charles Kraut hammer credit Miss Greenfield with starting or fast-forwarding their careers.         Her friends and confidants were legion, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board. Miss Greenfield's diminutive figure was a fixture in the elite dining rooms of Georgetown, where she lived near the home of her employer, who was also among her closest friends, Katharine Graham, the chairwoman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company, which owns both The Post and Newsweek. She was also close to Mrs. Graham's son, Donald, who is the company's current chairman and chief executive as well as The Post's publisher.         ''Meg was unique in her mind, character, and affinity for hard work,'' Mrs. Graham said in a statement yesterday. ''She was both brilliant and funny, a writer and an editor of amazing ability. She will be missed by all those affected by her original, independent thinking, by her family, her colleagues, and her close friends.''         As an editorialist, she was both a judge and a connoisseur of the foibles of the city's political and intellectual elites. ''Her mark was her obliqueness,'' Mr. Will said. ''Most columnists are Hemingway. She's Henry James, using understatement, nuance, indirection. It lasts better.''         Though missing in action from the televised punditry that began to dominate the nation's political discussion in the 1980's and 1990's, Miss Greenfield wielded her influence in many other venues, from the dinner parties of the powerful to the Columbia University offices where, from 1986 to 1995, she sat in judgment on her colleagues' work as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board.         She also had a keen sensibility for literature, history, fact and hypocrisy, and what dose of each goes into a person's reputation. That sensibility shone through one of her last columns, ''Goodbye, Columbus,'' in which she discussed the attitude of President Clinton's supporters toward Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia.         ''Senator Byrd was seen for a time as just another starchy, retrograde legislator, all hung up on the archaic lore of the Senate, ceaselessly spouting citations and precedents from the Constitution,'' she wrote. ''To be rude about it, as they were, they dismissed him as a bore.         ''But when it became apparent that his inclination and his own studies were leading him not to a love of Clinton or even to a degree of political solidarity with him, let alone any sympathy for what he did, but rather to conclusions about the Constitution that would be advantageous to Clinton, all that quickly changed. Byrd became in the Clinton supporters' depiction a great Roman statesman, a man beyond reproach -- a living, walking, breathing toga.''         Mary Ellen Greenfield -- she derived Meg from her initials -- was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Seattle, where her father, Lewis Greenfield, ran an antiques business. She graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1952, with a major in English literature, then spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar at Cambridge University in England, specializing in William Blake's works.         After considering an academic career, Miss Greenfield decided on journalism instead, joining The Reporter, a magazine of analysis and commentary, in 1957 as a researcher in its Washington bureau.         After three years of largely anonymous work, she published, in the heat of the 1960 Presidential campaign between Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy, a scathing intellectual profile of Mr. Nixon.         ''Refusal to answer a question by setting up a straw man to attack instead is a not uncommon device of debating,'' she wrote. ''But in Nixon's prose the straw man emerges as more than a debating device: it is an innate feature of his thinking. Nixon apparently finds it almost impossible to make a statement that is not, in some manner, an argument. Ideas never quite exist for him until they have been pitted against something else -- an extreme danger, a radically different point of view, or a potential attack from some sinister quarter.''         Miss Greenfield was promoted to staff writer at the magazine in 1961 and in 1965 became its Washington editor. When The Reporter shut down in 1968, Miss Greenfield became the first person hired by Philip Geyelin, the newly appointed editorial page editor of The Washington Post. One of Mr. Geyelin's early goals was to turn The Post away from the hawkish stance on the Vietnam War favored by its departing editorial page editor, J. Russell Wiggins.         As Mr. Geyelin and Mrs. Graham recount it, Miss Greenfield paid a courtesy call on Mr. Wiggins. Afterward, the unreconstructed cold warrior said to his dovish successor: ''My boy, you're making the mistake of your life. She's on my side.''         Few others would try to pigeonhole Miss Greenfield in the years that followed.         A year after she arrived at The Post, Mr. Geyelin made Miss Greenfield his deputy. A decade later, she replaced him. Even though she rose to the top of her profession during the years that saw the rise of the feminist movement, Miss Greenfield kept a studied distance from it.         Still, Miss Greenfield gleefully skewered some of the racism and sexism of the city's journalistic culture. In 1970, she solicited an op-ed article from Mr. Wilkins, a prominent black intellectual and policy analyst, about the Gridiron Dinner.         The piece focused on the raw humor featured at the dinner, which is an annual off-the-record event that brings the city's journalistic and political elites together for assorted high jinks. ''It was a piece that really kind of blew the town apart because people were not supposed to write about the Gridiron and I wrote about how racist that particular dinner was,'' Mr. Wilkins said.         Miss Greenfield and Mrs. Graham toured another Gridiron from the outside, trying to get a feel for the women's protests while ducking behind the dashboard of a car to avoid being seen. After the barriers fell, Miss Greenfield was a frequent guest at Gridiron dinners, attending the most recent one earlier this year.         An avid reader of literature, Miss Greenfield studied Latin in the 1970's so she could read more classic works. She was also a perennial on the college commencement circuit, receiving honorary degrees from Smith, Georgetown University, Wesleyan University, Williams College and Princeton University.         When she first became ill with lung cancer, Miss Greenfield returned to the region where she grew up and bought a home in the Puget Sound area. The property also allowed her more time to see her nephews and nieces. Her late brother's five children are her only remaining relatives.         In 1980, she wrote a mock lament to the knee-jerk excesses of her chosen profession. The piece was inspired by an embarrassing mistake at The Boston Globe that let a joke headline, ''More Mush From the Wimp,'' sneak into the newspaper over an editorial about a speech by President Jimmy Carter. After 100,000 copies were on the street, it was replaced with the headline ''All Must Share the Burden.''         ''That's the part that got us,'' Miss Greenfield wrote. ''All Must Share the Burden.'' She continued: ''Just put us in the presence of that headline and, we can't help ourselves, we start automatically and compulsively writing the editorial that goes with it. It's all about how men of good will should cease the bootless acrimony as there can be no winners in this tragic dispute and the biggest losers of all will be -- are you ready? -- well, of course, the nation's children.''         She added: ''When the end of the world finally comes about and editorial writers are all called to judgment, it won't be the headline pranks run amok, that sort of thing, that will get us. No, it will be all those other miles of editorial prose that fit so nicely under the headline ''All Must Share the Burden'' for which we will, collectively, fry.''       
         Kirsten Ralov, one of Denmark's greatest ballerinas and an authority on the unusually sparkling Danish style of classical dancing, died on Sunday at her home in Copenhagen. She was 77.         The cause was cancer, said Ebbe Mork, a dance writer in Copenhagen.         Miss Ralov was celebrated for her performances in the ballets of August Bournonville, the 19th-century Danish choreographer whose works emphasize a charming stage presence and fleet and light footwork. Associated with the Royal Danish Ballet throughout her career, Miss Ralov entered its school in 1922 and spent her artistic life from childhood to maturity on the stage of the Royal Theater in Copenhagen.         Her first major performances were in Bournonville ballets: she made her theatrical debut in a children's role in ''Konservatoriet'' in 1933 and received her first solo part as an adult dancer in ''La Ventana'' in 1941. She gave her farewell performance as the Ballerina Doll in Michel Fokine's ''Petrouchka'' in 1962. She then served as a ballet mistress for the Royal Danish Ballet and was its associate director from 1978 to 1988.         Miss Ralov's repertory in Copenhagen ranged from Myrta, the evil queen of the spirits in ''Giselle,'' to the sophisticated Street Dancer in Leonide Massine's ''Beau Danube''; she also danced a solo role in George Balanchine's abstract ''Symphony in C.'' But she was essentially a Bournonville specialist, starring in ballets like ''Napoli,'' ''The Kermesse in Bruges'' and ''A Folk Tale.''         Miss Ralov also did much to acquaint the world with Danish ballet. She and her husband, Fredbjorn Bjornsson, who died in 1993, were among the first Danish dancers to tour internationally, appearing with a small group of soloists at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1955 and with the full Royal Danish Ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1956.         After her retirement as a performer, Miss Ralov staged Bournonville productions for many companies.         She is survived by two sons.       
         Kirsten Ralov, one of Denmark's greatest ballerinas and an authority on the unusually sparkling Danish style of classical dancing, died on Sunday at her home in Copenhagen. She was 77.         The cause was cancer, said Ebbe Mork, a dance writer in Copenhagen.

         Wilmina Rowland Smith, who in 1971 became the first woman to serve as a guest chaplain of the Senate, died on June 5 at a retirement home in St. Petersburg, Fla. She was 91.         Billie Rowland, as she was known, was born in Augusta, Ga., on March 17, 1908, and received bachelor's degree from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa. She also earned master's degrees from Yale University and Union Theological Seminary in New York.         After college she traveled widely,  settling for a time in China to teach the children of American missionaries.         She worked for World Student Relief in Geneva after World War II, and in 1957 became the sixth woman to be ordained by the Presbyterian Church USA.         In the early 1960's, she was a staff member of the National Council of Churches in Greenville, Miss. She retired in 1973, two years after giving the opening prayer at a Senate session.         Her husband, H. Maxcy Smith, died in 1985.       
         Cecilia Danieli,  who helped revolutionize the world steel industry by developing the compact steel mills known in the industry as minimills, died last Thursday of cancer. She was 56.         Though women made broad strides in Italian business in her lifetime, Ms. Danieli was one of a handful who reached the top in the male domain of heavy industry. Her presence at the top, she once said, meant that Danieli consistently boasted a higher percentage of women in management posts than Italian companies of comparable size.         The company she ran, Danieli Group, founded by her grandfather in the family's hometown of Buttrio in Northern Italy, developed in the 1950's from a small manufacturer of scissors and shears to a supplier of compact steel mills to small Northern Italian steelmakers that mainly supplied the steel reinforcing bars that were the sinews of postwar Italian reconstruction.         Beginning in the 1970's, the company began shipping its engineers abroad to build mills in places like Mozambique to produce steel bars or rolling mills in the United States. These mills revolutionized steelmaking and tilted the market away from the developed world by giving scores of countries in Africa, South America and the East Asia the means to produce steel cheaply and efficiently. They ultimately led, in highly industrialized countries like the United States, to the decline of traditional big steel mills and their replacement by smaller, more flexible minimills.         Ms. Danieli, one of four sisters, was forced to take charge of the family company founded by her grandfather in 1914 in the mid-1970's, when the oil price increases in the first half of that decade drained the capital to invest in steel and scuttled further expansion. In 1976, the company posted its first loss ever. That year, she assumed the top position of managing director next to her father, Luigi, who remained president of the company but concentrated on the engineering side of the business.         She quickly rejuvenated Danieli's management, then gained a major breakthrough when the company captured a $240 million contract for a steel mill in the former East Germany from its nearest competitor, the giant Krupp group of the former West Germany. She also expanded sales in North and South America, Asia and the former Soviet Union.         In addition to its Italian headquarters, the company, with roughly 3,000 employees, had affiliates in Youngstown, Ohio, and in Sweden.         In 1984, to keep the company financially as well as technologically fit, Ms. Danieli took the unusual step for Italian family-run companies, and against the opposition of her more traditional father, of listing Danieli on the stock exchange. About 54 percent of the company remained controlled by her and Gianpietro Benedetti, her companion, with whom she shared management of the company in recent years.         Ms. Danieli entered the company in 1969 after earning a degree in economics at nearby Trieste University. A fluent English speaker, she once worked as a student for a summer on a truck farm near Schuylerville, N.Y. She avoided the limelight often favored by Italian executives. But Danieli's business success reflected her drive for technical superiority and her untiring sales efforts. A passionate student of history and a mountain climber, in the mid-1990's she once spent Christmas Day in the mountains of Iran to negotiate a sale.         She is survived by Mr. Benedetti and three children.       
         Ruth Langer Lawrence, who as a 15-year-old Austrian Jewish swimmer refused to compete in the 1936 Olympic Games in Nazi Germany, died on May 2. Lawrence, who lived in London, was 77.         Lawrence was born and reared in Vienna and took up swimming at age 11 with the Jewish sports club Hakoah (meaning strength). At 14, she broke the Austrian records for the 100-meter and 400-meter freestyles and won the Austrian championships at those distances. Although Austrian officials were uncomfortable about choosing Jews for their Olympic team, she, Judith Deutsch and Lucie Goldner, all Jews, were about to be selected.         Anti-Semitism was strong in Austria then, and the pools where the swimmers would do their final training carried signs saying ''No entry for dogs and Jews.'' Heeding the recommendation of the World Federation of Jewish Sports Clubs, headed by Lord Melchett of Britain, the three swimmers refused to take part in the Olympics.         ''We do not boycott Olympia, but Berlin,'' they said in a statement.         The three women were immediately banned from Austrian swimming ''due to severe damage of Austrian sports'' and ''gross disrespect for the Olympic spirit.'' The names of all Jewish swimmers were removed from the Austrian record books.         After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Lawrence escaped to Italy by dyeing her hair blonde and carrying a false baptismal certificate. In 1939, she moved to England, and that year she won the last British long-distance championship swim in the Thames.         Five weeks later, World War II began and she was evacuated from London to Bath as an ''enemy alien.'' She was later allowed to return to London, where she met John Lawrence, whom she married in 1943. She is survived by her husband, a son and a daughter.         Lawrence's photograph is included in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's traveling exhibition of the Nazi Olympics. The exhibition closed last week in Portland, Ore., and will reopen July 1 in San Diego. She was also interviewed for Stephen Spielberg's Holocaust archives.         Before the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Lawrence told Reuters: ''Whenever the Games come up again, I get a heartache. It's something that stays with you for the rest of your life. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But being Jewish, it was unthinkable to compete in the Games in Nazi Germany, where my people were being persecuted.''         In 1995, the Federation of Austrian Swimming Clubs lifted the ban imposed on her. The federation president wrote:         ''When I learned in recent weeks that athletes who refused to serve as window-dressing for the Hitler regime received a lifetime ban  . . . I blushed with anger and shame. I am deeply ashamed of the decision taken at that time.         ''You, who as an irreproachable and decent athlete, did everything you could to achieve athletic success, were already stamped by the Nuremberg Laws as a second-class person, and for renouncing athletic success in order to show solidarity with the persecuted, you were punished.         ''Those responsible today for the Federation of Austrian Swimming Clubs are glad that you survived that cruel and merciless time and humbly apologize for what our predecessors did. All of your athletic successes and achievements are hereby confirmed and recorded in the perpetual scoring tables. You, Ms. Lawrence, are an example to young people. We are proud that you are there.''       
         Anne Sheafe Miller, who made medical history as the first patient ever saved by penicillin, died on May 27 in Salisbury, Conn. She was 90.         In March 1942, Mrs. Miller was near death at New Haven Hospital suffering from a streptococcal infection, a common cause of death then. She had been hospitalized for a month, often delirious with her temperature spiking to nearly 107, while doctors tried everything available, including sulfa drugs, blood transfusions and surgery. All failed.         As she slipped in and out of consciousness, her desperate doctors obtained a tiny amount of what was still an obscure, experimental drug and injected her with it. Her hospital chart, now at the Smithsonian Institution, registered a sharp overnight drop in temperature, and by the next day she was no longer delirious and soon was eating full meals, one of her doctors reported.         Mrs. Miller's life was saved, and so eventually were the lives of all those previously felled by infections of bacteria like streptococci, staphylococci and pneumococci. Penicillin also saved the lives of an untold number of servicemen and civilians wounded in World War II; in earlier wars, people died by the thousands from bacterial infections resulting from their injuries.         Although Sir Alexander Fleming, the Scottish biologist, was the first to recognize the therapeutic potential of penicillin through a chance discovery at St. Mary's Hospital in London in 1928, nearly a dozen years passed before scientists fully appreciated its significance and were able to produce it for experimental use in humans.         Largely forgotten, it came to the fore only when researchers picked up on it again at Oxford University at the outbreak of World War II.         Before Mrs. Miller's doctors succeeded in saving her life, only a few experiments had been conducted with penicillin in mice and people, with results mixed and largely disheartening.         The small quantity of penicillin rushed to New Haven came from a laboratory in New Jersey, and news of Mrs. Miller's full, seemingly miraculous recovery helped inspire the American pharmaceutical industry to begin full production of penicillin.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Miller graduated in 1931 from Columbia Presbyterian School of Nursing, now part of Columbia University. The next year, she married Ogden D. Miller, a Yale University administrator. The family moved to Washington, Conn., in 1945, when Mr. Miller became headmaster of the Gunnery School, where he served until he retired in 1969. He died nine years later, and Mrs. Miller remained in Washington until 1996, when she moved to a retirement community in Salisbury.         She is survived by three sons, Ogden D. Jr., of Vienna, Va., David P., of Darlington, Md., and Dwight D., of Watertown, Mass.; a brother, Theodore H. Sheafe of Tigard, Ore.; a sister, Mary S. Jewett of Lyme, Conn.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Sylvia Sidney, whose vulnerable but spunky persona helped make her the ultimate heroine of realistic movies of the 1930's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Sidney determined to be an actress at the age of 15 and perfected her artistry over six decades in a versatile mix of 40 films and 100 classical and modern plays.         In her 20's, the petite actress with a heart-shaped face, large, moist eyes and a tremulous voice played anguished film heroines in Rouben Mamoulian's ''City Streets,'' Theodore Dreiser and Josef von Sternberg's ''American Tragedy,'' Elmer Rice and King Vidor's ''Street Scene,'' Sidney Kingsley's ''Dead End'' and Alfred Hitchcock's ''Sabotage.'' She also starred in the first three American films directed by Fritz Lang: ''Fury,'' ''You Only Live Once'' and ''You and Me.''         In Lang's stark cinema of social injustice, the film historian David Thomson wrote, the actress ''caught exactly the fragile happiness allowed in Lang's world and played with a restraint that perfectly matched the fatal simplicity of the plots. There are close-ups in 'Fury' of Sidney watching Spencer Tracy in a burning jail, as harrowed as any Lillian Gish close-ups'' in D. W. Griffith's silent film masterpieces.         Miss Sidney was grateful for tutelage from her first film directors. In 1977 she remarked: ''King Vidor and Mamoulian, of course, I adored. Fritz Lang and I became dear friends, though we had awful fights.'' But producers were reluctant to free her from type-casting, prompting her to deplore her repetitious roles as ''the girl of the gangster, then the sister who was bringing up the gangster, then later the mother of the gangster, and they always had me ironing somebody's shirt.''         Miss Sidney also resented being treated as studio property. She considered herself not a star, but an actress. Eventually she expanded her gallery of screen characters to include a chic Eurasian double-agent in ''Blood on the Sun'' (1945), an idealistic journalist in ''The Searching Wind'' (1946), a drudge in ''Les Miserables'' (1952) and a hard-bitten matriarch in ''Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams'' (1973), for which she was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress. In the 1980's her films included ''Hammett,'' ''Corrupt'' and ''Beetlejuice,'' directed by Tim Burton. In 1996 she appeared in a cameo as a prairie woman in Mr. Burton's ''Mars Attacks!'' as a favor to the director for casting her in ''Beetlejuice'' as a chain-smoking ghoul, a role she thought was ''great,'' said John Springer, her friend and publicist.         On Broadway, Miss Sidney appeared in Ben Hecht's ''To Quito and Back'' (1937), Irwin Shaw's ''Gentle People'' (with the Group Theater, 1939), Carl Reiner and Joseph Stein's ''Enter Laughing'' (1963) and Tennessee Williams's ''Vieux Carre'' (1977).         Her richly varied tour and stock performances included ''Pygmalion,'' ''Angel Street,'' ''Jane Eyre,'' ''Joan of Lorraine,'' ''Kind Lady,'' ''O Mistress Mine,'' ''Anne of the Thousand Days,'' ''The Rivals,'' ''The Madwoman of Chaillot,'' ''The Little Foxes,'' ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' ''She Stoops to Conquer,'' ''The Glass Menagerie,'' ''Cabaret,'' ''Sweet Bird of Youth,'' ''Butterflies Are Free'' and '' 'Night, Mother.''         Among Miss Sidney's dozens of starring television roles were acclaimed performances as a cancer-ridden patient in a hospice in the 1980 play ''The Shadow Box'' and as plain-spoken but compassionate grandmothers of homosexual AIDS patients in ''An Early Frost'' in 1985 and in ''Andre's Mother'' in 1990. Miss Sidney last appeared on screen in 1998 in several episodes of ABC's new version of ''Fantasy Island,'' for which she had a seven-year contract for a recurring role, Mr. Springer said. The show was canceled.         Sylvia Sidney, originally named Sophia Kossow, was born in the Bronx on Aug. 8, 1910, to Victor Kossow, a clothing salesman, and the former Rebecca Saperstein. Her parents were divorced when she was 9, and soon after she was adopted by her mother's second husband, Dr. Sigmund Sidney, a dentist.         Shy and a stutterer, she was given elocution and dancing lessons starting at the age of 10. As a teen-ager, she left Washington Irving High School to study acting at the Theater Guild school in Manhattan and was soon expelled for staying out late. Nonetheless, she obtained a dozen roles and favorable notices in Broadway plays, including a 1928 drama, ''Gods of the Lightning,'' and a 1930 comedy, ''Bad Girl.'' They won her a contract with Paramount Pictures and opened her path to fame.         Her main recreation at her homes in Roxbury and later Danbury, Conn., was needlework. Her designs are sold as kits, and she wrote two popular instruction books on the art: ''Sylvia Sidney's Needlepoint Book'' (1968) and ''The Sylvia Sidney Question and Answer Book on Needlepoint'' (1975).         Miss Sidney's three marriages all ended in divorce. Her husbands were Bennett Cerf, the publisher; Luther Adler, the actor, and Carlton Alsop, a publicity agent. With Mr. Adler, she had a son, Jacob (Jody) Adler, who died in 1987 of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig's disease. His illness prompted her to become a dedicated volunteer for the National A.L.S. Foundation. No immediate family members survive.         Ms. Sidney regarded her life and her career as inseparable. ''There isn't a role that I wouldn't accept, provided it's good and has something to say,'' she told an interviewer in 1975. ''I wouldn't know what to do with myself if I retired. I'm an actress, and I have to work.''         Correction:  July 3, 1999, Saturday  An obituary of the actress Sylvia Sidney yesterday misspelled her original surname. It was Kosow, not Kossow.         The obituary also omitted two survivors. They are her half-brothers, Albert C. Kosow of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Edgar J. Kosow of Plantation, Fla.       
         Patricia Zipprodt, the Tony Award-winning costume designer whose career extended from theater to dance to opera to film and television, died on Saturday at her home in  Greenwich Village. Ms. Zipprodt was 74.         The cause was cancer, according to her sister, Constance Zonka of Chicago.         Quite simply, as a headline writer once put it, Ms. Zipprodt had the gift of garb. In her youth she studied art, and then one day at the ballet she discovered her calling. She wanted to make the dresses.         ''I'll design for the ballet,'' she recalled telling herself. ''I'll paint with fabric.''         Years later she described a play as a painting that moves. ''Instead of it holding still and you look at it, you hold still and it scrolls by,'' she said.         Although she realized her early dream of designing costumes for ballet, she also designed for scores of Broadway shows, won Tony Awards for ''Fiddler on the Roof'' (1964), ''Cabaret'' (1966) and ''Sweet Charity'' (1985), along with many other prizes.         Her costumes graced musicals like ''Pippin'' (1972) and ''Chicago'' (1975), Broadway plays like ''Plaza Suite'' (1968), ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' (1983) and ''The Glass Menagerie'' (1983).         Off Broadway, her credits included ''Our Town'' (1959), ''The Balcony'' (1960), ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad'' (1962) and ''The Blacks'' (1962).         She did wardrobes for the Boston Opera, the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera and for American Ballet Theater, the New York City Ballet, the Houston Ballet and Ballet Hispanico.         In Hollywood she left her imprint on ''The Graduate'' (1967). On television she designed costumes for productions like ''The Glass Menagerie'' on ABC in 1973 and ''Alice in Wonderland'' on WNET in 1983.         Analyzing Ms. Zipprodt's talent, the actor Joel Grey, who worked with her in ''Cabaret'' in 1966, said: ''Her hands were all over the work, whether or not it had to do with making a diaper for Father Time or this very tattered but elegant master-of-ceremonies tail coat.''         Ms. Zipprodt's costumes for ''The Blacks'' brought her to the attention of Jerome Robbins, who hired her when he made his debut as a director with ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad.'' He called on her again for his next show, the hit ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' From Robbins, she said, she learned how to use color to help the audience track the main characters.         In 1990 she spent six months researching and designing more than 300 costumes for the 38-member cast of ''Shogun,'' the muscial based on the James Clavell novel about a shipwrecked 17th-century English navigator who is pivotal in a power struggle among five Japanese overlords.         Despite a million-dollar budget, the assignment, Ms. Zipprodt said, was harder than her work on ''Sunday in the Park With George'' (1984), when the challenge was to design costumes that suggested pointillism without actually using dots; or on the 1977 Metropolitan Opera production of ''Tannhauser,'' which called for more than 200 people to appear onstage at one point.         For ''Shogun'' Ms. Zipprodt traveled to Japan, studied the weaving industry in Kyoto that dated back to the world of ''Shogun'' and visited and photographed Kabuki theaters, samurai-movie studios, gardens, castles and textile mills.         In New York she sought out Japanese women to consult on tradition and custom and experimented in a workshop on West 22d Street with ways to duplicate ancient decorative techniques. (The show was fated to run for only 72 performances.)         Ms. Zipprodt was born in Chicago on Feb. 24, 1925. She was the eldest of three daughters of Agnes Irene Turpin and Herbert Edward Zipprodt, an advertising executive. In 1947 she earned a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College in Massachusetts.  After graduation, she returned to Chicago and fell in love with Lieut. Col. Robert O'Brien Jr., an Army cavalryman, but declined his proposal because she felt she must go to New York to discover if she had artistic talent.         By the 1950's Ms. Zipprodt was living the bohemian life in New York, where she painted at the Art Students League, studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and waited on tables at Schrafft's until her visit to the ballet altered her life forever.         About seven or eight years ago, after Colonel O'Brien had married, retired and become a widower, he came across a biography of Ms. Zipprodt in a copy of Playbill in Washington. It mentioned that she was an artist in residence at Brandeis University's theater department. The colonel called Brandeis and asked for her phone number, which the university would not give out. So he told the university to call her and pass along a message: ''Bob O'Brien called, and I want to marry her.'' The university did as instructed.         Ms. Zipprodt and the colonel were married on June 5, 1993. She lived in  Upperville, Va., and in New York. Colonel O'Brien died in 1998. Ms. Zipprodt was inducted into the Theatrical Hall of Fame in 1992.         As meticulous as she might be, as committed to researching history, assessing color, collecting swatches, cords and tassels and overseeing the  construction of costumes, Ms. Zipprodt never forgot that her quest for authenticity and beauty was in the service of the hectic and sometimes harrowing institution of show business.         ''Velcro,'' she once said, ''is our favorite word.''       
         Anne Woolliams, a British ballet teacher who played a major role in the international success of the Stuttgart Ballet and who became artistic director of the Australian Ballet and the Vienna State Opera Ballet, died in Canterbury, England, on July 8. She was 72 and lived in Canterbury.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Jan Stripling, a former principal dancer with the Stuttgart Ballet.         Ms. Woolliams, who was trained in England and Germany as a dancer, gained her reputation as a distinguished ballet mistress and teacher during her years in Stuttgart from 1963 to 1975. John Cranko, who left the Royal Ballet in Britain to head the company in what was then West Germany, made her his assistant from the start. Soon after his arrival in Stuttgart, he and Ms. Woolliams founded the Stuttgart Ballet School, the first school in West Germany with an integrated program of ballet and academic classes.         As company teacher and ballet mistress, Ms. Woolliams taught many of the company alumni who now direct major companies, including Jiri Kylian, William Forsythe and John Neumeier. Mr. Cranko named Ms. Woolliams assistant director in 1969, the year the Stuttgart Ballet made its highly acclaimed debut in New York.         Born in Folkestone, England, on Aug. 3, 1926, Ms. Woolliams studied modern dance as a child in Germany and ballet in England with Judith Espinosa, Noreen Bush, George Goncharov and Vera Volkova. In London she danced, in 1943, with the Kyasht Ballet and then the Russian Opera and Ballet Company, the St. James Ballet and in the film ''The Red Shoes.''         After Cranko's death in 1973, Ms. Woolliams staged his ballets around the world and remained in Stuttgart  until 1976 when she was invited to become artistic director of the Australian Ballet. Ms. Woolliams returned to Europe in 1987. She served as artistic director of the Vienna State Opera Ballet from 1993 to 1995.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Wendy White-Tomson, and a brother, James, both of Kent, England.       
         Trudi Schoop, a popular Swiss-born comic dancer who became a pioneer in the use of dance movement to treat mental illness, died on July 14 at her home in Van Nuys, Calif. She was 95.         Throughout the 1930's Miss Schoop was often called a female Charlie Chaplin because of the way she, like Chaplin, could combine merriment with pathos. But in the mid-40's she gave up performing to explore ways in which dance could serve as therapy for schizophrenic patients.         The daughter of a Zurich newspaper editor, Miss Schoop was essentially self-taught, although she did take some ballet and modern-dance lessons after she had already established herself as a performer. By the early 30's she was spending much of her time traveling with her company, and she made several American tours under the auspices of the impresario Sol Hurok.         Miss Schoop specialized in comic suites based upon the misadventures of a central figure. She played a male character who was frequently likened to Chaplin's Little Tramp in ''Fridolin on the Road.'' Reviewing its New York premiere for The New York Times in 1935, John Martin called Miss Schoop ''agreeable and clever,'' but also ''obvious and naive.'' Two years later, he was more enthusiastic about ''Blonde Marie,'' finding this depiction of an awkward but endearing servant girl notable for its ''great gusto and good humor.''         Miss Schoop remained in Switzerland throughout World War II, often performing in anti-Fascist cabaret shows. When the war ended, she resumed touring, offering a New York season in 1947. Soon thereafter she settled in the Los Angeles area and began a second career as a therapist.         Working with several California medical institutions, including Camarillo State Mental Hospital, she developed what she called ''body-ego technique,'' which used movement to help lead patients out of isolation so that they could respond to, rather than shrink from, human contact.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Marguerite W. Cullman, a longtime theatrical investor who was also an author, died yesterday in her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 94, and her main residence was in Purchase, N.Y.         After working as an editor of the old Stage magazine, Mrs. Cullman began investing with her husband, Howard S. Cullman, who was chairman of what was then called the Port of New York Authority and was prominent in the tobacco industry, serving on the board of Philip Morris  Inc. He died in 1972.         The couple began investing in Broadway productions in the 1930's because, as their children said yesterday, while Mrs. Cullman worked at Stage she liked to be sure that a play the magazine wrote about would not fold before the next issue appeared.         As a family story has it, Mrs. Cullman proved prescient in guessing on behalf of the magazine which plays would prove durable. When her husband learned that, he proposed that she read the scripts of forthcoming Broadway productions and he study the financial prospectuses issued by their producers.         After Mrs. Cullman left the magazine, the couple began their investing, which continued into the 1970's and brought them renown for their shrewdness and energy.         Robert Whitehead, the theatrical producer, recalled last night, ''I could see that she got a kick out of the theater and a kick out of being associated with it through investment.''         Among the hits that the Cullmans helped bring to the stage were ''Life With Father,'' ''Oklahoma!,'' ''Carousel,'' ''Brigadoon,'' ''South Pacific,'' ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Teahouse of the August Moon,'' ''Death of Salesman'' and ''A Streetcar Named Desire.''         During the 1940's and 1950's, their children said, the couple's success rate was so high that their participation in a forthcoming show was enough to guarantee its full funding.         Marguerite Sanders, as she then was, was born and reared in Manhattan, attended Columbia University, worked as a writer and editor for the McNaught Newspaper Syndicate and contributed articles to The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker and other publications.         In addition, she wrote two books, ''Occupation Angel'' (1962), about Broadway, and ''Ninety Dozen Glasses'' (1960), about her life with Mr. Cullman in 1958, when he was the United States Commissioner for the World's Fair in Brussels.         She was also vice chairman of the Lighthouse for the Blind and served on the board of the Spence-Chapin Home for Adoption.         An early marriage was annulled. She married Mr. Cullman in 1935.         She is survived by a daughter, Marguerite P. Cullman of Severna Park, Md.; a son, Brian Henry Cullman of Manhattan; two stepsons, Hugh Cullman of Beaufort, N.C., and Paul T. Cullman of Ferndale, Wash.; 12 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren.       
         Helen Forrest, the big-band singer whose dreamy hits with the Harry James orchestra distilled the nostalgic spirit of World War II pop, died on Sunday at the Motion Picture Country Home and Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 82.         The cause was congestive heart failure, The Associated Press reported.         Known as ''the voice of the name bands,'' Ms. Forrest became a leading vocalist in 1938 when she replaced Billie Holiday as the singer with Artie Shaw's orchestra. She also worked with Benny Goodman (1939-41) and James (1941-43) before going solo in 1944. In 1940 Ms. Forrest, who was white, broke precedent to record a single (''I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You'') with the black band leader Lionel Hampton.         Ms. Forrest's recordings with Shaw included ''Any Old Time,'' ''I'm in Love With the Honorable Mr. So and So,'' ''They Say,'' ''Thanks for Everything'' and ''All the Things You Are.'' Among her recordings with Goodman were ''The Man I Love,'' ''Taking a Chance on Love'' and ''More Than You Know.''         In 1941 she reached a peak of popularity with James, singing the No. 1 wartime hits ''I've Heard That Song Before,'' ''I Don't Want to Walk Without You'' and her signature song, ''I Had the Craziest Dream'' (the title of her 1982 autobiography).         Born Helen Fogel in Atlantic City, Ms. Forrest performed regularly as a young girl on the New York City radio station WNEW. That led to a job on CBS Radio singing with the trumpeter Bunny Berigan. Shaw heard her one night at the Madrillon Club in Washington and invited her to replace Holiday, who, weary of racial indignities suffered on the road, had decided to quit the band.         Ms. Forrest recorded 38 singles for Shaw, and when he briefly disbanded his orchestra in 1939, she moved to Goodman's band, which was not known for being hospitable to vocalists.         Quitting in 1941, she got in touch with James, who gave her a larger-than-usual role in his band and even had his arrangers beef up the orchestrations with violins. The result was a creamy voice-and-trumpet sound, at once spunky and wistful, that captured the wartime longing of women separated from their husbands.         Ms. Forrest's relationship with James, which was romantic as well as professional, disintegrated when he met Betty Grable, whom he later married, while making the movie ''Springtime in the Rockies.''         Married and divorced three times, Ms. Forrest is survived by a son, Forrest Feinman.         Going solo in 1944, Ms. Forrest teamed up with the crooner Dick Haymes to record a series of Top 10 duets that included ''Long Ago and Far Away,'' ''It Had to Be You,'' ''Together,'' ''I'll Buy That Dream,'' ''Some Sunday Morning,'' ''I'm Always Chasing Rainbows'' and ''Oh! What it Seemed to Be.''         In addition to recording and touring, Ms. Forrest made several film shorts with Shaw and appeared in several features with James, including ''Private Buckaroo'' (in which she sang ''You Made Me Love You''), ''Bathing Beauty'' and ''Best Foot Forward.''         As the big band era waned, she sang in supper clubs and on the radio, and from 1944 to 1948 she and Haymes starred together in a popular weekly radio show. But unlike Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day, Peggy Lee and other big-band singers who developed solo careers in the late 40's and 50's, Ms. Forrest was unable to make the transition, and after the 1950's remained a much-loved vocal touchstone to an earlier era.         In 1964 she toured the United States with Frank Sinatra Jr. and the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, and in the late 60's she was reunited with James for an album. A decade later, she joined James, Haymes, the Pied Pipers and the Ink Spots in a touring nostalgia revue, ''The Big Broadcast of 1944.'' Her last album was released on the Stash label in 1983.         Correction:  July 19, 1999, Monday  An obituary of the big-band singer Helen Forrest on Tuesday included a credit erroneously in her recording history with Artie Shaw. It was Billie Holiday, not Ms. Forrest, who recorded ''Any Old Time'' with the Shaw orchestra.       
         Brenda Hughes Moore, a human-rights advocate and arts consultant and the wife of the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr., retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, died Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 56 and lived in Greenwich Village and Stonington, Conn.         The cause was hepatitis, her husband said.         A native of Richmond, Mrs. Moore graduated from Salem College in North Carolina and studied at the University of Aix-Marseille and the University of Perugia.         She accompanied her first husband, John Franklin Campbell, a Foreign Service officer, to Ethiopia, where she became a special assistant to Emperor Haile Selassie and arranged a national exposition of Ethiopian crafts. She was also interested in the cause of Eritrea, then seeking independence from Ethiopia. Back in the United States, she assisted her husband, the first editor of Foreign Policy and author of ''The Foreign Affairs Fudge Factory.''         Mr. Campbell died in 1971 at age 31, and the next year she married Vernon Eagle, then the executive director of the New World Foundation, which supported civil rights and community projects.         The year after Mr. Eagle's death in 1974, she married Bishop Moore, who had officiated at her second wedding and had himself recently been widowed. She later received a degree from Yeshiva University as an arts appraiser.         In 1989 she and Bishop Moore visited the island of East Timor, and for the rest of her life she championed the cause of autonomy for East Timor.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Moore's immediate survivors are two sisters, Stephanie Hughes of Phoenix, and Lisa Hughes of Honolulu.       
         Joan Wight, the widow of the Yorkshire veterinarian who wrote under the name James Herriot and the model for a character in his books and television programs based on them, died on Wednesday. She was in her 80's.         Ms. Wight's health slowly declined after her husband died in 1995 at age 78, said Thomas McCormack, the former editor in chief of St. Martin's Press, which published the first five Herriot books.         Her husband, whose real name was James Alfred Wight, vividly depicted his wife as the endearing and supportive Helen Herriot in his memoirs, beginning with ''All Creatures Great and Small.'' Mr. McCormack described Ms. Wight as the model for ''the humorous, loving and, from time to time, tolerating wife of James Herriot.''         ''All Creatures Great and Small'' became the basis for a long-running television series, which was originally a BBC-TV production and later a cable television series in the United States. Its accounts of rural life attracted an audience of millions around the world.         On television, Helen was played first by Carol Drinkwater and later by Lynda Bellingham. In a 1979 movie, ''All Things Bright and Beautiful,'' Helen was portrayed by Lisa Harrow.         Although ''All Creatures Great and Small'' became a best seller, it was not reviewed until months after its publication, when strongly positive word-of-mouth reports had begun to make it famous.         One episode in the first Herriot book describes how Ms. Wight met her future husband. She grew up on a farm in Yorkshire not far from ''the surgery,'' as Mr. Wight's veterinary hospital was known.         One day, she brought in a calf with a broken leg. Mr. Wight repaired the damage with a splint. Later, she brought in a dog with a dislocated hip, and this time, he had eyes only for her. They soon became engaged.         ''A characteristic scene comes in the final chapter of 'All Creatures Great and Small,' '' Mr. McCormack said. ''The scene tells of Joan's and James's honeymoon, which is interrupted by a sudden, mad crush of work, which kills their hope of taking a trip. As Joan sits with notebook on her knee and pencil at the ready, she smiles. It was a magnificent, loving ending.''         Ms. Wight is survived by a son, James, and a daughter, Rosemary Page, both of Yorkshire in northern England.       
         Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, whose marriage to John F. Kennedy Jr. catapulted her and her understated glamour to fame, was reported lost and presumed dead on a flight Friday to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., along with her husband and her sister Lauren Bessette.         She was 33.         Until shortly before her marriage, Ms. Bessette was an executive at Calvin Klein Ltd. in New York. Her rise there -- from saleswoman in Boston to director of publicity for Mr. Klein's flagship line -- had been fast, but her achievements were quickly overshadowed by her relationship with Mr. Kennedy, whom she married in 1996.         After her marriage, she quickly became a fashion icon herself, on the cover of numerous magazines.         She soon settled into the role of Kennedy wife, with all the public appearances and public attention that entailed. But she kept a deliberately quiet profile.         ''She's a very private woman,'' Mr. Kennedy told USA Today in 1998. ''It's like you go from having a life you've built on your own terms and all of a sudden it's being snatched away from you.''         Ms. Bessette Kennedy grew up in affluent Greenwich, Conn. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Her mother, Ann, a teacher and administrator, remarried, to Richard Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon; the couple now live in Old Greenwich, Conn. Her father, William Bessette, an architectural engineer, lives in White Plains.         Ms. Bessette Kennedy had two sisters, Lauren and Lisa Ann, identical twins who were born 18 months before her.         Lauren Bessette, who graduated from Hobart College in Geneva, N.Y., was a principal in the investment banking division at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. She joined the company in 1993 and spent several years in Hong Kong.         Carolyn Bessette graduated from St. Mary's High School in Greenwich in 1983 and went on to Boston University, where she majored in elementary education. She graduated in January 1988 and was briefly a nightclub promoter. She then began working at Mr. Klein's Boston store.         A Calvin Klein executive brought her to the fashion house's headquarters in New York. She was hired to outfit the ''personals,'' friends of the house, among them celebrities and socialites.         Paul Wilmot, the former director of publicity for Calvin Klein who hired her, said he had been immediately stuck by her intelligence and poise. He said she easily juggled the demands of the job, which required a keen fashion sense and attention to countless administrative details.         She was promoted to director of publicity of the collection, a job that entailed working with fashion editors as well as coordinating the shows for the line.         She began dating Mr. Kennedy in 1994. Their relationship was relentlessly chronicled in the tabloid press, but their wedding, in front of 40 people in a rundown church on a secluded island off Georgia, was carefully scripted to elude publicity.         Usually dressed in black, she often wore her hair slicked back in a bun, and she favored simple clothing designers like Prada and Yohji Yamamoto.         Comparisons to her mother-in-law, the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, were frequent -- the two shared a Roman Catholic heritage, a thin, athletic physique, a cultivated mystique and a fierce possessiveness of their privacy.         Since her marriage, Ms. Bessette Kennedy had largely shunned the fashion world. Along with her husband, she lent her presence, and sometimes her name, to numerous benefits and cultural events.         ''I don't think she particularly missed being in the fashion industry,'' said John Perry Barlow, a friend of the couple. ''She still had plenty to do to adjust to being Mrs. John F. Kennedy Jr.''         Correction:  July 20, 1999, Tuesday  The obituary of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy yesterday misidentified the college from which her sister Lauren graduated. It was William Smith College, not its affiliate, Hobart; both are in Geneva, N.Y.       
         Eugenie Marron, a renowned big-game fisherwoman a half-century ago, died on Monday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 99.         In her heyday, Mrs. Marron, who lived in Brielle, N.J., and Palm Beach, Fla., held five world fishing records; one women's record, for a 722-pound swordfish caught in 1954 off Chile, remains unbroken, according to the International Game Fish Association in Dania Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Marron traveled the world for big-game fish with her husband, Louis E. Marron, who holds the men's record with a 1,182-pound swordfish caught off Chile in 1953.         She wrote a book about her fishing experiences called ''Albacora: The Search for the Giant Broadbill'' (Random House 1957). Mrs. Marron also assisted in research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Miami about the central nervous system of the giant squid.         Mrs. Marron was born on Nov. 22, 1899, in Jersey City and received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Columbia University. She was also an artist and sculptor; she studied with Alexander Archipenko.         She is survived by two nieces, Eugenie Wikberg of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Suzanne J. Treacy of Deerfield Beach, Fla.       
         Doris R. Schwartz, a nurse who did some of the earliest research on geriatric nursing care and whose findings led to improvements in health care for the elderly, died on Sunday at her home in Gwynedd, Pa.         A former resident of Manhattan, Ms. Schwartz was 84 and had moved to the Foulkeways Continuing Care Community in Gwynedd after a stroke in 1980. She retired that year from Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing, where she was a professor for many years.         Ms. Schwartz's familiarity with the debilities of old age stemmed from her years as an Army nurse in World War II, when she tended to wounded soldiers with similar afflictions. Her work continued even after she began to use a wheelchair.         After moving to the retirement center, she initiated research by the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing into the use of physical restraints on patients in nursing homes and hospitals; her work led to changes in restraint procedures.         Ms. Schwartz wrote an autobiography, ''My Fifty Years in Nursing: Give Us to Go Blithely'' (Springer; 2d ed., 1995), which remains in print.         In the weeks before her death, she had been working on a book about the 55 people who most influenced her career.         Doris Schwartz was born in Brooklyn and graduated from the Central Methodist Hospital School of Nursing there in 1942. She enlisted in the Army Nurse Corps and served in the Pacific and, after the war, at a military rehabilitation center in Battle Creek, Mich., rising to the rank of captain.         She then worked as a public health nurse in the Visiting Nurse Service with babies and new mothers in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn into the 1950's. She became an adviser to the Teaching Nursing Home Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.         She was a member of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Science and co-director of two groundbreaking programs to train geriatric and family nurse practitioners at Cornell University-New York Hospital. There she taught staff members and worked with victims of strokes and dementia.         A Doris Schwartz Chair of Gerontological Nursing was established at the University of Pennsylvania, and a Doris Schwartz Research Award, honoring a nurse for outstanding research in aging, is given by the Hartford Foundation Institute of Geriatric Nursing at New York University.         Ms. Schwartz leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Tove (Musse) Hansen, who presided over Scandia, a popular Los Angeles restaurant in the 1950's and 60's, after helping Jews flee Denmark during World War II, died last Saturday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 88.         In 1946, Ms. Hansen's husband, Kenneth, opened Scandia, a French and Scandinavian restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Over the years, it became one of the best known restaurants in Los Angeles, a destination for Presidents and movie stars. It was sold in 1978 and went out of business about 10 years ago.         Though Ms. Hansen was not the owner of Scandia, she was known for her presence in the restaurant when it was a celebrity rendezvous.         Nathan Chroman, a longtime friend of Ms. Hansen's and her lawyer, said that Ms. Hansen, when she lived in Denmark, helped Danish Jews in their mass escape to Sweden.         He added that she was later honored by Israel and the Israel Bond Organization in Los Angeles for her efforts.         Ms. Hansen's husband died in 1980; she is survived by a sister, Else Thomasen of Denmark.       
         Shulamit Katznelson, who was awarded the 1986 Israel Prize for Life Achievement, her country's highest honor, for bringing Arabs and Jews together through learning each other's languages, died yesterday at her home in the coastal town of Netanya, north of Tel Aviv. She was 80.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         For nearly half a century, Ms. Katznelson taught Hebrew to Arabs and Arabic to Jews at Ulpan Akiva, an independent residential language school she founded in Netanya in 1951. Arabs and Jews often room together at the school to help break down psychological barriers.         ''We are perhaps naive in trying to approach the problems of the region in this way,'' she said recently. ''But we believe that the firm foundations necessary to build and consolidate peace can only come about through person-to-person contacts and the ability of each side to speak the other's language.''         She added that many of the Jews and Arabs who attend the intensive six-week live-in course in a former hotel complex became friends and remained in touch with each other.         The school philosophy includes Ms. Katznelson's conviction that language cannot be separated from culture. Of the five hours of lessons each day in Hebrew, one hour is spent learning about Judaism and Jewish history. Likewise, the course in Arabic includes the study of Islam and Arab history as well as visits to Arab villages.         Ms. Katznelson was born in Geneva in 1919, and her family immigrated to Palestine two years later. Her mother, Bat-Sheva, became a legislator in Israel's Parliament. Her brother, Shmuel Tamir, served as Justice Minister, and an uncle, Zalman Shazar, was Israel's third President.         Ms. Katznelson attended high school and a teacher's college in Jerusalem, then attended a master's program at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.         From the start, the program at Ulpan Akiva taught not only Jewish immigrants, but also Israel's Arab citizens and visitors from around the world.         Nearly 100,000 people from 148 countries have studied at the school in the last five decades, among them ambassadors, Israeli Army officers and Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ulpan Akiva set up two branch offices in the Gaza Strip towns of Gaza City and Khan Yunis.         Ms. Katznelson retired two years ago, and was succeeded at the school by Ephraim Lapid, a former Israeli brigadier general.       
         Joan Braden, a former State Department official who was a hostess and friend to high-ranking Washington figures and whose eight children inspired the ABC television series ''Eight Is Enough,'' died on Monday in Alexandria, Va. She was 77 and a longtime resident of the Washington area.         The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported. Mrs. Braden collapsed at Sutton Place Gourmet, a food store in Alexandria,  and was pronounced dead at a local hospital.         For two years beginning in 1976, Mrs. Braden was the State Department's coordinator of consumer affairs and special assistant to the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. She had also been an aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller and had worked in political campaigns for  John and Robert Kennedy.         The 1975 book ''Eight Is Enough,'' by her husband, Tom Braden, tells of their family of eight children. In 1977 the book was adapted as the ABC series, starring Dick Van Patten, which was broadcast by the network until 1981.         In the book, Mr. Braden, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate from 1968 to 1986, described his wife's personality: ''She's blithe. That's what it is about her, and that is why she is so everlastingly cheerful.''         By 1976, when Mrs. Braden took up her State Department posts, her friends included Vice President  Rockefeller, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and many other powerful figures, who would assemble at the Bradens' large yellow clapboard house in Chevy Chase, Md., a Washington suburb.         According to those who dined there, the food was simple but good,  and the furniture pleasant and necessarily childproof. There were always flowers and candles and, if the weather was right, a fireplace ablaze.         But it was not those things that made Mrs. Braden's dinner parties special, and her invitations a status symbol.         Rather, it was said in Washington, the main magnet was Mrs. Braden herself, a slight woman (5 feet 5 inches tall, admittedly too thin at 103  pounds) with short auburn hair and a wide smile -- blithe, as her husband said, and everlastingly cheerful.         Mrs. Braden herself wrote a book, ''Just Enough Rope: An Intimate Memoir'' (1989). Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Maureen Dowd said, ''Joan Braden has taken a lot of heat for this book, which has been criticized as a vapid kiss-and-sell by a Washington society hostess with the capital's most notorious 'open' marriage.''         ''The title refers to the amount of freedom the author has received from her husband,'' Ms. Dowd wrote.  ''Washington insiders, however, sniff that it also alludes to the fact that she has hanged herself with this 'intimate memoir.' ''         But ''this reviewer does not take such a harsh view,'' Ms. Dowd continued, adding that after all, how can a book be all bad that features ''a shower scene with Nelson Rockefeller, a bedroom scene with Bobby Kennedy, a toe-tingling lunch with Kirk Douglas and an account of Frank Sinatra singing 'High Hopes' without his toupee?''         Mrs. Braden was born Joan Ridley in Indianapolis, and was reared in the nearby town of Anderson and in Washington. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Northwestern University, and  worked in the Pentagon during World War II.         From 1946 to 1951, she was an assistant to Mr. Rockefeller, who was then in the middle of a succession of Federal posts he filled before becoming Governor of New York in 1959. She went on to be a special assistant for public relations to  Oveta Culp Hobby, the Eisenhower Administration's Secretary of  Health, Education and Welfare.         Later she and her husband moved to California, where Mr. Braden -- with the assistance of a $100,000 loan from Mr. Rockefeller, whom he had known for years -- bought a small daily newspaper, The Oceanside Blade-Tribune. Mr. Braden published the paper for more than 13 years before selling it to South Coast Newspapers for $1.6 million.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Braden's survivors include five daughters, Mary Poole of Alexandria, Joan Ridder of Denver, Susan Zarker of Takoma Park, Md., and Nancy and Elizabeth Braden, both of Denver; two sons, David, who lives in Taiwan, and Nicholas, of Alexandria, and 12 grandchldren. One of the Bradens' sons, Tom, died in 1994.       
         Chan Richardson Parker, known to many in the jazz world as the last wife of Charlie (Bird) Parker, the be-bop innovator, died on Sept. 9 in a hospital in Etampes, France, southwest of Paris. She was 74.         She died of cancer, said Albert Oehrle, the lawyer for her son, Baird Parker. She had lived in Champmotteux, south of Paris, since 1971.         She lived with Parker from 1950 until he died in 1955 at 34, his life cut short by alcohol and drug use. Robert Dobrish, the lawyer for Parker's estate, said Parker ''thought of her as his wife,'' but they were not legally spouses.         Chan Parker, a native New Yorker, was originally named Beverly Dolores Berg, but as she wrote in her 1993 memoirs, ''My Life in E-flat'' (University of South Carolina), ''I changed that name as soon as I could.'' For a time, she was a nightclub dancer. She became an avid fan of jazz and be-bop. She met Charlie Parker when he was 23 and she was 18.In 1950, she and Kim, her daughter, moved in with Parker.         In later years, Ms. Parker's activities included operating a restaurant in New Hope, Pa.         Two daughters, Pree Parker and Aimee Woods, died earlier.         Besides Baird Parker of Lansdale, Pa., she is survived by her daughter, Kim Parker, of Delaware Water Gap, Pa.; another son, Gar Woods of Long Pond, Pa., and two grandchildren.       
         Tahia Carioca, the Egyptian belly dancer often called the Marilyn Monroe of the Arab world, died of a heart attack in a Cairo hospital on Monday.  She was 79.         Miss Carioca's parents were mortified when as a teen-ager she took her beauty and talent to a Cairo nightclub to dance for strangers, but it was the beginning of a journey that would make her one of the world's most renowned belly dancers.         Though the hold of fundamentalist Islam on Egyptian society has virtually wiped out public manifestations of her art, she was in the end granted the official approval her parents withheld, as the Egyptian Culture Minister, Farouk Hosni, led her funeral procession.         The stuff of legend, she married 14 different husbands and once slapped King Farouk when he threw an ice cube down her dress. She had roles in more than 300 movies and television shows.         But beyond mere fame, she virtually defined the intricate, pulsating art called raqs sharqi in Arabic nations but known in the West as the belly dance since a promoter at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair dreamed up the name.         Belly dancers cover less territory than Western dancers, concentrating instead on often minute movements, sometimes emphasizing such tiny muscular articulations as a quivering lower lip.         ''You really liked watching her; she would draw you in,'' said Morocco, a New York dancer who was inspired by Miss Carioca and herself became a leading international performer. She recalled the intensity of Miss Carioca's musicality and her grace.         When another great Egyptian belly dancer, Samia Gamal, died in 1994, her funeral was officially ignored,  Morocco said. Her style of dancing was sometimes called coltish or kittenish, in contrast to the strength and dignity of Miss Carioca's approach.  Miss Carioca used her many films to raise the status of Middle Eastern  dance.         ''She got it recognized as part of the Egyptian fine arts landscape through her portrayals of it in movies,'' said Julie Elliot, a belly dancer who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. ''She was a pioneer of modern oriental dance as it is done today.''         Miss Carioca, originally named Abla Mohammed Karim, was born in 1920. She studied dance at Ivanova Belly Dancing School in Cairo before moving to Mohammed Ali Street, Cairo's 1930's and 40's version of Broadway. She took her stage names from the Brazilian sambas she liked to perform.         Miss Carioca became one of the biggest stars at a Cairo nightclub owned by Badia Massabni, a Lebanese woman. The club was an elegant re-creation of a British music hall and was frequented by both British colonial administrators and the local aristocracy. Women as well as men were part of the audience. Dancers wore elegant, bejeweled gowns, sometimes with bare midriffs and sometimes not.         But the nice surroundings did not make belly dancing, something that up until that time had been performed mainly at private weddings and celebrations, publicly respectable.         ''Many men would reject the trade and would never marry a female performer,'' Karin van Nieuwkerk wrote in a 1995 book about Egyptian dancers called ''A Trade Like Any Other'' and published by the University of Texas Press.         The dancer Morocco said, ''Women do not show themselves publicly outside the family and, maybe, somebody they're going to marry.''         Of course, Miss Carioca married many interesting men, among them an American army officer whom she met during World War II, an actor and a prominent playwright.         That none of the matches lasted long may have owed something to her sometimes assertive personality, Morocco said. ''She was sort of a big mouth,'' she said, ''but very sweet.''         Miss Carioca is survived by an adopted daughter, Atiyat Allah.         Her first film was ''Doctor Farahat'' in 1935, directed by Togo Mizrahi. One of her most popular movies was ''Youth of a Woman,'' in which she played a landlady who seduces a naive, young peasant student. It was shown at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival.         ''She was an important part of Egypt's movie history,'' said the film director Gulal Sharqawi.         She gave up dancing in 1963 but as late as the mid-1980's ran her own theater in Cairo, helping to write and choose plays, as well as directing and producing.         She took to wearing the Islamic head scarf before retiring completely from public view 13 years ago.       
         She had not even known exactly what the word ''philanthropy'' meant, but the elderly washerwoman who gave away practically every dollar she ever made to endow a scholarship fund for poor students in Mississippi would become a symbol of selfless giving.         Oseola McCarty, who gave away a life savings of $150,000 to help complete strangers get a college education at the University of Southern Mississippi here in her hometown, died late Sunday afternoon in the frame house where she took in laundry and ironing and made her small fortune a dollar or two at a time.         Miss McCarty was told that she had liver cancer three weeks ago, about a year after she underwent surgery for colon cancer. She wanted her last days to be spent in the little house where she spent most of her life. She was 91.         ''I don't want to close my eyes because I don't know if I'll open them again,'' the tiny, frail woman told a visitor recently. ''But I am not afraid.''         In anticipation of her death, she decided in the summer of 1995 to give away most of her life savings, saying there was nothing in particular she wanted to buy and no place in particular she wanted to go. An only child who had outlived her relatives, she lived a solitary existence, surrounded by rows of clothes she made pretty for people who knew her only as the washerwoman.         ''I'm giving it away so that the children won't have to work so hard, like I did,'' she said in July 1995.         She did not want any monuments, any proclamations, said people who  knew her. But the selflessness of her gift would bring her worldwide attention. The woman who had gone out only for some preaching at the Friendship Baptist Church in Hattiesburg and to buy groceries would be honored by the United Nations, would shake hands with President Clinton and would receive more than 300 awards. People all over the world knew who she was and what she did.         The woman who acted in anticipation of death found a life she could have never imagined. She flew on a plane for the first time in her life and laughed out loud when the food did not fall off the tray as the plane rumbled through the sky. She stayed in a hotel for the first time in her life, and before she checked out, she made the bed.         ''People treated her like a monument,'' said Jewel Tucker, the secretary to the president of the university and Miss McCarty's traveling companion in those almost giddy years after the gift. ''But she was really a movement. It will keep moving.''         Contributions from more than 600 donors have added some $330,000 to the original scholarship fund of $150,000. After hearing of Miss McCarty's gift, Ted Turner, a multibillionaire, gave away a billion dollars.         ''He said, 'If that little woman can give away everything she has, then I can give a billion,' '' Ms. Tucker said.         If anyone can say they felt adoration in their life, Ms. Tucker said, Miss McCarty could. People would see her in airports and flock to her. Some people just wanted to touch her, as though she was good luck.         Along with all the plaques and trophies or other honors -- she received the Presidential Citizen's Medal, the nation's second-highest civilian award, and an honorary doctorate from Harvard University -- she was awarded other things that were pure fun.         In 1996, she carried the Olympic torch through part of Mississippi. Later that year, hers was the hand on the switch that dropped the ball in Times Square in New York's New Year's Eve celebration. In fact, she said at the time, it was the first time she had stayed up past midnight.         Miss McCarty will lie in state in the rotunda of the university's main building on Saturday.         Friends like Aubrey K. Lucas, president emeritus of the University of Southern Mississippi, said it warmed him and others that came into contact with her to know that a lifetime of loneliness had been pushed aside by all the positive attention that her gift brought.         Horace Fleming, the university's president, said he sometimes wondered if all the attention that came her way was really welcome. But he believes now that it was.         Her traveling companion, Ms. Tucker, knows that Miss McCarty did enjoy it.         Although she never asked for it, ''She loved every minute of it,'' Ms. Tucker said.         In time, people came to see her almost like an oracle and listened closely for pearls of wisdom at the little woman's knee.         But her friends know that Miss McCarty's wisdom was really a mix of common decency and common sense.         ''There's a lot of talk about self-esteem these days,'' she once said. ''It seems pretty basic to me. If you want to feel proud of yourself, you've got to do things you can be proud of. Feelings follow actions.''         The university's president said that a New York reporter once asked him out of earshot of Miss McCarty to tell him the true story of her gift.         ''How did it really happen?'' the reporter asked him.         The president told the reporter that it happened just as Miss McCarty said, that she had wanted to do something good with the money she had made. It is not any more complicated than that, Mr. Fleming said.         In a world in which people are suspicious of things too good to be true, he said, Miss McCarty really was good and true.       
         Jeanne Miles, an American painter of luminous geometric abstractions, died last Friday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 90.         Ms. Miles was born in Baltimore and grew up in Washington. She was the first woman to enroll in the art school at George Washington University. In 1937, she was given a travel grant and, determined to use it for something exotic, went to Tahiti for a year to paint. She later studied in Paris at the Atelier Marcel Gromaire and the Grand Chaumiere.  She left France after the start of World War II and came to New York, where she lived and worked in Greenwich Village for many years. She moved to Los Angeles two years ago.         Ms. Miles exhibited for many years with the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York during the gallery's  heyday, from 1943 to 1959, and counted artists like Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Bradley Walker Tomlin among her friends. More recently, she had solo shows in Manhattan at the Marilyn Pearl Gallery in 1988 and at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in 1994.         The paintings in the Shapolsky show were modest in scale, based on circular and starlike patterns done in shades of rich jade green interspersed with passages of gold leaf. Although abstract, they suggested both illuminated manuscript pages and mandalas. The work reflected both the artist's long-standing interest in Asian art and thought, and her commitment to the spiritual implications of Western modernist art. ''The mandala form is universal and deeply fixed in our psyche,'' she said in an interview.         Ms. Miles's paintings were included in many group shows from the 1930's on at the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, among other institutions. Her work is in the permanent collection of the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Guggenheim, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Newark Museum and elsewhere.         She received grants from the Yaddo Art Colony and the McDowell Art Colony, an award from the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1968, and two Mark Rothko awards, in 1970 and 1973. She taught at Oberlin College, Moravian College and Yale University.         Ms. Miles is survived by a daughter, the actress Joanna Miles; a grandson, Miles Brandman, and a sister, Kitty Daffron of Florida.       
         Lenon Hoyte, better known as Aunt Len, who shared her dream of a doll museum with Harlem children and  collectors from around the world for two decades, died Aug. 1 at a hospital in New York. She was 94.         A public school art teacher, she  founded Aunt Len's Doll and Toy Museum, one of the most extensive private collections of dolls and related toys in the United States, and long one of New York City's choice specialty museums. She closed the museum in the early 1990's when she was no longer able to care for it.         To Ms. Hoyte, the dolls were her ''babies,'' to be loved and shown off, whether they were the rarest antiques or battered castoffs.         In 1938, Ms. Hoyte and her husband bought the three-story brownstone at 6 Hamilton Terrace between Convent and St. Nicholas Avenues.         At one time the house was home to 6,000 dolls.         There were a dozen versions of  Shirley Temple; there was Barbie, and Betsy Wetsy, presidents and their wives, and refined French dolls with bodies and faces made of  bisque, the unglazed ceramic ware used to make fine dolls in the 19th century and before.         And always, her collection included black dolls, which are now highly sought by collectors, because so few were made before the 20th century.         One rarity, described in the sale catalogue as ''a black Bru pressed-bisque-head bebe doll,'' was valued at $18,000.         There were a pair of papier-mache dolls, named Lillian and Leo, made by Leo Moss, a black handyman who lived in Atlanta in the 19th century. Both Lillian and Leo have tears running down their cheeks.         The story has it that after the dollmaker parted from his wife and children he became so sad that he made only crying dolls.         The collection also included accessories like doll houses, doll clothing and costumes, tin toys and stuffed animals.         Visitors had to squeeze their way sideways or hunch down as they progressed through the narrow passageways of the public spaces on the ground floor and in the basement of the building.         The museum had a modest entrance fee, never exceeding $2 for adults and 50 cents for children.         Visitors would encounter all manner of mannequins, ranging from thumb-size to two or three feet tall.  Not all of the collectibles were old. One of Ms. Hoyte's favorites -- a baby doll with wide eyes and long eyelashes -- was carved in mahogany in 1977 by a California artist, Patty Hale.         In 1990, soon after Mayor Edward I. Koch presented Ms. Hoyte with the Mayoral Award of Honor for Art and Culture, her genteel house and museum was broken into by thieves.         At least nine dolls, including a two-foot-tall English king, considered priceless by knowledgeable collectors, were stolen.         Ms. Hoyte was disconsolate.         ''People any more don't let you live,'' she said then. ''You struggle to keep something up for joy and beauty, and you find yourself having to watch for thieves. It's not right.''         But soon after, four of the stolen dolls -- representing George and Martha Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin -- turned up, disjointed but repairable, in Ms. Hoyte's front room. ''I don't ask questions about how,'' she said. ''I'm just happy to have them back.''         In 1994, 700 of the finest antique dolls were auctioned at Sotheby's. Thousands more had been sold previously to dealers around the country.         Lenon Holder Hoyte was born in New York City on July 4, 1905, the first of five children of Moses and Rose Holder. She attended public school in New York City and studied art at the College of the City of New York, Columbia University and with private teachers.         She taught art at Junior High School 149 in the Bronx and retired after 41 years. ''When they started killing teachers, I got out,'' she said.         Her passion for collecting dolls dated to 1962, when she was asked to organize a doll show to raise money for Harlem Hospital. After that, she began acquiring dolls from flea markets, garage sales and antiques shops that she visited throughout the United States, Europe and the Caribbean. Her collection was officially opened as a museum in 1974.         Ms. Hoyte continued to produce  doll shows, and donated the proceeds to St. Philip's Episcopal Church, where she had been a lifelong member.         She spent many of her retirement years traveling to doll shows and picking up dolls and doll accouterments for her collection.         Ms. Hoyte's husband, Lewis Hoyte, died about 30 years ago. She is survived by her brother, Dr. Oliver Holder, of Sag Harbor, N.Y., two nieces and three nephews.       
         Ruth Roman, a screen actress who parlayed her electrically charged combination of sexiness and wholesomeness into Hollywood stardom in the late 1940's and 50's, died on Thursday at her home in Laguna Beach, Calif. She was 75.         She died in her sleep, said her son, Richard Hall.         After her breakout role opposite Kirk Douglas in Stanley Kramer's ''Champion,'' a 1949 adaptation of a Ring Lardner short story about a maniacal prize fighter, Warner Brothers gave her starring roles in nine films in under two years.         In one day she leaped from working with Bette Davis in ''Beyond the Forest'' to supporting Milton Berle in ''Always Leave Them Laughing.'' A week after the completion of ''Strangers on a Train'' opposite Robert Walker, she was whisked into ''Tomorrow Is Another Day'' with Steve Cochran.         From 1948 to 1965, Ms. Roman appeared in more than 30 movies, and in the 1960's and 70's in numerous television shows.         Her romantic partners in films included Randolph Scott in ''Colt .45,'' James Stewart in ''The Far Country'' and Gary Cooper in ''Dallas.''         Few of her films are studied in film schools today. But in their time they made box office cash registers ring like sleigh bells and in 1951 Ms. Roman was receiving 500 letters a week from around the world.         There were plenty of cheesecake queens in Hollywood seeking roles when Ms. Roman arrived in 1945, but it was her come-hitcher warmth, combined with her shapely, dark-haired good looks, that made her a standout. When Collier's profiled her in 1951, the magazine declared that Ms. Roman's career had been built on a ''pervasive air of wholesomeness.''         It was an appeal that even Ms. Roman did not fully understand. When she auditioned for a part in ''Champion,'' she thought she would be right for the role of the fighter's gold-digging floozy and accordingly wore a tight-fitting black dress and heavy makeup when she swivel-hipped into Stanley Kramer's office.         But somehow the wholesomeness showed through. ''Actually, I thought of you for the other girl,'' said Mr. Kramer, then serving as the film's producer.         Marilyn Maxwell played the floozy, with Kirk Douglas as the fighter and Ms. Roman as his demure and steadfast wife.         It had been that same quality that landed Ms. Roman her first film role: a bit part as a WAVE in ''Stage Door Canteen'' in 1942.         Clem Beauchamp, company manager for ''Stage Door Canteen,'' told an interviewer in 1951 that he chose Ms. Roman from dozens of eager actresses because ''I felt right away that here was a girl who would show up on time in the morning with her lines learned and no nonsense.''         By Hollywood standards, Ms. Roman's romantic life was a bit dull. She dated Bill Walsh, a publicity agent, for five years. She once stepped out with Ronald Reagan. And in 1950 she married Mortimer Hall, a Los Angeles television executive. The marriage ended in divorce.  A second marriage, to Budd Burton Moss, also ended in divorce. She told interviewers that she disliked nightclubs and flashy clothes. Her one extravagance, she said, was her collection of 35 pairs of shoes, and that consisted mainly of Indian moccasins.         Not all of the excitement in her life was make-believe. In 1956 Ms. Roman was aboard the luxury passenger liner Andrea Doria when it was struck by the Stockholm. Ms. Roman was returning from Italy with her 3-year-old son, Dickie. She was dancing in the ship's Belvedere room, she told a reporter for The New York Times, when ''we heard a big explosion like a firecracker.''         She said she saw smoke coming from the general area of her cabin and rushed there to protect her son. He was sound asleep. She said she awakened Dickie and told him,  ''We're going on a picnic.''         When it was clear that the liner was sinking and passengers began entering lifeboats, a seaman lowered Dickie into a boat. Ms. Roman said she followed down a rope ladder, but when she was halfway down the lifeboat pulled away. She called out to the boat but it did not return. She was put on another lifeboat.         Ms. Roman told a reporter she was never in fear for her son's life, but felt sure he would be safe in the lifeboat, which turned out to be true. Ms. Roman and her son were among the 760 survivors of the Andrea Doria.         Her son, her only survivor, lives in California.         Born in Lynn, Mass., on Dec. 23, 1923, she was the youngest of three daughters of immigrants from Lithuania. Her father, Anthony Roman, a carnival barker, died when she was a child, forcing her mother to work as a waitress, cleaning woman and laundress.         Ms. Roman was proud of her family's endurance. ''For a while,'' she once told a reporter, ''we were moving regularly once a month because we couldn't pay our rent.''         But she never felt sorry for herself, she said, remarking, ''When you start out poor, you don't know what you're missing.''         Ms. Roman quit high school in her second year when she decided to become an actress. During the day she worked as a movie usher and at night she performed with the New England Repertory Company, a semi-professional group in Boston.         With $200 in her pocketbook, she  soon struck out for Hollywood. For a while, she lived in a boarding house with several other aspiring actresses. They called their home the House of the Seven Garbos.         For six years she endured a series of disappointments. She got a good part in a western called ''White Stallion,'' but it was never released. Then came a role in ''A Night in Casablanca,'' but after the filming her part was cut. But then everything changed after her audition with Stanley Kramer.       
         Birgit Cullberg, a pioneering experimental choreographer in Sweden who earned an international reputation through her intense dramatic ballets and vigorous social-protest pieces, died on Wednesday in Stockholm, where she lived. She was 91.         Although Miss Cullberg was a disciple of the German Expressionist choreographer Kurt Jooss, her own style fused modern dance and ballet. She was resident choreographer of the Royal Swedish Ballet from 1951 to 1957, and her most famous works were danced by ballet companies throughout the world.         Among these was her acknowledged masterpiece, ''Miss Julie,'' based on the August Strindberg play; it had its premiere in Sweden in 1950. Restaged to great acclaim in 1958 for American Ballet Theater, ''Miss Julie'' was a triumph for Violette Verdy in the title role, as the Swedish aristocrat who seduces a butler, and for Erik Bruhn as Jean, the butler. Mr. Bruhn virtually made the role his own for 20 years through his astonishingly powerful portrayal.         Ballet Theater staged three other Cullberg works, including the haunting Lapp tale ''Moon Reindeer.'' In 1958 the New York City Ballet presented Miss Cullberg's ''Medea'' with Melissa Hayden in the title role. In his review, John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, wrote, ''There is not a superfluous phrase, a meaningless gesture, an item of mere decoration in the choreography from end to end.''         Psychological insight was Miss Cullberg's strength, as she showed again in 1982 when the Cullberg Ballet, which she founded in 1967, made its belated United States debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with  Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in attendance.         Never shy about exploring the neurotic and the erotic, Miss Cullberg was represented by a duet, ''Adam and Eve,'' and an especially sensuous performance of ''Miss Julie,'' which nonetheless focused on the class differences between Julie and her servant. In ''Adam and Eve,'' Daniela Malusardi and Niklas Ek, Miss Cullberg's elder son, moved seamlessly from innocent playfulness to adult passion, a couple expelled from Eden but rejecting God as well.         Most of the other choreography was by Mats Ek, Miss Cullberg's other son, who cast her as a Mother Africa figure in his ''Soweto.'' Miss Cullberg, then 74, came out swinging, kicking, fiery-eyed and goading the oppressed onstage to resist until they collapsed to the sound of gunshots. In 1991, with her long white hair still flying, Miss Cullberg performed in Mats Ek's television dance production ''The Old Woman and the Door.''         She excelled in choreography for television. Her duet ''Red Wine in Green Glasses'' (1970) was shown on public television in the United States and was awarded the Prix Italia.         Miss Cullberg started life in a secure, wealthy home, but she had a volatile relationship with Anders Ek, one of Sweden's leading actors, whom she married in 1942. They had three children: Niklas, a brilliant dancer; Mats, 54, and his twin, the actress Malin Ek. They survive her, as do several grandchildren.         Miss Cullberg and her husband separated in 1949, and ''Medea,'' like many of her works, was interpreted by several Swedish critics as a piece that universalized her private emotions of the time.         Miss Cullberg and her husband reconciled in 1959 and both joined the new Stockholm City Theater, she as a stage director. (She directed him in ''Othello.'') The couple eventually divorced, but in the late 1970's, after Mr. Ek's death, Miss Cullberg choreographed a meditation on their life entitled ''Dreams of Love and Death.''         Born in Nykoping, Sweden, on Aug. 3, 1908, Miss Cullberg was the daughter of Ella W. Cullberg and Carl Cullberg, a bank director, and attended the University of Stockholm. After Jooss, the choreographer of the celebrated antiwar ballet ''The Green Table,'' appeared with his company in Stockholm, Miss Cullberg spent four years in England studying with him at Dartington Hall, an experimental arts center.         Returning to Sweden in 1939, she formed a small company and danced solos inspired by animal movements. In the early 1940's she studied ballet and wrote dance criticism. In 1946 she and the choreographer Ivo Cramer formed the Swedish Dance Theater, which disbanded in 1948. As the Royal Swedish Ballet's resident choreographer, she staged eight ballets.         In 1967 the Swedish Government established the current Cullberg Ballet. Writing in 1982 the Swedish critic Erik Naslund paid tribute to Miss Cullberg by declaring that it was her troupe, not the Royal Swedish Ballet, that was ''definitely the more prestigious company.''       
         Emily Solis Nathan, a journalist who later became a public relations executive specializing in art and museum projects in New York, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         Miss Nathan was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Adelphi University and received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in 1929. She wrote for The Bronx Home News, The New York Sun, The Sun-World Telegram and WOR radio.         Just before World War II she began a career in public relations and eventually started a firm with Helen Erskine. Her clients included the Archives of American Art, the National Portrait Gallery and the New-York Historical Society. During the war she helped organize art exhibitions to benefit the American Friends of France and the Free French. Her first at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was an exhibition of British and American cartoons, a wartime benefit for the English Speaking Union. It was the second exhibition of cartoons at the Metropolitan.         Miss Nathan is survived by two nieces and two nephews.       
         Doreen Valiente, a self-proclaimed witch who in the mid-1950's wrote part of the liturgy now used by witches around the world, died in Brighton, England, on Sept. 1. She was 77.         Through lectures and her many books, Ms. Valiente became the chief proselytizer of the white witch movement, which espouses use of magic, defined as Divine energy, for beneficial purposes.         She was held by many to be the ''mother of modern paganism,'' according to The Times of London, which reported her death on Monday. As a coven of today's witches gather in a circle, it is her version of the Charge of the Goddess, a witches' liturgical text, that the priestess recites.         ''Over the course of her life she witnessed -- and helped generate -- a sustained revival of witchcraft and paganism in Britain, despite repeated protestations by evangelical Christians,'' The Times said in its obituary.         Phyllis W. Curott, president emeritus of Covenant of the Goddess, a New York-based umbrella organization for witches, said that in recent years millions of people had been drawn to witchcraft, but that the words written by Ms. Valiente remain central in virtually every ceremony.         ''A common chord, uniting all, is a real love and appreciation for the Charge of the Goddess,'' she said.         For Ms. Valiente, witchcraft became ever more inclusive, ultimately embracing feminism, environmentalism and a host of New Age concepts, including native American spirituality.         ''It was an idea whose time had come,'' Ms. Valiente said in a 1991 interview, ''and these other things are also things whose time has come.''         Ms. Valiente became a guiding force in the wicca movement, which derives its name from an old Anglo-Saxon word for witch, or the wise one.         In the United States, Ms. Curott said, the number of wicca devotees now numbers three million to five million, making it one of the country's fastest growing beliefs.         Ms. Valiente was born Doreen Dominy in London in 1922. She was brought up as a Christian and sent to a convent school, which she walked out of at 15, refusing to return.         Biographers say that she experienced psychic episodes in her youth, and that by her late teens she was a practicing clairvoyant. She worked as a secretary by day.         In 1944, she married Casimiro Valiente, a refugee from the Spanish Civil War who went on to fight with the Free French.         In 1952, shortly after Britain had repealed its Witchcraft Act, which had outlawed witchery, she approached Cecil Williamson, then owner of the Museum of Witchcraft on the Isle of Man.         Mr. Williamson put her in touch with Gerald Gardner, who headed a group of witches called the New Forest Coven. Mr. Gardner initiated her as a witch in 1953. Ms. Valiente became the coven's high priestess and collaborated with Mr. Gardner in putting an up-to-date spin on what was billed as the witches' ancient liturgy, ''Book of Shadows,'' written in segments during the 1950's         The book was actually an eclectic mix, based principally on Charles Leland's ''Gospel of the Witches,'' published in 1899, but drawing also on Freemasonry, theosophy and the works of the Golden Dawn, a magical tradition of England and Ireland embraced by George Bernard Shaw and William Butler Yeats.         Wicca began to be practiced with its new ritual and with Ms. Valiente in a prominent position. ''She became a high priestess during an era when witchcraft was still very much in the broom closet,'' Ms. Currot said.         She was tapping into a rich and quixotic tradition. Witchcraft had persisted and sometimes been tolerated, despite laws against it going back to the seventh century.         ''The story of witchcraft in Britain is unique, in both its form and mildness, when compared with the rest of Europe,'' wrote Ronald Holmes in his book, ''Witchcraft in British History'' in 1974.         Ms. Valiente broke with Mr. Gardner in 1957 when he ignored the coven's vows of secrecy by aggressively seeking publicity. After the deaths of her mother in 1964 and husband in 1972 (neither of whom had approved of her career choice) she began to take a much more personal and active role in what witches simply call the craft.         Her most important contribution to the movement was a stream of books, including ''An A B C of Witchcraft,'' published in 1973; ''Witchcraft for Tomorrow'' (1978), and ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft,'' (1989).         A gauge of the growth of her movement is that 1964, when she gave the opening speech at the inaugural dinner at the Witchcraft Research Association, it was attended by 50 subscribers. In November 1977, she addressed an audience of 1,500 at the Pagan Federation Congress.         Ron Cooke, a fellow believer who was her companion for most of the last two decades of her life, died in 1997. She left no close relatives, but made the Center for Pagan Studies in Surrey, England, principal beneficiary.         ''She was a wise and wild woman, who definitely ran with the British equivalent of wolves,'' said Ms. Curott, who in 1985 won the case allowing witch clergy to perform weddings in New York City.       
         Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who sold her first book for $1 million when she was 98, died on Saturday in a hospital in Duluth, Minn., where she was vacationing with her daughter. She was 100.         Miss (her preference) Foveaux (pronounced FOH-voh), a snowy-haired great-great-grandmother, lived a literary fairy tale when she turned a memoir she wrote in a writing class for senior citizens in her hometown, Manhattan, Kan., into the book ''Any Given Day.''         In a 1997 auction Warner Books paid $1 million for the rights to publish the book.         In its 208 pages, she told of the quietly heroic struggle of a woman to win her independence while she was in a bitter marriage to an alcoholic. She worked in a laundry and as a nurse's aid to support her eight children before and after the divorce.         Her book, never intended for publication, ''just poured out,'' said Charley Kempthorne, a part-time farmer who taught a writing class at the Manhattan Adult Learning Center. ''She had bottled it up for many, many years.''         Miss Foveaux was an unschooled and unskilled writer, but she was clearly a born storyteller. Her words were straightforward. Of her decision to divorce, she wrote, ''I made up my mind to live my life so that I need not be ashamed to look at myself in a mirror.''         The book, which she began in 1977 and took several years to write, came to light only after an article about it appeared in 1997 on the front page of The Wall Street Journal to which Mr. Kempthorne had sent a copy. The article set off a frenzy to buy the book, leading to the auction.         The editor who acquired it, Claire Zion, called the writing ''very plain, very clear,'' and said that it would be altered only insignificantly for publication. ''We in New York try to sit here and think what the country is thinking,'' she said. ''This is Kansas talking.''         The book auction and the publicity visit to New York transported her to a new world. Miss Foveaux flew for the first time, took limousines, stayed at fancy hotels, appeared on talk shows and was written about in newspapers. She took it all with a big grain of salt.         ''I imagine I'll be like everyone else that ever got into a mess like this,'' she said.         The book was published in 1997 and remains in print but was not a best seller, despite the wide pre-publication publicity it received.         Miss Foveaux was born in Holden, Mo., in 1899, at a time when the world of Mark Twain was fading into memory. Her early childhood was spent on a small Missouri farm, but then her family moved frequently, to Arkansas and Washington State, among other places. As World War I started, she got her first job and fell in love with a young soldier. He vanished in the war, her beloved mother died, and the Depression wreaked hardship. She had eight children. As her book related, she struggled to maintain them in difficult circumstances.         She is survived by two daughters, Faye Marie Rutledge of Winder, Ga., and Aleda Torgerson of Silver Bay, Minn., and a son, Marion, of Manhattan, Kan., as well as 16 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.         In an interview after the $1 million auction, she was asked if she would buy cars and houses for her relatives. She shot back, ''They didn't help me, did they?'' The article describes family members bursting into nervous laughter.       
         Ginette Lesley Harrison, an outstanding alpinist, was lost in an avalanche on Sunday on one of the most treacherous Himalayan mountains.  She was 41.         A British-born physician who specialized in high-altitude medicine, Dr. Harrison was part of an 11-member international expedition scaling Dhaulagiri in central Nepal, at 26,795 feet the world's seventh highest mountain. She was lost on her final ascent after two teammates had reached the summit; a sherpa on another expedition was killed in the same avalanche.         Her death was reported at Dhaulagiri base camp by her husband, Gary Scott Pfisterer, the American leader of the team.         The couple met in 1993 on Mount Everest, when they walked to the summit hand in hand. They recently moved to his hometown in Massachusetts, Monson.         Dr. Harrison earned her medical degree at Bristol University and trained in high-altitude and wilderness medicine at the University of Colorado. Besides her husband, her survivors include her parents, Brenda and Douglas Harrison, of Saltash, Cornwall.       
         Amalia Rodrigues, the Portuguese singer who was considered the queen of fado, died yesterday at her home in Lisbon. She was 79.         Her recording company, Valentim de Carvalho, said she was found dead in her bed by her secretary.         Fado, which means fate in Portuguese, is a passionate, volatile, haunted style that originated in the cafes and taverns of Lisbon. Played on the round, bright-toned 12-string Portuguese guitar, with Arabic elements that make it kin to Spanish flamenco, fado is filled with the quality called saudade in Portuguese: a mixture of sadness and nostalgia, longing and resignation. Its lyrics are bleak and fatalistic, with their suffering described in the first person. Ms. Rodrigues performed in the black clothes of mourning, with her head thrown back and her face like a mask of tragedy, singing in a voice that was at once tearful and fierce.         ''I have so much sadness in me, I am a pessimist, a nihilist, everything fado demands in a singer, I have in me,'' Ms. Rodrigues once said. ''When I am on my own, alone, tragedy comes, and solitude.''         During more than 50 years as a performer, Ms. Rodrigues was acclaimed as the definitive voice of fado, revered in Portugal and acclaimed as its musical representative around the world. When her death was announced, Portugal's radio stations dropped regular programming and began broadcasting tributes. The Prime Minister of Portugal, Antonio Guterres, ordered three days of national mourning. Reuters reported that Mr. Guterres said: ''It is a moment of great sadness. She was the voice of Portugal.''         Amalia Rodrigues was born in 1920 in the Alfama district of Lisbon, the cradle of fado. She was one of 10 children in a working-class family and was reared by her grandmother. She sold fruit in the streets and worked as a seamstress before she began to perform as a tango dancer.         As a teen-ager her renditions of tangos built a reputation, and she began singing professionally in 1939. At first her family did not approve of her singing tango and fado, songs associated with the lower classes and the underworld.         She made her first recordings in 1945 in Portugal and in Rio de Janeiro. In 1952 she signed to the Valentim de Carvalho label and began to reshape the tradition. She combined the urban and rural styles of Lisbon and Coimbra; she chose lyrics that reached beyond stories of heartbreak to muse on God and destiny.         Ms. Rodrigues began to tour beyond Portugal after World War II. She performed regularly in Brazil, Spain, France and Britain and eventually gave concerts in the United States, Japan, Mexico and the Soviet Union. She recorded more than 170 albums that were released in 30 countries, and appeared in a dozen films, notably ''Les Amants du  Tage'' (''Lovers of the Tagus''), by the French director Henri Verneuil.         Fado fell from its commercial peak during the 1960's, and after 1974, when a revolution removed the dictator Antonio Salazar, fado was associated by many Portuguese with the authoritarian regime. ''I always sang fado without thinking of politics,'' Ms. Rodrigues said. ''I never had the support of any government.''         By then, Ms. Rodrigues was known around the world. At her concerts, including her last New York City performance at Town Hall in 1990, rapt listeners sang along to her songs of love and death. In the 1990's she had heart surgery and retired from singing because of poor health. She made her last public appearance in 1998 in Lisbon, singing at the opening of Expo 1998.       
         Marie-Madeleine Durufle, an internationally renowned organist and teacher and the widow of the French composer and organist Maurice Durufle, died on Oct. 5 in Paris, where she lived. She was 78.         Mrs. Durufle, a technically formidable organist, was generally considered the last great exponent of the French Romantic school of organ playing, which valued elegant grandeur, textural clarity and rhythmic freedom. She gave incomparable performances of works by the French organ masters, including Charles-Marie Widor, Louis Vierne, Jean Langlais, Marcel Dupre and her husband, who died 13 years ago. She was a tireless champion of his organ works, which were harmonically conservative yet mystical, finely crafted and often brilliant.         She was born Marie-Madeleine Chevalier in Marseilles on May 8, 1921, and her prodigious gifts were soon apparent. At 11 she was named an organist of the Cathedral of St. Veran de Cavaillon, and at 12 she entered the conservatory at Avignon. Her desire to pursue advanced studies was delayed by the outbreak of World War II. Finally, in 1946, at 25, she became a pupil of Dupre at the Paris Conservatory, where she won the first prize in organ. In 1953 she was awarded the Gran Prix International Charles-Marie Widor for organ and improvisation.         She met her future husband at the conservatory when he substituted as a teacher one year for Dupre. The introverted and serious Maurice Durufle was drawn to the extroverted, bubbly Ms. Chevalier, who was nearly 20 years younger than he. They were married in 1953. Mrs. Durufle became the co-organist with her husband at St. Etienne-du-Mont in Paris, a post he had held himself since 1930. They gave joint concert tours frequently, their first visit to the United States coming in 1964.         In 1975, as they drove one evening in southeastern France in heavy rain, a speeding car traveling in the opposite direction crashed into their vehicle. Mrs. Durufle suffered severe pelvic and rib injuries and both of her husband's legs were broken. Years of surgery and physical therapy followed, but neither she nor her husband ever completely recovered.         Mrs. Durufle is survived by her sister, Elaine Chevalier, a solfege teacher and choral conductor in Paris.         In 1989, three years after her husband's death, not having performed in concert for 15 years, Mrs. Durufle agreed to participate in a Durufle Festival in New York organized by her former student, Dennis Keene, the organist, conductor and artistic director of Voices of Ascension.         ''All of the musicians and singers involved in the festival were overwhelmed by Madame's positive glow,'' Mr. Keene said, recalling that event. Her last public concert, he said, was in New York at the Church of the Ascension in 1993.         During her joint tours with her husband, before the accident, Mrs. Durufle tended to play the flashier pieces. In an interview with The New York Times in 1989 she conceded that this was intentional. ''My husband was a very great virtuoso at the organ,'' she said, ''but once he became my husband, I worked at it more than he did. Often he would say to me, 'You play the most difficult pieces, and I play the 'interpretation' pieces.' ''       
         Lee Lozano, an eccentric artist who pursued Conceptual Art and painting in the 1960's and then left the New York art world for self-imposed exile that included an embargo on contact with other women, died on Oct. 2 in the Dallas Health and Rehabilitation Center in Texas.  She was 68 and lived in Dallas.         The cause was cervical cancer, said Mark Kramer, the artist's cousin.         Ms. Lozano was a quixotic, confounding rebel whose decadelong New York career seemed always to involve pushing one limit or another. Her early paintings, executed in an Expressionistic cartoon style, confronted issues of sexual and painterly decorum. They featured a robust messiness, distorted close-ups of the body, intimations of violence and suggestively exaggerated images of tools.         By 1967 she had taken the systemic approach of Minimalism, making nearly monochromatic ''Wave'' paintings based on wavelengths that pushed the limits of visual perception. In the mid-1960's she also began to execute a series of life-related actions (she didn't like the word performance) that tested, among other things, her stamina, her friends' patience and the conduct of everyday life. These works reflected her friendship with Conceptually inclined artists like Sol LeWitt, Hollis Frampton, Dan Graham and Carl Andre. They also reflected an increasing disenchantment with the art world that bordered on hostility.         Many of these pieces were proposed or recorded in written works that she considered drawings. Sometimes she designated everyday activities like thought, conversation or marijuana smoking as art, attracted by the idea that they were unsaleable and democratic. Her ''Throw-Up Piece'' proposed throwing the 10 most recent issues of Artforum, the leading magazine of contemporary art, in the air and letting them fall where they may. In ''Transistor Radio Piece'' she listened to a radio while attending a panel discussion on art.         In 1969 and 1970 Ms. Lozano began a steady withdrawal from the art world in works that she titled ''General Strike Piece'' and ''Dropout Piece.'' She decided to boycott women for a month or two as a means of improving communication with them. For unexplained reasons, she continued this piece to the end of her life, despite the great inconvenience and, one supposes, even greater rudeness.         Ms. Lozano was born Lee Knastner in Newark in 1930. She received a B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1951 and studied painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. A brief marriage in the late 1950's to an architect, Adrian Lozano, ended in divorce. She leaves no survivors.         Ms. Lozano had her first exhibition at the Bianchini Gallery in New York in 1966 and was then associated with the Green Gallery. In 1998 her work, long absent from the New York scene, returned when three SoHo galleries, Mitchell Algus, Rosen & Van Liere and Margarete Roeder, each showed a different phase of her painting. At the same time the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford exhibited her ''Wave'' paintings and notebooks. All the dealers and curators involved with these exhibitions were men.       
         Mary C. Weitzman, who was a chorus girl as a teenager, a college freshman at 35, later a professor and finally a respected medical researcher, died on Saturday at a Manhattan hospital. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         As a researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, she worked on isolating microscopic samples of endocrine hormones from the eyestalks of Bermuda land crabs, some of which she captured herself. The work provided evidence for the once radical but now established theory that nerves secrete hormones in small but extremely influential quantities.         Until a year ago, Dr. Weitzman was still taking two subways and a bus to work each day from her Upper West Side apartment. It was the last leg of a journey that began in Norfolk, Va., where she was born in 1914 to two poor Eastern European immigrants. She dropped out of high school to dance in a chorus line, much to the delight of her father, a frustrated vaudevillian.         She married J. Daniel Weitzman, an investor and art collector, who made headlines in the 1970's when more than $400,000 of his artworks were stolen from his home by three gunmen who left him bound and gagged.         The Weitzmans were involved in the early stages of the civil rights movement, even before it was generally called that, and in 1948 they opened the Dupont Theater, the first desegregated theater in Washington.         Because of the Weitzmans' politics, the American Legion picketed the theater and Hollywood distributors cut off the supply of films. The Dupont therefore came to specialize in foreign and avant-garde films. Chess tables and espresso added to the bohemian atmosphere.         In 1949, the Weitzmans, neither of whom had graduated from high school, enrolled at George Washington University. Mr. Weitzman dropped out because of a business deal. Mrs. Weitzman went on to earn a master's degree.         In 1957, the couple moved to New York City when Mrs. Weitzman was accepted by Einstein's doctoral program, which at the time was jointly administered by Columbia University. She received her doctorate in 1963, staying on to join the Einstein anatomy department.         For years, she single-handedly published Bibliographica Neuroendocrinologica, an abstract of the world's research in her field. Colleagues said that part of her motivation was to spread new findings to third world countries. She personally translated articles from German, French, Spanish and Russian.         Her research was done with two other Einstein scientists, Berta and Ernst Scharrer, who are often credited as founders of endocrinology, which describes how hormones control the nervous system.         The Weitzmans were divorced in 1962. Mr. Weitzman died in 1980.         Dr. Weitzman is survived by two sons, Donald, of Brookline, Mass., and David, of Orinda, Calif.; a sister, Frances Pasmanick of Washington; two brothers, Harold Cohen of Arlington, Va., and Norman Cohen of Venice, Calif.; and five grandchildren.         Dr. Weitzman's impact was as much human as scientific, said Sam Seifter, a professor of biochemistry at Einstein. She worked with students one-to-one in the laboratory, devoted herself to helping minority students, and often counseled students on personal problems.         Sometimes, in the anatomy department's lunchroom, her colorful past would return when she burst into song; she favored old-time show tunes, the Loyalist songs of the Spanish Civil War and the anthems of the civil rights movement.       
         Gaby Casadesus, a pianist and teacher whose specialty was the 19th- and 20th-century French piano repertory, and who often performed in a piano duo with her husband, Robert Casadesus, died on Nov. 12 at her home in Paris. She was 98.         Mrs. Casadesus, whose name was originally Gaby L'Hote, was born in Marseilles in August 1901. She entered the Paris Conservatoire when she was 12, and became a student of Marguerite Long and Louis Diemer. She graduated from the Conservatoire with first prize in piano when she was 16 and soon established herself with performances of the piano works of Faure, Ravel and Milhaud, which she studied with the composers' guidance.         Her recitals also reached further back into the French keyboard literature to include music of Rameau, Couperin and Chopin. She was known as an elegant Mozart interpreter, and in 1923 she was awarded the Prix Pages, recognizing the achievement of female pianists in France.         When she was still at the Conservatoire she met Robert Casadesus, another student of Diemer, two years her senior. The two began giving performances of duo piano works together, and they married in 1921. Robert Casadesus wrote several works for the duo, including Six Pieces (1938), and a Concerto for Two Pianos, which they first performed in Warsaw in 1934, and with the New York Philharmonic in 1950.         In the 1960's their son Jean Michel Casadesus sometimes joined them for performances of the Bach Triple Concerto and Robert Casadesus's Concerto for Three Pianos. Jean Michel Casadesus died in an automobile accident in January 1972; Robert Casadesus died that September. Mrs. Casadesus is survived by a daughter, Therese Casadesus Rawson of Berwyn, Pa., and another son, Guy Casadesus of Toulon, France, as well as five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.         During World War II the Casadesus family settled in Princeton but returned to France in 1946. Both were influential teachers at the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau, France. Mrs. Casadesus also gave regular master classes at the Salzburg Mozarteum and at several French and American universities. She was the author of two books, ''Ma Technique Quotidienne'' (''My Daily Technique,'' written with Philip Lasser, one of her students) and ''Mes Noces Musicales'' (''My Musical Wedding,'' written with J. Muller).         After her husband's death she helped found an annual summer festival in Lille, France, with her nephew, the conductor Jean-Claude Casadesus, and in 1975 she started the Robert Casadesus International Piano Competition, in Cleveland. She also devoted herself to performing and publishing her husband's compositions.       
         Phoebe Snetsinger, who saw and recorded more birds than anybody else, died on Nov. 23 in a van accident on a birding expedition to Madagascar, shortly after viewing an exceptionally rare Helmet vanga. She was 68 and lived in Webster Groves, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis.         Birding went from a hobby to a passion for Mrs. Snetsinger on the day in 1981 that a doctor told her she had an incurable cancer, with less than a year to live. Rejecting therapy, she took off to Alaska on a scheduled trip, her first long-distance journey simply to see birds.         ''She came back and felt good,'' her husband, David, said. ''Things just started snowballing from there.''         Mrs. Snetsinger liked to say her avian ardor ''began with a death sentence,'' and her relentless energy reflected that level of urgency as her cancer went into the first of several remissions. Family members and friends could not imagine her without binoculars, floppy hat, sneakers, telescope and other field gear as she scurried around the globe on scores of bird tours, most costing more than $5,000. An inheritance paid the bills; she supplied the boundless energy. She said she spent more time in the world's jungles, mountains and other wild areas than at home.         There were setbacks, as the cancer, melanoma, recurred every five years or so, only to go into remission again. But her record, as verified by the American Birding Association, was sighting about 8,400 birds, or nearly 85 percent of the species now estimated to exist, more than 2,000 birds ahead of her nearest competitor.         ''She was a celebrity in our bunch,'' said Bret Whitney, a co-founder of Field Guides, a tour operator based in Austin, Tex. Mrs. Snetsinger was traveling on one of the group's tours when the van overturned. Mr. Whitney said she apparently died instantly.         ''She gave so much to the birding world and had so much more left to give,'' said G. Stuart Keith, the birding association's first president. At the highest tier of birding, it was a common joke to differentiate between Phoebe Snetsinger and the phoebe, a genus of flycatchers.         Genera, or large groups of species (as in the genus Homo of Homo sapiens), were of considerable importance to Mrs. Snetsinger, who kept a separate list of those that have only a single species, known as monotypic genera. Her list of more than 2,000 such genera far surpassed anyone else's, said Mr. Whitney, who also works as a research associate at Louisiana State University.         She also kept extensive notes on subspecies, using index cards as a catalog until switching in recent months to a computer from the Remington portable typewriter she had used since college.         Her subspecies notes, in whatever format, are important because many of the birds have now been reclassified as species. When she started, there were 8,500 officially named species, compared with about 10,000 now. A spokeswoman for the American Museum of Natural History said some scientists believed there could eventually be as many as 18,000 named separate bird species.         This means that her life list will almost certainly grow posthumously. ''She has birds in escrow,'' Mr. Whitney said.         Mrs. Snetsinger was born in Lake Zurich, Ill., where she attended a one-room elementary school with only two other students. At 11, she met her future husband, then 13, in 4-H clubs.         She graduated from Swarthmore College as a German major, and then taught science at the Baldwin School, a private girls school in Bryn Mawr, Pa. When Mr. Snetsinger returned from service in Korea, they both attended graduate school and she earned a master's degree in German literature.         They had four children, all of whom survive. They are Thomas, of Corvallis, Ore.; Penny, of Woodbridge, Conn.; Carol, of Missoula, Mont., and Susan, of Tempe, Ariz. All but Penny pursued careers relating to birds, Thomas as a researcher in endangered bird species for the Federal government, Carol as a bird researcher in Alaska and Montana, and Susan as a student of the spotted owl in the Northwest.         In 1965, a friend took Mrs. Snetsinger birding for the first time in Minnesota, and when her husband took a corporate job in Missouri she pursued her interest with a group of birders. (Birders adamantly spurn the term ''birdwatcher'' in the belief that it suggests a lack of gravity.) The group visited local woods and prairies each Thursday afternoon.         After birding came to represent a new lease on life to her, Mrs. Snetsinger began to take longer and longer trips. She was hooked when she visited Kenya and saw 500 different birds in three weeks. Her odyssey was aided by new technology for recording bird sounds, greater access to more and more remote habitats and the increasing numbers of tours being offered.         The depth of her enthusiasm is suggested by her response to a fall she took about six months ago while climbing a mountain in the Philippines: she stayed in the field for two additional weeks to see more birds.         The whole idea of listing birds, or at least the seriousness of the pursuit, is also sometimes criticized, or at least satirized. Indeed, it is called ''the game'' by birders themselves. ''It's like collecting stamps or baseball cards,'' said Paul J. Baicich, editor of Birding, the magazine of the American Birding Association.         Mr. Snetsinger said his wife's competitive spirit was kept hidden, though he did not deny it existed. In a 1996 interview, she insisted that she wanted to play down her quantitative quest. ''I'm going back to being a birder, not a lister,'' she said.         Ultimately, she felt very lucky, as she explained in an article to be published in next February's issue of Birding. ''Birding is the best and most exciting pursuit in the world, a glorified never-ending one,'' Mrs. Snetsinger wrote. ''And the whole experience of a foreign trip, whether you see 10 new birds or 500, is simply too good to miss.''       
         Gloria Caruso Murray, a visual artist who was the last surviving child of Enrico Caruso, died on Dec. 5 at St. Luke's Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 79 and had briefly tried to live up to the musical world's sentimental fantasy that she had inherited her father's vocal abilities.         She died of cancer, said Aldo Mancusi, curator of the Caruso Museum in Brooklyn.         Only hours after his daughter's birth on Dec. 18, 1919, at the Knickerbocker Hotel just a stone's throw from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York, Caruso, then the most famous operatic tenor in the world, exuberantly tossed the girl into the air, peered into her mouth and announced, ''Ah, she has the vocal cords, just like her daddy!''         A year and a half later, Caruso was dead at 48 -- a loss that nourished a popular fantasy that his child would also have an extraordinary voice.         At age 7, when she and her mother returned to New York from a vacation in Europe, a New York newspaper ran the headline ''Gloria Caruso, Here With a Voice'' and pronounced her ''a potential opera star of the first magnitude.''         The next year she made her first record. At 11, she made her first public appearance, delivering a radio address on behalf of a charity headed by President Herbert Hoover. Later that year she made a test recording for RCA Victor, and John McCormack, another renowned tenor, gave her singing lessons and announced that she had promise.         The press had an immense appetite for even the slightest tidbits of news about the great Caruso's daughter. But it gradually became apparent that she did not have the voice to follow her father.         In 1942, Ms. Murray told a reporter that she was studying art at the Art Students League in New York and that she had come to prefer the visual arts to music. ''I've always been torn between art and music,'' she said. ''Daddy drew and sculptured as a hobby. And Mommy draws. Art is as much in the family as singing.''         In marrying Caruso, her mother, an American named Dorothy Benjamin, created a tumult in 1918. Her father, Park Benjamin, a wealthy patent lawyer and New York society figure, fiercely opposed the match between his daughter, then 25, to Caruso, who was 45. After the couple eloped, Park Benjamin disowned her. When he died in 1925, he left her $1 from his substantial estate.         In 1943, Gloria Caruso married Ensign Michael Hunt Murray, who had left Harvard to become a naval aviator in World War II. The couple had two sons but later divorced.         Ms. Murray set up a studio in New York City where she painted both portraits and landscapes. Later she lived in Miami and, for the last 10 years, in Jacksonville.         Andrew Farkas, co-author with Enrico Caruso Jr. of ''Enrico Caruso: My Father and My Family'' (Amadeus Press, 1990), said that Ms. Murray's paintings were ''of good quality, although she sold very few.''         ''She became rather reclusive,'' Mr. Farkas said, adding, ''She had been answering questions about her father for a long time.'' Eric D. Murray, one of Ms. Murray's sons, said his mother had become occupied with managing the family estate after her mother died in 1957.         Matters were complicated because Caruso had left no will. In 1928, a court in Trenton had ruled that Gloria Caruso was entitled to two-thirds of the royalties on her father's phonograph records, sold by the Victor Talking Machine Company.         Gloria Caruso attended Miss Hewitt's Classes in New York City, the Ozanne School in Paris, the Bishop School in La Jolla, Calif., and Miss Nixon's School in Florence, Italy.         In addition to her son Eric, of Maryland, she is survived by her other son, Colin D. Murray of Jacksonville.         Mr. Farkas wrote that Enrico Caruso had four children from a relationship with Ada Giacchetti, a soprano who had left her husband to live with the tenor before his marriage to Miss Benjamin. Only one, Enrico Caruso Jr., sought a career as a singer. All are deceased.       
         Jill Craigie, a devoted socialist and feminist who became one of Britain's first successful female film directors and whose half-century marriage to the Labor Party leader Michael Foot put her at the heart of the country's leftist politics, died on Monday in London. She was 85.         Ms. Craigie first made her mark in documentary filmmaking with ''Out of Chaos,'' a 1943 film about modern art; ''The Way We Live,'' a 1946 study of the effects of the German blitzkrieg on Plymouth, and ''Blue Scar,'' a 1948 look at life in an impoverished Welsh mining village. It was while making her film in Plymouth that she met Mr. Foot, then a candidate for Parliament. She interviewed him and a relationship began.         Ms. Craigie was born in Derbyshire to a Scottish father and a Russian emigre mother and had, by her own estimation, a wretched childhood. Her parents divorced when she was an infant. Her father was killed in World War I and her mother lived mostly abroad.         ''I used to spend most of my holidays at boarding school,'' she once said. ''I went to a dozen different boarding schools over the years and never learned anything. I was one of the rootless people. I had a very lonely childhood indeed. I turned to writing because I was lonely.''         After school, she moved to London and began writing an advice column and horoscopes for a women's magazine called Betty's Paper. She quickly found her way into artistic and literary circles. When she was 19, she married a sculptor, Claude Begbie-Clench, and they had a daughter, Julie. The marriage was short-lived.         Soon after, she married Jeffrey Dell, a scriptwriter for the movie producer Alexander Korda, and they wrote a play called ''The Judge,'' which was staged in London in 1938. This marriage was also short-lived, but Ms. Craigie was able to use the connections she made through Mr. Dell to get work in the British film industry, first making sports films and later turning to feature-length documentaries.         During these years, Ms. Craigie was romantically linked to many prominent artists and writers.         Mr. Foot and Ms. Craigie did not marry for almost two years after their meeting in Plymouth, though they lived together for much of that time. They finally married in 1949, she once said, to assuage the concerns of Mr. Foot's family.         Though many at the time doubted that Ms. Craigie's third marriage would last longer than the first two, theirs turned out to be a close and loving relationship, friends said.         She is survived by her husband and daughter.         Ms. Craigie's work as a filmmaker and writer dwindled after her third marriage, though she did write the screenplay for ''The Million Pound Note,'' renamed ''Man With a Million,'' a 1953 film starring Gregory Peck that was filmed in London.         In 1952, she wrote and produced a BBC radio documentary about the British suffragist movement, a subject that was near to her heart since a chance meeting in 1940 with a group of aging suffragists at a memorial service for one of their members.         For the last decades of her life, Ms. Craigie was said to be at work on a  history of the movement, left unfinished at her death.         In 1967, she made a television documentary called ''Who Are the Vandals?'' that was critical of housing developers. In 1995, she made ''Two Hours From London,'' a documentary about the former Yugoslavia.         As Mr. Foot's political career prospered, Ms. Craigie became known as one of his confidantes as well as the hostess for many Labor Party gatherings at the couple's home. When Mr. Foot became chief of the Labor Party in 1980, beginning a three-year leadership that ended with a crushing defeat for the party in 1983, a few asserted that he was being pushed by an ambitious wife. Ms. Craigie demurred.         ''He would be in exactly the same position he is in today had he not been married to me, except he wouldn't have had such a nice house,'' she said.       
         Dorothy Allison, a self-proclaimed psychic with a knack for turning up at the scenes of notorious crimes, died on Dec. 1 at Clara Maass Medical Center in Belleville, N.J. She was 74 and lived in Nutley, N.J.         The cause was heart failure, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Allison, a small woman in thick, oversized glasses, materialized to offer to solve crimes including the Patricia Hearst kidnapping, the ''Son of Sam'' killings, the murders of children in Atlanta and the death of JonBenet Ramsey. She was not successful in those cases, but her supporters insist that she hit the mark on others.         Chief Robert DeLitta of the Nutley Police Department, which became something of a booking agent for Ms. Allison, said, ''The information she provided was very, very accurate -- right on the money.'' He said hundreds of police departments from all over the world called the Nutley police to reach her.         Her fame made her the emblem of a vigorous debate about the efficacy  and legitimacy of so-called psychic detectives. ''Dorothy couldn't locate Patty,'' Randolph Hearst, Patricia's father, said in a Newsweek interview. ''But she is honest and reputable. I wouldn't laugh at it.''         But skeptics, many armed with volumes of research, insist that psychics have never solved a single crime. Joe Nickell, a columnist for Skeptical Inquirer, the magazine of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, said in an interview that psychic detectives use a trick called ''retrofitting,'' which involves tossing out several clues, like a number or a mention of water, that are interpreted to fit the facts after they become known.         Police departments may waste valuable time and resources digging in specific spots and draining ponds on the erroneous advice of a psychic, he said. ''Certainly Dorothy Allison caused a great deal of -- I'm sure unintended -- mischief,'' he said.         Michael Shermer, the publisher of Skeptic magazine, said in an interview that psychic detectives commonly make logical predictions; for example, they suggest that a corpse will be found in a remote area.         ''If you have a body, are you going to dump it in a crowded city?'' he asked.         When Ms. Allison named names, they were not always the right ones. In the case of the murders of about a dozen black children in Atlanta in 1979-80, she gave the police 42 names of possible killers, and none of the names were Wayne or Williams. A man named Wayne B. Williams was eventually convicted of the crimes.         Ms. Allison became something of a cult figure after many newspaper articles and television shows depicted her as a great-grandmother sitting at her kitchen table, concentrating on astrological charts and gazing at gruesome photographs of crime scenes. Visitors to her house noticed many commendations from police departments, some of which officially say they do not use psychics.         She was born in Jersey City and grew up there. Her psychic sensations became public knowledge in 1968, when she told the Nutley police that they could find the body of a missing boy in a drainage pipe. Though it has been widely reported for three decades that they did, Mr. Nickell said that according to his research, the body was found floating in a pond by a man looking for a place to bury his dead cat.         In interviews over the years, Ms. Allison said she had worked on more than 5,000 cases, so many that she had trouble recalling the names of victims. She said she had led detectives to 250 bodies and had solved hundreds of murders. Among the police departments that consulted her was New York City's.         Chief DeLitta of the Nutley police said she had been helpful on many occasions, citing a 1993 bludgeoning murder. Among Ms. Allison's correct predictions were double letters in the names of the suspect and a street that figured in the case, the occupation of the suspect's father, and the facts that the suspect lived in a garden apartment next to a yellow house and that one of his car's headlights was out.         She also said the murder weapon would be found in a river. The weapon was never found, but the man convicted of the crime later admitted throwing it in the river, the chief said.         Ms. Allison refused payment for her work, saying it would be ''blood money.'' She did accept money for expenses and payments for appearances on talk shows and other forums. She also wrote articles and books, the most successful of which was ''A Psychic's Story,'' published in 1980.         She is survived by her husband, Bob; two sons, Alex Allison of Nutley and Robert McBride of Stone Ridge, N.Y.; a daughter, Dorothy McBride of Montville, N.J.; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.         ''If you asked me if I believe in psychics, I'd say no -- only very few,'' Ms. Allison said in a New York Times interview in 1996.         She had harsh words for psychics who advertise on television, a practice she shunned. ''Those 1-900 number people should be arrested,'' she said.       
         Betty Cage, an administrator of the New York City Ballet who played a quiet but important role in creating the company, died on Sunday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 82 and lived in Manhattan.         Her title for many years was simply general manager, but Ms. Cage was a linchpin of the City Ballet. She avoided the limelight and was unknown to the balletgoing public. A woman of few words, she presided over generations of dancers, choreographers and backstage personnel with a wryly detached wit and a calm, almost uncanny sense of approaching trouble.         Ms. Cage was, as Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of the City Ballet, described her role in ''Thirty Years,'' his history of the organization, ''at once labor negotiator, certified public accountant, legal expert, mother superior, confessor, psychiatrist and practicing witch (white magic).'' She was, Kirstein wrote, ''proficient in the science and pursuit of the possible and impossible.''         Born in Minneapolis, Ms. Cage grew up in Buffalo, then moved to New York. She worked in a law office before becoming an assistant editor at John Bernard Myers's literary journal View and an assistant to Frances Steloff at the Gotham Book Mart, jobs that gained her entry into the world of New York poets, artists and intellectuals involved in dance in the 1940's.         It is likely that Kirstein met Ms. Cage at the Gotham Book Mart, where he is said to have invited her to work with Ballet Society, a precursor to City Ballet. Ms. Cage arrived in 1947 and retired in 1985. Her first job there was as an assistant to Frances Hawkins, the business manager at Ballet Society. It was there that Ms. Cage formed a close professional relationship with Morton Baum, who, as chairman of the City Center's finance committee in 1948, extended a crucial invitation to the ballet company to become a resident of the theater. Ms. Cage also helped to engineer the City Ballet's 1964 move to Lincoln Center. In 1985, she founded the Dancers Emergency Fund at City Ballet.         Ms. Cage was an avid practitioner  of tai chi, the Chinese system of movement. She collaborated with her husband, Edward Maisel, on ''Tai Chi for Health,'' published in 1972. Ms. Cage also taught unofficial tai chi classes at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Lucile Petry Leone, the founding director of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps, which recruited more than 100,000 young women to study nursing and helped spare the country of the need to draft nurses in World War II, died on Nov. 25 at an assisted-living center in San Francisco. She was 97.         As early as the summer of 1941, months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, there was talk in Washington that it might be necessary to conscript nurses to care for the inevitable high number of casualties there would be should the United States become engaged in a major war.         A less radical alternative -- and a much more politically acceptable one -- was temporarily agreed upon. The United States Public Health Service would start a program to attract young women at schools throughout the country into nursing. Lucile Petry, a teacher at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing, was chosen to initiate the program.         Two years later, after the United States was at war in both Europe and Asia, Ms. Leone founded and directed the Cadet Nurse Corps, a more formal effort to start women on a path to nursing. The program, authorized by Congress in 1943, offered to cover the cost of a candidate's tuition, fees, room and board, books, monthly stipends and snappy navy-style uniforms.         In exchange, said Ellen Schell, a nursing historian based in San Francisco, candidates had to ''promise to participate in essential military or civilian nursing for as long as the war lasted.''         The Cadet Nurse Corps proved a success, meeting its recruitment quotas in 1943 and 1944 and outstripping them in the final year of the war, when there were 112,000 cadets in the program. As a consequence, the United States never had to draft nurses into the armed services during the war.         Explaining the success of the Cadet Nurse Corps, Ms. Leone told an interviewer in 1945: ''We had a saleable package from the beginning. The girls immediately liked the idea of being able to combine war service with professional education for the future.''         She also gave credit to the organization's slogan, ''Custodians of the Crises of Life.''         In 1949, Ms. Leone became the first woman to direct a division of the United States Public Health Service, the Division of Nurse Education. Her rank was equivalent to that of an admiral.         ''In that capacity,'' said Zina Mirsky, assistant dean for administration at the School of Nursing of the University of California at San Francisco, ''she established the role of nursing in the federal government -- a presence that still exists.''         Ms. Leone retired from government service in 1966 and went on to teach nursing and serve as associate dean at Texas Women's University.  She retired again in 1971.         Lucile Petry, the only child of a high school principal and his wife, was born on Jan. 23, 1902, in Frog Heaven, in Preble County, Ohio. She was reared in Selbyville, Del., and  after graduating from the University of Delaware in 1924, she received  advanced degrees at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing in 1927 and Columbia Teachers College in 1929. She taught at the Yale School of Nursing and the University of Minnesota School of Nursing before being summoned to Washington.         Ms. Leone's marriage to Nicholas Leone ended in divorce in 1967. She has no immediate survivors.       
         Nilde Iotti, an early leader of the Italian Communist Party and the first woman to become president of the lower house of Parliament, died Friday night of heart failure after a long illness, the news agency ANSA reported. She was 79.         Ms. Iotti, who served as a Partisan during World War II, was first elected to office in 1946, winning a seat in the constitutional assembly. At age 26, she took part in the ''Committee of the 75,'' which wrote a first draft of Italy's postwar constitution.         From 1979 until 1992, she served as Italy's president of the lower house of Parliament, a role similar to that of the speaker of the house in the United States. It made her No. 2 in line to succeed the president.         In Parliament, her regal manner earned her the nicknames, ''Czarina'' and ''The Red Queen.'' She described herself differently, saying, ''I'm just a woman who has a difficult job and tries to do it with tact.''         The daughter of a railway worker, Ms. Iotti was born in Reggio Emilia, the heart of Italy's ''red belt'' and studied literature at the Catholic University of Milan. She moved to Rome after the war, where she met and fell in love with Palmiro Togliatti, Italy's Communist Party leader.         Mr. Togliatti was married, and divorce was then illegal in Italy. The couple adopted a daughter in 1950, the sister of a worker killed by police during a strike in Modena. The couple stayed together until Mr. Togliatti's death in 1964.         Viewed throughout her life as a staunch member of the Communist Party's central committee, Ms. Iotti changed along with many in her party after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. She was one of the first party officials to endorse the proposal to rid the party of its hammer and sickle and rename themselves ''Democrats of the Left.''         Ms. Iotti, who campaigned to legalize divorce and abortion in Italy, resigned from Parliament last month, citing ill health.         Her coffin will be laid in state in the Italian Parliament and she will receive a state funeral on Monday. She is survived by her daughter, Marisa Malagoli Togliatti.       
         Rose E. Bird, who became the first woman on California's Supreme Court and whose resolute opposition to the death penalty later led voters to remove her as chief justice, died of complications from breast cancer on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 63.         Almost from the moment she was appointed to head the state's highest court by Gov. Jerry Brown in 1977, Ms. Bird, a pioneering liberal lawyer who had never been a judge, became one of the most controversial figures in California politics. She led a liberal majority that strengthened environmental laws and consumer rights. But in 1986, voters angry at her opposition to the death penalty removed her and two other Brown-appointed justices by refusing to extend their terms. They were the first such removals in California history.         Ms. Bird, who came of professional age at a time when major law firms still resisted hiring women, held a succession of path-breaking jobs. She was the first woman hired by the Santa Clara County public defender's office in Northern California, and she became the first woman to hold a cabinet-level post in state government when Mr. Brown named her his secretary of agriculture in 1975. Many of her detractors were forced to acknowledge her administrative skills, while even her admirers among judges and lawyers conceded the brittleness that made her a lighting rod for criticism.         Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who had known her for years, said Ms. Bird had ''a total passion for, and commitment to, justice.''         ''In some ways, she was just too good to be a judge, he said. ''She had a total passion and commitment, and that's not always the best way to function and get along in this world, in a political environment. From the day she got to the Supreme Court, she never really had a chance.''         After the death penalty was reinstated in California in the late 1970's, Judge Bird never upheld a death sentence, voting to vacate such sentences 61 times. She survived repeated efforts to recall her, but was ousted after Governor George Deukmejian, a Republican, led an aggressive campaign against her.         To this day, Ms. Bird's name remains a kind of reflexive shorthand in California for ''soft-on-crime liberal.'' In last year's election, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, sought to tar his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, by association, because Mr. Davis had been Governor Brown's chief of staff at the time of Ms. Bird's appointment.         ''I appreciate that some people within our state are impatient, impatient to see executions,'' Ms. Bird said after her removal. ''I don't think anybody in this state will sit easy if, in fact, this becomes a court that ensures nothing but executions to appease the overweening and insatiable attitude of ambitious politicians.''         Today, in part because of long-running arguments over capital punishment, California has the largest death row in the nation, with more than 500 inmates sentenced to die. But virtually the entire state political establishment, Democratic as well as Republican, now favors the death penalty, and the pace of executions is widely expected to increase.         Rose Elizabeth Bird was born on Nov. 2, 1936, in Tucson, the youngest of three children whose parents ran a chicken farm. Her parents separated in 1941, and her father died soon after. Ms. Bird's widowed mother, Anne, moved the family to New York, her home state.         Young Rose was a standout scholar in high school, earning a scholarship to Long Island University, where she majored in English in preparation for a career in journalism. She later enrolled as a graduate student in political science at the University of California at Berkeley, but an internship in the State Legislature in Sacramento persuaded her to switch to law school, because lawyers seemed to have the most influence on public policy.         After working as a public defender and teaching a seminar in criminal defense at Stanford University's law school, Ms. Bird became a volunteer in Mr. Brown's 1974 campaign for governor, serving as his frequent chauffeur on his trips to her area and later as a trusted adviser on his transition team. On taking office, Mr. Brown broke precedent by naming Ms. Bird secretary of agriculture, a post traditionally held by a grower. Ms. Bird emphasized consumer protection and worker health and safety, moving to ban the use of a short-handled hoe that forced farm laborers to spend hours stooped in the fields. She also drafted a landmark farm labor bill guaranteeing workers' rights to hold secret-ballot union elections and shepherded it through the legislature.         The controversy she generated in the agriculture post was nothing compared to the criticism that greeted her nomination as chief justice in 1977. Police groups and politicians around the state opposed her on the grounds that she would favor defendants, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, then a bishop and head of the state Agricultural Relations Board, questioned her ''emotional stability'' and her ''vindictive approach to dealing with all persons under her authority.''         Just a year later, conservatives outraged by her decisions on school busing, taxes and other issues began a campaign to remove her. Under California law, supreme court justices appointed by the governor must be approved by the electorate in the next gubernatorial election, and periodically thereafter.         She survived the opposition that year. But on the morning of election day, The Los Angeles Times published an article, citing anonymous sources, suggesting that the Supreme Court had deliberately delayed issuing a split decision overturning a law mandating prison sentences for those convicted of using a gun in certain crimes, so as not to hurt Judge Bird's chances at the polls.         That led to public hearings by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, which portrayed the court as riven by personal conflicts and political infighting. No formal charges of misconduct were brought against any justice, but the controversy generated by the investigation lingered on.         After her ouster in 1986, Ms. Bird, who never married, retreated into semi-seclusion. She cared for her aged mother in Palo Alto and surfaced occasionally as a television commentator or a public speaker, but dropped even some old friends and associates. She had battled breast cancer intermittently since 1976. Her mother died in 1991, and she is survived by two brothers, Philip, of Hawaii, and Jack, of Arizona.         ''If you have never experienced life under a microscope, you need to understand that those who live a public life are no longer seen as real persons -- human beings,'' Ms. Bird wrote in a 1996 newspaper column. ''Rather, they are objects to be examined, manipulated, ridiculed and sometimes even hated.''       
         Margaret A. Greenfield, a founder and officer of the Independent Journalism Foundation and a dealer in art, antiques and real estate, died yesterday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 74.         She had cancer, said her husband, James L. Greenfield.         Beginning in the 1950's, Mrs. Greenfield was an art and antiques dealer in London, Washington and finally Manhattan, where for about the last 25 years she owned and ran an antiques shop, Marco Polo, on Madison Avenue between 84th and 85th Streets. It closed about a year ago.         She also renovated and resold brownstones on the Upper East Side.         Mrs. Greenfield was active in the Independent Journalism Foundation from its inception in 1991. The foundation, based in Manhattan, teaches citizens of former Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe about working as journalists in newly democratic societies.         She was the foundation's treasurer and one of its founders, along with her husband and Donald M. Wilson, a former vice president of Time Inc. Mr. Greenfield, a former foreign correspondent for Time magazine and former assistant secretary of state, is now a consulting member of the editorial board at The New York Times, where he has also been foreign editor and later an assistant managing editor.         Mrs. Greenfield created and furnished the foundation's four centers in Eastern European capitals -- in Prague, Bratislava, Bucharest and Budapest.         Margaret Ann Schwertley Greenfield was born in Gooding, Idaho. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Idaho and worked as a stewardess for United Airlines and then for Pan American World Airways.         She met Mr. Greenfield when she was based in Hong Kong in the early 1950's, while she was Pan Am's first stewardess based in the Far East. They were married in 1954.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Anne Schwertley of Manhattan and Jane Schwertley of Gainesville, Fla.
