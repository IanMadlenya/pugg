        Beatrice Lillie, who during a half-century theatrical career was often called ''the funniest woman in the world,'' died yesterday at her home in Henley-on-Thames, England. She was 94 years old.         Beatrice Lillie, who during a half-century theatrical career was often called ''the funniest woman in the world,'' died yesterday at her home in Henley-on-Thames, England. She was 94 years old.         Miss Lillie, who used a long cigarette holder to punctuate the barbed ripostes for which she was famous, was the widow of Sir Robert Peel. But she never took her official title, Lady Peel, seriously and called her autobiography ''Every Other Inch a Lady.''         The Canadian-born comedienne suffered a series of strokes several years ago that silenced her voice and ended her career. Her last Broadway show was ''High Spirits,'' a 1964 musical version of Sir Noel Coward's ''Blithe Spirit,'' and her last film was the 1966 musical ''Thoroughly Modern Millie.''         The very name Beatrice Lillie could evoke memories of mirth and merriment for the hundreds of thousands of people she entertained in theaters, movie houses, vaudeville palaces and supper clubs and on radio and television, over a period of more than 50 years.         In Alexander Woollcott's estimation, Miss Lillie was ''a comic genius'' with her trademark close-cropped hair and fezlike cap. She was, in fact, one of those rare entertainers whose talents and qualities are extremely difficult to measure and describe. One had to see her to believe her - or perhaps disbelieve her. She was a great clown who learned early how to ''play'' an audience.         Because of that fact, it was often said that no two Lillie performances were ever the same. She explained that for most of her performances, when things went well, ''the wand was on; something happened between myself and the audience, for they recognized something I'd known for years - I was a natural-born fool.'' State of Havoc         Anyone who ever saw her sketch about a slightly tipsy, tongue-tied Mrs. Blagdon Blogg turning Harrods department store in London into a state of havoc, would consider her an adorably nutty fool. In the sketch, Mrs. Blogg tried, unsuccessfully, to buy ''two dozen double-damask dinner napkins,'' a request that soon started coming off her thickened tongue as ''two dazzle dimask dibble dimmer napples,'' and so forth.         In her sketches and songs, most of which were constructed to puncture the pompous, Miss Lillie could send her audiences into fits of laughter by merely lifting an eyebrow, twitching her nose as she spoke a certain phrase or turning her longish face into a rubbery U-shape with a somewhat equine smile. With great ease she seemed able to contort and mold that face into a thousand shapes.         Often it was not precisely what she said or sang that garnered so many laughs, but the way she delivered the material. As the critic George Jean Nathan put it, ''With one dart of her eyes, she can spare a skit writer a dozen lines.''         Sir Noel, Miss Lillie's devoted friend and often the writer of her material, her director or her co-star, finally grew accustomed to her idiosyncrasies. ''For an author-director to attempt to pin Beattie down to a meticulous delineation of character is a direct invitation to nervous collapse,'' he said. Natural Instinct for Humor         Miss Lillie had a natural instinct for humor. One spring day, while she was serving tea to friends in her East End Avenue apartment in New York, a pigeon flew in the window and sat on the arm of a chair. Some of Miss Lillie's guests were startled, but she merely looked at the bird and asked, ''Any messages?''         Beatrice Gladys Lillie was born in Toronto on May 29, 1894. Her father, John Lillie, a native of Northern Ireland, had served with the British Army in India before he married Lucie Shaw, an Englishwoman. Beatrice had an older sister, Muriel.         Mrs. Lillie, who enjoyed a modest reputation as a concert singer, had great expectations for her daughters - Muriel would be a concert pianist, Beatrice a soprano - and their musical training began early.         The Lillie Trio - Mrs. Lillie, Beatrice and Muriel - entertained at local soirees and did a bit of touring, but Beatrice was showing signs of being an undisciplined soprano. The trouble was that she had discovered early the pleasures of making people laugh while she sang. At 8 years of age, she was thrown out of a church choir for making funny gestures and flopping her fan about during serious moments, causing small boys to giggle uncontrollably. Top Hat and Tails         At 15, Miss Lillie ended what had been at best a mere pass at a formal education, and sailed for England, where her mother had taken Muriel to study music. Her first stage appearance, which ran a week, was as a male impersonator, a role she was to play off and on, in top hat and tails, for several years. ''I was the best-dressed transvestite in the world,'' Miss Lillie said.         In 1914, she was hired for a minor role in ''Not Likely,'' produced by Andre Charlot, a Frenchman who had brought to London, with great success, the concept of the little revue of fast-paced, sophisticated songs, skits and blackouts.         The young, bubbling Miss Lillie was besieged by hordes of stage-door Johnnies. The one who won her was the handsome Robert Peel, whose ancestor Sir Robert Peel served as one of Queen Victoria's Prime Ministers and organized London's Metropolitan police force. Its members were nicknamed ''bobbies'' after him. Wed at Family Estate         Miss Lillie was married to the future Sir Robert Peel at his family's estate, Drayton Manor, in 1920, but the bridegroom's parents stayed away, disapproving of ''theatrical folk.'' The couple's only child, also named Robert and called Little Bobbie, was born a year later.         A few months afterward, a bored Beatrice Lillie returned to the stage in Charlot's revue ''Now and Then.''         Miss Lillie's insistence on not giving up her career was dictated in part by economic necessity. Her husband was virtually penniless, a man who was never able to hold down a job and a gambler as well.         ''It was fortunate that I could trek back and forth across the Atlantic, earning a living for my son and husband,'' Miss Lillie said. The couple grew apart, and Sir Robert died of peritonitis at the age of 36, in 1934, in the home of his mistress. Son Killed in World War II         Miss Lillie's private world was shattered in 1942, when her son, who had enlisted in the Royal Navy, was killed in a Japanese air raid on the port of Colombo, Ceylon.         Miss Lillie spent much of the war entertaining troops in the Mediterranean region, Africa, the Middle East and, later, in Germany.         Over the years, she appeared in at least one revue a year, and sometimes two or three. Among them was ''This Year of Grace'' in 1928, written by and co-starring Sir Noel. One of Miss Lillie's most famous songs was ''Mad Dogs and Englishmen,'' introduced in her ''Third Little Show'' on Broadway in 1931. It became a standard in her repertory as well as in Sir Noel's.         In her 1972 autobiography, Miss Lillie told how another of her standards, ''There Are Fairies in the Bottom of My Garden,'' was introduced, against her will, into her repertory. Her friend Ethel Barrymore thought the song was a lovely, serious one, but Miss Lillie made it a side-splitter, especially when she sang it garbed in a long formal gown, then raised her skirt and roller-skated off stage. Radio Series in the 30's         Miss Lillie's Broadway and West End shows included ''Walk a Little Faster,'' ''The Show Is On,'' ''Happy Returns,'' even George Bernard Shaw's ''Too True to Be Good,'' one of her few straight plays, in which it was felt she was miscast. She made half a dozen movies and also had a radio series in the 1930's.         She toured the United States many times, in ''An Evening With Beatrice Lillie,'' ''Inside U.S.A.,'' and half a dozen other shows. Her friends were fond of telling the story about the time Miss Lillie and several chorus girls went to a beauty parlor in Chicago to have their hair done before an opening. An heiress to a meatpacking empire came in and informed the beauty salon's proprietor that she was ''mortified and infuriated to learn this establishment has been taken over by showgirls.''         As Miss Lillie left her booth, she loudly told the salon proprietor, in her most proper and meticulously enunciated English: ''You may tell the butcher's daughter that Lady Peel is finished.'' And she sailed out.         Beatrice Lillie was an original, but one who never took herself seriously. Once a reporter asked, ''Miss Lillie, what lies at the bottom of your art?''         ''There are fairies at the bottom of my art,'' she answered.         Miss Lillie left no immediate survivors.       
        Norma Varden, whose acting career in films, television and on the state included such roles as Jack Benny's mother and the housekeeper in ''The Sound of Music,'' has died at age 90.         Norma Varden, whose acting career in films, television and on the state included such roles as Jack Benny's mother and the housekeeper in ''The Sound of Music,'' has died at age 90.         Miss Varden died Thursday of heart failure at Cottage Hospital's coronary care unit, a nurse, Kathy Polischuk, said today.         Miss Varden began making movies in the early 1930's in her native England, which led to offers from Hollywood. Her credits there included ''Random Harvest,'' ''The White Cliffs of Dover,'' ''National Velvet'' and ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.''         In addition to her ''Sound of Music'' role, she played the murder victim in ''Witness for the Prosecution.'' In the Humphrey Bogart-Ingrid Bergman classic ''Casablanca,'' she was the woman whose husband's pocket was picked.         Turning to television, Miss Varden was Mr. Benny's mother on ''The Jack Benny Show'' in the 1950's.         She had made her home in this coastal city northwest of Los Angeles since 1969. Funeral arrangements were incomplete, a spokesman for the Wech-Ryce-Haider Funeral Chapel said.       
        Elaine de Kooning, a painter, teacher and writer on art, died of lung cancer yesterday at Southampton (L.I.) Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in East Hampton.         Elaine de Kooning, a painter, teacher and writer on art, died of lung cancer yesterday at Southampton (L.I.) Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in East Hampton.         Mrs. de Kooning, who was married to the artist Willem de Kooning, was a highly versatile painter whose work ranged from realism to abstraction but was grounded in the gestural Abstract Expressionism of the New York School. Her landscapes, portraits and studies of athletes in action were notable for their verve and freshness.         ''I always say I'm an escape artist,'' she told the critic Rose Slivka when asked to characterize her style. ''Style is something I've always tried to avoid. I'm more interested in character. Character comes out of the work. Style is applied or imposed on it.'' Sketches for a Series         Seized by a particular theme, she would explore many aspects of it. She did 50 watercolor sketches, for instance, to begin a series devoted to Bacchus, a series inspired by her encounter with ''the churning, writhing movement'' of a statue in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris in 1976.         When she was commissioned in 1962 to do a portrait of President John F. Kennedy for the Truman Library in Independence, Mo., she characteristically immersed herself in the project, turning out hundreds of sketches and some two dozen finished canvases in her attempt to capture the President's restless energy.         One of the finished portraits hangs in the Truman Library; the other is in the John F. Kennedy Library at Cambridge, Mass. Cave Art Inspired Recent Work         Her recent work was inspired by the paleolithic cave paintings of Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain, which she felt were close in spirit to 20th-century art. In her show at the Fischbach Gallery in New York City last November, the grafitti-like images of horses, deer, antelope, bison and bulls appeared in flowing panorama, seeming to emerge - as they do in the caves themselves - by means of spontaneous brushwork from the rough, accidental surfaces of the cave walls. The ambitious series was the culmination of work begun in 1983 after a visit to Lascaux.         Elaine Marie Catherine Fried was born in New York City on March 12, 1920, the oldest child of Charles Frank and Mary Ellen O'Brien Fried. She was introduced to art at an early age by her mother, who covered the walls of their Brooklyn home with reproductions of famous paintings. After her graduation from Erasmus Hall High School, she put in a brief stint at Hunter College, then switched to the Leonardo da Vinci Art School in Manhattan, where she fell in with a congenial group of abstract and Social Realist painters. In 1938, at the age of 18, she met Mr. de Kooning in a Manhattan cafeteria. They were married in 1943. First Solo Show in 1952         Mrs. de Kooning's first solo exhibition was in 1952 at the Stable Gallery in New York. An insightful writer and lecturer on art, she held teaching posts at many colleges and universities, including Yale, Carnegie-Mellon, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Georgia, Bard College, the Cooper Union and the Parsons School of Fine Art in New York.         Her work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York and in a number of other institutions throughout the country.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Marjorie Luyckx, and two brothers, Conrad and Peter Fried, all of Freeport, L.I., and a stepdaughter, Lisa, of Springs, L.I.         A funeral service will be held at 1 P.M. on Saturday at the Williams Funeral Home, 99 Newtown Lane, in East Hampton.       
        Angna Enters, a dancer and mime, painter and writer, died on Saturday at the County Manor Nursing Home in Tenafly, N.J. She was 82 years old.         Angna Enters, a dancer and mime, painter and writer, died on Saturday at the County Manor Nursing Home in Tenafly, N.J. She was 82 years old.         Miss Enters became internationally known during the 1920's for an individual style of dance-mime that Stark Young described as ''free of influences foreign to her nature.'' She specialized in character vignettes, frequently described as wordless monologues, developing nearly 300 separate characters for her touring Theater of Angna Enters from 1928 to 1960.         Her range of subjects was wide, from sharply specific satires on politics and the arts to portraits of ordinary young women. ''To my way of thinking, the greatest quality about Angna Enters is her unfetteredness,'' the dance critic Walter Terry wrote in 1946. In her 1926 ''Moyen Age,'' one of her best-known pieces, Miss Enters seemed to have stepped out of a medieval painting as she enacted a woman's reactions to stories of events in the life of Christ, in a series of fluid poses to music by Frescobaldi. Also an Artist and Sculptor         Miss Enters was also a well-known artist and sculptor who held her first New York exhibition in 1933. She designed and executed all the costumes and props for her performances, and illustrated several of the books she wrote on her life and her work. She also composed scores for some of her pieces.         Miss Enters was born in New York City of an Austrian father and French mother, and spent her childhood in Milwaukee and traveling through Europe. She returned to New York in 1922 to enroll at the Art Students' League, where she studied with John Sloan while doing lettering in an advertising agency during the daytime.         Miss Enters had studied ballet in Milwaukee as she had studied piano, she once said, ''to become 'accomplished.' '' Her adult interest in dance began with a concern for the visual representation of movement. First Dance Work in 1923         She enrolled in dance classes taught by Michio Ito in 1922, and performed as his partner in a series of recitals in 1923. That year she created her first piece, ''Ecclesiastique,'' an evocation of a statue of a Gothic Virgin, which she performed in a Broadway revue organized by Ito. The piece later became ''Moyen Age.'' She presented her first solo program in 1924 at the Greenwich Village Theater with a borrowed $25 as her operating budget.         Her reputation grew rapidly over the next two years, and Miss Enters made her London debut in 1928, performing for the first time in Paris the following year.         Miss Enters wrote three volumes of autobiography - ''First Person Plural,'' ''Silly Girl'' and ''Artist's Life'' - a novel, ''Among the Daughters'' (1956), and a book about her work, ''On Mime,'' published in 1966. Her plays, ''Love Possessed Juana: A Play of the Inquisition in Spain'' and ''The Unknown Lover,'' were presented by the Houston Little Theater in 1946 and 1947. A University Lecturer         A noted master teacher, Miss Enters lectured at universities throughout the country. In the early 1960's, she was an artist in residence at the Dallas Theater Center and Baylor University and a fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University.         Miss Enters retired from performing in 1960, and had been in nursing homes since 1976. There are no survivors.       
        Esther Morgenstern Gilman, a painter, illustrator and set designer, died of cancer Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 63 years old.         Esther Morgenstern Gilman, a painter, illustrator and set designer, died of cancer Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 63 years old.         Mrs. Gilman's exhibitions here and abroad included a recent retrospective in her native Cleveland. Her prizes include the Robert Boardman award of the Painters and Sculptors Society of New Jersey, the American Institute of Graphic Arts Exhibition award and the Outstanding Children's Book Illustration award for ''Little Girl and Her Mother'' by Beatrice Schenk de Regnier.         Mrs. Gilman was an editorial board member of the Femninist Press and a consultant for the Open Theater. She created sets for productions at Cafe Cino, Writer's Stage, Van Dam Playhouse, Judson Memorial Church, Theater Genesis and La Mama.         Mrs. Gilman's marriage to Richard Gilman, a drama critic, ended in divorce. She is survived by her son, Nicholas Alexander Gilman.         A memorial service will be held at 4 P.M. today at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.       
        Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Steloff founded the Gotham Book Mart in 1920 and, over the years, turned it into an international literary haven. It is still thriving at 41 West 47th Street in Manhattan, an anachronism in a time of failing independent bookstores.         Soon after the store opened, it attracted authors, dramatists, poets and artists. Among those who came to chat, to browse and to see if their books and plays were on the shelves were Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos, H. L. Mencken and Eugene O'Neill. Her customers included George and Ira Gershwin, Ina Claire and Charlie Chaplin, and, more recently, Alexander Calder, Stephen Spender, Woody Allen, Saul Bellow, John Guare and Garson Kanin.         She championed the experimental and challenged the censors. Her courage in purchasing shipments of the banned ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' directly from D. H. Lawrence in Italy in the late 1920's and in ordering smuggled copies of ''Tropic of Cancer'' from Henry Miller in Paris during the 1930's led to lawsuits and landmark decisions on censorship.         Although Miss Steloff sold the Gotham in 1967 to Andreas Brown, another book lover, she continued to live in an apartment on the third floor, above the store, and remained as a working consultant. She ignored her age and her semiretirement, descending every afternoon to sit at a desk in her own corner, occasionally jumping up to press books on browsers, and then to direct them to the cash register. Browsers Welcome         Essentially a person of no literary pretensions, Miss Steloff made her bookstore a place cherished as the habitat for the new and the avant-garde in literature, where small magazines and forgotten books of poetry, out-of-print books on belles-lettres and works on film and the theater could be found in an atmosphere congenial to browsers.         Under her guidance the Gotham became a meeting place for the literati and a bibliophile's paradise. The number of well-known writers, dancers, artists and theater people who were her customers, clients and friends made up an encyclopedia of 20th-century culture. At her 100th birthday celebration, on Dec. 31, 1987, greetings arrived from all over the world.         Miss Steloff was one of the founders of the James Joyce Society, which still meets at the Gotham, although she never met the author. ''Sylvia Beach took care of his book wants at Shakespeare & Company in Paris,'' she said. ''But sometimes Joyce ordered books from the Gotham directly by mail - including during the last year of his life.''         After working in several bookstores, she opened her own on West 45th Street in 1920. The store moved twice to larger quarters. ''It was a struggle at the beginning,'' she recalled. ''There were some days during the Depression when we didn't sell a single book.'' An Interest in the Mystical         ''I am not the great brilliant person to decide about how good a book is,'' she said once. ''I judge books by my customers who buy them and spark others to read them.'' She was greatly interested in Oriental teachings, mystical experiences and philosophers not connected with established Western churches. Books in these fields were represented in her corner of the store.         Along with its fame and reputation, the Gotham was also a very carefully operated book business. As the owner and the person who paid the salaries, Miss Steloff was demanding, irascible, unwearying and unable to understand why no one else was willing to put as many hours or as much concentration into the store as she did.         Miss Steloff recalled some of the clerks who had worked for the Gotham over the years. ''There was Allen Ginsberg and LeRoi Jones and many poets in their youth,'' she said. ''Tennessee Williams lasted less than a day - he couldn't get here on time in the morning and, also, he wasn't very good at wrapping packages.'' Sold Flowers in Hotels         Ida Frances Steloff was born Dec. 31, 1887, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a town full of gaiety in the summer and a bleak, wintry place for the rest of the year, especially for the poor. The Steloffs, who lived year round in Saratoga Springs, were among the very poor. When Miss Stefloff was little, she sold flowers on the verandas of the big hotels. The early death of her mother increased her misery, especially when her stepmother expressed her frustrations with poverty in the harshness she showed the children.         At 12, Miss Steloff was taken in by a couple who offered her a home. But she soon found herself a menial in the household and was forced to drop out of the seventh grade - her last formal schooling. Once in desperation she ran away to New York City. It was not until she was 19 that she made a final move to New York. She landed a job at Loeser's, a Brooklyn department store, working in ''corsets.'' But during the Christmas rush, she was transferred to the books department.         It was like giving a copy of Euclid to Isaac Newton: She had found herself and a way of life.         For the next 12 years she worked in various bookstores: Schulte, Brentano and McDevitt-Wilson, where she developed what one friend called ''an instinctive taste for the best in modern literature,'' a taste that she was willing to gamble on when she had her own shop. She never referred to Gotham as a store; it was always a ''shop.''         Her stature concealed her stamina. She ran the place, but she also opened the correspondence, wrapped and mailed packages, climbed up and down ladders and argued with publishers. Bookstore people were continually helping her down from ladders in her 80's. ''She feels,'' Mr. Brown said, ''as if she still has to stock the store.'' A Doctorate From Skidmore         Miss Steloff was awarded a prize by the National Institute of Arts and Letters for distinguished service to the arts, was listed in Who's Who in the Theater and received an honorary doctorate from Skidmore College - an award that stood in sharp contrast to one of her remarks:         ''I used to feel bitter and cheated about not having a formal education. But why should I? How could I, no matter what my education, ever have had the wonderful chance to have Thornton Wilder and other people talk to me personally, and right here in my shop! As if they were in their classrooms! I couldn't ask for anything more.''         A battle to save the bookstore ended last February, when Mr. Brown bought the building that houses the store from the American Friends of the Hebrew University Foundation. With the $1 million proceeds, the foundation has established a scholarship at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in the name of Miss Steloff's parents.         It was quiet yesterday at the cozy bookstore, with a sprinkling of students and literary buffs brousing through the volumes. In the hall on the second floor hung oversized photographs of Miss Steloff - with Dylan Thomas in 1952, Anais Nin in 1966, Jean Cocteau in 1948, Salvador Dali in 1963, Marianne Moore in 1967. Memorial Service Is Planned         Although funeral arrangements were not yet complete, Mr. Brown said yesterday that Miss Steloff would be buried Monday in the family plot in the Jewish Cemetery at Saratoga Springs.         The Gotham will be closed on that day in her memory. Mr. Brown said he would post a sign and pictures of Miss Steloff in the bookstore window. A memorial service is to be held in three or four weeks, he said.         On May 11, Miss Steloff was to have been presented Brandeis University's Notable Achievement Award.         Miss Steloff was married to David Moss in 1923. They were divorced in 1930 and had no children.         Surviving are a half sister, Belle Sidoroff, of Wilmington, Del., and a half brother, Al Steloff, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

She was 68 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Marion Irene Guilfoyle, a lawyer who was a leader in Irish-American and Roman Catholic affairs in New York City, died of complications from a lung disease Wednesday at Union Hospital in the Bronx. She was 68 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Miss Guilfoyle worked in the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan and in the National Bureau of Casualty Underwriters, as a law assistant to Federal District Judge Mary H. Donlon and, from 1977 until her retirement in 1980, as a staff lawyer at the United States Court of International Trade.         She was president of the New York County Board and the New York State Board of the Ladies Ancient Order of Hibernians. Miss Guilfoyle was active with the Hibernians for more than 40 years.         In 1974, Miss Guilfoyle was the first woman to become president of the Guild of Catholic Lawyers of the New York Archdiocese. In 1979, the Catholic Church named her a Lady Commander with Star, Order of the Holy Sepulchre.         Miss Guilfoyle was born on Staten Island. She was an alumna of Hunter College and the Fordham University Law School.         Surviving is her mother, Ermina, of the Bronx.       
        Norma Klein, an author of more than 30 novels for teen-agers and adults, died Tuesday after a brief illness at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 50 years old.         Norma Klein, an author of more than 30 novels for teen-agers and adults, died Tuesday after a brief illness at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 50 years old.         Ms. Klein was best known for young-adult works that dealt with family problems, childhood and adolescent sexuality, as well as social issues like racism, sexism and contraception. Her first novel, ''Mom, the Wolf Man and Me'' (1972), was about the daughter of an unmarried, sexually active woman. Ms. Klein's subsequent works, which were published by Alfred A. Knopf, Viking, Fawcett, Dutton, Dial and Bantam, included ''Taking Sides,'' ''What It's All About,'' ''Angel Face'' and ''Going Backwards.'' She frequently published two or three books a year, and most were very successful, according to Frances Foster, her editor at Knopf.         Because of their subject matter, many of Ms. Klein's books sparked considerable controversy, and a 1986 American Library Association survey found that nine of her novels had been removed from libraries. In a 1986 interview with The New York Times, Ms. Klein said: ''I'm not a rebel, trying to stir things up just to be provocative. I'm doing it because I feel like writing about real life.''         Ms. Klein's adult fiction focused on contemporary couples and families, and her novels included ''American Dreams'' and ''The World As It Is.'' She also published about 60 short stories, taught fiction at Yale and Wesleyan Universities, and was a board member of PEN.         Ms. Klein is survived by her husband, Erwin Fleissner; two daughters, Jennifer and Katherine; her brother, Victor; and her mother, Sadie, all of Manhattan.

I usually lost.''         Among friends and colleagues she was known for her personal style, a hawklike eye for detail and a habit of rarely going anywhere without her tape measure. A devoted collector and preservationist, she renovated a 1924 worker's cottage and an early 19th-century barn that had been a dance hall.

Karen Ulane, a Vietnam War combat pilot who was discharged by Eastern Airlines after a sex-change operation in 1980, was killed Monday in the crash of a charter plane. She was 48 years old and lived in Aurora.         Ms. Ulane, known until her surgery as Kenneth Ulane, died in the crash of a twin-propeller DC-3 owned by an air taxi and cargo service in a field near here. Two others aboard were also killed.         Ms. Ulane had the sex-change operation in 1980 after 12 years with Eastern. The airline dismissed her, citing possible safety hazards in stressful situations.         In 1983 Federal District Judge John F. Grady ordered reinstatement and $158,590 in back pay and other expenses, saying the 1964 Federal anti-discrimination law protects transsexuals. An appeals court disagreed and reversed the decision.         Ms. Ulane eventually received a settlement from Eastern that was ''substantially more'' than the amount ordered by Judge Grady, said her attorney, Dean Dickie.         Kenneth Ulane flew combat missions in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968.         Survivors include her mother and a son from a marriage while she was Kenneth Ulane.

        Fran Allison, the warm-voiced human component of the popular television show ''Kukla, Fran and Ollie,'' died of bone marrow failure at the Sherman Oaks (Calif.) Community Hospital yesterday. She was 81 years old and lived in Van Nuys, Calif.         Fran Allison, the warm-voiced human component of the popular television show ''Kukla, Fran and Ollie,'' died of bone marrow failure at the Sherman Oaks (Calif.) Community Hospital yesterday. She was 81 years old and lived in Van Nuys, Calif.         To a generation of children in the late 1940's and the 50's, Miss Allison was the girlfriend, mother and gentle conscience of the Kuklapolitan Players, the puppet troupe created by Burr Tillstrom. Thanks to Tillstrom and Miss Allison, who treated the puppets like people, their exploits and personalities made them family favorites on prime-time television for 10 years.         ''I adored Kukla and Ollie - they were never anything but real to me,'' Miss Allison said in an interview.  Joining the Kuklapolitans She was born in La Porte City, Iowa, and after graduating from Coe College became a teacher. Later, she auditioned as a singer on a local radio station. By 1937, she was a popular radio personality in Chicago.         In 1947, she joined the Kuklapolitan Players, and they made their television debut the following year. ''I needed a girl who could talk to a dragon,'' Tillstrom explained.         By 1950, the show had six million viewers. As Fran, Miss Allison seemed particularly fond of Ollie, an outrageous, single-toothed dragon who adored buttered popcorn and putting his hair in curlers. Kukla loved to lean on Ollie's head, messing his hair. Fran was the soothing character.         In those years, television was performed live and Miss Allison once admitted she never knew in advance exactly what the puppets would say. ''On the air, you say exactly the same thing you would say if it happened for the first time, off the air,'' she said in an interview. A Baritone Dragon         In the early 1950's, Miss Allison made her Town Hall debut, assisting Ollie, whose full name was Oliver J. Dragon, in his first Manhattan performance as a baritone.         ''It may be ironic,'' The New York Times observed in 1952, ''but Kukla and Ollie still seem so real that it's always a little disturbing when Burr Tillstrom steps into view.''         When the program went off the air, it left a group of sad adults and children. ''One of the most imaginative shows ever developed in the electronic medium,'' wrote the Times critic. The program reappeared briefly in the 1970's. Burr Tillstrom died in 1985 at the age of 68.         In the 1960's, Miss Allison was host of a show of films for children and appeared in musicals on television. In Los Angeles, she was host of a program for the elderly, ''Prime Time,'' on KHJ-TV.         Miss Allison is survived by her brother, Lynn, of Chicago.

        Jan DeGaetani, an American mezzo-soprano who became a champion of avant-garde music, died of leukemia Friday night in Genesee Hospital in Rochester. She was 56 years old and a resident of Rochester.         Jan DeGaetani, an American mezzo-soprano who became a champion of avant-garde music, died of leukemia Friday night in Genesee Hospital in Rochester. She was 56 years old and a resident of Rochester.         Miss DeGaetani developed into one of the most respected singers and musicians on the international scene, and in the opinion of many critics, the finest song recitalist that the United States has ever produced. Her creamy voice was wide in range, perfectly placed and produced, always on pitch and handled with consummate artistry.         Miss DeGaetani, who sang everything but opera, had one of the largest repertories of any singer before the public. It ranged from Renaissance music to Cole Porter. It encompassed the world of German lieder and French chanson. She was as much at home with a Beethoven mass as with a Berlioz song cycle with orchestra. She sang Stephen Foster songs and Victorian ballads.         She was called the Queen of the Avant-Garde by some critics. She sang in many languages as though each were her native tongue. Her concert tours took her all over the world, and she sang with virtually every major orchestra and conductor in such works as Bach's B-minor Mass, Beethoven's Mass in C and Ravel's ''L'Enfant et les Sortileges.''         She was exceptionally well known as a specialist in contemporary music. Many composers, and many specialists, considered that to be the most important part of her work. Jobs as Secretary and Waitress         At the Juilliard School she developed an interest in contemporary music. Immediately after graduation, she joined the Gramercy Chamber Ensemble and the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble. She took many jobs to keep going, including secretarial work, waiting on tables, baby-sitting and occasional television commercials.         The turning point in her musical life came after her graduation in 1955, when in addition to her other work she devoted an entire year to learning Arnold Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' a seminal work composed in 1912.         Studying ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' she once said, ''opened my mind to endless kinds of beauty, and music hasn't been the same to me since.'' She eagerly sought out other music of the avant-garde, and established a special relationship with many composers.         George Crumb wrote his ''Ancient Voices of Children'' for her. Jacob Druckman, Peter Maxwell Davies, Gyorgy Ligeti and Pierre Boulez all wrote music with her voice in mind, often dedicating the scores to her. She sang the world premieres of many of their compositions. Other composers with whom she was closely associated were Elliott Carter, William Schuman, Richard Wernick and Mario Davidovsky. Her interest in new music made her a hero to the avant-garde, and she soon became a cult figure.         From the beginning, Miss DeGaetani used the same accompanist, Gilbert Kalish, and an unusual rapport developed between them. Critics noted that they thought alike and breathed alike. Miss DeGaetani said their concerts were ''joint recitals, mutual in every respect.'' The Ultimate Gift         She had, in addition to her other natural attributes, the ultimate gift of the song recitalist - the ability to make every member of the audience feel as though she was singing for that person and that person alone.         Donal Henahan of The New York Times wrote after a 1981 concert that Miss DeGaetani had the ability ''to do with apparent ease what most singers find impossible to do at all, which is to sing straight into the listening heart and mind.''         Despite the wide-ranging variety in her programs and the musical difficulties that many posed, she was anything but a dry or intellectual singer. She believed, as she told an interviewer a few years ago, that intuition was at the very least as important as intellect. ''You must use your most opulent, raw, gut intuition,'' she said. ''You don't take that out of yourself when you use your intellect.''         Miss DeGaetani was born in Massillon, Ohio, on July 10, 1933, sang in the church choir there and later said she knew then that she was going to be a singer. Her father, Earl D. Reutz, a lawyer, encouraged his talented daughter, whose given name was Janice. After her marriage to the conductor Thomas DeGaetani, she sang under the name Jan DeGaetani. Taught at Eastman and Aspen         For many years Miss DeGaetani taught at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and at the summer festival in Aspen, Colo. Among her pupils were Lucy Shelton, William Sharp, Amy Kaiser and Milagro Vargas.         Miss DeGaetani made more than 35 recordings. They were typical of her repertory, ranging from Renaissance music to music of the current decade. Among her most famous disks are Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' music by Ravel, George Crumb's ''Ancient Voices of Children,'' a Stephen Foster disk and a recent one named ''Songs of America,'' which received rave reviews.         She made her last record last March while fatally ill. The recording contains 10 Mahler songs and the Berlioz ''Nuits d'Ete.'' It will be released in the fall by Bridge Records.         Her marriage to Mr. DeGaetani ended in divorce in 1966. In 1969 she married the oboist Philip West, also a teacher at Eastman. Mr. West has participated in many of his wife's recitals.         Surviving are her husband; the two children of her first marriage, Mark West of Rochester and Francesca Watson of the Philippines ; her mother, Eleanor Ruetz of Portland, Ore., and a sister, Vera McKenna of Portland.         There will be a private service and a memorial this week at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester.       
        Olga Erteszek, designer and founder of the Olga Company, which makes women's underwear and sleepwear, died of cancer Friday at her home in Brentwood, Calif. She was 73 years old.         Olga Erteszek, designer and founder of the Olga Company, which makes women's underwear and sleepwear, died of cancer Friday at her home in Brentwood, Calif. She was 73 years old.         Olga, as she was known professionally, is credited with several design innovations, including the seamless bra and the nightgown with a built-in bra. The nightgown evolved from a hospital stay for a slipped disk, she explained in an interview in The New York Times in 1966. She tested it during her convalescence, found it satisfactory and made it part of her line. It was an immediate success. ''This is comfort, security,'' she said at the time. ''This is hospital tested. I know.''         Her face as well as her name became familiar in a series of advertisements carrying her photograph and the slogan ''Behind every Olga there really is an Olga.'' A Rented Sewing Machine         The designer had immigrated to California from her native Krakow, Poland, in 1941 with her husband, Jan Erteszek, a lawyer. Shortly after arriving, they started a business with $10 and a rented sewing machine. Their first product was a lacy garter belt she had learned to make from her mother. Bullocks-Wilshire bought all the samples and the young couple were in business.         With Olga designing and her husband directing the business, the Olga Company reached a volume of $67 million when it was sold to Warnaco in 1984. Headquarters have remained in California. A daughter, Christina Johnson, is now design director of a line of lingerie for Warnaco called Olga's Christina, which is aimed at a younger, sports-oriented customer.         In addition to winning many industry awards, Olga and her husband were honored for their community and humanitarian work. In 1985, they received the California Industrialist of the Year Award for lifetime achievement. Mr. Erteszak died in 1986.         In addition to Christina Johnson, Olga is survived by two other daughters, Victoria Foote of New York City, and Mary Rudolph of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 2 P.M. tomorrow at the Church of the Recessional, Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, Calif.       
        Dr. Mary Ann Paduano, professor of nursing at the Lienhard School of Nursing at Pace University, died Sunday after a long illness at Rosary Hill Home in Hawthorne, N.Y. She was 43 years old and lived in White Plains.         Dr. Mary Ann Paduano, professor of nursing at the Lienhard School of Nursing at Pace University, died Sunday after a long illness at Rosary Hill Home in Hawthorne, N.Y. She was 43 years old and lived in White Plains.         Dr. Paduano joined the Lienhard school on Pace's Manhattan campus in 1971. She was appointed professor of nursing in 1982.         She was a graduate of Teachers College of Columbia University, where she earned a master's degree and a doctorate, both in education. She was a lieutenant colonel in the Army Nurse Corps Reserve and had been attached to the 74th Field Hospital, an Army Reserve unit in the Bronx.         She is survived by her husband, David Farrell; her mother, Susan Paduano of Queens, and two sisters, Susan DeLuca of Bethpage, L.I., and Teresa Gentile of Queens.       
        Bette Davis, who won two Academy Awards and cut a swath through Hollywood trailing cigarette smoke and delivering drop-dead barbs, died of breast cancer Friday night at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She was 81 years old and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.         Bette Davis, who won two Academy Awards and cut a swath through Hollywood trailing cigarette smoke and delivering drop-dead barbs, died of breast cancer Friday night at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She was 81 years old and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.         Miss Davis was en route to her home from the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain, where she had been honored for her acting career. She arrived in Paris on Tuesday and was to fly to Los Angeles, but was taken instead to the hospital, on the outskirts of Paris.         Her lawyer, Harold Schiff, said she had undergone a mastectomy in 1983.         ''The doctors had told us the cancer had spread, that it was terminal,'' he said. ''The doctors had said let her go on going about her business.'' #2 Oscars, 10 Nominations For more than a half century, Bette Davis reigned as a Hollywood star in the grandest meaning of the term. With her huge and expressive eyes, her flamboyant mannerisms and her distinctive speaking style, she left an indelible mark on her audiences in a wide variety of roles.         Nominated for 10 Oscars, Miss Davis was a perfectionist whose tempestuous battles for good scripts and the best production craftsmen for her films wreaked havoc in Hollywood executive suites.         ''I was a legendary terror,'' she once recalled. ''I was insufferably rude and ill-mannered in the cultivation of my career. I had no time for pleasantries. I said what was on my mind, and it wasn't always printable. I have been uncompromising, peppery, intractable, monomaniacal, tactless, volatile, and ofttimes disagreeable. I suppose I'm larger than life.''         She was indeed. Few in the entertainment industry could deny that Bette Davis possessed all the legendary indestructibility of the New England Yankee that she was. Starting as a stage actress, she won spectacular fame as a screen star and, as she grew old, shifted effortlessly to high-paying television roles.         Miss Davis's two Oscars for best performance by an actress were won in 1935, for ''Dangerous,'' and in 1938, for ''Jezebel.'' But perhaps she is best recalled for her tour de force as Margo Channing, the tough-talking but soft-hearted stage actress in ''All About Eve,'' for which she was nominated for an Academy Award.         She made almost 100 films. Her 10 nominations for Oscars are the most any actress has received. And she received many other honors, including the Life Achievement Award of the American Film Institute and the Cesar Award of the French film industry. In 1987 she received the Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievements in the performing arts.         The Kennedy Honors coincided with the release of ''The Whales of August,'' a film in which Miss Davis co-starred with Lillian Gish and for which she won wide critical praise. She appeared in that movie and in television and film roles despite having had a mastectomy and a series of strokes while hospitalized in 1983. ''It was my terror that I'd never work again,'' she said afterwards, ''for I have always very much loved to work.''         Last April 24, Miss Davis was honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center at its annual tribute, joining the company of such previous honorees as Sir Laurence Olivier and Charlie Chaplin. ''An honor I'm delighted to get,'' she said at the time. ''Greedy, greedy. Can't have too many awards. I've gotten just about every award there is.''  Enduring Popularity  'Acting Should Be Larger Than Life'         Although Miss Davis reached the apex of her popularity in films between the mid-1930's and the early 50's, her appeal swept across generations, due largely to her frequent appearances in made-for-television films and the repeated showings of her old, now-classic movies on television.         These classics include ''Of Human Bondage,'' ''Dark Victory,'' ''The Corn Is Green,'' ''The Letter,'' ''The Great Lie,'' ''A Stolen Life,'' ''Now, Voyager,'' ''Mr. Skeffington,'' ''The Little Foxes,'' ''The Petrified Forest'' and ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?''         New generations of entertainers, many of them female impersonators, have found her distinct mannerisms and clipped speech irresistible material for their acts.         ''Oh Petah, Petah, Petah,'' such an impersonator will say, rolling exaggeratedly widened eyes and puffing savagely on a cigarette. ''What a dump!'' And, inevitably, the memorable line that Margo Channing utters as she walks drunkenly up the stairs at her party: ''Fasten your seat belts; it's going to be a bumpy night.''         ''You know, I've learned from the imitators,'' Miss Davis said in an interview this year. ''I really have. I was never conscious I moved my elbow like that'' - she moved it from side to side - ''until I saw someone doing me.''         She was always proud of her approach to acting. ''Natural!'' she said. ''That isn't the point of acting. The public must believe us. They must also be somehow ennobled. Did I ever try to be low-key? Never, never, never! I fought that from the beginning. I think that acting should be larger than life.''  At First, Simply 'Betty'  A Broken Home And School Away         Born Ruth Elizabeth Davis in Lowell, Mass., on April 5, 1908, Miss Davis came from a firmly rooted Yankee background. Her mother was the former Ruth Favor; her father, Harlow Morrell Davis, a Harvard Law School graduate who became a Government patent attorney.         Her father divorced her mother when Miss Davis was 7 and her sister, Barbara, was 5, leaving her mother to rear the children alone. In later years Miss Davis said many times that she saw the divorce as her father's abandonment of his family, and that it left her barren of love for him and preternaturally devoted to her doting mother.         Mrs. Davis put the girls in boarding school in Massachusetts and moved to New York. In 1917, she was joined by her daughters.         It was at about that time that ''Betty'' Davis took the more exotic-sounding name that would become world-famed. A friend of her mother's who was reading Balzac's ''La Cousine Bette'' suggested the name-spelling change, telling her that it would ''set you apart, my dear.''         In her teens, Miss Davis returned to New England, living in several towns there while her mother worked as a portrait photographer. She waited on tables at her schools, and once, to help with family expenses, posed nude for a woman making a sculpture.         Miss Davis decided in her teens that she wanted to become an actress, and her mother took her to New York in 1928, where she arranged for her to read for Eva Le Gallienne, whose Civic Repertory Theater was then one of the most popular touring companies.         ''Miss Le Gallienne thought I was not serious enough in my approach to warrant my attendance at her school,'' Miss Davis recalled years later.  Breaking Into the Business  Stage Experience, Looks and a Voice         Miss Davis's first professional acting job was with a winter stock company in Rochester, run by the director George Cukor, who dismissed her after a few months. She made her New York acting debut in 1929, at the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village, in Virgil Geddes's ''The Earth Between.'' Brooks Atkinson, critic for The New York Times, wrote that she was ''an entrancing creature.''         Successes and disappointments were to come in rapid order after that. The young actress, then only 21 years old, was in her first Broadway hit, ''Broken Dishes,'' quickly followed by ''Solid South,'' in which she played the beguilingly named Alabama Follensby, the first of many Southern-belle roles that were to come her way.         The movies had learned to talk only a few years earlier, and Hollywood was greedily spiriting away Broadway actors and actresses who had good speaking voices as well as looks. It was thus perhaps inevitable that a fresh young actress with some training and experience and a couple of good notices would be asked to take a screen test.         She was given a $300-a-week contract by Universal Pictures, and Miss Davis and her mother went to Los Angeles in 1930. Her first movie role was in ''Bad Sister,'' notable only for the fact that it also introduced Humphrey Bogart to films. But the movie's cinematographer, Karl Freund, passed the word to studio bosses that ''Davis has lovely eyes,'' and just as she was to be dropped, her option was picked up for another 13 weeks.         By the end of 1932, Miss Davis, discouraged after having appeared in six lackluster movies and finally without a contract, prepared to return with her mother to New York. Then she got a call from George Arliss, the highly respected English actor, who was to be her mentor until his death.         He hired Miss Davis as his leading lady in ''The Man Who Played God,'' her breakthrough movie role.         The film was a success, and its producer, Warner Brothers, signed Miss Davis to her first contract. It was the start of a love-hate relationship with the studio that was characterized by Miss Davis's frequent storming off sets, being suspended for refusing to act in what she considered inferior movies, and going to court to sever her ties with Warners.         But in her first three years at Warners Miss Davis made 14 films, including Edna Ferber's ''So Big,'' with Barbara Stanwyck starring, and ''20,000 Years in Sing Sing,'' which was, she was to say, ''my only film with the great Spencer Tracy, to my everlasting regret.''         ''He was the finest actor I ever worked with,'' she said.  Getting Parts, and Noticed  Unafraid to Play The Villainess         She was working hard, in mostly forgettable fare, but Miss Davis was also learning the movie craft and earning the respect of technicians.         From the start Miss Davis, unlike leading ladies of the day, had no qualms about playing unsympathetic roles, and so was overjoyed in 1934 when she was lent by Warners to the rival RKO studios to play the cruel and slatternly waitress Mildred in W. Somerset Maughham's ''Of Human Bondage,'' opposite Leslie Howard as the crippled hero Philip.         ''Every actor who becomes a star is usually remembered for one or two roles,'' she said, ''like Judy Garland in 'The Wizard of Oz', Garbo in 'Camille,' Brando in 'A Streetcar Named Desire.' Mildred in 'Of Human Bondage' was such a role for me. She was the first leading-lady villainess ever played on a screen for real.''         ''It's odd that people remember me best for my evil roles,'' she said, ''since I played so many other kinds of characters. But villains always have the best-written parts.''         She was widely praised for her performance as Mildred and nominated for an Academy Award, but she failed to win one, mostly, she said, because Warner Brothers did not want to promote an Oscar for a film it did not produce. She came to regard the Oscar that she won the next year, for ''Dangerous,'' as ''a consolation prize.''         She was always proud of her two Oscars, though, and said this year: ''I'm not a bit modest about them. I don't use those boys for door stops.''         Warners was treating her with new respect, giving her movies like ''The Petrified Forest,'' with Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart, but Miss Davis harbored a festering resentment against what she called ''the contract slave system'' at the studio.         Deciding in 1936 to defy the strictures of her contract, Miss Davis agreed with an English company to go to London to make two movies. Years later she was to ruefully confess that before she left, Jack L. Warner, the studio head, offered her a chance ''to play one of the great screen roles of all time, but I didn't know it.''         '' 'Please don't leave. I just bought a wonderful book for you,' '' she quoted Mr. Warner as saying. ''And I said, 'I'll bet it's a pip!' and walked out of his office.'' She learned later that the role she turned down was Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.'' Mr. Warner later gave up his option on it.  The Glorious Years  Memorable Roles, One After Another         In England, Miss Davis was sued by Warner Brothers, which succeeded in preventing her from working for another producer while under contract to Warners. But once she had returned to the United States, Warners gave her a new contract calling for fewer pictures at a much higher salary.         They also gave her excellent, high-budget pictures, like ''Jezebel,'' for which she won her second Oscar in 1938. In a single year, 1939, Warners released no fewer than four blockbuster Davis movies: ''Dark Victory,'' ''Juarez,'' ''The Old Maid'' and ''The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex,''         ''Jezebel'' began her halcyon years, she said, and ''in 1939 I secured my career and my stardom forever; I made five pictures in 12 months, and every one of them made money.''         The memorable Davis roles continued in swift order: The murderous and unfaithful planter's wife in Maugham's ''The Letter'' in 1940, quickly followed the next year by ''The Great Lie'' and ''The Little Foxes,'' in which she played the scheming Regina Giddens. In 1942 she scored again in ''Now, Voyager,'' as Charlotte Vale, a frumpish spinster who blossoms into a confident beauty and finds true love with Paul Henreid. The film is remembered by movie buffs for the scenes in which Mr. Henreid lights two cigarettes at once and gives one to Miss Davis.         There were other triumphs in the 1940's - ''The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' ''Watch on the Rhine,'' ''Mr. Skeffington,'' ''The Corn Is Green'' and ''A Stolen Life.'' But Miss Davis's luck began to run out with critical and box-office disasters like ''Winter Meeting'' and ''Deception,'' and in 1949 Warner Brothers, after 19 years, released her from her contract while she was making the ludicrous melodrama ''Beyond the Forest.'' In it a by-then plumpish Miss Davis uttered one of her most famous ''camp'' lines, so often used by her mimics, ''What a dump!''  Anguish and Acclaim  Role of a Lifetime In 'All About Eve'         With the end of the Warners era, Miss Davis's third marriage, to William Grant Sherry, an artist by whom she had a daughter, Barbara Davis Sherry, was also ending. She won custody of her daughter.         Miss Davis had previously been married to Harmon Oscar Nelson Jr., a band leader, and she said in 1982 that on his insistence she had two abortions. ''That's what he wanted,'' she said. ''Being the dutiful wife, that's what I did.'' The marriage ended in divorce.         But for decades afterward, Miss Davis publicly battled with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, insisting that she had bestowed her first husband's middle name on the Oscar. ''The Academy has fought stoically to claim that they named the Oscar,'' she said. ''But of course I did. I named it after the rear end of my husband. Why? Because that's what it looked like.''         Miss Davis's second husband, Arthur Farnsworth, a businessman, died of head injuries suffered in a fall in 1943.         Miss Davis was filming ''Payment on Demand'' in 1949 - it was not released until 1951 - when she was offered a role of a lifetime in what she was to call ''that charmed movie, 'All About Eve.' '' She was a last-minute replacement for Claudette Colbert, for whom the director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, had written the role of Margo Channing, the fading Broadway star. Miss Colbert was unable to begin the film on schedule because she ''hurt her back, thank God,'' as Miss Davis liked to recall it.         ''When I finished reading 'All About Eve' I was on Cloud Nine,'' said the actress. ''That night Joe Mankiewicz told me Margo Channing was the kind of dame who would treat her mink coat like a poncho.''         She played Margo that way, and brilliantly, and with the aid of a witty, literate script, sharp direction by Mr. Mankiewicz, and a sparkling cast that included Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, George Sanders, Marilyn Monroe (in a supporting role), and Thelma Ritter, the movie became one of the all-time great Hollywood films.         During the filming of ''All About Eve,'' Miss Davis became romantically involved with her leading man, Gary Merrill, and they were married in 1950. Soon afterward they adopted two children, Margot and Michael.  The 'Darkest Decade'  A Broadway Flop, A Retreat to Maine         Miss Davis received another Oscar nomination for ''The Star,'' released in 1953, but the film was unsuccessful. She was by then 45 and younger actresses were being offered the parts that would have once been hers. She accepted an offer to return to Broadway in a revue, ''Two's Company.''         When the show opened in New York in December 1952, Miss Davis recalled years later, ''The ovation was, to say the least, heartwarming, the reviews were bloodcurdling.'' The revue closed after 90 performances.         Miss Davis and Mr. Merrill took an option to buy a home in Maine and, she said with wry amusement, ''We called our house Witch Way because we didn't know which way we were going and a witch lived there. Guess who?''         ''For three years I was solely a wife and mother and Gary fell out of love with me,'' Miss Davis was to say years later. During that period it also became apparent that the Merrills' adopted daughter, Margot, was retarded, and at the age of 3 she had to be put in a special school. Margot has since lived in homes for the retarded.         During what she was to call her ''darkest decade,'' the 1950's, while the the Merrills' marriage continued to disintegrate, Miss Davis again played Elizabeth I in ''The Virgin Queen'' and a year later, in 1956, appeared in Paddy Chayefsky's ''A Catered Affair'' as Ma Hurley, a Bronx housewife, which she sometimes said was her favorite role. The Merrills also traveled cross-country doing one-night stands in ''The World of Carl Sandburg'' until 1960, when they were divorced.  Friends and Enemies  Fonda, Crawford, Cagney and Flynn         Having settled into character acting, Miss Davis in 1961 scored a success as the gin-soaked ''bag lady'' Apple Annie in ''Pocketful of Miracles.'' That same year she was praised for her performance on Broadway in Tennessee Wiliams's ''The Night of the Iguana,'' which she left in April 1962 to film ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'' a box-office winner that earned her yet another Accademy Award nomination for best actress of the year.         The horror movie, in which Miss Davis wore pasty white makeup and padded herself to appear overweight, revolved around two show-business has-been sisters living in creepy seclusion in a Hollywood mansion. The role of the loony Baby Jane Hansen, addled into thinking she was going to make a comeback in vaudeville, gave Miss Davis a chance to pull out all the acting stops, and she did so with relish. The other, wheelchair-bound, sister was played by Joan Crawford.         The casting of Miss Davis and Miss Crawford in ''Baby Jane'' resuscitated longstanding rumors that they had feuded when both were Warners stars. In 1982 Miss Davis told an interviewer, ''I never feuded with Joan Crawford. During 'Baby Jane' the whole world hoped we would fight but we did not. We were both pros.'' In any event, Miss Davis was not reticent about revealing her rancor against other performers. She accused Miriam Hopkins, with whom she co-starred in ''The Old Maid'' and ''Old Acquaintance,'' of upstaging her and scene-stealing. She also disliked Errol Flynn, her co-star in ''Elizabeth and Essex,'' calling him ''unprofessional.''         Intense as her rivalries were, her friendships were deep and long lasting, particularly for Claude Rains, Henry Fonda, James Cagney, Paul Henreid, Olivia de Havilland, Anne Baxter and Geradine Fitzgerald.         As she grew older, Miss Davis continued making movies, many of them horror thrillers or melodramas, like ''The Anniversary'' (1968), in which she wore a patch over one eye.         Unlike many of her contemporaries who held out against appearing on television when it was in its infancy in the 1950's, Miss Davis embraced it. She appeared as a guest on the Jimmy Durante comedy show, and made episodes of popular series like ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Perry Mason.''  Writing Her Own Epitaph  'The Sweetness Of My Joy'         Despite advancing age Miss Davis kept on working, appearing on television and in an occasional movie, some of them made for television. She said she worked into her later years because the money came in handy, and work was part of her Yankee heritage. ''It is only work that truly satisfies,'' she said. ''No one has ever understood the sweetness of my joy at the end of a good day's work. I guess I threw everything else down the drain.''         This included her personal life, she said, adding: ''All my marriages were charades, and I was equally responsible. But I always fell in love. That was the original sin.''         It was never a secret that Miss Davis was temperamental, opinionated and often difficult to get along with, but in 1985 a scandalous book about her, by her own daughter, shocked her critics as well as her fans.         In ''My Mother's Keeper,'' B. D. Hyman portrayed Miss Davis as an abusive, domineering and hateful mother and as a grotesque alcoholic who was largely responsible for her own mistreatment by certain of her husbands. Two years later Miss Davis replied to Mrs. Hyman's charges with her own bestseller, 'This 'N That,'' in which she defended herself as the victim of a lying and ungrateful child. She confessed later that her estrangement from her daughter pained her.         For some years after her last divorce Miss Davis lived in Weston, Conn., but in the late 1970's she moved into an apartment in West Hollywood.         ''Indestructible,'' she once said. ''That's the word that's often used to describe me. I suppose it means that I just overcame everything. But without things to overcome, you don't become much of a person, do you?''         ''I know what I want as my epitaph,'' she said. ''Here lies Ruth Elizabeth Davis - she did it the hard way.''         Correction:  November 11, 1989, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Oct. 8 about Bette Davis credited her incorrectly with a distinction held by another actress.         As a letter from a reader has pointed out, it is Katharine Hepburn who has received the most Academy Award nominations. The obituary also included a film incorrectly among Miss Davis's nominations. She was not nominated for the 1934 film ''Of Human Bondage.''       
        Maryat Lee, a playwright and producer for community theaters, died of heart disease on Sept. 18 at home in Lewisburg, W. Va. She was 66 years old.         Maryat Lee, a playwright and producer for community theaters, died of heart disease on Sept. 18 at home in Lewisburg, W. Va. She was 66 years old.         A 1951 anti-drug drama by Miss Lee, ''Dope,'' played community and street theaters for two decades.         Miss Lee moved to West Virginia 12 years ago and founded the Eco Theater, which her brother, John, described as ''suggestive of ecology, close to the people, based on oral history and using untrained actors.''         She is survived by her mother, Grace, of Black Mountain, N.C., and two brothers, John, of Vero Beach, Fla., and Robert E., of Black Mountain.       
        Mary Alice Rice, a retired producer of fashion shows and former showgirl, died Monday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N,J., after a long illness. She was 78 years old and lived in Summit.         Mary Alice Rice, a retired producer of fashion shows and former showgirl, died Monday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N,J., after a long illness. She was 78 years old and lived in Summit.         Ms. Rice came to Manhattan from Temple, Tex., in 1930 and got a job in the chorus of George White's ''Flying High.'' In 1931, Flo Ziegfeld put her in the Follies and later declared her one of ''the 10 most beautiful girls on the American stage.''         In the early 1940's, Ms. Rice convinced the Plaza Hotel, among others, that regular runway fashion shows for charity would attract patrons, and from 1942 to 1987, when she retired, she produced the Plaza's annual Easter show, along with numerous others for the Pierre, the St. Regis and similar hotels.         In 1954, she married William L. Evers, then the executive director of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation.

Elizabeth Firestone Willis, a patron of the arts and a composer, died of heart failure Wednesday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh. She was 67 years old and lived in Washington.         Mrs. Willis, whose grandfather, Harvey S. Firestone Sr., founded the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio, had been a member of the National Council of the Metropolitan Opera Association and a trustee of the Archives of American Art and the New England Conservatory of Music.         In recent years, Mrs. Willis, a pianist, devoted herself to jazz, making appearances with Mel Torme, Lionel Hampton, Gene Krupa and B. B. King. Most recently, in collaboration with Mr. Hampton, she wrote ''The George Bush Election Theme.''         In Dwight D. Eisenhower's Presidential campaigns she served as musical coordinator.         She began her career composing music for children's broadcasting.

        Dr. Pearl (Perry) Izenzon, the co-founder and executive director of the Potsmokers Anonymous drug-rehabilitation program, died of cancer Friday night at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 48 years old and lived on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.         Dr. Pearl (Perry) Izenzon, the co-founder and executive director of the Potsmokers Anonymous drug-rehabilitation program, died of cancer Friday night at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 48 years old and lived on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.         Dr. Izenzon founded the rehabilitation program in 1974 with her husband, David Izenzon, an artist and musician who died of a heart attack in 1977. Dr. Izenzon, who had a doctorate in education, was also an artist.         The Izenzons modeled Potsmokers Anonymous after Alcoholics Anonymous. Thousands of marijuana smokers were helped by the program, said a longtime family friend, Richard Weiner. He added that Dr. Izenzon did not use drugs, and that she helped start the program because many of her musician and artist friends were battling drug problems.         He also said she made many radio and television appearances warning about the dangers of drug abuse. ''She felt that pot was not something to be taken lightly,'' Mr. Weiner said.         Dr. Izenzon received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Bard College in 1951 and her doctorate from Columbia University Teachers College in 1986.         A native of Queens, she was active in many community rehabilitation and beautification projects on the Lower East Side.         She is survived by two sons, Solomon and Seth, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Goldy Rosen, of Garden City, L.I. Her mother, Fannie Meresman, of Manhattan, died two weeks ago.

        Melba Till Allen, a former Alabama state auditor and state treasurer who was convicted of using her office for personal gain, died of cancer Friday at Baptist Medical Center in Montgomery. She was 56 years old and lived in Marbury, Ala.         Melba Till Allen, a former Alabama state auditor and state treasurer who was convicted of using her office for personal gain, died of cancer Friday at Baptist Medical Center in Montgomery. She was 56 years old and lived in Marbury, Ala.         Mrs. Allen, long active in Alabama politics, was auditor from 1967 to 1975 and treasurer from 1975 to 1978. A crusader against corruption, she was credited with helping to win the adoption of a state ethics law in 1973.         In 1978 she was convicted of using her office as treasurer to obtain bank loans to build a theme park and of failing to make full disclosure of her personal finances.         Mrs. Allen, who denied any wrongdoing, was sentenced to six years in jail and three and a half years of probation. She spent 30 days in jail and the rest of her sentence living and working as a bookkeeper at a Montgomery retirement home.         A Democrat, she sought the party nomination for United States Senator in 1972, losing to Senator John J. Sparkman.         She is survived by her husband, Marvin; a daughter, a son, her mother, three sisters, seven brothers and six grandchildren.       
        Mary McCarthy, one of America's pre-eminent women of letters, died of cancer yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Castine, Me., and Paris.         Mary McCarthy, one of America's pre-eminent women of letters, died of cancer yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Castine, Me., and Paris.         In her long and prolific career as a novelist, memoirist, journalist and critic, Miss McCarthy earned recognition for her cool, analytic intelligence and her exacting literary voice - a voice capable of moving from the frivolously feminine to the willfully cerebral, from girlish insouciance to bare-knuckled fury.         In 1984, she was awarded both the Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contributions to literature and the National Medal for Literature.  'A Subversive Soul'         ''If there were any real ancestor among American women for Mary McCarthy it might be Margaret Fuller,'' the critic Elizabeth Hardwick, a friend, once observed, referring to the 19th-century American editor, essayist, poet, teacher and translator. ''Both women have will power, confidence and a subversive soul sustained by exceptional energy.''         Miss McCarthy's accounts of sexual shenanigans in ''The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt'' in 1941 and ''The Group'' in 1963 created something of an uproar when they first appeared. But her notoriety in literary circles stemmed less from the scandal quotient of her fiction than from her adversarial literary and political stands. She had celebrated public skirmishes with Philip Rahv, Diana Trilling and Lillian Hellman; issued vitriolic pronouncements on Watergate and the Vietnam War, and became known for the ferocity of her book and theater reviews.  Perverse Opinions         At their worst, those reviews pointed up Miss McCarthy's weakness for catchy one-liners and her taste for willfully perverse opinions. Of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire'' she wrote, ''His work reeks of literary ambition as the apartment reeks of cheap perfume,'' and of Eugene O'Neill and ''The Iceman Cometh'' she declared, ''He is probably the only man in the world who is still laughing at the Iceman joke or pondering its implications.''         Yet at her best (as in ''The Stones of Florence'') Miss McCarthy was an erudite cultural historian, using her familiarity with history, politics and the arts - and the application of some plain old-fashioned common sense -to draw surprising connections and to make her readers reconsider their preconceptions.         ''A career of candor and dissent is not an easy one for a woman; the license is jarring and the dare often forbidding,'' Ms. Hardwick said. ''Such a person needs more than confidence and indignation. A great measure of personal attractiveness and a high degree of romantic singularity are necessary to step free of the mundane, the governessy, the threat of earnestness and dryness. Moderating influences are essential.''         In the case of Miss McCarthy, she said, ''the purity of style and the liniment of her wit, her gay summoning of the funny facts of everyday life, soften the scandal of the action or the courage of the opinion.''         To Robert Lowell, Miss McCarthy was ''our Diana, rash to awkwardness,'' blurting ''ice clear'' sentences above the ''mundane gossip and still more mundane virtue'' of her colleagues. To Alfred Kazin, she was the owner of ''a wholly destructive critical mind,'' a critic with an ''unerring ability to spot the hidden weakness or inconsistency in any literary effort and every person.'' And to Norman Mailer, she was ''our First Lady of Letters'' -''our saint, our umpire, our lit arbiter, our broadsword, our Barrymore (Ethel), our Dame (dowager), our mistress (Head), our Joan of Arc.''  Heroines Were Self-Portraits         The most tireless mythologizer of her life, however, remained Miss McCarthy herself. There were her memoirs: ''Memories of a Catholic Girlhood'' (1957), the beautifully observed portrait of her painful youth, and the later, more workmanlike ''How I Grew,'' published in 1987. In addition, the heroines in Miss McCarthy's fiction form a sort of continuing portrait of the author: Meg in ''The Company She Keeps'' (1942), the clever Vassar girl, ''a princess among the trolls''; Martha, ''the bohemian lady'' in ''A Charmed Life'' (1955), whose need to ''tell the truth'' continually gets her into trouble; Kay, the skeptical iconoclast in ''The Group'' (1963), and Rosamund, the esthetic mother figure in ''Birds of America'' (1971).         These novels also included sharp-edged portraits of many of Miss McCarthy's friends and lovers: her second husband, the critic Edmund Wilson, was portrayed as a loud, unappealing intellectual in ''A Charmed Life''; and Rahv, her roommate and mentor as editor of The Partisan Review, turned up in ''The Oasis'' (1949).         Yet if Miss McCarthy's novels often read like thinly disguised exercises in autobiography, they also attempted to provide an idiosyncratic chronicle of American life - at least within her own intellectual set - as it changed over some five decades. Sexual freedom in the 1930's, radicalism in the 40's and 50's, Vietnam and the social upheavals of the 60's, Watergate and terrorism in the 70's - these are the larger issues that flicker in the background of the novels.  Fiction Was Difficult         There is a certain didacticism to these books, a feeling of willed creation, and Miss McCarthy herself acknowledged that she found it considerably more difficult to write fiction than essays or reviews.         Each novel, she once said, had its genesis with an idea. ''Birds of America,'' which chronicled the coming of age of a teen-age ornithologist, was meant to be ''a novel about the idea of equality and its relation to nature''. ''The Groves of Academe'' (1952), a satiric portrait of a scheming scholar and his colleagues, was intended to address the question ''Where is the justice for an impossible person?'' ''The Group,'' a chatty gossip sheet about the lives of eight Vassar women, was conceived as a study of the illusory idea of social and political progress that captivated so many young people in the 1930's.         That last novel, which brought Miss McCarthy both a popular audience and a movie sale, enhanced her almost legendary reputation for enraging old friends and acquaintances who thought they saw themselves as the thinly disguised and gleefully skewered characters in her fiction.  A Painful Childhood         Throughout her career, Miss McCarthy seemed preoccupied with two themes: what she called ''the idea of justice'' and the idea of self-reliance. Both impulses originated in her painful childhood, and both, in a sense, led to her later attempts to invent an identity true to her platonic conception of herself.         Mary Therese McCarthy was born on June 21, 1912, in Seattle, the daughter of Roy Winfield McCarthy, a member of a prominent Roman Catholic family in Minneapolis, and the former Therese Preston, whose father, a transplanted New Englander, was one of Seattle's most successful lawyers. She had three brothers, Kevin, Preston and Sheridan.         The early years of Miss McCarthy's life seem to have been a romantic idyll; she would later portray them as a lovely succession of parties and holidays, with May baskets and valentines.         ''Both my parents were handsome, winning and romantic,'' she wrote. ''Their marriage was opposed by both families, partly for religious reasons, and partly because my father was an invalid, with an invalid's febrile vitality. He had a bad heart, and it was prophesied, from the first, that he would die young and leave his wife with a pack of children.''  'Dickensian Cruelty'         In fact, both he and his wife died in the great flu epidemic of 1918, and the 6-year-old Mary and her three brothers were sent to live with their great-aunt Margaret and her husband in Minneapolis. There, they experienced what she once called ''circumstances of almost Dickensian cruelty and squalor.'' The children were made to stand outdoors for three hours at a time in the snow, and they were regularly thrashed with a razor strop; Miss McCarthy recalled being beaten in one instance for receiving a school prize, lest she become ''stuck up.''         Miss McCarthy's bitter recollection continued: ''Two blocks away, my McCarthy grandparents, dwelling in sumptuous middle-class style, instilled in us the contrast between wealth and penury by occasional treats and vacations; it was thought beneficial that we should know we were orphans and fitted for a different destiny than our well-tended cousins.         ''Today, some of my relations allege my literary successes and my brother Kevin's career as an actor as proof that the harsh formula followed in our upbringing produced results; nevertheless, I cannot feel grateful. Nor do I believe that artistic talent flowers necessarily from a wounding of the stem on which it grows.''         When she was 11, Miss McCarthy was rescued from her misery in Minneapolis by her maternal grandfather, Harold Preston, who took her to Seattle and gave her a fine education at the Forest Ridge Convent and the Annie Wright Seminary.  Puritanism vs. Romance         As ''Memories of a Catholic Girlhood'' and ''How I Grew'' indicate, the twists and turns of Miss McCarthy's melodramatic childhood would develop two distinct sides to her personality: on one hand, the puritanical student who wants to win prizes for her scholarship and dreams of becoming a nun; on the other, the die-hard romantic who writes moody stories about suicide and prostitution and dreams of becoming an actress. In fact, before she left for college in 1929, Miss McCarthy took some acting classes at the Cornish Drama School in Seattle, where she met the actor Harold Cooper Johnsrud, whom she married a week after her graduation from Vassar. She would divorce him three years later.         By the time Miss McCarthy left Vassar in 1933, she said, she had become ''a wayward modern girl,'' determined, in the words of her colleague William Barrett, ''to hold her own with men - both intellectually and sexually.'' Her finely observed collection of interconnected stories, ''The Company She Keeps,'' would chronicle - in slightly disguised fashion - many of her adventures in these early post-college years, including the breakup of her first marriage, her desultory love affairs and her dabbling in Trotskyite politics.         Writing of that time, Mr. Barrett described the girlishly pretty writer as ''a Valkyrie maiden, riding her steed into the circle, amid thunder and lightning, and out again, bearing the body of some dead hero across her saddle.''         Two influential men of letters, Rahv and Wilson, would play important roles in the shaping of Miss McCarthy's career. Rahv, with whom she lived during the 1930's, helped her to get her first literary job - writing theater reviews for the magazine; Wilson, whom she married in 1938, persuaded her to try writing fiction. He put her in a room, she recalled, and told her to stay there until she finished a story. Their tempestuous marriage produced one son, Reuel, and ended in divorce in 1946. Later that year she married Bowden Broadwater, a writer and teacher.  Satiric Wit         With a clinical eye and an apparently total gift for recall, Miss McCarthy used her satiric wit to illuminate the pretensions and prejudices of her fellow intellectuals. Much of her writing was devoted to exposing what she regarded as the ignorance, bigotry, dishonest sentimentality and affectation that cluttered the intellectual marketplace.         She defended Hannah Arendt and William Burroughs when it was fashionable to assail them, and attacked J. D. Salinger, Kenneth Tynan and Arthur Miller when others were singing their praises.         The litigious Lillian Hellman was so incensed, in 1980, by Miss McCarthy's description of her in a television interview as a ''dishonest writer'' that she instituted a $2.25 million defamation suit.         Hellman's death in 1984 placed the lawsuit in limbo, making Miss McCarthy feel somewhat put out. ''I still feel disgusted by the amount of lying that didn't stop,'' she said in an interview in 1987. ''I wanted it to go to trial, so I was disappointed when she died.''  Busy Despite Health Problems         Miss McCarthy married James Raymond West, a former director of information for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in 1961. They divided their time between an apartment in Paris and their house in Maine.         In addition to her husband and son, Miss McCarthy is survived by two stepsons, Daniel West of Los Angeles and Jonathan West of Lodz, Poland; a stepdaughter, Alison West of Manhattan; two brothers, Kevin, of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and Preston, of Millsboro, Del., and two grandchildren.         In recent years, Miss McCarthy had several operations for hydrocephalus (water on the brain), but maintained a hectic schedule, working on another volume of memoirs, contemplating a study of Gothic architecture, teaching literature at Bard College and learning German. She recalled telling a friend some two decades ago that she ''never woke up in the morning without a feeling of intense repentance and a resolve to be better.''         ''I don't do that anymore - or almost never,'' she said in a recent interview. ''But I do have this idea of improvement, if not in one's powers, at least in one's vision, in one's understanding. I suppose it's all tied up with the American belief in progress. Not that I have that as an idea, but I certainly have it in my personal life. I couldn't live without feeling I know more than I did yesterday.''

Farrar, an educator, author and education researcher, died of cancer Sunday at her home in Shaker Heights, Ohio. She was 50 years old.         Dr. Farrar helped shape the debate over improving public education with her writings, particularly her best-known work, ''The Shopping Mall High School,'' a book she wrote with Arthur G. Powell and David K. Cohen in 1985.         She was an associate professor of education at the State University of New York at Buffalo since 1986 and was also engaged in a long-term study of the effects of a business-education partnership intended to revamp the public schools in Boston and improve the college and job prospects of graduates.         She received her Ph.D. in education at Harvard University.         She is survived by her husband, Jay Talbott, of Shaker Heights; her son, Jeffrey Farrar, of Kitty Hawk, N.C., and her mother, Alice Farrar, of Nashua, N.H.       
        Helen Lehman Buttenwieser, among the first women admitted to the City Bar Association in New York and a civic leader, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Helen Lehman Buttenwieser, among the first women admitted to the City Bar Association in New York and a civic leader, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         As one of the city's earliest and most notable female lawyers, Mrs. Buttenwieser bore the admiration of younger generations modestly, with self-deprecating humor and candor. When the City Bar Association honored her last year at an annual dinner, she noted dryly, ''I'd rather be reading a book.''         As a scion of a powerful family, she followed in its tradition of advocacy, philanthropy and concern for social issues. ''Public service is an obligation,'' Mrs. Buttenwieser once declared. 'Embodied the Concept'         Two passions ruled her professional life: the law and civil liberties. They merged when she became the first chairwoman of the Legal Aid Society, an organization she served for more than 50 years.         ''She embodied the concept of public service, and that her profession recognize its responsibility to people unable to represent themselves,'' said Alexander D. Forger, the current chairman of the Legal Aid Society and chairman of the Manhattan law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. As Legal Aid's first chairwoman, she nevertheless insisted on being referred to as chairman, rather than chairperson.         ''That was her style,'' Mr. Forger said. ''She was of the old school, where matters of gender were less important than doing the job.''         Mrs. Buttenwieser, who was born in Manhattan, was the daughter of two leading figures of ''our crowd,'' the 100 or so German Jewish families who founded leading banking, securities and retailing empires. Her mother, Adele Lewisohn, was the daughter of Adolph Lewisohn, who made his fortune shipping mining products. Her father was Arthur Lehman of the investment banking family. Her uncle, Herbert H. Lehman, was a New York Governor and a United States Senator from New York. Another uncle, Irving Lehman, was Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals. Worked in Settlement House         After two years at Connecticut College, she left and enrolled at the New York School of Social Work. Then, she worked in child guidance in a settlement house. In 1930, she was appointed to the Board of Child Welfare. She turned to the law when she aspired to a judgeship in what is now Family Court.         In 1929, she married Benjamin J. Buttenwieser, a partner in the investment banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company. In a typical ''our crowd'' twist, one of her husband's partners wed her sister, and the firm later merged with Lehman Brothers, the family firm.         She graduated from New York University Law School and became the first woman to work at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. She left after a year because of the impending birth of a child.         Mrs. Buttenwieser then set out to fashion a life that would enable her to fuse work, family and community service. She founded her own office and practiced law in Manhattan for 50 years, until she retired in 1986. ''I decided when you get to be 80, you retire,'' she said. A Busy Volunteer         Her volunteer activities continued throughout her life and included many firsts. In 1939, she was the first chairwoman of a standing committee of the New York County Bar Association. Ten years later, she was elected trustee of the Title Guarantee and Trust Company, the first female director of a prominent banking concern.         She was chairwoman of the New York City Committee on Adoptions and often served as a pro bono lawyer for children's aid organizations. Mrs. Buttenwieser and her husband frequently opened their home to foster children.         When asked how she had been able to accomplish so much, she often credited ''a good husband.'' The two were a familiar sight at their regular table at Le Perigord, where they dined every Saturday at 8 P.M. precisely and where they recently celebrated their 60th anniversary.         Mr. Buttenwieser, a prominent philanthropist and civic leader, nurtured his wife's career and shared her causes. Mrs. Buttenwieser, as a tireless defender of Alger Hiss, the former State Department official who was convicted of perjury in 1950 after trials that mesmerized the nation, was the host for Sunday brunches at her home, where the defendant and his advisers and friends would gather. 'Fundamental Values'         ''She was a woman of great spirit and fundamental values - human rights, decency and the quality of individuals,'' said Oscar M. Ruebhausen, a longtime neighbor and retired partner of Debevoise & Plimpton, the firm that defended Mr. Hiss.         Mrs. Buttenwieser put her money where her beliefs were. She was an investor in The Nation, the liberal magazine. She formed a coalition of small family foundations, Joint Foundation Support, to serve philanthropists by providing information on the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations.         She was also a former trustee of the New York Civil Liberties Union, a former board member of the Citizens Committee for Children, a former chairwoman of Madison House, a former president of the New York Federation of Jewish Charities, a former board member of the Legal Defense Fund and a former member of the Mayor's Committee on the Judiciary.         She was a donor of Adele Lehman Hall at Barnard College, named for her mother, and was a former trustee of Connecticut College and a former board member of the Columbia University School of Social Work and the Dalton School.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a sister, Frances L. Loeb of Manhattan; three sons, Lawrence, of Manhattan, Peter, of Philadelphia, and Paul, of Boston; nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.       
        Eliana Martinez, an AIDS patient whose mother successfully fought a court ruling that the child be in a glass cage in school classes, died of the disease on Monday. She was 8 years old.         Eliana Martinez, an AIDS patient whose mother successfully fought a court ruling that the child be in a glass cage in school classes, died of the disease on Monday. She was 8 years old.         Eliana contracted AIDS as an infant from a tainted blood transfusion. The disease was not diagnosed until 1985.         Her mother, Rosa Martinez, a licensed practical nurse, adopted her as an abandoned 11-month-old in a Puerto Rico hospital.         Officials of the Hillsborough County School Board officials had wanted the child kept home, fearing she posed a health risk. A judge ruled Eliana could attend school if she stayed inside a special glass booth. But Mrs. Martinez appealed the decision. In April Eliana went to school for children with special needs, without the enclosure.       
        Florence Abraham Kahn, retired owner and former chief executive of H.

Abraham Inc., a Brooklyn glass-fabricating concern, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I., after a long illness. She was 81 years old and lived in Great Neck, L.I.         Mrs. Kahn's father, Harry Abraham, founded the company in 1914, and she began working for it after his death in 1949. When her mother Gussie, who had been running the factory, died in 1974, Mrs. Kahn operated it until 1982, when she sold it and retired.         Mrs. Kahn was active in civic affairs and was co-founder of the Great Neck Cooperative Nursery School in the early 1930's.         She is survived by her husband, Jesse; two sons, David, of Great Neck, and Louis, of Teaneck, N.J.; a daughter, Miriam Harris of Great Neck; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

        Leda Anchutina Eglevsky, who danced in George Balanchine's first American ballet companies and founded the Eglevsky Ballet with her husband, Andre Eglevsky, was found dead yesterday morning in bed at her home in Massapequa, L.I. The cause of death was not immediately determined. Always reluctant to give her age, Miss         Leda Anchutina Eglevsky, who danced in George Balanchine's first American ballet companies and founded the Eglevsky Ballet with her husband, Andre Eglevsky, was found dead yesterday morning in bed at her home in Massapequa, L.I. The cause of death was not immediately determined. Always reluctant to give her age, Miss Anchutina was thought to be 73.         Born in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, U.S.S.R., Miss Anchutina was a child when she was brought to the United States. She studied ballet in New York with Michel Fokine and, on the first day of its classes, was a pupil at the School of American Ballet, founded in 1934 by Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein. A dancer known for her daintiness and speed, she was a member of the original cast of ''Serenade,'' a ballet Balanchine created for his students and his first ballet in America. She performed in several of the works he created for his first company, the American Ballet.         Among her leading roles were the Queen of Spades in ''The Card Party'' and the Bride's Friend in ''Le Baiser de la Fee,'' both created by Balanchine for a Stravinsky Festival in 1937 at the Metropolitan Opera House, then the home of the American Ballet. Danced on Broadway         Miss Anchutina also danced in ''Great Lady,'' a 1938 Broadway musical choreographed by Balanchine. She was a member of Mr. Kirstein's Ballet Caravan company, with which she danced in Lew Christensen's ''Pocahontas'' and William Dollar's ''Air and Variations.'' She later danced with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in its 1941-42 season, and with Leonide Massine's Ballet Highlights in the mid-1940's.         Like her husband, whom she married in the late 1930's, Miss Anchutina drew on training with Fokine and Balanchine for her stagings of ballets for the Eglevsky Ballet, which was founded in 1961. She was the director of the Eglevsky School of Ballet in Massapequa until her death.         Miss Anchutina is survived by her mother, Dosi Sorokin; two sons, Dr. Andre Jr., of Fredericksburg, Va., and Paul, of Shirley, L.I.; a daughter, Marina, of Santa Fe, N.M., and eight grandchildren.       
        Gladys Burr, who spent 42 years in state institutions after being mistakenly labeled mentally retarded, died Thursday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, Conn. She was 82 years old.         Gladys Burr, who spent 42 years in state institutions after being mistakenly labeled mentally retarded, died Thursday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, Conn. She was 82 years old.         In 1978, the state of Connecticut -convinced that Miss Burr had never been retarded - freed her, 42 years after her family had had her committed to Norwich State Hospital at age 29 because of ''trouble at home.'' In 1985, Miss Burr won $235,000 in compensation from the state of Connecticut in a suit she filed in 1979.         Miss Burr was committed in January of 1936 on the recommendation of her mother and her family doctor, a cousin. She was first diagnosed as psychotic and then declared mentally retarded. In the years that followed, a succession of mental tests, some now outdated, gave contradictory results. The first I.Q. tests showed that she was mildly retarded. Little note was taken of the fact that she had completed two years of high school and a three-month business course. Later tests, from 1946 to 1961, indicated that she had I.Q. scores ranging from 99 to 104 - considered within the normal intelligence range. A 'Living Hell'         On July 10, 1936, Miss Burr was transferred to the Mansfield Training School, which she described as ''living hell.'' She said she had been beaten, forced to work in the laundry all night and to lift patients heavier than herself.         State officials said Miss Burr did not ask to be released until 1968. But her lawyer, Richard Altshuler, said she made requests in at least three letters in the 1940's. In January 1979, she received a one-paragraph letter from the Mansfield Training School saying she was being released but without giving any reason.         In 1979, her lawyer filed a suit against a group of state mental health officials seeking $125 million and contending that they had deprived Miss Burr of her civil rights and had subjected her to slavery.         Mr. Altshuler produced reports that showed officials knew she was not retarded for more than 30 years. Miss Burr spent her remaining years in a nursing home in Colchester, Conn., and remained bitter about her experience. ''What did I do to deserve this treatment?'' she said. ''I forgive people, but I'll never understand it.''       
        Dr. Priscilla White, whose research sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic women, died Saturday at her home here. She was 89 years old.         Dr. Priscilla White, whose research sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic women, died Saturday at her home here. She was 89 years old.         A statement from the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston said Dr. White found that a fetus of a diabetic mother would often be healthy a month before delivery but would die if allowed to go to full term. She concluded that babies of diabetic women should be delivered early.         She also found that although infants of diabetic mothers usually are normal or larger than normal in size despite premature birth they require the same special care needed for premature infants.         Dr. White's research and the treatment process she developed increased the fetal survival rate around the country from 54 percent in the 1920's to about 97 percent in the late 1970's and 1980's, the center said.         Born in Boston, Dr. White attended Radcliffe College and graduated third in her class from Tufts University Medical School in 1923.         She joined a diabetes practice headed by Elliott P. Joslin, and in 1924 became the youngest member of the team that established the Joslin center.         Dr. White taught at Harvard Medical School and was an assistant professor of medicine at Tufts. She received numerous honors and was the first woman to receive the Banting Medal, the American Diabetes Association's highest scientific award.
