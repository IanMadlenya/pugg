         Edna Morris, prominent in thoroughbred racing and social circles for more than 50 years and a major fund-raiser for the Girl Scouts of Greater New York, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         A son, Alfred (Chappy) Morris, said she had been in failing health for several years.         Mrs. Morris was a familiar figure at race tracks, often accompanied by her friend, Jean MacArthur, the widow of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. The all-scarlet racing colors carried by Morris horses, the oldest continuous silks in the country, were originated by the family before the Civil War. The first running of the Belmont Stakes in 1867 was won by the filly Ruthless, who raced for Francis Morris, the great-grandfather of Mrs. Morris's husband, John A. Morris.         Mr. Morris, a Wall Street stockbroker and a former president of the Thoroughbred Racing Association, died in 1985 at 93.         Mrs. Morris was active in several organizations, particularly in fund raising, but her principal activity was with the Girl Scouts, for whom she organized and presided over a number of benefits.         ''I'm trying to do my little bit for women,'' she said at a benefit in 1968. ''Scouting is an informal lesson in growing up, in learning resourcefulness, how to evaluate and how to cope -- and men today want women who can cope.''         She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 13, 1908, the daughter of Howard and Edna (Dolma) Brokaw. Her father, an accomplished polo player, was co-owner of Brokaw Brothers Clothing, a retail store on Fifth Avenue near the New York Public Library. She was a graduate of Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.         In addition to her son Alfred, of Manhattan, she is survived by another son, Dr. John Morris Jr. of Nashville.       
         Annette Markoe Schieffelin, widow of William Jay Schieffelin Jr., a former chairman of Schieffelin & Company, died on Thursday in Lenox Hill Hospital. Mrs. Schieffelin, of the Upper East Side of Manhattan and Ashville, Me., was 99.         Her husband, who died in 1985, was a direct descendant of John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States, and of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt.         Mrs. Schieffelin was born in New York City, a daughter of the former Annette Butler and James Wright Markoe, J. P. Morgan's friend and  physician. On April 18, 1920, while passing the collection plate at Sunday worship, Dr. Markoe was assassinated in St. George's Church on Stuyvesant Square by an anarchist and escaped mental patient who mistook him for Mr. Morgan.         Mrs. Schieffelin was a member of the Colony Club, the Thursday Evening Club, the Contemporary Club and the Garden Club of Maine.         Besides her husband of 67 years, Mrs. Schieffelin was predeceased by a son, William Jay Schieffelin 3d, and a daughter, Anne Louise Bradley. She is survived by 8 grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and 2 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Elspeth Huxley, a witty and energetic journalist and author of more than 30 books, including memoirs, biographies, crime stories and novels, many inspired by her childhood in colonial Kenya, died on Jan. 10 in a nursing home in Tetbury, in Gloucestershire, England, a family friend said. She was 89.         Although her eclectic literary output reflected an extraordinary range of interests, Mrs. Huxley was perhaps best known for a 1959 work of autobiographical fiction, ''The Flame Trees of Thika,'' which was based on her early life among white settlers on her father's coffee plantation. Although some Kenyans denounced it as an apologia for colonial rule, the book was widely praised for its rich sense of humor, its affectionate personal portraits and its gentle evocation of life in a singular place. ''The Flame Trees of Thika'' became an immensely popular best seller, and in 1981 was made into a television series in Britain. The next year  it was shown on public television in the United States.         Elspeth Josceline Huxley was born in July 1907, the only child of Maj. Josceline Grant, a Scot, and his formidable wife, the former Nellie Grosvenor. Her father, whose failed business schemes included a plan to develop a new kind of motorcar, was a ''gentle, humorous, dreamy person whose dreams never came true,'' she once said. Her mother was a daughter of Lord Stalbridge, who, despite being the younger brother of the first Duke of Westminster, had little money.         In any case, no money came to the family. When she was 5, her family  moved to Kenya, taking possession of a 500-acre coffee farm that Major Grant had bought on a whim in the bar of a Nairobi hotel. They arrived on an ox cart, worked full time on the plantation and had major swings in financial fortune; when they ran out of money for gas, for instance, they had to use oxen to pull the farm truck.         For her part, she was sometimes taught at home and sometimes in school. She had little choice, she later remembered, but ''to fall back on old copies of the Field, manuals of instruction on everything from lace-making to the erection of simple stills, and the volumes of a pocket encyclopedia in minute type.'' At one point she was sent to school in England, but the school sent her home in 1919 after it discovered that she was running numbers on the Derby horse race.         While still a teen-ager, she discovered that she could use her writing talent to make money. Her first published article, in a magazine called The Magician Monthly, was about a magic trick of her own invention. Later, under the pseudonym Bamboo, she wrote a polo column for The East African Monthly, answering readers' questions despite her ignorance about the game. By the time she was 17, she had had 65 articles published in Kenyan newspapers, some of them illustrated with her own photographs.         In 1925, she went to England, earning an agriculture degree from Reading University. Thanks to a wealthy uncle, she also studied agriculture at Cornell University in the United States. Her interest in farming remained throughout her life, and in 1960 she published ''Brave New Victuals: An Inquiry Into Modern Farm Production,'' in which she questioned the increasing reliance on artificial farming methods.         Major Grant and his wife, now the owners of a pig and maize farm, had hoped that their daughter would eventually return to Kenya. But attracted to journalism, she wrote dozens of articles for British magazines and newspapers and took a job for $:5 a week as a press officer at the Empire Marketing Board in England. The job evaporated during the Depression, but in 1931, she married her boss, Gervas Huxley, chief of the publicity department.         She soon had an opportunity to indulge her love of travel: Huxley, a grandson of the humanist Thomas Henry Huxley and a cousin of Aldous, the author, was appointed head of the Ceylon Tea Propaganda Board, a job that required him to travel around the world, encouraging people to drink tea.         In 1935, Mrs. Huxley published her first book, a biography of Lord Delamere, a white settler who revolutionized large-scale farming in Kenya. The book, ''White Man's Country: Lord Delamere and the Making of Kenya,'' was widely regarded as an authoritative account of colonial eastern Africa. More books followed at a rapid pace, including three detective novels and ''Red Strangers'' (1939), a novel that told the story of white settlement from the view of several generations of native Kenyans.         During World War II, the Huxleys returned to England, settling on a pig and dairy farm in the Wiltshire countryside, where they remained the rest of their lives. Mrs. Huxley worked for a time for the BBC's propaganda department, and in 1948  helped to establish the East African Literature Bureau, which worked to publish books by Africans.         In 1959 her ''Flame Trees of Thika'' appeared, followed in 1962 by a sequel, ''On the Edge of the Rift.'' Mrs. Huxley returned to the same themes in 1988 with a memoir, ''Out in the Midday Sun: My Kenya.'' In a review in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote, ''It makes us appreciate the peculiar mixture of courage, rashness, perseverance, idealism and opportunism that brought such a varied group of people to this beautiful, dangerous land.''         Mrs. Huxley was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1962. Her husband died in 1971; she is survived by their son, Charles, and  three grandsons.         Mrs. Huxley attributed much of her energy, sense of humor and intelligence to her mother, who had, among other things, compiled a Swahili-English dictionary that was published by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. (The dictionary was less than comprehensive and,  Mrs. Huxley later said, ''It contained not very useful phrases like 'The idle slaves are scratching themselves' ''). In 1980, she published a collection of her mother's letters along with a biographical essay, in ''Nellie: Letters From Africa.''         As the African nationalist movement gathered steam, Mrs. Huxley wrote a number of articles defending white settlers and colonial rule. She later wrote with lucid sympathy about the challenges facing the newly independent nations under majority rule.         Among Mrs. Huxley's other books  are a country diary about life in Wiltshire and biographies of Florence Nightingale and the Antarctic explorer Robert Scott. Her last book, a biography of Scott's son, the naturalist Peter Scott, was written when she was 83. Energetic to the end, she last visited Africa in 1995, gardened enthusiastically, took an hourlong walk every day and corresponded with a wide circle of friends and acquaintances.         She also took on myriad causes, protesting the erosion of the countryside and the disappearance of rural post offices, for instance, while espousing euthanasia and the protection of rhinoceroses. But in her last Who's Who entry, she described her recreations as ''resting and gossip.''       
         Mae Barnes, the sassy pop-jazz singer and dancer who introduced the Charleston on Broadway and later became a New York nightclub legend, died at Jamaica Hospital in Boston on Dec. 13. She was 89.         She was being treated for cancer, said a friend, the theater historian Delilah Jackson.         At the height of her popularity, Ms. Barnes appeared so frequently at the Bon Soir, a Greenwich Village cabaret, that the club was nicknamed ''the Barnes Soir.''         Famous for her special material -- songs like ''(I Ain't Gonna Be No) Topsy,'' an assertion of black pride that was ahead of its time -- and famous for her irreverent interpolations into familiar lyrics, Ms. Barnes loved to poke fun at the songs of the day. Twisting a key line in Harold Arlen's ''One for My Baby,'' the words ''set 'em up Joe,'' became ''stick 'em up, Joe.''         Other signature songs included ''On the Sunny Side of the Street,'' ''I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter,'' ''Sweet Georgia Brown'' and ''They Raided the Joint and Took Everybody Down but Me,'' all sung in a rhythmically charged style that combined the insinuation of the bawdy blues with taut jazz phrasing.         Ms. Barnes, whose original name was Edith May Stith, was born in New York in 1907 and grew up in Manhattan. At age 12 she dropped out of school, telling the administration she was moving to Cleveland, and got a job as a chorus girl at the Plantation Club in Harlem. She toured the South as a vaudeville performer and in 1924 made her Broadway debut in the revue ''Runnin' Wild.'' The show, which introduced the Charleston to Broadway, also featured another legend-to-be, Elizabeth Welch.         As a stage performer, Ms. Barnes was nicknamed ''the bronze Ann Pennington,'' after the Broadway dancing star of George White's Scandals. Her dancing in the national tour of another show, ''Shuffle Along,'' led Bill Robinson to call her ''the greatest living female tap dancer.'' When a car accident in 1938 fractured her pelvis, she turned to singing.         ''I took the rhythm from my dancing and put it in my songs,'' she later said. As her cabaret career developed, she graduated from dives to more upscale New York clubs like Cerutti, the Little Casino and the Blue Angel. In the early 1950's she became the mainstay of the Bon Soir, the cellar club on Eighth Street in Greenwich Village that later became a showcase for Barbra Streisand. A favorite of high society, she frequently performed at Elsa Maxwell's parties and counted the Duke and Duchess of Windsor among her friends.         She also appeared in a 1950 edition of the ''Ziegfeld Follies'' that closed in Boston. Her final Broadway appearance was in 1954 in the Dorothy Fields-Arthur Schwartz musical ''By the Beautiful Sea,'' starring Shirley Booth.         She continued to perform in clubs around the world into the 1960's and recorded for Atlantic and Vanguard Records. She is prominently featured on ''The Erteguns' New York: New York Cabaret Music,'' (Atlantic), an anthology released in 1987.         No immediate family members survive.         A memorial service will be held at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue and 54th Street, at 3 P.M. on Jan. 30.       
         Pilar Barbosa de Rosario, a revered Puerto Rican historian and political authority who served as teacher, mentor and mother confessor to generations of Puerto Rican politicians, scholars and intellectuals, died on Wednesday at a hospital near her home in San Juan. She was 99 and widely regarded as the conscience of the ruling New Progressive Party.         In a career in which, in 1921, she became the first woman to teach at the University of Puerto Rico and later established the departments of history and social studies there, Dr. Barbosa became such an authority on Puerto Rican political history, from the movement for autonomy from Spain in the late 19th century to the drive for statehood in the 20th, that she was named the commonwealth's official historian in 1993.         It was a further reflection of her standing that after her death Gov. Pedro Rossello decreed a three-day period of mourning and that half a dozen members of the Legislature formed an honor guard at her coffin during a wake on Wednesday night.         The only reason a state funeral was not planned was that Dr. Barbosa had asked for private ceremonies, and as virtually any political figure in Puerto Rico would attest, Dr. Barbosa's wishes had long been treated as commands.         Indeed, long after she retired in 1967, Dr. Barbosa remained an influential figure in Puerto Rican politics -- a gregarious and vivacious woman with such a magnetic personality and wide-ranging knowledge of political history and current events that students, politicians and government officials trooped to her door for her counsel and her company.         ''It was an intellectual watering hole,'' said Gonzalo Cordova, a friend who began teaching history at the university the year she retired. ''You didn't come to drink, but for the conversation.''         To Kenneth McClintock, a 40-year-old member of the Puerto Rican Senate, her wealth of political and historical knowledge was understandable. ''As she was growing up,'' he said, ''history was made at her dining room table.''         Her father, Jose Celso Barbosa, was the founder of the Puerto Rican statehood movement and the precursor of the New Progressive Party, which has continued to embrace his ideals -- as modified over the years, to be sure, by his daughter, who insisted that the party of statehood also commit itself to social justice.         This, too, was a tribute to the legacy of her father. He was a black man who was so outraged at being denied higher education by the Spanish that after graduating first in his class at the University of Michigan medical school in 1882 -- and even then allowed to practice in Puerto Rico only after the intervention of the American consul in San Juan -- that he became a leader of the autonomy movement.         Having found a measure of racial and civil justice in 19th-century America after the United States displaced the Spanish in 1898, he espoused statehood as the best way to guarantee similar rights in Puerto Rico.         As one of his 12 children, Dr. Barbosa, whose mother died when she was a toddler, inherited her father's intelligence and his ideals. When she began teaching at the University of Puerto Rico in 1921 she was still an undergraduate herself, and the university was little more than a teacher's college.         After graduating in 1924, she moved on to Clark University in Worcester, Mass., receiving a master's in 1925 and a doctorate the next year.         Over the next decades Dr. Barbosa researched and wrote numerous books, pamphlets and papers on Puerto Rican political history, some based on her father's papers.         Partly, perhaps, because she and her husband, Jose Ezequiel Rosario, an economics professor who died in 1963, had no children, Dr. Barbosa began receiving her students for informal consultations on Saturday afternoons.         The sessions, which began in the days she lived in a farmhouse on the outskirts of San Juan, were continued after she retired and moved to a condominium in the city's Santurce section, but with a difference.         Because she no longer had a teaching load to keep her busy during the week, her proteges took to calling on her any day of the week.         By the time many of them had risen to high positions in the government, Dr. Barbosa, who also maintained friendly relationships with members of other parties, had acquired so much influence that she operated almost as a political boss -- a boss who seemed so blind to her own power that she may not have realized that an off-hand criticism delivered in a private conversation would soon be altering party policy.         Dr. Barbosa is survived by a brother, Rafael Barbosa, of Carolina, P.R.       
         Casey Miller, a writer and editor who was a pioneering advocate of nonsexist language, died on Sunday at her home in East Haddam, Conn. She was 77.         Kate Swift, her close friend and co-author, said the cause of death was chronic obstructive lung disease.         Beginning in the early 1970's, Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift co-wrote numerous books and articles on English usage and its relationship to the status of women. Writing in a climate of increasing sensitivity and opposition to language that relegated women to secondary status, Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift waged a forceful campaign against what many considered sexist language. If not all their proposals (like ''genkind'' to replace mankind) found their way into everyday usage, the women nonetheless helped to raise awareness of oppression by language.         Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift were the authors of ''Words and Women,'' published in 1976 by Doubleday and 1991 by HarperCollins, and ''The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing,'' published in 1980 by Lippincott & Crowell and in 1988 by HarperCollins. They also wrote many articles on sexism in English that appeared in national periodicals and in more than 30 anthologies and textbooks.         They achieved widespread recognition as authorities on the subject of linguistic disparagement of women with ''One Small Step for Genkind,'' a 1972 article in The New York Times Magazine that was reprinted in college textbooks as recently as last year.         In it, they wrote: ''Except for words that refer to females by definition (mother, actress, Congresswoman), and words for occupations traditionally held by females (nurse, secretary, prostitute), the English language defines everyone as male. The hypothetical person (''If a man can walk 10 miles in two hours . . . ), the average person (''the man in the street'') and the active person (''the man on the move'') are male. The assumption is that unless otherwise identified, people in general -- including doctors and beggars -- are men.         ''It is a semantic mechanism that operates to keep women invisible; man and mankind represent everyone; he in generalized use refers to either sex; the ''land where our fathers died'' is also the land of our mothers -- although they go unsung. As the beetle-browed and mustachioed man in a Steig cartoon says to his two male drinking companions, 'When I speak of mankind, one thing I don't mean is womankind.' ''         Ms. Swift said yesterday that the idea for the article grew out of their first collaboration as editors in 1970, on a sex education handbook for high schools that talked about the nature of man and man's behavior and used the pronoun ''he'' in ways that made it impossible to know whether the author was writing about both males and females or only about males.         ''We began to think this was a field that needed to be written about and explored,'' Ms. Swift said.         Their articles on the subject first appeared in New York magazine and in the first issue of Ms. magazine. The New York Times Magazine article appeared on April 16, 1972, and  ''got an awful lot of negative comment,'' Ms. Swift said.         Casey Geddes Miller was born on Feb. 26, 1919, in Toledo, Ohio. She received a bachelor of arts degree in 1940 from Smith College, where she was a philosophy major. During World War II, she served for three years in the Navy, working in Washington in naval intelligence.         She was on the staff of Colonial Williamsburg from 1947 to 1954, when she became the curriculum editor of the publishing house of the Episcopal Church, Seabury Press. Ten years later, she became a freelance editor, working at her home in Greenwich and after 1967 in East Haddam, where she formed her editorial partnership with Ms. Swift.         She is survived by her sisters, Kate R. Gregg of Falmouth, Me., and Caroline S. Cooper of Gilmanton, N.H.       
         Marlene D. Daniels, a noted expert on maritime law and a partner in the New York law firm of Seward & Kissel, where she headed the maritime finance department, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 55.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, Patricia M. Hynes, a friend, said.         Miss Daniels was a director of the Admiralty/Finance Forum, an organization she co-founded in 1986 to bring together maritime financiers, admiralty lawyers and ship owners to discuss issues affecting the shipping industry.         She also was a member of the Maritime Law Association of the United States and its committees on marine financing and cruise lines, a member of the European Maritime Law Association, the Liberian Shipowners Council and its legal advisory board, and on the executive committee of the board of the Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce.         She was part of a group of 10 lawyers who in 1992 left the New York firm of Hill, Betts & Nash to join Seward & Kissel. At the time, the group represented more than 30 percent of the lawyers specializing in maritime law at Hill, Betts.         Miss Daniels, a graduate of the Dwight School for Girls, Connecticut College for Women and Fordham Law School, joined Hill, Betts & Nash as an associate in 1967 and was made a partner in 1973.         Born in Englewood, N.J., she was a daughter of the late Joseph H. Daniels, the founder of Palisades Newspapers, a chain of weekly newspapers in Bergen County, N.J.         Miss Daniels is survived by her mother, Eleanor Daniels of Hackensack, N.J., and three sisters, Joanne Daniels Solomon of Manhattan, Bonnie Lee Daniels of Miami and Sheryl Daniels of Hackensack.       
         Ursula Niebuhr, the founder and longtime chairwoman of the department of religion at Barnard College, died on Friday at her home in Stockbridge, Mass. She was 89 and the widow of the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr.         Although she was clearly upstaged by her renowned husband, who taught at the Union Theological Seminary, Mrs. Niebuhr's own scholarship was so well regarded that in the 1940's she was asked by the president of Barnard to create a department of religion there. She accepted and remained as associate professor and department chairwoman until her retirement two decades later.         A native of Southampton, England, she was sent to Oxford to study at St. Hugh's College, then regarded as little more than a glorified finishing school. She enhanced its reputation considerably when she graduated with honors in history and theology and became the first woman to win a fellowship to the Union Theological Seminary in New York.         When a friend proposed to introduce her to Mr. Niebuhr, a faculty member, she was skeptical, her daughter, Elizabeth Sifton, recalled yesterday. ''Oh, no,'' the friend said, ''you'll love him,'' and she did.         They were married in 1931, embarking on an intellectual and emotional collaboration marked by animated debates that continued until her husband's death in 1971. By then, her daughter noted, their theological differences had dwindled to liturgical quibbles between Mrs. Niebuhr's Episcopalian ideas and her husband's Congregationalist notions.         In the introduction to his last book, Mr. Niebuhr said he could no longer tell where his ideas left off and hers began. After his death, Mrs. Niebuhr returned the favor, editing two collections of his writings.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, Mrs. Niebuhr is survived by a son, Richard, of Stockbridge; a sister, Barbara Moravec of Sutton, England, and three grandsons.         Correction:  January 13, 1997, Monday         An obituary in some editions yesterday about Ursula Niebuhr, the founder of Barnard College's religion department, misstated the given name of her surviving son. He is Christoper, not Richard.       
         Pamela Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, a leading figure in the Democratic Party and for decades one of the most vivacious women on the international scene, died yesterday at the American Hospital in Paris of complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 76.         Mrs. Harriman, who was preparing to relinquish her post and return to Washington, suffered the hemorrhage on Monday at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, where she had gone for her usual swim.         She devoted her later years to helping to rebuild the Democratic Party in the 1980's, raising millions of dollars. She was appointed Ambassador by President Clinton in 1993, and was well regarded as a diplomat.         The President yesterday called her an ''extraordinary U.S. ambassador,'' adding, ''She was a source of judgment and inspiration to me, a source of constant good humor and charm and real friendship, and we will miss her very, very much.''         However great her accomplishments, she could never put to rest the legend of the captivating woman who snared some of the world's richest and most attractive men on two continents, marrying three of them.         Along the way she was trailed by a chorus of angry women who repeated tales of her escapades for decades.         Born in England in 1920 into an old aristocracy that no longer counted for much, she ultimately made her way into a new aristocracy of the wealthy and powerful that counted a great deal. She was 19 when she married Randolph Churchill. Within months he went off to war and she found herself at the center of London as a confidante and hostess for her new father-in-law, Winston Churchill. She called him Papa, and he reveled in her company.         Through Winston Churchill she met Max Beaverbrook, the press baron, who became her mentor; Harry Hopkins, Franklin D. Roosevelt's envoy, who became her friend, and W. Averell Harriman, the lend-lease administrator, who became her lover, and, 30 years later, her third husband.         With expenses underwritten by Mr. Harriman, she took up wartime residence in Grosvenor Square, a small parcel of London that became so filled with Americans that she remembered it as Eisenhowerplatz. There she brought prominent Americans and their British allies together for small dinners and raised eyebrows with her numerous liaisons. The most prominent among them were her London neighbor, John Hay (Jock) Whitney, who became the United States Ambassador to Britain, and Edward R. Murrow, the wartime voice of CBS in London.         After the war, divorced and the mother of a son, Winston Spencer Churchill, she moved to Paris where, with her customary energy and resourcefulness, and with the cachet and connections of the Churchill name, she established a glittering place for herself in international high society.         Later she moved on to America, where she charmed, and married, Leland Hayward, the renowned Broadway agent and producer. After Hayward's death Averell Harriman reappeared, and after a brief courtship they married and became the couple that helped reinvigorate the Democratic Party.         As a girl, Pamela Digby was peaches-and-cream pretty, but no great beauty. Taught, as were most girls of her class, that her goal was to marry well, she developed an exceptional ability to beguile men. She enveloped them in her attention, anticipated their every need and locked on them with adoring eyes that suggested genuine interest in their every word. When it was mentioned to one acquaintance that she was lacking a sense of humor, he shrugged and replied, ''Maybe, but she makes you feel you have the best sense of humor in the world.''         One of her biographers, Christopher Ogden, was beguiled himself when he described her on the night in November 1992 when she welcomed Bill Clinton, the new President she had helped to elect, to a dinner reception at her Georgetown house.         ''She looked fabulous, almost breathtaking,'' he wrote in his book ''Life of the Party.''         ''Her smile can appear too practiced but tonight it was wonderfully wise and guileless,'' he wrote. ''Her voice was low with a sexy, croacky catch.''         Not everyone agreed. Sally Bedell Smith, the author of another biography, ''Reflected Glory,'' said in 1996: ''She wanted great wealth and power. These were big ambitions for a person with little to say and no wit, but she had unflagging determination and ruthlessness.''         Mrs. Harriman was quick to deny that she had ever had an agenda. In 1996, in an interview in the Embassy residence in Paris, she said: ''My life, for me, has been free-flowing. I never thought, 'Now I'm here, I want to go there or do that.' I've taken life as it has presented itself to me.''         She bristled at the way she was characterized in the press and said she should not be faulted if the succession of men in her life happened to be rich and influential. ''Those were the people I met,'' she said. ''Everything in life, I believe, is luck and timing.''         Her first bit of luck was to be born, on March 20, 1920, to Edward Kenelm Digby, soon to become the 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, the former Constance Pamela Alice Bruce. She grew up at Minterne Magna, a 50-room stone mansion in Dorset, where despite severe financial pressures, the family's four children were tended to by maids, governesses and tutors.         She grew up in what she called ''a very small, closed society, the last of really 19th-century culture.''         The Startling Remaking Of a Country Girl         ''It's almost incredible to people I work with today,'' she said last year, ''to realize I was born in a world where a woman was totally controlled by men. I mean, you got married and there was kind of no alternative. The boys were allowed to go off to school. The girls were kept home, educated by governesses. It never sort of occurred to me in the first, I suppose, 20 years of my life that a woman could move from the position that pre-World War II women like me were in.''         She received a certificate in domestic science in 1936 from the Downham School in Hertfordshire. Then she was sent to Paris and Munich for ''finishing.'' As she approached the social season of 1938, when she was presented at court, she was still considered an unfashionable country girl.         Then Winston Churchill's only son, Randolph, well educated but spoiled and trailing a reputation for brilliance, arrogance, extravagance and drunkenness, took her to dinner and proposed on their first date, having already been turned down, according to the London gossips, by a number of other women. He was going off to war, told friends he was sure he would die, and wanted to produce an heir.         They were married on Oct. 4, 1939. ''I was absolutely sincere in wanting it to work,'' she said, ''and I still believe that if it hadn't been wartime, that marriage probably would have worked. I mean there's been too much exaggeration about Randolph being a drunk and Randolph being this and Randolph being that. He was his own worst enemy and very difficult to be his father's son and all that, but he had many, many admirable qualities.''         After following her husband to a succession of army camps, Pamela Churchill was taken under her father-in-law's wing. The Prime Minister found her enchanting. She brought him the London gossip and played the card game bezique with him into the early hours of the morning when he couldn't sleep. And he was elated that she was bearing his grandchild and namesake.         ''Nobody in today's generation can fully understand what it was like to be part of the last probably great war,'' she said, and years later she remembered it as the most exciting time of her life.         During bombing raids she shared the shelter under 10 Downing Street with the Prime Minister and his wife, Clementine. Above ground there were dinners and weekends with world leaders at Chequers or at Lord Beaverbrook's, tea dances at Claridges and the Dorchester, officers to entertain at the Churchill Club and Roosevelt's envoy, Harry Hopkins, to look after.         A Fling With Aly Khan, And Other Romances         After the war she became a reporter for Lord Beaverbrook's Daily Express and Evening Standard, cabling news about politics, the arts and the social scene from London, New York, Palm Beach, Montego Bay, Paris and the south of France.         She looked back at those postwar years as a time to ''catch up on all the things that I might have done if I hadn't had those six years of war,'' she said. ''I wanted to discover a lot of things that I had not done at the age of 19.''         She had a fling with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the Aga Kahn, and after the breakup of her marriage to Randolph Churchill she began her new life in Paris. There she met the Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli and fell in love, and during their five-year romance provided him with connections in England and America. She converted to Catholicism in what some said was an effort to be a more acceptable bride to the heir to the Fiat fortune. But that was not to be.         After their breakup there were five years as mistress to Baron Elie de Rothschild of the French banking family. Because he was married to one of the most well-liked women in Paris society, Mrs. Churchill made enemies. But she had admirers, too, among them Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon.         ''I'm censured for having had friends,'' Mrs. Harriman said in 1996, assailing the many books and articles written about her, ''and, of course, more friends than I've ever really had. Men friends. The amount of people that I read about that I've slept with that I've never slept with -- I mean it's extraordinary!''         She insisted that she was not looking for a rich husband, saying of her biographers and detractors: ''The one thing that they've all missed is the fact that having once been married I said to myself, 'I don't have to get married again.' I was bruised. What annoys me, especially in this world where women are equal with men, why do they all take the same tack, that people didn't marry me? Nobody's ever thought that I didn't want to marry.''         But then she did marry, in 1960. During a visit to New York she was introduced to Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer of such hit musicals as ''South Pacific'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' A friend asked her to go to the theater with Hayward, whose wife, Slim, later known in New York society as Lady Keith, was in Europe. It was not long before Hayward proposed.         She showered him with what Sally Bedell Smith characterized as ''geisha-like devotion.'' She cooked chicken hash on a hot plate when they were out on the road and organized splendid houses in New York and Westchester, but theirs was a complicated marriage. Hayward had three children from his marriage to the actress Margaret Sullavan, who committed suicide in 1960, 11 years after their divorce. The children loved their mother and their first stepmother, but not their father's new wife.         When Hayward died of a stroke in 1971, there was a feud over his will. His daughter Brooke Hayward even suggested in her book, ''Haywire,'' that her last stepmother absconded with a string of pearls her mother had left to her. Pamela Harriman insisted that she knew nothing about the pearls.         As the Wife of Harriman, She Buoys the Democrats         Five months after Hayward's death, at a dinner party given by Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, there was a serendipitous reunion with W. Averell Harriman, who had been widowed the year before. A month later Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward, 51, married the 79-year-old former Governor of New York, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Harry Truman's choice to be President of the United States.         Although Harriman was the heir to the Union Pacific Railroad fortune, he was famously parsimonious. With his new wife, however, he was generous, and began to live up to his means. She fixed up his houses. She became an American citizen and adopted his interests in the Soviet Union and, more exuberantly, in the Democratic Party.         As Mrs. Averell Harriman, she gave fund-raising dinners for Democratic candidates in the 1970's. But it was the election of Ronald Reagan and the big Republican gains in Congress in the 1980 election that galvanized both Harrimans to action. To resuscitate the Democratic Party, they agreed to form their own political action committee, which quickly became known as PamPAC. Mrs. Harriman surrounded herself with advisers and learned quickly. She built up her political curriculum vitae, giving speeches and, with the help of friends, writing Op-Ed pieces for The New York Times and The Washington Post.         The Harriman house in Georgetown, with its fine collection of Impressionist works,  became a headquarters of sorts for the party in exile. Contributors paid thousands of dollars to be invited to Mrs. Harriman's receptions and dinners, where they were given briefings and allowed to rub shoulders with party nabobs like Clark Clifford and Robert Strauss and any number of Presidential candidates and senators, current and past.         When Harriman's health deteriorated, his wife worked assiduously to keep him occupied, making sure he had visitors to keep him company when she was away. By then Mrs. Harriman had her own airplane, so she was able to return to him in the evenings. He died in 1986 at the age of 94.         A $100 Million Fortune, And a Family Feud         There were two funeral services, one in New York and one in Washington, and two burials. Mourners thought they were witnessing his burial in the family plot next to his previous wife, Marie. In fact, The Washington Post later reported, Mrs. Harriman had postponed the actual interment for two months while another burial plot was prepared at his estate in Arden, N.Y. Pamela Harriman will be buried at his side, after a funeral service in Washington next Thursday and a memorial service in Paris.         In addition to her son, Mrs. Harriman is survived by her sisters, Sheila Moore of Atlanta and Ireland, and Jaquetta James of the Isle of Mull, Scotland; her brother, Edward, Lord Digby, of Minterne Magna; four grandchildren and three great grandchildren.         Harriman left his widow most of his fortune, more than $100 million, and designated her an executor and trustee of his estate and their charitable trusts. His daughters and their children were to share in the remains of a trust after Pamela Harriman's death. The financial arrangement set the stage for another family feud.         At about the time of their marriage, Harriman put his investments in the hands of William Rich, a man he believed to be a careful and conservative investor, and he engaged his old friend Clark Clifford and his partner Paul Warnke as his lawyers.         He told his wife to follow their advice, but Mr. Clifford soon became preoccupied with defending himself against charges growing out of allegations that he was involved in the huge B.C.C.I. bank and money-laundering scandal, and Mr. Warnke moved to another law firm. Mr. Rich proceeded to make what the Harriman heirs have charged were highly speculative and unwise investments that resulted in huge losses.         The heirs turned to her to make good on those losses. In 1994 they sued her in Federal court in Manhattan. Family members suggested she had pushed Mr. Rich into making risky investments to maintain her expensive habits. She denied it.         ''I never got involved in finances,'' she said. ''It is totally absurd to think that I had any influence, or tried to have any influence, on the running of the office or the management of the money. Never. There was no reason.''         Mrs. Harriman sold some property as well as a Picasso, a Matisse and a Renoir during that time. The two sides reached a settlement in 1995, agreeing not to divulge the terms, then joined forces to file a civil suit against Mr. Rich in Virginia.         Clinton's Her Candidate And Is Duly Grateful         In 1988 Mrs. Harriman's choice for President was Al Gore, not Michael Dukakis. For the 1992 election she considered a number of candidates before settling on Bill Clinton. She committed herself wholeheartedly to raising money for his campaign and he showed his gratitude by choosing her house for his first triumphal victory dinner in Washington. Later he named her Ambassador to France.         That was how Mrs. Harriman came to preside over the palatial residence of American ambassadors on the Rue du Faubourg-St.-Honore, not far on a Paris street map but a world away from the Avenue de New York and the apartment she occupied in the 1950's as Pamela Churchill.         That she was a woman with a past enhanced her standing with the French. Her energy went into 16-hour days dealing with questions of international trade, NATO expansion and the war in Bosnia, and working the telephone to Washinton late into the night, trying to forestall cuts in the Foreign Service budget. She loved every minute of it.         Remembering Mrs. Harriman yesterday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called her a ''central figure in the history of this century.''         ''America has lost a remarkable representative, the State Department has lost one of its most effective diplomats and I have lost a friend,'' she said.         That Sunday morning in late 1996, as she sat in the living room of her private apartment in the Embassy residence, Mrs. Harriman was asked if there was anything she wished she had done differently.         ''No,'' she said.         ''Really, no regrets?''         ''I consider I have had a very fortunate life.''         ''A happy life?''         ''Very, very. I drank deep of the well.''       
         Dorothy Fosdick, the foreign policy expert who helped fashion the United Nations, the Marshall Plan and NATO in the 1940's, advised Adlai E. Stevenson in the 1952 Presidential campaign and then spent nearly three decades as Senator Henry M. Jackson's chief cold war strategist, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Washington. She was 83 and had continued to live in Washington after Senator Jackson's death in 1983.         Her sister, Elinor Downs, said the cause was cardiac arrest.         From the early months of World War II, when the United States began  planning for the postwar world, until President Reagan opened the final phase of the struggle against the Soviet Union with his ''evil empire'' speech in 1983, Dr. Fosdick was in the thick of national foreign policy planning and debate.         Along the way, she consistently took such a hard line against the Soviet Union and was such a passionate and articulate advocate of military might that her colleagues sometimes had to remind themselves that she was, in fact, the daughter of the Rev. Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, the pacifist pastor of Riverside Church, the Rockefeller-backed bastion of New York liberalism.         Whatever her father's influence,  Dr. Fosdick, who was born in Montclair, N.J., and grew up in the faculty housing at the Union Theological Seminary, took as her mentor the family's friend and neighbor, Reinhold Niebuhr, the theologian whose belief that evil is a palpable world force that must be resisted and overcome became the geopolitical creed of a generation of cold war theorists.         Dr. Fosdick's career was also influenced by her beloved Uncle Raymond, her father's brother, Raymond B. Fosdick, an international lawyer whose appointment as Under Secretary of the League of Nations came to naught after the Senate failed to ratify the founding treaty.         She took the rejection of the treaty as a personal affront and later wrote a prize-winning essay on the episode at the Horace Mann School, then went off to Smith College, where she was an acclaimed athlete. After obtaining a doctorate in public law from Columbia University, she taught sociology and political theory.         Her academic career came to an end early in 1942, when she was recruited by the State Department's opaquely named Division of Special Research and was assigned to begin planning for a postwar international organization.         Over the next few years, she helped shape the Dumbartron Oaks and San Francisco conferences, which laid the groundwork for the United Nations, served on the delegations to both conferences and attended the early sessions of the U.N.         Her contributions were so impressive that in 1948 at the age of 34, she became the only woman on the State Department's newly formed Policy Planning Staff, a high-level, in-house think tank of nine strategic planners whose work under George Kennan and later Paul Nitze helped shape the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.         During the 1952 Presidential campaign, Dr. Fosdick became so enamored with the Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson, that she became his chief foreign policy adviser and had a romantic fling with him (at the same time, she later learned, that Stevenson was having a secret affair with Alicia Patterson.)         Stevenson apparently disappointed her on both fronts. Dr. Fosdick, who never married, mainly, her sister suggested, because she never found a man her equal, later confided to friends that she did not think Stevenson had the gumption to be President.         After a period as a freelance writer, Dr. Fosdick, whose books included, ''What is Liberty?'' and ''Common Sense and World Affairs,'' finally found her niche in 1954 as chief foreign policy adviser to Senator Jackson, the Washington State Democrat known for his expertise in military affairs.         Sharing both his passion for liberal social causes and his commitment to a strong military, Dr. Fosdick became the Senator's alter ego. She wrote his speeches, helped develop his strategic positions and political initiatives and orchestrated his legendary informational hearings. Her 1961 report, for example, after a quiet, thorough investigation of cold war policy procedures became the blueprint for President John F. Kennedy's reorganization of the national security policy apparatus.         At a time when Senator Jackson was a Senate legend for the quality of his staff, Dr. Fosdick was in command of the ''bunker,'' so called partly because of the cramped staff quarters and partly because Senator Jackson and his staff were so often at odds with the prevailing political winds of detente.         Dr. Fosdick, known as Dickie and sometimes referred to as the bunker's bubbie, the Yiddish word for grandmother, was an exacting boss, one whose day could be ruined by a misplaced comma.         A slim, peppery woman who had been a fierce competitor on the Horace Mann and Smith athletic fields, Dr. Fosdick was only 5-foot-1, but more than one bulky senator felt her sting. When Dr. Fosdick went toe-to-toe, eyeball-to-tie clasp on a cherished issue, she would punctuate her arguments with rapid finger gestures that often peppered a senatorial paunch.         In time, Dr. Fosdick was eclipsed on the public stage by some of her  admiring young proteges, among them Ricard N. Perle, who became an Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Elliott Abrams, who became an Assistant Secretary of State, but only, perhaps, because she preferred to work behind the scenes.         As Mrs. Downs put it, recalling that her sister had turned down repeated offers to become an ambassador or college president: ''She had no personal ambition. She only wanted to save the world.''         In addition to Mrs. Downs, of Boston, Dr. Fosdick is survived by a niece, Patricia Berger of Brookline, Mass., a nephew, Stephen Downs of Albany; two grand-nephews, and three grand-nieces.       
         Constance D. Gibson, an elegant dowager who spent half her life regally overseeing one of Manhattan's crown jewels as the acknowledged queen of Gramercy Park, died on Monday at her home overlooking the park she had nurtured and cherished for more than 50 years. She was 94.         To those who stumble unawares upon the two acres of tree-shaded greenery surrounded by a tall iron fence at the foot of Lexington Avenue, Gramercy Park is an urban wonder, a surprising and soothing respite from the bustling worlds of Third Avenue between 20th and 21st Streets to the east and Park Avenue South to the west.         Yet for all its natural appeal, Gramercy Park is not an accidental wonder. Created by a real estate developer in 1831, it is at once the city's only private park and one whose gardens and greenswards are maintained by unpaid trustees.         An Army general's widow with a commanding presence, Mrs. Gibson, who was the head trustee from 1980 to 1992, took her job so seriously that she supervised the planting of hundreds of tulip bulbs every fall. She kept an eagle eye on the staff of professional gardeners and had such an obsessive interest in the good order of the park that she seemed to know where and when each leaf would fall. From her second-floor bedroom window, she once told a friend, she could see ''that the gardeners are doing exactly what I told them to do.''         Herself an accomplished gardener who raised holly behind her house and tended flowers at her summer home in Massachusetts, Mrs. Gibson was a fixture at the New York Horticultural Society, or ''the Hort,'' as she called it, and was running flower exhibitions in the park long before she became a trustee in 1964.         By the time she moved into a town house on Gramercy Park South in 1940, Mrs. Gibson had established herself as something of a purposeful free spirit.         A native of Liverpool, England, whose father came to the United States when she was 2, Mrs. Gibson, grew up in New Dorp, S. I., in a house whose spacious, English-style garden appealed to her mother and gave Mrs. Gibson a lifelong love of flowers.         After graduating from Bryn Mawr with a degree in fine arts in 1924, she was so disappointed that her father would not let her continue her studies abroad that when she saw an advertisement in The New York Times seeking a French-speaking woman with a size 4B foot, she answered it.         Her father was scandalized, but with the approval of her mother, Mrs. Gibson, who took such pride in her shapely feet that she had her toenails painted even in her 90's, became a foot model in Paris, where she also studied at the Sorbonne and met a self-effacing American Army captain from Poultney, Vt., named Herbert Daskum Gibson.         By the time they were married in 1931, Mrs. Gibson had obtained a master's degree from Columbia, but her husband was still a captain, a circumstance his wife set out to rectify in posts in the Philippines and the United States.         Never mind that he was decorated for valor in World War I and that he performed such distinguished service in the Pacific in World War II that he was promoted to Brigadier General. As Mrs. Gibson later confided to a friend, her husband, who died at 88 in 1980, ''would never have made general without me.''         With her husband at war, Mrs. Gibson moved in with her brother in the Gramercy Park house and became a leader of the New York society home front, throwing herself into a whirlwind of volunteer efforts for organizations like Bundles for Britain and the American Red Cross, serving as an Air Raid warden and even becoming a defense industry expediter.         A petite woman whose elegant clothes were handmade, Mrs. Gibson became a beloved figure in the Gramercy Park neighborhood, where she was seen as a link to the genteel 19th-century era of Edith Wharton and Henry James.         Beneath the surface of her impeccable manners, there was a playfulness that could sometimes startle those who mistook her refined manner and upper-class British accent as a sign of stodgy reserve.         ''How are you today, Mrs. Gibson?'' someone would ask. ''Full of beans,'' she would reply.         In recent years when the decorum of the park's affairs was marred by a sometimes rancorous squabble over the removal of some trees, Mrs. Gibson, who retained the admiration and respect of both factions, generally remained above the fray.         But a chorus of chortles echoed through the park when a newspaper account of the dispute quoted Mrs. Gibson (who could not believe that the perfectly nice reporter she had chatted with would repeat her exact words) as describing one of the disputants as ''a son of a bitch.''         Yet to those who knew her best, she remained such a model of gentle graciousness that the young women who took care of her marveled that even in her final days, when she barely had breath to speak after suffering a stroke, they never placed  her in her bed at night without hearing the labored, whispery words: ''Thank you, very much.''         She leaves no survivors.       
         Ella Maillart, a Swiss sportswoman, adventurer, travel writer and photographer who defied convention, hardship and international borders to explore forbidden territory and forbidding terrain, died on Thursday in her mountain chalet in Chandolin, Switzerland. She was 94.         She was the author of ''Forbidden Journey,'' an account of her 1935 trek to the closed city of Sinkiang in Chinese Turkestan.         During a life in which she was variously a French teacher in Wales, a secretary, a traveling saleswoman, an Olympic sailer, a competitive skier, a pioneer field hockey player, an actress, a sculptor's model and a movie stuntwoman, Ms. Maillart seemed most comfortable on the frontiers of social convention and  Western civilization.         The daughter of a well-to-do Geneva furrier and his athletic Danish  wife, Ms. Maillart grew up rich and restless.         An accomplished athlete who founded Switzerland's first women's field hockey club and was a member of the Swiss sailing team in the 1924 Olympics, Ms. Maillart was initially drawn to the sea.         She was a familiar figure on the Mediterranean in the 1920's and 30's and became something of a sensation in England after the commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet received an official reprimand because the entire fleet missed lights out while the Admiral entertained Ms. Maillart and three other yachtswomen.         She had to abandon a plan to sail the South Pacific with an all-female crew when her childhood sailing companion fell ill.         Instead, after a brief film career in Berlin in 1930, she went to Moscow, then walked across the Caucasus Mountains, tried to put together a women's field hockey team in Russia and rowed for a team called the Alimentation Workers' Eight.         A 1932 trip to Russian Turkestan whetted her appetite for Asian travel. An introduction to a Paris publisher by a noted yachtsman she had met on the Riviera helped her combine her wanderlust with professional purpose and led to two books, ''Turkestan Solo'' and ''Among Russian Youth: From Moscow to the Caucasus.''         In a 1993 interview with MarBy Blume in The International Herald Tribune, Ms. Maillart attributed her yearning for travel to her disgust with the horrors of World War I.         ''I wanted to leave Europe,'' she said, ''go as far as possible.''         Ms. Maillart, whose travel credo was ''Nobody can go? Then I shall go,'' was so determined to go where few Western men and virtually no women had gone before that she was willing to endure almost any hardship.         For her most famous journey, a harrowing 7-month, 3,500-mile trek from Beijing to Kashmir through  Chinese Turkestan in 1935, she set off with two pounds of marmalade, a  rifle, a bottle of Worcestershire  sauce, writing paper, a Leica camera and an unwieldy companion -- Peter Fleming, a Times of London correspondent and Ian Fleming's younger brother.         Both would have preferred to travel alone, but Ms. Maillart, knowing that foreigners were barred from the warlord-controlled territory, decided it might not be a bad idea to have a companion along in case she landed in prison.         Mr. Fleming, an acknowledged travel amateur, got the better part of the bargain: a companion who could design and make a tent, cook outdoors in freezing winds, sew and walk 14 miles without eating, and, as it happened, who was willing to wash his clothes as well as hers.         Or as he put it in his account of the journey, ''News Tartary,'' ''It was she, and not I, who did the dirty work.''         In the inevitable comparisons of their separate accounts of the journey, Mr. Fleming was considered the more elegant writer.         Ms. Maillart's book, a straightforward, workmanlike account of exactly what she saw, was written for the ages. In a thousand years, for example, her description of a child and newborn lambs on a yurt floor thick with their droppings will remain as authoritative an account of what things were like in Turkestan in 1935 as her photographs. Taken as notes, not as art, they were featured in a 1993 Paris exhibition.         Ms. Maillart, who often traveled alone -- on foot, on horseback, or by camel -- made another concession for a 1947 trek with a sick, morphine-addicted friend. She called the resulting book ''The Cruel Way: Two Women and a Ford in Afghanistan.''         Ms. Maillart, who leaves no immediate survivors, continued to travel, largely for her own amusement. But in recent years she cut back on her travels: She made her last trip to Tibet when she was 83 and had not traveled abroad since a visit to Goa three years ago.       
         Mildred Custin, who built Bonwit Teller into a leading fashion force in the late 1960's by introducing designers such as Pierre Cardin, Andre Courreges, Emanuel Ungaro and Calvin Klein to the American public, died Thursday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 91.         As president and then chairwoman of the 12-store Bonwit chain from 1965 to 1970, Ms. Custin used extensive retailing experience, superb taste and a sense of daring to impart a high-fashion image to what had been a traditional store selling the same clothing women could buy just about anywhere else. She gave some of the hottest names of the swinging 1960's boutiques in the store, and among the labels sold there were Norman Norell, James Galanos, Donald Brooks, Geoffrey Beene, Pauline Trigere and Rudi Gernreich.         Ms. Custin added masses of fresh flowers to Bonwit's flagship store at 721 Fifth Avenue, between 56th and 57th Streets, on the sites now occupied by Trump Tower and Niketown.  She filled the store with a series of boutiques, including the famous S'fari Room for trendy fashion, and turned the 57th Street side into a men's haberdashery.         It was a daring move at the time to try to sell men's wear in what had been strictly a women's specialty store. Ms. Custin offered her customers Cardin's neo-Edwardian silhouette, then considered radical, the first Bill Blass men's wear, Hermes ties from Paris and Turnbull & Asser shirts from London. At Christmas time, men were catered to with special shopping evenings.         Ms. Custin never lacked daring. She believed that women were better than men at the fashion business. ''We are more inclined than they are to take risks,'' she said in a New York Times interview in 1981. ''All women who have reached the top in fashion did it by risking their necks. If I saw something I liked, I'd fill the store with it. I trusted my judgment.''         Among the fortuitous decisions she made was to give Calvin Klein his first order, for $50,000, in 1968. ''I've told that story so many times,'' Mr. Klein recalled yesterday, ''of wheeling the rack of clothes up Fifth Avenue on a Saturday morning. It wasn't even a collection, it was just fall coats and dresses. She was so supportive to me in those early years with things stores don't do anymore, like free advertising.''         ''She was completely hands on,'' he added, ''totally involved in everything from the fresh flowers to the windows to the advertising. She had a little voice but was a very strong lady with a clear strategy and a vision that was very focused.''         She was also among the first merchants to give elaborate parties in the store, starting with a black-tie supper dance to introduce Norman Norell's first perfume in 1968.         Ms. Custin, a petite woman with silvery hair and a soft, little-girl voice, had a reputation for grace and charm, bulwarked by a capacity for working hard and inspiring others to do the same. In her first year at Bonwit's she noted that all the stores were closed on Washington's Birthday while the streets were crowded with pedestrians, all potential customers. So the next year, she convinced her employees to stay open on the holiday, and the people were in the store, not on the street.         She was born in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 25, 1906, and was reared in Boston, where she graduated from Simmons College. She spent 37 years honing her retailing skills before taking the reins at Bonwit's in New York. Her career began in 1928 in the controller's office at R. H. Macy & Company after she was rejected for the executive training program in retailing.         She returned to Boston and worked at Shepard's, a department store that no longer exists, and then at R. H. White's. In 1935, she went to John Wanamaker in Philadelphia, where she worked her way up from gift buyer to a vice presidency.         In 1958, she was named president of Bonwit Teller Philadelphia, a three-store chain that became part of Bonwit Teller New York in 1963. In Philadelphia she secured her reputation by transforming a drab, rundown store into a paragon of good taste by revamping window and interior displays, advertising and merchandising. It was there that she started sending chatty memos to charge customers along with their monthly bills, a practice she continued in New York.         Approaching Bonwit Teller's mandatory retirement age for executives of 65, Ms. Custin retired as chairwoman and started a new career as a consultant to retail and fashion businesses with her friend Jerrie Rosenberg, the former director of public relations for Bonwit's, as vice president.         It was Ms. Custin's involvement as consultant to the Esplanade, a shopping complex in Palm Beach, that led to her moving there in 1979. She ran her business until 1990.         Ms. Custin is survived by two nieces, Joan Custin of New York and Barbara Poverman of Chestnut Hill, Mass., a great-niece and two great-nephews.       
         Elizabeth Snapp, a publicity agent who worked primarily with composers and new-music ensembles, died on Friday at North Shore Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 50 and lived in Glen Cove.         The cause was cancer, said Carol Yaple, a friend.         Ms. Snapp began her career in the 1970's at the music publishing company G. Schirmer. In 1980 she formed her own company, E. Snapp, Inc. Her early clients included John Corigliano, William Schuman and Morton Gould. She also worked for Novello, the English publishing company, from 1980 to 1993, and was responsible for promoting the music of Richard Rodney Bennett, Aulis Sallinen, John McCabe and Tristan Keuris.         In the early 1990's her company expanded into the world of performance, with an emphasis on new music. One of her responsibilities was the Bang on a Can festival, which she assisted in its transition from a fringe group performing in East Village churches to a polished but still adventurous series at Lincoln Center. She also represented the American Youth Orchestra, the Pulse Percussion Ensemble, the American Composers Orchestra and composers including Hugo Weisgall, David Lang, Irwin Bazelon, Michael Gordon, John Luther Adams and Michael Nyman.         She is survived by her husband, Robert Pryor; two children, Shannon and Ben; a sister, Shannon Snapp Natale of Boston, and her mother, Auntrenette Snapp of Roanoke, Va.       
         Helene Hanff, whose wittily acerbic 20-year correspondence with a London bookseller she never met won her a passionate following after it was published as the epistolary memoir ''84, Charing Cross Road,'' died on Wednesday at the De Witt Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 80.         Up to the book's publication in 1970, Ms. Hanff was a relatively unheralded freelance writer whose work centered mainly on television screenplays and children's books. But the letters she addressed to the antiquarian bookshop Marks & Co. from 1949 to 1969, with their shared confidences and affectionate needling along with orders for Jane Austen and Izaak Walton, brought her a small if unanticipated literary celebrity.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Thomas Lask wrote: ''Here is a charmer: a 19th-century book in a 20th-century world. It will beguile an hour of your time and put you in tune with mankind.''         From the beginning of her correspondence, Ms. Hanff ignored the niceties of business letter writing. ''WHAT KIND OF A PEPYS' DIARY DO YOU CALL THIS?,'' she bellowed in an eccentrically capitalized letter of Oct. 15, 1951, after receiving a Marks & Co. shipment. ''this is not pepys' diary, this is some busybody editor's miserable collection of EXCERPTS from pepys' diary may he rot. i could just spit. where is jan. 12, 1668, where his wife chased him out of bed and round the bedroom with a red-hot poker?''         In his replies, Frank Doel, the shop's chief buyer and Ms. Hanff's principal correspondent, strove at first to maintain what she called his ''proper British reserve.'' But little by little, Ms. Hanff wore him down, as she did the other members of the shop's staff. They sent her recipes for Yorkshire pudding. She sent them food parcels and nylon stockings in a one-woman crusade to ameliorate Britain's postwar shortages. And Ms. Hanff often tempered her trans-Atlantic crankiness with rhapsodic soliloquies over the orders that Marks & Co. managed to get right.         ''The Newman arrived almost a week ago and I'm just beginning to recover,'' she wrote in 1950 after buying a first edition of John Henry Newman's ''Idea of a University'' (1852) for $6. ''I feel vaguely guilty about owning it. All that gleaming leather and gold stamping and beautiful type belongs in the pine-paneled library of an English country home; it wants to be read by the fire in a gentleman's leather easy chair -- not on a secondhand studio couch in a one-room hovel in a broken-down brownstone front.''         Despite her origins south of the Battery -- she was a native of Philadelphia -- Ms. Hanff was the Platonic New Yorker to her enchanted London correspondents. Her letters are a window on days spent picnicking in Central Park, rooting ardently for the Dodgers (and later the Mets) and wading into the fray of local politics (she was the first woman to serve as president of the Lenox Hill Democratic Club).         A constant undercurrent in Ms. Hanff's letters was the hand-to-mouth writing life she led, working at home in ''moth-eaten sweaters'' with an overflowing ashtray at her elbow and the gin bottle never far from reach. Despite repeated pleas from Marks & Company staff members to visit them in England (by the 1950's Frank Doel was offering her the use of his grown daughter's bedroom), Ms. Hanff's precarious finances never allowed her to make the trip until 1969, after Mr. Doel's sudden death from peritonitis.         Helene (pronounced heh-LAYNE) Hanff was born on April 15, 1916, in Philadelphia, the daughter of Arthur and Miriam Levy Hanff. She grew up in a theater-mad household (during the Depression, her father, a shirt salesman, took the family to the theater every week by slipping shirts to the box-office men in exchange for tickets), and all she ever wanted to be was a playwright.         Her career began auspiciously in 1938, when she won a fellowship from the Bureau of New Plays as a result of a nationwide competition. Soon afterward, she moved to Manhattan, where she became a protegee of Theresa Helburn, a co-producer of the Theater Guild. But although Ms. Hanff wrote 20 plays through the 1940's, none were ever produced. Her repeated attempts to succeed in New York theater are chronicled in her 1961 memoir, ''Underfoot in Show Business.''         ''I wrote great dialogue, but I couldn't invent a story to save my neck,'' she told The New York Times in 1982. In the 1950's, Ms. Hanff supported herself by writing screenplays for television programs including ''Playhouse 90,'' ''The Adventures of Ellery Queen'' and ''Hallmark Hall of Fame.''         A child of the Depression, Ms. Hanff could afford only a year of college, and throughout her life was an impassioned autodidact, educating herself by reading the great books, which she preferred to procure from London rather than dip into ''Barnes & Noble's grimy, marked-up schoolboy copies.'' One wall of her studio apartment on East 72d Street in Manhattan was filled from floor to ceiling with her Marks & Co. treasures, with their rich leather bindings and gleaming gold stamping. In front of the bookshelves hung the Marks & Co. sign, stolen for her by a devoted ''84'' reader from the shop after it closed, not long after Mr. Doel's death.         When Ms. Hanff decided to publish her correspondence with the shop as a memorial to Mr. Doel, the result brought her undreamed-of attention. ''84, Charing Cross Road'' was hugely popular in Britain, where it was adapted for the London stage by James Roose-Evans. (The play was less well-received on Broadway, where it ran in 1982 with Ellen Burstyn as Ms. Hanff and Joseph Maher as Mr. Doel.) In 1987 the book was made into a feature film starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins.         The book's success finally gave Ms. Hanff the wherewithal to travel to England, where she visited the boarded-up bookshop and met Mr. Doel's widow, Nora, a journey documented in ''The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street'' (1973). Ms. Hanff's other books include ''Q's Legacy'' (1986), ''Apple of My Eye'' (1977) and the children's titles ''Movers and Shakers'' (1969) and ''Terrible Thomas'' (1964).         ''It's unreal to me, what the last 10 years have been like,'' Ms. Hanff said in 1982. ''The fans -- people all over the world who regard me as a friend! And in London there is a brass plaque on the wall with my name on it, to mark the spot where the bookshop once stood, because I wrote letters to it. In your own mind you're still an uneducated writer who doesn't have much talent, and yet here you are with a plaque on the wall in London! You don't even dream about things like that.''         But ''84, Charing Cross Road'' could not provide its author with the economic stability she sought throughout her life. ''The one drawback about being a writer is that you never know in any month where the rent is coming from six months from then,'' Ms. Hanff told Publishers Weekly in 1985.         In her last years she was ''broke,'' by her own account, living on royalties and Social Security and accepting a $5,000 grant from the Authors League Fund to help pay her hospital bills.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice.         She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.         In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.         Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.         Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, ''Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer''.         While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.         During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.         An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.         A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled ''A World to Live In'' from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published ''Twice a Year,'' a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were ''The Selected Writings of John Marin'' (1949); ''Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend'' (1985) and ''Encounters: a Memoir'' (1987). In 1965 she published ''Nehru: The First Sixty Years,'' a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.         In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.         Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Frooks, who stumped for women's suffrage as a child, recruited thousands of men to World War I service as a teen-ager, and then spent most of the century as a lawyer and political gadfly, died on Sunday at Veterans Hospital in Manhattan. She was about 100 and lived in Manhattan and Peekskill, N.Y.         Among her many achievements were laying the groundwork for aid to dependent children and for small claims courts.         She served as chief yeoman in the Navy in World War I and as a judge advocate in the Army in World War II, taught school in Puerto Rico, ran a flying school, turned out columns for The New York World, wrote half a dozen books, founded The Murray Hills News, represented celebrated murder defendants, ran repeatedly for Congress, corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, feuded with Eleanor Roosevelt, hobnobbed with the King of Greece, turned down marriage proposals from Harry K. Thaw and Fiorello H. La Guardia, and so clouded the issue of her age that even her own family is not sure if she was 99 or 103.         But whether she was ''almost 17,'' in January 1918, as she put it in her her book ''Lady Lawyer,'' or 20, as a contemporaneous newspaper article reported, Miss Frooks, who received a gold medal from President Woodrow Wilson that month, was surely one of the last living Americans to have had a formal audience with Wilson in his White House office (and seen the evangelist Billy Sunday clap him on the back with such gusto that the President's top hat went flying.)         Whatever her age, by then she had a national reputation as ''the infant prodigy,'' ''the baby orator,'' and the girl who had made speeches for women's suffrage from Union Square to Hyde Park before turning her attention to military recruitment and Liberty Bonds.         The daughter of a prosperous businessman and an international society figure, Miss Frooks was born on a 400-acre Hudson Valley farm near Saugerties, N.Y., and grew up there and at the family's winter residence at the Waldorf Hotel.         As the seventh of nine highly articulate children, five of whom became lawyers, Miss Frooks recalled that she was holding her own in animated dinner table conversations on international affairs by the time she was 8 -- two years after she had decided on a legal career.         It was one of her mother's London society friends who spotted her talent for oratory and recruited her for the suffrage movement. Miss Frooks, who recalled making her first street-corner speech when she was 11, cut such a winsome figure in her little girl's bows and frills and spoke with such startling eloquence that she was always the first speaker at curbside rallies. The speakers who followed had learned they were less likely to be stoned or pelted with tomatoes when Miss Frooks led off.         She was even more impressive as an unofficial military recruiter, and after she had talked an estimated 30,000 men into signing up, primarily for the Navy, President Wilson not only presented her with a medal but recruited her for the Navy. As the highest-ranking woman in the service, Miss Frooks continued and expanded her recruitment activities and later organized a women's veterans organization.         Miss Frooks, who received a degree from the old Hamilton Law School in Chicago and then a master's from New York University, was a lawyer at 21, by her account.         By the early 1920's, at least, she was well known in New York as the first full-time lawyer for the Salvation Army. After setting up free legal clinics and discovering that poor people were often frustrated by their inability to collect small debts, she conceived the idea of a small claims court and lobbied hard until the first was signed into law by her old friend and suitor, Mayor La Guardia.         Thaw, the man who had killed the celebrated architect Stanford White 20 years earlier, hired Miss Frooks in 1926 to defend a 16-year-old girl who had killed the man who raped her when she was 12.         Miss Frooks, who eventually won a suspended sentence for her client,  became so incensed that the girl's widowed mother had been forced to neglect her children while struggling to eke out a living that she helped prod the legislature into establishing aid to dependent children.         The case also led to a ''My Day,'' column in The World, which lasted until 1932, when she was told that she was being replaced by Mrs. Roosevelt, a circumstance that may have contributed to her animosity toward the First Lady.         For all her childhood support of women's suffrage and her own legal career, Miss Frooks was no ordinary feminist. She made fiery speeches against the proposed equal rights amendment in 1975. As she had put it in 1922, ''Women should be in the home, have adorable husbands, and be the only wife.''         Miss Frooks, who was married in 1986, is survived by her husband, Jay P. Vanderbilt.       
         Judy Flannery, a late-blooming athlete who became an unlikely triathlon champion, was killed on Wednesday when she was struck by an automobile while on a bicycle-training ride near Poolesville, Md. A resident of Chevy Chase, she was was 57 and had won six American and four world age-group championships in the sport, which combines running, swimming and cycling.         According to the Montgomery County police, Ms. Flannery, who was nearing the midpoint of a 55-mile training ride with two friends, was killed when a car driven by an unlicensed 16-year-old driver swerved across the center line of the country road. The youth and his 38-year-old father, who was in the front passenger seat, received minor injuries. The police said yesterday that the incident was still under investigation and that no charges had been filed.         A native of Wilmington, Del., who graduated from the College of New Rochelle and worked as a biochemist before starting a family, Ms. Flannery grew up with a trim, athletic build in an age when girls were generally not welcome in athletics.         By the time her own four daughters were growing up, things were changing, especially at the Flannery household. Indeed, Ms. Flannery, who also had a son, spent so much time ferrying her brood to and from one athletic field or another that a daughter described her yesterday as ''the original soccer mom.''         Still, it was not until she was about 38, as she later recalled, that Ms. Flannery decided to find out what she had been missing.         ''I ran around the block,'' she said, and, as it happened, more or less kept on going: within a few years she was running marathons.         She might have stuck with distance running if a friend had not taken her to a triathlon one day. Immediately intrigued, Ms. Flannery, who was particularly attracted to the cycling phase, began training for the triathlon.         She was 47, and many of the women in the sport had been competing for decades, but within four years Ms. Flannery had pulled ahead of those in her age group.         She won the first of her six consecutive national championships in 1991, captured the first of her four world titles in 1992 and was so dominant in the United States that when she placed second last weekend in a race in Birmingham, Ala., the 55-year-old woman who beat her was described as stunned. No wonder. It was Ms. Flannery's first loss in a national age-group competition in six years.         Her proficiency as well as her popularity helps explain why the sport's national governing body, USA Triathlon, named her last month as the Master Female Triathlete of the Year.         A powerful runner who held her own in swimming, Ms. Flannery proved especially adept at cycling, so much so that she won five national age-group titles in time trials.         Although triathlons are staged over a varied combination of distances -- a mile swim, a 25-mile bicycle race and a 6.2-mile run in championship events, for example -- Ms. Flannery did not abandon her old sport of marathoning altogether. She competed three times in the grueling Hawaiian Ironman triathlon, which includes a full, 26.2-mile marathon, once placing second in her age group.         As enthusiastic about her sport as she was proficient in it, Ms. Flannery, a bubbly woman with a perpetual smile, was an accomplished recruiter who charmed thousands of women into taking up the sport while serving as chairwoman of the women's commission of USA Triathlon.         She was also an athlete of such uncommon modesty that she was never known to mention her victories. Those she had befriended and brought into the sport were inevitably startled to learn that the woman who had recruited them was a perennial champion.         For all the time she spent training and competing, Ms. Flannery was a regular volunteer at a local soup kitchen, but when it came to charity she preferred something a bit more robust. At the time of her death, for example, she and three cycling teammates were preparing to raise money to combat domestic violence by taking part in this summer's 3,000-mile Ride Across America.         Ms. Flannery is survived by her husband, Dennis; a son, Dennis, of Washington; four daughters, Erin of Santa Monica, Calif., Kelly of Collegeville, Pa., and Shannon and Megan, both of Washington, and a brother, David Sysko, of Wilmington.       
         Helene-Diane Shulman Kravis Ruger, an interior designer known professionally as Hedi Kravis, died on Wednesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Ms. Kravis, who maintained homes in Manhattan and Bedford, N.Y., was 49.         The cause was cancer, her son, Robert S. Kravis, said.         With her friend Elissa Cullman, known as Ellie, Ms. Kravis was a founding partner in 1984 of the Manhattan decorating firm of Cullman & Kravis.         They were among a new breed of interior designer -- young, chic, energetic and enterprising -- who were part of the society they designed for.         Their natural habitats were the Upper East Side and summer homes in the country. And instead of serving long apprenticeships with well-known decorators or taking courses in interior design, these women began by decorating their own apartments, their husbands' offices and their friends' country retreats.         For their clients, they enhanced the kind of settings they knew well -- spacious living rooms for parties, paneled libraries for leisure, tables hospitable to guests numbered in the dozens and richly canopied beds for slumber.         ''If you can really organize a household, you can do anything,'' Ms. Kravis said in an interview in 1987.         For one assignment, Ms. Kravis and her clients donned sunglasses and sun hats in the first week in January to imagine what summer would be like at a sprawling stucco and shingle house of 8,500 square feet on a site overlooking the Atlantic in East Hampton, L.I., where she had only six months to effect a transformation.         ''We imagined the landscaping and the not-yet-built tennis court,'' Ms. Kravis said, ''and thought what it might be like to walk through the house and out to play tennis.''         In 1987, Mrs. Cullman traced the origins of the firm to a movie script that she and Ms. Kravis showed to Stanley Jaffe, a film producer and old friend. ''His reaction was that we were talented, but could we help him refurbish his house in the country and pull his different homes together?'' she said. ''We were obsessive. We went down to the last details -- matchbook covers and guest towels.''         Both women married young, bore children, traveled, entertained, served on the boards of charities and collected antique English furniture, Chinese porcelain, American folk paintings and modern art.         Ms. Kravis, whose father, Bernard Shulman, was a psychiatrist, was born and reared in Brooklyn. She graduated from Finch College in 1969 and studied English at Columbia University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.         She was a member of the board of the Irvington Institute for Medical Research and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University. She also worked on behalf of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the American Jewish Committee.         Her marriage to Henry Kravis, the leveraged-buyout specialist, ended in divorce. Her second marriage, to J. Thompson Ruger, an executive of Sturm, Ruger & Company, manufacturers of firearms, was ended by his death in 1993.         In addition to her son, Ms. Kravis is survived by a daughter, Kimberly R. Kravis, and a sister, Sharon Beckerman, all of Manhattan.       
         Catherine McLeod, an actress whose headache-induced outburst -- ''Mother, please! I'd rather do it myself!'' -- became a national catch phrase in the early 1960's, died on Sunday at the Encino-Tarzana Medical Center in Encino, Calif. She was 75 and lived in nearby Sherman Oaks.         The cause was pneumonia, said her son Don Keefer Jr.         Before the 1963 Anacin commercial in which she erupted irritably in the kitchen, Ms. McLeod had been best known for her starring role in ''I've Always Loved You'' (1946), a romantic drama directed by Frank Borzage. Ms. McLeod was also featured in ''Courage of Lassie'' (1946), ''That's My Man'' (1947), ''The Fabulous Texan'' (1947), ''Old Los Angeles'' (1948), ''My Wife's Best Friend'' (1952) and ''Ride the Wild Surf'' (1964).         On television, she appeared in numerous live programs in the 1950's, as well as in episodes of ''Gun smoke,'' working with her husband, the actor Don Keefer.         Besides her husband and her son Don, of Studio City, she is survived by two other sons, John, of Santa Monica, and Tom, of Burbank, and a sister, Mary Jane O'Brien of West Covina.       
         Thelma Carpenter, whose long roller-coaster career as a singer took her to the heights with the big bands of the 1930's and 40's, out of show business into years as a file clerk and back to the big-time on Broadway in the 60's, was found dead on Thursday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 77.         Detective Thomas A. Frey of the 24th Squad said Ms. Carpenter's death appeared to be the result of natural causes.         ''I'm a singer first, last and always,'' Ms. Carpenter once said.         And indeed she was, from the time she was 7 and asked the manager of a radio ''Kiddies Hour'' for an audition until the end of her life, when she performed at places like Michael's Pub and on ''The Cosby Show.''         At the height of her career, the Brooklyn-born Ms. Carpenter, who combined a bubbling, buoyant personality with a pliant voice and a polished sense of showmanship, sang with such jazz greats as Teddy Wilson, Coleman Hawkins and Count Basie.         On the supper club circuit, she was a soloist at Julius Monk's Ruban Bleu, the Maisonette at the St. Regis and Bon Soir in Greenwich Village.         She made her Broadway debut in 1944 in ''Memphis Bound'' with Bill Robinson, appeared in ''Ankles Away'' with Beatrice Lillie, created the role of Irene Page in ''Bubbling Brown Sugar'' and took on a starring role in ''Dolly!'' in 1968 and 1969, when she became Pearl Bailey's standby and portrayed Dolly Levi more than 100 times.         She performed in such films as ''Hellzapoppin' '' (1941), singing with the Basie orchestra, ''The Wiz'' (1978) and ''The Cotton Club,'' Francis Ford Coppola's 1984 film about gangsters and Harlem nightlife.         On radio and television, Ms. Carpenter appeared with Eddie Cantor and Ed Sullivan, was a co-star of the ABC television series ''Barefoot in the Park'' and made guest appearances in everything from ''The Love boat'' to ''The Cosby Show.''         When ''Barefoot in the Park'' was canceled in 1970 after 13 weeks, as when she was out of show business for several years after her mother died in 1962, Ms. Carpenter, while disappointed, refused to turn bitter.         ''My grandaddy taught me something I've never forgotten,'' she said in a 1970 interview. ''What you need is so much more important to you than what you want. Anyway, I've never aspired to be a superstar. You talk about stardom, well, your nose bleeds up there. I got close enough to know. Suddenly there were people I'd never seen, telling me I owed them something. Listen, I've given my money away, where I thought it would help, but I don't want 'yes' people around me. Basically I'm a loner.''         Ms. Carpenter, who left no immediate family survivors, was an only child and never married. ''Yes, I've never married, though you might say,'' she said in 1970, ''that I've done lots of heavy rooming and light housekeeping in my time. Honey, I like life.''         Ms. Carpenter was still a student at Girls' Commercial High School of Brooklyn in 1939 when she was heard by John Hammond, the jazz enthusiast and recording executive who had started Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman and Count Basie on the way to stardom. Mr. Hammond put her on with Teddy Wilson's band at the Famous Door on 52d Street.         Later that year, Coleman Hawkins, the legendary jazz saxophonist, returned to the United States after five years in Europe, formed a band and looked for a singer. ''They make 'em like you in America?'' he asked when he saw Ms. Carpenter. ''You can have the job.''         Ms. Carpenter's career prospered in the United States and abroad, but when her mother died, she said, ''I just lay down in my bed for a whole year.'' Finally, when she needed money, she went looking for a job, applying at a personnel agency that found work as a file clerk at Duffy-Mott, makers of Mott's Applesauce.         When her friend Martha Raye told her there was going to be an all-black company of ''Hello, Dolly!'' Ms. Carpenter went to see the show when Ginger Rogers was playing the lead. ''Son of a gun, I could do that!'' Ms. Carpenter told herself. Pearl Bailey got the role, but when her original standby left, Ms. Carpenter took over the role.         ''I had to go out there and face an audience that had just been told that Pearl Bailey won't be there,'' Ms. Carpenter said. ''I decided I was either going to be Dolly or I wasn't going to be Dolly. 'You don't have to pay me,' I felt, 'just applaud me.' And when they'd stand up and cheer, I'd won.''         Correction:  May 30, 1997, Friday         An obituary of the singer Thelma Carpenter on May 17 misidentified the Broadway show in which she appeared with Beatrice Lillie. It was ''Inside U.S.A.,'' not ''Ankles Aweigh.''       
         Ethel Leah Heins, a specialist in  books for young readers, died on May 8 at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass. She was 79, and lived in Newton.         The cause was complications from a fall, said Gregory Maguire, a friend.         Mrs. Heins was a former editor of The Horn Book Magazine, a leading review journal of children's literature published in Boston. In all, her association with Horn Book spanned four decades, her last review, of Sharon Creech's ''Chasing Redbird,'' appearing in the current issue.         Another recent contribution by Mrs. Heins was a retelling of Russian fables by Ivan Krylov. She worked with a Russian translator to stay close to the author's language and spirit while mindful of the American child as the intended reader. ''The Cat and the Cook and Other Fables of Krylov'' appeared in 1995.         Mrs. Heins, who was born in Manhattan and whose name was originally Ethel Yaskin, graduated from Douglass College, Rutgers University in 1938.         She undertook graduate studies at Columbia and Harvard Universities while working as a children's librarian at the New York and Boston Public Libraries from 1938 to 1962.         Until 1974, she was a librarian and specialist in instructional materials for the Lexington public schools in Massachusetts. Her association with Horn Book began years before.         Mrs. Heins's husband, Paul, an English professor, author and translator of the Brothers Grimm, was editor of Horn Book from 1967 to 1974. She succeeded her husband as editor in 1974 and retired from the post 10 years later.         Mrs. Heins was a founder of the Center for the Study of Children's Literature at Simmons College in Boston, where she also taught as an adjunct professor for 10 years.         Mrs. Heins's husband died last year. She is survived by a son, Peter S. Heins of Thousand Oaks, Calif.; a daughter, Margery E. Heins of Shelburne Falls, Mass.; a sister, Miriam Heins of Ann Arbor, Mich., and two grandchildren.       
         Patricia Mason, a real-estate broker who handled the sales of some of New York's best-known properties in recent years and who was well-known as a horticulturist, died at St. Vincent's Hospital early yesterday. She was 71 and lived in Greenwich Village.         Her husband, Francis S. Mason Jr., said the cause was cancer.         Mrs. Mason joined the William B. May Company in 1968 and at the time of her death was a senior vice-president who specialized in sales of town houses in Greenwich Village.         One closely watched sale she arranged was the house at 19 Gramercy Park, which sold for $1.5 million in 1979. Benjamin Sonnenberg, a public relations executive, had bought two adjoining houses in 1933 and converted them to a 37-room six-story mansion. The ballroom was said to be the scene of some of the most fashionable parties of the 1940's.         Mrs. Mason also handled the sale of 128 East 19th Street; the property had belonged to the ballet promoter Lincoln Kirstein who died early last year. She donated her commission from that sale to the Lincoln Kirstein Fund at the School of American Ballet.         In addition, it was at her suggestion that the Stuyvesant-Fish House on Stuyvesant Street was recently donated to Cooper Union. F. Phillip Geraci, who bought the landmark building in 1967 and spent 12 years restoring it, was a friend and client. The house was built in 1802 as a wedding present for Elizabeth Stuyvesant and Col. Nicholas Fish; she was the great-granddaughter of Peter Stuyvesant.         The Masons were married in New York in 1952; in 1956 they went to Yugoslavia where they spent four years. Mrs. Mason represented the Lutheran World Relief and Church World Service. Mr. Mason was a cultural affairs officer with the United States Information Agency.         Mrs. Mason's interest in horticulture began during those years. Her gardens in Belgrade, London, Washington and New York were frequently shown on horticultural tours. The garden of her home on Morton Street in Greenwich Village and of her family home -- established 50 years ago by her mother, Leslie Ten Eyck Michaels, at Manursing Island in Rye, N.Y. -- were among the first to be shown to the public under the auspices of the Garden Conservancy, a national organization that works to preserve exceptional gardens.         Mrs. Mason was born in Miami Beach, graduated from Wellesley College in 1948 and received a master's degree from the London School of Economics the following year. In London she worked for the United Nations World magazine and later was on the staff of the International Labor Organization in Geneva. She returned to Manhattan in 1951.         She worked with horticultural groups including the Garden Conservancy, the rock garden committee of the New York Botanical Garden, the North American Rock Garden Society, the International Dendrological Society and Wave Hill, in the Bronx.         In addition to her husband she is survived by a son, Spencer Mason of Pforzheim, Germany; a daughter, Leslie Scarlett Mason of Manhattan, and one grandchild.       
         Dionis Coffin Riggs, a poet, author, newspaper columnist and civic leader who made Martha's Vineyard her home and her passion for the better part of a century, died on April 20 at Cleaveland House, the West Tisbury, Mass., boardinghouse where she had listened to seafaring tales as a child and told them as an old woman. She was 98 and had conducted her regular living room poetry seminar there less than a week before her death.         For someone who graduated from Girls' High School in Brooklyn, spent more than 30 years as a school principal's wife in Jersey City and had a later-life fling with poetry in Turkey, Mrs. Riggs had an uncommon attachment to Martha's Vineyard.         But as a descendant of Athearns, Mayhews, Butlers, Looks and other of the island's first families, Mrs. Riggs, who was born on Martha's Vineyard, in Edgartown, had its history in her blood and its turn-of-the-century sounds in her ears.         To the end of her life, Mrs. Riggs, who could remember when Edgartown's streets were paved with scallop shells, savored the recollected sounds of horses' hooves and wagon wheels crunching down Main Street.         She also had a keen ear for her sea captain grandfather's stories of adventure at sea and calamity at home. As Mrs. Riggs recounted it in her 1940 best seller, ''From Off Island,'' when her 28-year-old grandfather James F. Cleaveland returned from a voyage in 1852 with a 16-year-old Irish Catholic bride from Australia, his mother was not amused.         Indeed, the woman was so unwelcoming to her new daughter-in-law that the young woman talked her husband into taking her along on a five-year voyage. She returned triumphant with two daughters and enough tales to keep her granddaughter, Mrs. Riggs, enthralled for the rest of her life.         It was a family tragedy that gave Mrs. Riggs the opportunity to hear these and other tales firsthand. Her father, Thomas Coffin, a tea taster, left home when she was 3 and never returned, forcing her mother first to open a boardinghouse in Edgartown and later to leave her daughter with her parents to pursue teaching jobs in Pennsylvania and Brooklyn.         By the time Mrs. Riggs joined her mother for her high school years in Brooklyn, she had a fund of stories and a yen to tell them. But it was not until well after she had obtained a teaching certificate in New Jersey and had taught there just long enough to realize she couldn't stand it, that she began to find outlets.         After her 1922 marriage to Sidney Noyes Riggs, who worked as an experimenter with Thomas Edison before becoming a school principal, Mrs. Riggs, an inveterate club woman and volunteer, began writing plays for various women's clubs and later turned out numerous articles on Martha's Vineyard history.         A childhood interest in poetry had been suppressed. Her first effort drew such a bemused reaction from her older sisters, she later recalled, that she wrote no more poems for years. But after entering a poetry contest at the urging of a New Jersey friend and winning a $1 prize, Mrs. Riggs let go with a flood of pent-up poetry.         Her clear, simple and affecting poetic observations so delighted newspaper and magazine editors that she eventually published more than 1,000 poems, many in The Christian Science Monitor and her hometown newspaper, The Vineyard Gazette.         Mrs. Riggs, who always spent summers on Martha's Vineyard, retired there with her husband in 1954, and after his death in 1975 converted the sprawling family home into a bed and breakfast catering to poets.         When she visited a daughter in Turkey, where her son-in-law had been sent by the State Department, Mrs. Riggs became so involved with the local poetry scene that she helped translate hundreds of Turkish poems into English. Her desire to return and continue the work when she was almost 90 was thwarted because she failed to win a Fulbright Fellowship.         Mrs. Riggs, who was long active in virtually every civic organization in West Tisbury, especially enjoyed her weekly readings to schoolchildren (they called her ''cool'') and at a local nursing home, where she was older than her ''elderly'' listeners.         As the West Tisbury correspondent for The Vineyard Gazette, Mrs. Riggs always began her weekly column with a haiku (she enjoyed the challenge) and never overlooked an important event. Her last column, published two days before her death, included the news that a neighbor's goat had given birth to triplets.         She is survived by three daughters, Alvida Jones, Ann Fielder and Cynthia Riggs, all of West Tisbury; 14 grandchildren, and 22 great-grandchildren.       
         Anita Finkel, a dance writer and editor, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, said Leslie Getz McDonagh, a friend.         Ms. Finkel came to dance writing from an academic background. Born in Los Angeles, she earned one doctorate in English literature and another in linguistics at the University of California at Los Angeles, where she also taught. An expert on ice dancing and champion figure skating, she wrote about those fields and about dance for Ballet News, where she was also an editor, and for Dance International, Stage Bill, Geo and Connoisseur. Ms. Finkel also reviewed books for The Baltimore Sun and was an editor fo the Colliers Encyclopedia.         As a writer and editor, Ms. Finkel was known for her meticulous research and unequivocal opinions. In 1988, she founded New Dance Review, a brainy, impudent jounral that she published through 1995. She was a contributor to the Oxford University Press International Encyclopedia of Dance, which she helped to edit.         Ms. Finkel is survived by her father, Abraham Milton Finkel, and a brother, Robert, both of Los Angeles.       
         Frances Foster, a character actress, a stage director and a founding member of the Negro Ensemble Company, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Fairfax, Va. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and in Far Rockaway, Queens.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said Hattie Winston, a friend, who said Ms. Foster was in Virginia to attend a stepgrandson's high school graduation.         Ms. Foster was at the Negro Ensemble Company from 1967 until 1986, appearing in more than 25 of its productions. She won an Obie Award in 1985 for sustained excellence of performance.         The other honors she received included one of the company's Adolph Caesar awards in 1987 and two of the annual Audelco Awards, which honor achievement in black theater: a best actress award in 1978 for ''Do Lord Remember Me,'' and a best director award for 1983 for ''Hospice.'' Both plays were at the New Federal Theater in Manhattan.         Ms. Foster made her stage debut as Dolly May in ''The Wisteria Trees'' at the City Center Theater in 1955, and her talent proved durable. She won praise for her portrayal of a matriarchal Mississippi grandmother in Leslie Lee's 1990 play ''Ground People.'' Reviewing it when it opened at the American Place Theater, Mel Gussow of The New York Times wrote, ''Just sitting in her kitchen, lining the thin soles of her shoes with paper while telling tales of her midwifery, Ms. Foster is a moving presence, as she has been in many other plays.''         Another critic, reviewing the play ''You Have Come Back,'' set in Algeria, at St. Clement's Church in Manhattan in 1988, wrote, ''Frances Foster gives such a superb performance as the 103-year-old nurse that it is a revelation just to watch her move about the stage, creating an old Algerian woman out of a few lines.''         And Frank Rich of The Times wrote admiringly in 1985 that Ms. Foster was ''a big woman'' with ''a big repertory of comic voices, ranging from a raspy belt to a maternal croon to a ditsy English matron's stiff-upper-register.''         Her work in television included acting in daytime television staples like ''One Life to Live,'' ''Ryan's Hope'' and ''All My Children.'' She also appeared in the Spike Lee movies ''Malcolm X'' (1992) and ''Crooklyn'' (1994) and in other films. She was on the Actors Equity Association council from 1953 to 1967 and an artist in residence at City College of New York from 1973 to 1977.         Ms. Foster, born Frances Brown in Yonkers. where she was brought up,  studied acting at American Theater Wing in Manhattan from 1949 to 1952.         She married Robert Standfield Foster in 1941. He died in 1977.         She is survived by her husband of 14 years, Morton Goldsen; a son, Terrell Foster, of San Francisco; three stepchildren; six stepgrandchildren, and a sister, Beverly Tate of Far Rockaway.       
         Joan Daves, a leading literary agent whose client list included six Nobel Prize winners, died on Wednesday at her home in Bedford, N.Y. Ms. Davis, who also had a home in Manhattan, was 77.         Her husband, Joe H. Kirchberger, said the cause was an acute asthmatic attack.         For decades, Ms. Daves was regarded as one of the world's foremost agents for serious and intellectual fiction and nonfiction. Her Nobel Prize-winning clients included Heinrich Boll (1972), Elias Canetti (1981), Herman Hesse (1946), the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1964), Nelly Sachs (1966) and Gabriela Mistral (1945). All but Dr. King, who won the Nobel Peace Prize and took Ms. Daves with him to Stockholm when he received the award, were laureates in literature.         Ms. Daves (pronounced DAY-vis) also represented such renowned authors as Frank O'Connor, Isaac Babel, Vaclav Havel and Rachel Carson, the trailblazing environmentalist who wrote ''Silent Spring'' and ''The Sea Around Us.''         ''She loved these authors, which conjures up another world; it wasn't the fast buck,'' said Jennifer Lyons, who became her associate when Ms. Daves affiliated her one-woman agency in 1987 with a larger Manhattan agency, Writers House, to secure the interests of her authors as she grew older. ''There was a real passion for authors themselves, for artists and for literature that is rare today.''         Robert Weil, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press, recalled that Ms. Daves became familiar with Dr. King in the early 1950's before he achieved national prominence while leading the 1955 boycott of the segregated transit system in Montgomery, Ala.         Mr. Weil said Ms. Daves told a friend that there was an extremely articulate, charismatic and visionary minister from the South she had to meet. ''She could spot very early people's genius and people's talent,'' Mr. Weil said. ''She also sided with the underdog.''         In addition, Mr. Weil said: ''She was literature. She was a brilliant critic, a brilliant reader. She was extremely nurturing. She had a social flair as well. She was a great person to put together people as if she ran a salon in New York which combined the writers of post-World War II European literature with the needs of American publishers.''         In the sale of American rights, the Joan Daves Agency also represented a number of distinguished foreign publishers, like Kinderbuch Verlag of Switzerland, the German concerns Carl Hanser Verlag of Munich and Verlag Kipenheuer und Witsch of Cologne, and the Austrian concern Residenz Verlag of Salzburg.         Ms. Daves, who was later to Americanize her name, was born in Berlin in 1919 and grew up as Liselotte Davidson. She was the middle child and younger daughter of a Jewish banker who was to die in Auschwitz.         In the mid-1930's after the Nazis came to power, her father sent her to Paris, where she became fluent in French. She was forced to return to Berlin when the Nazis imposed currency restrictions on Jews, but she reached Britain in 1938 and followed her sister to the United States in 1940, settling in New York City.         An avid reader who was always interested in books, she worked for a couple of years for Interscience Publishers, publishers of scientific books and books by refugees. In 1942, she went to work as an editor for Harper & Brothers, where she started the Harper's Art Library, which issued books about Durer and Flemish and French master drawings.         In the early 1950's she established the Joan Daves Agency and used her European connections to attract the Continent's foremost writers.         Besides her husband, Ms. Daves is survived by a brother, Peter Davidson of Las Vegas.         In 1992, in ceremonies at the consulate in Manhattan, Ms. Daves was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in recognition of a lifetime of advancement of German culture and literature.       
         Dorothy Buffum Chandler, whose vision and fund-raising fervor helped transform modern Los Angeles and who as the wife and mother of successive publishers helped turn The Los Angeles Times into one of the nation's great newspapers, died on Sunday at a rest home in Hollywood. She was 96.         Mrs. Chandler's greatest single achievement was probably her nine-year drive in the late 1950's and early 60's to finance and build the Music Center of Los Angeles County, which revitalized the city's downtown district and fused old-line society with the newer wealth of Hollywood.         The opening of the center in 1964 earned her a spot on the cover of Time magazine and an accompanying article that declared her effort to get it built as ''the most impressive display of virtuoso money-raising and civic citizenship in the history of U.S. womanhood.''         The next year, the center's largest auditorium, which has become a frequent home to the Academy Awards ceremonies, was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.         Gov. Pete Wilson of California called Mrs. Chandler ''the heart and soul of Southern California's cultural life.'' Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles told The Los Angeles Times that ''her imprint will be part of Los Angeles for many centuries to come,'' particularly its cultural life.         Dorothy Buffum was born in Lafayette, Ill., and moved with her family to Long Beach, Calif., when she was a toddler. Her father and uncle opened a dry-goods store in Long Beach that eventually grew into the chain of Buffum's department stores, a fixture of Southern California until the 1980's.         She met Norman Chandler, the son of Harry Chandler, publisher of The Los Angeles Times, at a dance at Stanford University, and they married in 1922.         During the years that Norman Chandler trained to be publisher and worked his way through the newspaper's executive echelons, Mrs. Chandler raised their daughter, Camilla, and son, Otis, and did volunteer work for the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and other institutions.         When Harry Chandler died in 1944, Norman Chandler took over as publisher, and four years later his wife was named his administrative assistant. Her presence was quickly felt within the newspaper, particularly in the coverage of women and the arts. She was instrumental in inaugurating the paper's Women of the Year awards, which were given to more than 200 women between 1950 and 1976.         ''She was just really a ball of fire with whatever she set her mind to, whatever she wanted to get done,'' said James Bellows, a former editor of The New York Herald-Tribune and The Washington Star who was associate editor of The Los Angeles Times in the late 1960's and early 70's. ''She really worked at the role of women in the city, and was very involved in setting up the Women of the Year. She was very concerned that it reflect the diversity of the city and that it be given to women for their achievements and not just for social activities.''         Mr. Bellows said he found Mrs. Chandler to be ''tough, but not intractable,'' someone who knew her mind, was willing to debate and listen to argument and who eventually ''usually got her way.''         Mrs. Chandler's role as a civic fund-raiser began in earnest in 1950, when she undertook a successful drive to save the Hollywood Bowl. A few years later she began her effort to build the Music Center, eventually raising $19 million and forming a committee to float an additional $13.7 million in bonds that were guaranteed by the county.         ''She was a critical figure in the modernization of Los Angeles,'' said David Halberstam, whose book, ''The Powers That Be,'' chronicled the newspaper's rise under Mrs. Chandler's husband and son. ''If you're charting the coming of a big, sleepy, conservative community into the modern, affluent, increasingly sophisticated metropolis that exists today, she may be the single most important player.''         At the time, Mr. Halberstam said, Los Angeles was split between an older establishment centered in the downtown area and a newer establishment in Hollywood and farther to the west.         ''Culturally, she helped connect West Los Angeles with downtown Los Angeles, two communities that 40 years ago had almost nothing in common and barely spoke the same language,'' he said. ''It was her drive, energy, ambition and even hubris that connected them.''         Otis Chandler succeeded his father as the paper's publisher in 1960 and held that post for 20 years, though Norman Chandler remained an executive with the company until his death in 1974. Mrs. Chandler strongly supported her son's efforts to improve the quality of the newspaper and to raise it to the ranks of the nation's finest. Otis Chandler is now a board member of the Times Mirror Corporation, which owns the newspaper.         In later years, Mrs. Chandler served on numerous boards and Presidential commissions, devoting special attention to the University of California. She was among three women chosen by President Lyndon B. Johnson to visit South Vietnam in 1967 to assess the status of the American war effort. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan included her in the first group of winners of the National Medal of Arts.         She is survived by her son; her daughter, Camilla Chandler Frost, eight grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.         Anecdotes about Mrs. Chandler's fund-raising prowess are numerous.         One friend recalled how she tore up a $20,000 check from a wealthy businessman and handed it back to him, telling him that it was unacceptably paltry. At a private dinner where she was a guest, just weeks before the Music Center was to open, Mrs. Chandler is said to have stood up after coffee was served and gone from person to person collecting money in a large, blue bag.         ''I think of myself as a catalyst,'' she said in an interview shortly after the Music Center opened. ''There are so many people with good ideas and good intentions. They doubtless know more about the arts than I do. But I pull them together. That's my job.''       
         Alexandra Danilova, an internationally popular ballet star known for her vivacity and theatrical flair, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Beloved by audiences in a performing career that extended from the Imperial Russian Ballet of St. Petersburg to Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes of the 1920's and the various Ballets Russes companies that succeeded it, Miss Danilova was also a noted teacher and for many years a faculty member of the School of American Ballet, the New York City Ballet's school.         She was known to friends by the nickname Choura, and admired for her Champagne-like sparkle and a stage presence so intense that she could command attention even when she was not moving. With her heart-shaped face and dark brown hair, she was striking to behold. She was also celebrated for possessing what were considered the most beautiful -- and photogenic -- legs in ballet. Lincoln Kirstein, the New York City Ballet's director, once called them ''legs like luminous wax.''         Yet Miss Danilova did more than personify glamour. Extraordinarily versatile, she danced roles that ranged from the passionate Swan Queen in ''Swan Lake'' to the mischievous Swanilda in ''Coppelia'' and the worldly heroines of Leonide Massine's balletic comedies, ''Le Beau Danube'' and ''Gaite Parisienne.'' Although she particularly enjoyed dramatic roles, she also danced abstract ballets. George Balanchine, her schoolmate from St. Petersburg, created ''Danses Concertantes'' in 1944 for her and for Frederic Franklin, the English-born dancer who was her partner at the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from the late 1930's through the 50's.         She appeared in many experimental productions, including, in the Soviet Union, Fyodor Lopukhov's ''Dance Symphony'' of 1923, among the first abstract symphonic ballets. Artistically inquisitive, Miss Danilova once said: ''I have been so lucky. All my life I have worked with the avant-garde. That developed me enormously as an artist, much more than if I had danced just 'Swan Lake' and 'Giselle.' ''         She was born in Peterhof, Russia, near St. Petersburg, on Nov. 20, 1903, and orphaned when she was a small child. She was brought up by relatives and foster parents. When they discovered that the little girl loved to dance, they wondered if there might be a career in ballet for her, and she was accepted by the Imperial Ballet School in 1911. In 1920, she entered the Maryinsky Ballet, the company now known as the Kirov Ballet.         As a young dancer, she was caught up in the artistic ferment after the Bolshevik Revolution. Not only did she appear in the experiments of Lopukhov, but she also became a friend of Balanchine, at that time an experimental young choreographer. Along with several other dancers, she and Balanchine left the Soviet Union in 1924 on what was intended to be a tour of Western Europe. But that same year, she and Balanchine were accepted by Diaghilev: Miss Danilova as a dancer, Balanchine as a choreographer.         Until 1931, she and Balanchine lived together as husband and wife, although they were never married. Balanchine was still officially married to another dancer, Tamara Geva, and he told Miss Danilova that because his marriage papers had been left behind in Russia, he feared it might be difficult to arrange a legal separation.         When Diaghilev died in 1929, Miss Danilova said she felt as if the ground had collapsed beneath her feet. A few years later, however, she danced with the Ballets Russes, which Col. W. de Basil organized in 1933 as a successor to the Diaghilev company. In 1938, she became prima ballerina of a rival company, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, in part because its resident choreographer was Massine, whom she admired only slightly less than Balanchine. The coming of World War II turned the Ballet Russe into an American company and, often partnered by Mr. Franklin, she toured across the country until the early 1950's, appearing in the classics, in ballets by Massine and in works by other choreographers, including Balanchine.         Miss Danilova, who became an American citizen in 1946, was twice married, to Giuseppe Massera in 1934 and to Casimir Kokitch in 1941. Both marriages ended in divorce, and Miss Danilova said in ''Choura,'' her autobiography, which was published in 1986: ''I sacrificed marriage, children and country to be a ballerina, and there was never any misunderstanding on my part: I knew the price.''         She also wrote, ''In a way I regard American audiences as my children, because I helped to educate them.''         Many dancegoers who saw her with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo would agree to that. Miss Danilova gained the reputation of being an artist who was never slack and who gave one-night appearances in tiny villages the same loving care that she bestowed upon seasons at the Metropolitan Opera House.         ''I never danced for an audience that I thought was unworthy of my performance,'' she once declared. She said she believed that a ballerina should always be glamorous, onstage or off. In her autobiography, she wrote: ''Every woman has an image -- mother, princess, ballerina -- that she must uphold. I was privileged to be a ballerina and I, therefore, had a duty to my audience. They must never be disappointed in me.''         Miss Danilova was often in demand as a guest teacher around the country. She also coached works from the classical repertory, and in 1974, she and Balanchine staged ''Coppelia'' for the New York City Ballet. She appeared on Broadway in ''Song of Norway'' in 1944 and ''Oh, Captain'' in 1958 and in the movie ''The Turning Point'' in 1976. In 1958, she received the Capezio Award.         No immediate family members survive. A funeral service for Miss Danilova will be held at 5 P.M. on Thursday at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.         Although she was long reluctant to return to Russia, Lewis Ufland, her former manager, said yesterday that Miss Danilova did go back several years ago. She visited St. Petersburg as part of the trip, and was able to attend graduation performances at the Kirov School, the former Imperial Ballet School she had attended as a child. The faculty enthusiastically welcomed her as one of that institution's greatest alumnae.       
         Kay Halle, a glamorous Cleveland department store heiress who cut a heady swath through the 20th century firmament, befriending and bewitching luminaries on both sides of the Atlantic and serving as a perceptive gadfly in politics, society and the arts, died on Aug. 7 at her home in Washington. She was 93.         During a remarkable life in which she formed enduring intimate relationships with George Gershwin, Randolph Churchill, W. Averell Harriman, Joseph P. Kennedy, Walter Lippmann, Buckminster Fuller and scores of other diverse figures, Miss Halle demonstrated such a flair for friendship and a knack for bringing people together that it is a wonder she found time for anything else.         She had a creditable enough career in journalism and with American intelligence in World War II. But Miss Halle, who wrote for The Cleveland Plain Dealer and other publications, conducted radio interviews with public figures and provided intermission commentary for Cleveland Orchestra broadcasts, was at her best in private settings.         A tall, slender, blonde beauty who kept her youthful good looks well beyond middle age and whose infectious enthusiasm continued long after that, Miss Halle (pronounced HAL-ee) once showed a friend a list of 64 men who had proposed to her, among them a youthful Randolph Churchill and an aging Averell Harriman.         (For all her reputation as a femme fatale, the ''Mata Halle'' nickname that William J. Donovan pinned on her during her years with his wartime Office of Strategic Services was more pun than analogy to the World War I seductress.)         Given the range and ardor of her admirers, one of Miss Halle's more notable achievements may have been avoiding marriage and thriving in an era when even independently wealthy spinsters were viewed with suspicion.         Seeking safety in numbers, she became famous for surprising wealthy suitors by showing up for dinner dates with several less well-heeled admirers in tow.         Even more notable was the fact that she remained on such good terms with her spurned suitors. Thirty years and two marriages after he was first rejected, for example, Mr. Churchill was still as devoted to her as ever.         That was partly because Miss Halle was such an attentive listener that she could repeat entire conversations verbatim, making her a reliable and entertaining gossip.         For all that, she had such a passion for discretion that long after most of her paramours were dead, including those who had not been free to propose marriage, she refused all entreaties to write her memoirs. Even intimates who are certain, for example, that she had been Joseph Kennedy's favorite mistress cannot say for sure whether her friendship with Gershwin, who wrote her gushing letters, had been a full-fledged romance.         A product of a fairy-tale union between a wealthy German-Jewish merchant and an Irish-Catholic working girl, Miss Halle, whose father was a founder of the old Halle Brothers department store in Cleveland, grew up in an ecumenical, intellectually charged atmosphere that left her without prejudice or pretension and with an eclectic range of interests, especially in people.         Her survivors include a sister, Ann Little of Chagrin Falls, Ohio.         Making the most of her family connections and even more of those she formed on her own, Miss Halle got her start in political society early. During a family visit to Washington when she was 13, President Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker, a former Cleveland mayor, had a young assistant, Walter Lippmann, show her around. He got her admitted to a special session of Congress, making her perhaps the last person alive to have witnessed Wilson's request for a declaration of war in April 1917.         Later, after one boring year at Smith College, Miss Halle took New York by storm, captivating Gershwin and making her apartment a headquarters of the roaring 20's.         She broadened her scope considerably after Randolph Churchill gave a speech in Cleveland in 1931 and fell in love with her. Although Miss Halle, who was eight years older than he was, kept him at bay, she became a frequent visitor to Chartwell, the Churchill country home in England, and a favorite of his father, Sir Winston Churchill.         As a result, Miss Halle, who was an old friend of Franklin D. Roosevelt and campaigned for him in 1932, became one of the few people to be on intimate family terms with the two wartime leaders.         Miss Halle, who made Washington her base after World War II, became such a Churchill enthusiast that she published two volumes of his collected sayings and was credited with using her considerable drawing room influence to persuade Congress to confer the honorary American citizenship that he considered his most prized public tribute.       
         Loretta Blum, a fashion retailer in Dallas for more than 20 years, died on Saturday at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. She was 64 and lived in Dallas.         The cause was a stroke, said Bud Knight, a friend and former colleague.         At the time of her death, Ms. Blum was operating the Loretta Blum Boutique in Preston Center Plaza. She had no business partners or immediate family, and the boutique will close on Saturday after a memorial service for Ms. Blum.         Ms. Blum became prominent on the Dallas fashion scene with the opening of the first boutique bearing her name in 1973 in the Highland Park area. There she sold the designs of Emanuel Ungaro, Valentino, Krizia, Oscar de la Renta, Scaasi and Franco Moschino, among others. Her clientele, Mr. Knight said, was ''the Dallas woman who had a passion for fashion, as she did.''         She also opened an Ungaro boutique next door to her main store, a Miss B shop for the younger customer, and a Christofle boutique. Her shops flourished during the Texas boom years of the 1970's and 1980's but succumbed to the economic downturn in the late 80's. Ms. Blum managed to hold on until 1992, when she closed her businesses.         The next year she returned with a boutique in the Lester Melnick store. In 1994 she opened the current Loretta Blum shop.         She had worked as a buyer for Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue before going into business for herself.         Ms. Blum was born in Kehoka, Miss., attended Ohio State University and graduated from the Tobe-Coburn fashion school in New York City.       
         The death at 36 of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car crash in Paris brought to a tragic close the life of a woman who had gone from being a shy young society girl to one of the world's most glamorous women.         Her marriage to Prince Charles, heir to the British throne and 12 years her senior, on July 29, 1981, was one of those events that people remember as a timepost in their own lives, a moment of old fashioned romance and royal splendor seldom seen in this century. Fifteen million people in Britain alone watched it on television.         The unraveling of that marriage was just as public, with the extraordinary occurrence of candid television interviews by the two partners about their separate adulteries and the descent of the young Princess into eating disorders and suicide attempts.         Though the marriage ended officially with their divorce a year ago Aug. 28, the rivalry for public attention and approval continued until her death. This year the Princess had taken highly publicized trips to former war zones like Angola to conduct her high-profile campaign against landmines, and had in recent weeks posed knowingly on Mediterranean holidays with her friend, Emad Mohammed al-Fayed, 42, in an apparent effort to show the world that the once troubled young woman had found personal happiness.         Prince Charles, for his part, held the first photo calls at his vacation home in Balmoral since the early days of his marriage, appearing with the couple's two sons, William, 15, the next heir to the throne, and Harry, 13. It was a competition conducted by photo opportunity, and in the Princess's case turned a liability she often complained about, the constant attention of paparazzi, into an asset.         Lady Diana Spencer was born on July 1, 1961, Sandringham, Norfolk, and was only 19 years old when Charles proposed. Her son William was born in June, 1982, providing promised continuity to the crown and making her the mother of a king-to-be.         By 1986 the first press stories about cracks in the marriage appeared, at a time, a biography of the Princess has said, when Charles had resumed his relationship with his married friend Camilla Parker Bowles.         That biography ''Diana: Her True Story,'' by Andrew Morton, said she then started dating a cavalry officer, James Hewitt, conducting an affair that lasted four years and which she later said had hurt her.         The royal couple had few common interests. Charles loved horses, his garden and traditional architecture; she loved buying clothes, listening to pop music on her Walkman and gossiping on the telephone.         Once a girl in frilly modest-maiden dresses and a modified bowl haircut, she had become a fashionplate with annual expenses of more than $1.2 million, a woman whose every style change influenced the way women around the well dressed world appeared. Just this past June, 80 of her dresses were auctioned off for charity at Christie's in New York, promoted in a lavish catalogue shot by Lord Snowden, the former husband of Princess Margaret.         The couple separated in 1992, and in November 1995, Diana gave her explosive interview to the BBC confessing her own adultery, her anger at the palace and her feeling that Charles would not be a good King. It became widely reported that her wish was that Charles renounce his right to the crown, passing it on to their son William, known to the British public as Wills.         In the divorce she had to give up the honorific Her Royal Highness, the title that separates the royal family's inner circle from other nobles and aristocrats, but was able to keep the title Princess of Wales. She obtained lump sum payment of $22.5 million and $600,000 a year to maintain her offices. She also got the right to keep her five-bedroom, four-reception-room apartment at Kensington Palace.       
         Pilar Miro Romero, a pioneering female director of movies and television who also fostered Spain's film industry by introducing state aid for promising young filmmakers when she served in the Socialist Government of the 1980's, died at her home here on Sunday. She was 57.         She collapsed from a heart attack, doctors said. She had undergone surgery in 1975 to be outfitted with two heart valves, and they were replaced in a second operation in 1985.         King Juan Carlos, a friend of Ms. Miro's since they were law students in Madrid 40 years ago, paid condolences at the city morgue on Sunday. Just two weeks ago, she directed Spanish state television's coverage, beamed worldwide, of the wedding in Barcelona of the King's daughter Princess Cristina.         Ms. Miro's film ''Beltenebros,'' a tale of intrigue about the resistance during Franco's dictatorship, won a Silver Bear award at the Berlin Film Festival in 1992. Her movie ''El Perro del Hortelano,'' an adaptation of a 17th-century Spanish comedy about palace romance, garnered seven prizes, including best director, at this year's Goya Awards, Spain's top film honors.         Ms. Miro, who became the first woman to direct dramas for Spanish television in 1966, was known for her link to progressive causes like the fight against racism. She won respect even from many leading conservatives, who attended her funeral today.         As the Culture Ministry director of cinema from 1982 to 1985, she began Government subsidies to cash-starved young filmmakers. Among the directors who acknowledged the benefit were Pedro Almodovar, nominated for an Oscar in 1989 for ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' and Fernando Trueba, who won the foreign-film Oscar in 1994 for ''Belle Epoque.''         Born on April 20, 1940, in Madrid, Ms. Miro studied law at the University of Madrid but switched her interest to cinema and began working at state television in 1960. She directed her first feature-length film in 1975, and her 1979 movie ''El Crimen de Cuenca'' was censored for almost two years in Spain for depicting a torture scene by Civil Guards. When it finally opened, it was a top box office attraction.         In 1982, she was a media adviser to Felipe Gonzalez when he was elected for the first time as Prime Minister, starting nearly 14 years of Socialist Party rule. Ms. Miro served in his administration, first in the Culture Ministry, then as Director General of state television and radio. She resigned from that post in 1989 during a controversy over her spending some $30,000 in Government funds for her personal wardrobe. She paid back the money and was cleared of wrongdoing by a court in 1992.         Her subsequent projects included directing television coverage, in 1995, of the royal wedding in Seville of Princess Elena, the King's eldest daughter.         Mr. Gonzalez attended the funeral today, as did the Spanish tenor Placido Domingo, whom Ms. Miro had seen perform at the Royal Theater opera house in Madrid the night before she died. The large crowd also included Princess Cristina and her husband, making their first public appearance since their wedding, and NATO's Secretary General, Javier Solana, formerly a Socialist minister under Mr. Gonzalez.         Ms. Miro is survived by a son, Gonzalo, and a brother, Carlos.       
         Merian Lovelace Kirchner, the little girl whose pleadings for just one more bedtime story gave birth to a beloved series of children's books, died on Sept. 25 at a hospital on Staten Island. She was 66 and the daughter of Maud Hart Lovelace, the creator of the Betsy-Tacy books.         Friends said the cause was emphysema.         It was her mother who lived and wrote the Betsy-Tacy life, not so much creating as copying her characters whole from her own turn-of-the-century childhood in Mankato, Minn., or Deep Valley, as it is known in the 10 main Betsy-Tacy books and three satellite volumes.         But it was little Merian Lovelace, growing up in the 1930's in Garden City, Long Island, who first demonstrated that her mother's girlhood had more than passing appeal. She pestered her mother so often for a new story about Betsy Ray and her friend Tacy Kelly that Mrs. Lovelace, who had concentrated on short stories and historical novels, decided to put Betsy and Tacy on paper.         The result has been something of a literary cult.         For although Betsy Ray and Tacy Kelly have never quite achieved the stature of, say, Nancy Drew, they have spawned a 1,000-member Betsy-Tacy society and a Betsy-Tacy home page (http://virtuflex.com/ Betsy-Tacy/), and they have turned Mankato into a tourist attraction.         Aside from the fact that Betsy was an uncommonly independent young heroine, a bustle-era girl who took her own ambitious career plans for granted, the books have exerted a special appeal because unlike Nancy Drew, who was blond, perfect and 18 forever, Betsy and her friends grew older in each successive book.         When the first book, ''Betsy-Tacy,'' covering Betsy's meeting with Tacy at age 5, was published in 1940, Mrs. Kirchner was 9. By the time she got to Smith College, she was something of a minor celebrity, letting her classmates read the proofs of the latest installment.         The last book, ''Betsy's Wedding,'' was published in 1955, a year after her marriage to Englebert Kirchner, a German-born writer.         As the daughter of a woman who turned her own childhood into literary fodder, Mrs. Kirchner might have been expected to continue the tradition.         But except for a column she wrote for the Betsy-Tacy Society newsletter, she showed little interest in her childhood and none in fiction.         Not that Mrs. Kirchner was especially rebellious. It was just that she decided to follow in the footsteps of her father, Delos Lovelace, a Minnesota-born journalist who was once city editor of the old New York Sun. (He was also the author of the novelization of the movie ''King Kong,'' which helps explain why he named his daughter after the movie's director, Merian C. Cooper.)         Settling in Greenwich Village as her parents had done a generation earlier, Mrs. Kirchner held a series of jobs in journalism, contributing to a book on civil rights for Newsfront Publishers, working as a freelance book editor, and ending her career as a senior writer for the magazine Medical Economics.         After her mother's death in 1980, Mrs. Kirchner helped keep the Betsy-Tacy flame alive, working closely with the Betsy-Tacy Society and campaigning for reissues of the books. Her husband died in 1992.         For all her role in the creation of the Betsy-Tacy series, Mrs. Kirchner never appeared as a character, except by implication.         At the end of ''Betsy's Wedding,'' as her husband, Joe, is about to go off to World War I, Betsy speaks of their plans to have a little girl named Bettina, not realizing, perhaps, that in time the little girl would make her mother write it all down.       
         Mary Jayne Gold, a Chicago heiress who used some of her fortune to help prominent Jewish or anti-Nazi artists like Chagall flee Nazi-occupied France, died on Sunday at her home near St.-Tropez on the French Riviera. She was 88.         Miss Gold, who attended finishing school in Italy and joined the lively Paris scene in the 1930's, moved to Marseilles shortly after German forces invaded France in June 1940. There she began working with an Emergency Rescue Committee formed by an American journalist, Varian Fry, to aid thousands of refugees who had fled the Gestapo.         Although Marseilles was in an  area of southern France that was not seized by the Nazis until 1942, it was under the control of the collaborationist Vichy regime led by Marshal Philippe Petain. The committee's main goal was to get the refugees, many of them Jews, either to North Africa or through Spain to Portugal. From there, many could make it to the United States or Cuba.         The committee, which included a former French official, Daniel Benedite, had its base in a crumbling chateau near Marseilles, where among others the Surrealist leader Andre Breton would hold court.         ''With them was a handsome American girl, Mary Jayne Gold, who gave them vast sums of money for their noble work in which she also took a hand,'' Peggy Guggenheim wrote in her memoirs, ''Out of This Century,'' recalling that she visited the chateau as part of her own plan to finance the escape of several artists, including Max Ernst, whom she later married.         ''Before I arrived Breton and Fry and Mary Jayne Gold and Benedite had been arrested and held incommunicado on a boat for days during Petain's visit to Marseilles,'' Miss Guggenheim said. ''They had finally managed to get a secret note to the American consul, who rescued them.'' The United States did not declare war on Nazi Germany until 1941.         Before Miss Gold and Fry were forced to leave Marseilles in 1941, the committee is reported to have arranged the escape of some 2,000 refugees, including the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz and the writer Hannah Arendt, by giving them false passports and leading them to escape routes, often across the Pyrenees. Miss Gold's money was crucial since visas and passports could be bought on the flourishing Marseilles black market.         ''I was not there to witness the worst, only the beginning,'' Miss Gold wrote in her memoir, ''Crossroads Marseilles 1940,'' published by Doubleday in 1980. ''Even then, I was sometimes embarrassed into a sort of racialism -- like being ashamed of belonging to the human race.''         The Associated Press quoted a friend, the filmmaker Pierre Sauvage, as saying that Miss Gold ''felt that only one year in her life really mattered and it was the year she spent in Marseilles.'' He added, ''She was a very shrewd woman whose heart was on the right side of issues and who at a crucial turning point in history understood what was called for.''         After the war, she returned to France and settled on the Riviera. She never married and had no children.       
         Jane Warner Dick, an early social welfare advocate who later served on a United Nations panel, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Lake Forest, Ill. She was 91.         Mrs. Dick's social work began in 1926 with Hull House, founded by Jane Addams in 1889. A friend of Ms. Addams, Mrs. Dick volunteered in the Immigrants Protection League, an arm of Hull House that provided legal services and helped immigrants adjust to life in the United States.         She later served on the Illinois Social Welfare Foundation as well as the Illinois Board of Public Welfare, where she established volunteer services for the state's mentally ill.         Mrs. Dick was active in Democratic politics in Illinois, where she was an early supporter of Adlai Stevenson. She urged Mr. Stevenson to run for governor in 1948 and served as the state chairwoman of his successful gubernatorial campaign. She also worked on his Democratic Presidential campaigns in 1952 and 1956.         In 1961, Mrs. Dick was appointed as the United States representative to the Social Commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council by President John F. Kennedy, on the recommendation of Mr. Stevenson, then Ambassador to the United Nations.         In her time with the United Nations, Mrs. Dick played a pivotal role in a raucous debate over a proposed resolution condemning racial discrimination. The United States maintained that the resolution, which called on nations to outlaw any organization that promoted discrimination, was too sweeping.         ''The United States' legal system does not permit censorship or punishment for the expression of ideas, even ideas we loathe,'' she said at the United Nations in 1963. ''We do not believe it is necessary to restrict freedom of thought in order to overcome discrimination.''         A version of the resolution was eventually adopted, with the United States and several Western nations abstaining from the vote.         Mrs. Dick was the author of a book about Mr. Stevenson, ''Volunteers and the Making of Presidents,'' published by Dodd, Mead Inc. She was a trustee of the Menninger Foundation, an advocacy group for the mentally ill; the Children's Home and Aid Society of Illinois, and the Newberry Library in Chicago. She was also a governing member of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.         Her husband, the Chicago industrialist Edison Dick, died in 1994. She is survived by a daughter, Titia Dick Ellis of Santa Fe, N.M.; a son, Edison W., of Washington; a sister, Marion Hodgkins of Lake Forest, Ill.; 9 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Rella MacDougall, a prominent decorator who was the longtime chairwoman of the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Show House, died on Wednesday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 91.         The cause was cancer, said Harry Hinson, the fabric designer, who was a longtime friend.         Mrs. MacDougall led the show house, which used annual interior design shows to raise money for the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club, as it changed from a fledgling organization 24 years ago into an institution in interior design and the largest show house in the country. In 1972, the first show house raised $53,000 for the club, which runs after-school recreation programs in the South Bronx. In recent years, the show house has raised more than $500,000 annually.         Mrs. MacDougall was widely admired for her diplomacy and popularity, according to an April 1996 article about her in The New York Times. ''In a world of whining and complaining, she has wonderful, old-fashioned standards, which have not been deconstructed for modern times,'' the designer Mark Hampton was quoted as saying.         Rella Gammon grew up on a high bluff in Keokuk, Iowa, overlooking the Des Moines and Mississippi Rivers. Her father was an engineer who worked on Route 66. In 1926, she graduated from Lindenwood College in St. Charles, Mo. ''I wanted to be an engineer, build bridges, but my father nixed that,'' she said.         She spent more than a decade as a businesswoman in Detroit that included working as assistant to the president of a manufacturer of cotton batting for auto upholstery. In 1941, she married Allan MacDougall, the president of the National Distillers' import division. She gave up salaried work and became a full-time hostess, traveler and stepmother, occasionally decorating friends' apartments as wedding presents.         In 1964, when a friend's husband died unexpectedly, Mr. MacDougall suggested that she and her friend form a decorating company. ''Allan, I'll sacrifice anything,'' she later recalled telling her husband, ''but I will not go into decorating.'' From 1965 until 1990, she ran MacDougall & Company and worked as a decorator in New York and abroad. Her husband died in 1971.         When she heard about the first  Kips Bay show house in 1972, ''I remember thinking it was the craziest idea I ever heard,'' she said. ''The New York I knew was too sophisticated for that.''         Mrs. MacDougall was best known for sitting by the show house's doorway, graciously greeting visitors with her needlepoint in hand. She summed up her philosophy thus: ''If you don't enjoy it more each year, you shouldn't be doing it.''       
         Lillian Disney, the widow of Walt Disney and a prominent patron of the arts, died on Tuesday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles after suffering a stroke on Monday. She was 98.         Mrs. Disney, who met Mr. Disney in the 1920's while working at a low-level job at his fledgling studio, was married to the mogul for 41 years. ''This really is the end of an era for Disney,'' said Roy E. Disney, a nephew of Mrs. Disney's and vice chairman of the Walt Disney Company. He added: ''She was a great lady, full of laughter and fun and always prepared to speak the truth, tough and loving at the same time.''         A publicity-shy figure, Mrs. Disney became highly active in a number of charities after her husband's death in 1966 and emerged as a leading patron of the arts. She helped found the California Institute of the Arts, a somewhat avant-garde school that has produced many of the nation's most formidable animators.         In May 1987, Mrs. Disney made a landmark gift of $50 million to the Music Center of Los Angeles County to build a world-class concert hall for the city. Although plans for the grandiose concert hall had stalled in recent years, mostly because of financial and artistic disagreements, the project was recently revived with a $25 million donation from the Walt Disney Company. It is scheduled to be completed in the year 2001.         During her marriage, Mrs. Disney served as her husband's sounding board and unofficial adviser. By all accounts he would discuss his ideas -- from Snow White to the creation of Disneyland -- with Mrs. Disney and sought her approval.         On a train ride from New York City to Los Angeles, after a serious business setback, Mr. Disney came up with a new character: Mortimer Mouse. ''Not Mortimer,'' said his wife. ''It's too formal. How about Mickey?''         Michael D. Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company, said, ''Mrs. Disney was a full-time partner to Walt and we are all grateful for her contributions in the creation of Mickey Mouse and the Disney Company and the example she set for family life and community service.''         Although a vocal figure behind the scenes, Mrs. Disney rarely spoke publicly and appeared at few Hollywood events. One of the few times she made a public comment came after the publication of a book, ''Walt Disney: Hollywood's Dark Prince'' (1993), by Marc Eliot. The book depicted Walt Disney as a political reactionary, anti-Semite and a Hollywood informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.         In a statement, Mrs. Disney said: ''We shared a wonderful, exciting life and we loved every minute of it. He was a wonderful husband to me and a wonderful and loyal father and grandfather. I am distressed to learn of a new book about Walt that actually invents incidents that never happened.''         Last year Mrs. Disney donated $100,000 to the Nez Perce Indians, who were seeking to buy some ancient tribal artifacts. Mrs. Disney grew up in Lapwai, Idaho, on the Nez Perce Indian reservation. Her father worked for the Government as a blacksmith and Federal marshal.         She came to Los Angeles in 1923 to join her older sister, Hazel. A friend of her sister was working at the new Walt Disney studios, and told her about a job opening there. She found a job as a $15-a-week ''inker'' of film frames. She married Walt Disney on July 13, 1925, in Lewiston, Idaho.         A daughter that the Disneys adopted, Sharon Disney, died in 1993. She is survived by another daughter, Diane Disney Miller of Napa, Calif., who has played an important role in the plan for the Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles. She is also survived by 10 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         Karen Hubert Allison, who with her husband, Len Allison, lived out every cook's fantasy of turning a home into a restaurant and later earned three stars for the establishment, Huberts, in Manhattan, died on Tuesday in Maui, Hawaii. She was 49 and had lived in Maui since 1995.         The cause of death was breast cancer, said Dr. Wayne Lavender, a family friend.         When the couple opened their restaurant on East 22d Street in Manhattan in 1981, American restaurants were still in the grip of French traditions. The best restaurants were those whose chefs were trained in other countries and were most comfortable with ingredients and techniques developed thousands of miles away. The Allisons were among the pioneers who advocated exploring America's own ingredients and traditions.         ''They keyed into this very new idea of new American cuisine, which was about finding good producers and good ingredients,'' said Peter Hoffman, who cooked at Huberts from 1981 to 1985 and now owns Savoy in SoHo.         Neither Mr. Allison nor Ms. Hubert Allison was a trained chef. In 1977, when the couple began serving meals in their Brooklyn home, their ambition was not to open a restaurant but to make a documentary about a neighborhood clothing store. Ms. Hubert and Mr. Allison, who married in 1984, needed to raise $10,000 for a new camera, and they hit on the idea of inviting their friends to buy weekend meals in their three-story house in Cobble Hill. Both Mr. Allison, an English teacher, and Ms. Hubert, a writer, did the cooking. Their plan worked so well that they not only raised the money but also decided to go into the restaurant business.         Their first restaurant, also called Huberts, opened in 1979 in a romantically ornate Victorian corner bar in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, where they quickly won critical acclaim. By 1981, demand for seats had overflowed the 12-table bar and they moved to 102 East 22d Street in Manhattan. There, with Ms. Hubert Allison in the dining room and Mr. Allison in the kitchen, Huberts became one of the signature New York restaurants of the 1980's, a time when New Yorkers were enthusiastically discovering the joys and social possibilities of fine wining and dining. It earned three stars in 1985 from Bryan Miller, the restaurant critic for The New York Times.         ''There were people coming from all over the globe who were either cooking there or sharing food thoughts, and you saw this riot of tastes and flavors settle down into this kind of signature cuisines,'' said Joshua Wesson, the wine writer and merchant who was the sommelier at Huberts from 1983 to 1986. ''Before there was a Greenmarket, there was Karen Hubert and Len Allison seeking out little growers and artisanal makers of cheese and bringing them down to this restaurant.''         Karen Hubert was born in New York City in 1948. She received a bachelor's degree from City College of New York, where she met Mr. Allison, and a master's degree in fine arts from Columbia University.         In 1987, the couple's daughter, Halley Cyd Marie Allison, was born, and in 1989 they had a son, Luke Edward Allison. In addition to her husband and children, Ms. Hubert Allison is survived by a stepson, Matthew Allison, 32, a record industry executive in Hong Kong.         After Halley's birth, Ms. Hubert Allison began to withdraw from the restaurant business. At the same time, the couple closed the 22d Street restaurant and opened a more expensive Huberts at Park Avenue and 63d Street. With four times the seating and three times the staff, it had less of the warmth and intimacy that characterized their earlier efforts. It, too, received three stars, but lasted only two years.         They tried to regain their touch in 1991 with Onda, a more modest restaurant serving a hybrid of Thai and Italian cuisines. It did not last long.         After that, the couple taught at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and then moved to Hawaii after Ms. Hubert Allison became ill in 1995. In Hawaii, she concentrated on writing. Her first novel, ''How I Gave My Heart to the Restaurant Business'' (Ecco Press), a roman a clef, was published earlier this year, and she completed a cookbook, ''The Vegetarian Compass,'' which is to be published by Little, Brown next spring.         Despite the couple's many achievements, one nagging detail always remained. Their documentary was never completed.       
         Dawn Steel, the first woman to head a major movie studio and who played a prominent role advancing other women to top jobs in Hollywood, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center here. She was 51 and lived in Los Angeles.         Charles Roven, Ms. Steel's husband, a film producer, said Ms. Steel had been suffering from a malignant brain tumor.         ''When I got the call 21 months ago from the doctor about Dawn's condition,'' said Mr. Roven, ''I was told that 97 percent of the people who had this die within the first six months. It goes to show what spirit she had.''         Ms. Steel, who came to Hollywood in the 1970's to take a merchandising job at Paramount, rose quickly to become president of production at that studio, where she oversaw development of such films as ''Flashdance,'' ''Footloose,'' ''Top Gun,'' ''The Untouchables,'' ''Fatal Attraction'' and ''The Accused.'' She became the first woman to head a major studio when she held the top job at Columbia Studios from October 1987 until January 1991. During her reign, the studio's films included ''Awakenings,'' ''Flatliners,'' ''Ghostbusters 2'' and ''Casualties of War.''         Ms. Steel produced several movies in recent years, among them ''Cool Runnings,'' a highly successful comedy about a Jamaican bobsled team. She and Mr. Roven have produced ''Fallen,'' starring Denzel Washington, and ''City of Angels,'' with Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage, both to be released next year.         Ms. Steel's career and life were marked by a powerful, even outsize, personality that helped her succeed in a business dominated by men.  ''She was highly opinionated, extremely self-confident, had a fantastic sense of humor and was someone of enormous style and taste,'' said Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the partners of Dreamworks SKG, and an early mentor of Ms. Steel's at Paramount, along with Michael Eisner and Barry Diller. He added, ''Maybe under the facade she was scared and intimidated by it all, but I didn't see a scintilla of that.''         Nora Ephron, the writer, who was given her first directorial job by Ms. Steel, said: ''Dawn certainly wasn't the first woman to become powerful in Hollywood, but she was the first woman to understand that part of her responsibility was to make sure that eventually there were lots of other powerful women. She hired women as executives, women as producers and directors, women as marketing people.         ''The situation we have today, with a huge number of women in powerful positions, is largely because of Dawn Steel,'' said Ms. Ephron.         Ms. Steel was one of President Clinton's earliest supporters in Hollywood. In the last year, Mr. Clinton had phoned her several times, and Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Ms. Steel at her home in the Coldwater Canyon area of Los Angeles.         Characteristically, Ms. Steel often laughed with friends when recalling her first meeting with Mr. Clinton.         ''You're not as bad as I thought you'd be,'' Mr. Clinton told her.         Ms. Steel's skill as an executive was sometimes overshadowed by a reputation for an abrasive, take-no-prisoners style. She was called Steel Dawn and the Tank. ''It hurt me deeply, this reputation as tough, hard, mean,'' she said in 1993, following the publication of her autobiography ''They Can Kill You, but They Can't Eat You: Lessons From the Front.'' She added: ''It was very painful, it came from guys who wanted to kill me. In some ways I was curt because there's an unbelievable amount to accomplish in a day.''         ''Look, I'm not Mary Poppins,'' she said at another point, ''but I think I functioned with integrity.''         The films that Ms. Steel most enjoyed seeing and making -- such as ''Flashdance,'' about a female welder who wants to dance, and ''Cool Runnings'' -- were personal to her. These are stories of outsiders with outlandish ambitions who overcome numerous obstacles to get what they want. ''She had a formula for many of her movies that carried a simple truth: You want something, you work incredibly hard, you get it,'' said Lucy Fisher, vice chairwoman of the Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group, and a close friends.         Although Ms. Steel often said that she was just ''an ordinary middle-class girl from New York,'' the story of her life was far from ordinary and, like those of many other wealthy and successful moguls in Hollywood, self-invented.         She was born in the Bronx on Aug. 19, 1946, and grew up in Manhattan and ''in a crummy neighborhood on the wrong side of the tracks'' in Great Neck, N.Y., according to her autobiography. Her father, Nat, was a zipper salesman to the military who had a nervous breakdown when she was a child; her mother, Lillian, was a formidable businesswoman compelled to work to support the family. (The family's name was originally Spielberg, but her father changed it to Steel to reflect his prowess as a semiprofessional weight lifter).         Ms. Steel ran out of money after a year at Boston University, and attended New York University's School of Commerce for two years, studying marketing. By 1968 Ms. Steel was working as a receptionist in the garment district and soon found a low-level marketing job at Penthouse magazine devising X-rated products. (She initially told her parents she was working at Mademoiselle.)         Answering phones at Penthouse, Ms. Steel noticed that amaryllis plants took on a phallic look just before blooming. As she recalled, she hired an artist to exaggerate the effect and wrote her own copy for the ad: ''Grow your own . . . All it takes is $6.98 and a lot of love.'' The plant was so popular that Penthouse could not keep it in stock.         Ms. Steel's tenacity, and flair for theatrics, was made evident in 1975 while she was traveling through Europe looking for gimmicky gift ideas. She came up with the notion of poking fun at the Gucci label by stamping it on toilet paper. She solicited orders from boutiques and formed her own company, Oh Dawn! Inc., she said, ''because when I said I was in the toilet-paper business, people would say, 'Oh Dawn!' ''         Soon enough, the Gucci family sued her for copyright infringement. Sid Davidoff, a lawyer and former administrative assistant to Mayor John V. Lindsay, agreed to take her case even though, he later recalled, she ''didn't have a dime, she was living by her wits.'' Mr. Davidoff, building a First Amendment defense, made sure the New York tabloids heard about the case, which was quickly headlined ''the toilet-paper caper'' and led to an editorial cartoon showing the Gucci family as Goliath and poor Dawn Steel as David. The case was settled out of court.         By 1978, Ms. Steel had ended a 10-month marriage, sold her business to her ex-husband and asked Mr. Davidoff to place a call to his friend Mr. Katzenberg about a marketing job for her at Paramount. She was hired and quickly impressed her bosses.         Asked in 1993 why men like Mr. Eisner and Mr. Katzenberg had rapidly advanced her career, Ms. Steel replied: ''One was that I was funny. I wasn't heavy furniture. I made them laugh and entertained them. And the other thing was that I could identify a good idea. Not a lot of people can do that. That was my gift.''         She was once compared to a tank by the producer Dan Melnick. ''She would just lower her head and charge through all the red tape and bureaucracy,'' he said. ''She's the most determined woman in the business.''         Her early advocacy of ''Flashdance'' (1983), an unlikely blue-collar musical that turned into a huge hit grossing $95 million in the United States, solidified her position at Paramount. ''Flashdance'' was followed by ''Footloose,'' another hit.         By 1985, Paramount's president, Ned Tanen, appointed Ms. Steel president of production, making her one of the highest-ranking female executives in Hollywood. She had already developed a celebrity persona that made photographers take as many pictures of her at a premiere as a movie actress. She prided herself on her crown of leonine hair -- Ms. Ephron once introduced ''Dawn Steel and her hair'' at an awards luncheon for women -- and her romantic relationships with such figures as the actor Richard Gere and Martin Scorsese, the director.         Ms. Steel's dismissal from Paramount remains one of the more unusual in recent Hollywood history. Having married Mr. Roven in 1985, she was in the hospital after the birth of her only child, Rebecca, in March 1987, when she learned that Frank Mancuso, chairman of Paramount, and Mr. Tanen, chairman of the Motion Picture Group, had ousted her. Exactly why they did was unclear.         As Ms. Steel told Playboy years later, her husband walked into the hospital room with a newspaper under his arm and said, ''I don't know how to tell you this, babe, but you got fired while you were in labor.'' Ms. Steel said. ''I remember thinking, 'I will not cry, I will not let them make me cry.' ''         In addition to her husband and daughter, she is survived by a brother, Larry, of Manhattan.         Within six months of her ouster at Paramount, Ms. Steel was offered the job of running Columbia Studios, which was owned by Coca-Cola. Lynda Obst, a producer who was given her early producing jobs by Ms. Steel, said that one of the personal high points of her tenure at Columbia was the decision to restore and reissue the David Lean classic ''Lawrence of Arabia.'' ''It was something that she was extraordinarily proud of,'' said Ms. Obst.         Ms. Steel left the job in 1991, following Sony's purchase of the studio. Her settlement was reportedly in excess of $6 million.         Ms. Steel, in reviewing her career a few years ago, recalled that her commitment to helping women in Hollywood was a slow one. ''I must tell you, I did feel threatened by other women in those early years,'' she said. ''I was so busy climbing up this ladder, staying above the water. If there was only room for one woman in a room, I wanted to be her. I'm not proud of it. I certainly don't feel that way now. It was an absolute evolution for me.''       
         Denise Levertov, a poet of intense emotion and fervid political conviction, died on Saturday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle, where she lived. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lymphoma, said Griselda Ohannessian of New Directions, Ms. Levertov's publisher.         As a poet and political activist, Ms. Levertov was ''a touchstone, a maintainer for our generation,'' the poet Robert Creeley, one of her first publishers in the United States, said yesterday. ''She was a constantly defining presence in the world we shared, a remarkable and transforming poet for all of us. She always had a vivid emotional response and also a completely dedicated sense of political and social need.''         The poet Kenneth Rexroth once wrote that Ms. Levertov was ''the most subtly skillful poet of her generation, the most profound, the most modest, the most moving.''         In the tradition established by William Carlos Williams, she wrote with a concrete immediacy of language. She spoke directly through her poetry, favoring commonplace objects and images over large philosophical concepts.         The author of more than 30 books of poetry, essays and translations, she wrote with great particularity and sensitivity about aspects of love, spiritual as well as erotic. More and more, her work conveyed her political awareness and social consciousness. She was, as in the title of her first book of essays, ''The Poet in the World.'' At the same time, in her art she would contemplate her own life, writing confessional poems about her marital and familial problems. For her, content and form were ''in a dynamic state of interaction.''         In ''The Ache of Marriage,'' she wrote:         The ache of marriage:         thigh and tongue, beloved,         are heavy with it,         it throbs in the teeth         We look for communion         and are turned away, beloved,         each and each         It is leviathan and we         in its belly         looking for joy, some joy         not to be known outside it         two by two in the ark of         the ache of it.         And in ''Of Being,'' she wrote:         I know this happiness         is provisional:         the looming presences --         great suffering, great fear --         withdraw only         into peripheral vision:         but ineluctable this shimmering         of wind in the blue leaves:         this flood of stillness         widening the lake of sky:         this need to dance,         this need to kneel:         this mystery:         A defining moment of her life was the Vietnam War. She helped found a group called the Writers' and Artists' Protest Against the War in Vietnam, she was actively involved in the anti-nuclear movement, and in 1967 she edited a volume of poetry for the War Resisters League. In the same year, she published ''The Sorrow Dance,'' a book of poems whose sorrow included the war and also the death of the poet's sister.         Ms. Levertov was born in Ilford, England. Her father was Paul Philip Levertoff, a Russian Jew who converted to Christianity and became an Anglican priest. Her mother was from Wales. Her father's conversations about the family background in Hasidism and her mother's knowledge of Welsh and English folklore proved influential. Educated by her parents, she was introduced to poetry by her older sister, Olga, and was writing from an early age.         During World War II, she worked as a nurse in London and also began publishing her poetry. In 1940 her first poem appeared in Poetry Quarterly, and, said Mr. Rexroth, he and other poets were soon ''in excited correspondence about her'' as ''the baby of the new Romanticism.'' Her first volume of verse, ''The Double Image,'' was published in 1946.         After the war she married Mitchell Goodman, an American writer, and for several years they lived in France near Mr. Creeley, who was a friend of Mr. Goodman. In 1948 the couple moved to the United States, where Ms. Levertov studied and was influenced by such modernist poets as Williams, Wallace Stevens and Ezra Pound, and also continued her artistic relationship with Mr. Creeley, Robert Duncan and other Black Mountain poets.         Both she and her husband frequently spoke out on political issues, particularly regarding the Vietnam War. Mr. Goodman was convicted along with Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling resistance of the draft. Ms. Levertov and Mr. Goodman were divorced in 1975. Mr. Goodman died last February. They had one son, Nikolai, who lives in Seattle.         When Ms. Levertov's 11th collection of verse, ''The Freeing of the Dust,'' was published in 1975, the poet David Ignatow wrote in The New York Times Book Review that ''by nearly unanimous agreement Levertov was well on her way to becoming one of our leading poets'' with ''her forceful and compassionate presentations of urban lives'' and ''the beauty and sensuousness of her nature poems.'' By shifting to ''passionate Vietnam poems,'' she had lost some of her following but gained a new vitality.         Ms. Levertov wrote through six decades. In the 1990's, she published ''New and Selected Essays''; four poetry volumes, ''Evening Train,'' ''Sands of the Well,'' ''The Life Around Us: Selected Poems on Nature'' and ''The Stream and The Sapphire: Selected Poems on Religious Themes,'' and the prose memoir  ''Tesserae: Memories and Suppositions.''         She taught at colleges and universities, and served as poetry editor of The Nation and Mother Jones. Among her honors were the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award in poetry and the $50,000 Lannan Prize. In 1996, she won the Governor's Award from the Washington State Commission for the Humanities.         She felt compelled to clarify and justify the uses of poetry in a world of political crisis. In ''New and Selected Essays'' she wrote, ''One is in despair over the current manifestation of malevolent imbecility and the seemingly invincible power of rapacity, yet finds oneself writing a poem about the trout lilies in the spring woods. And one has promised to speak at a meeting or help picket a building. If one is conscientious, the only solution is to attempt to weigh conflicting claims at each crucial moment, and in general to try to juggle well and keep all the oranges dancing in the air at once.''         Ms. Levertov was a masterly juggler of words, images and feelings, as well as a defender of artistic and political liberty.         In ''Overheard Over S.E. Asia,'' she wrote:         I am the snow that burns.         I fall         wherever men send me to fall --         but I prefer flesh, so smooth, so dense:         I decorate it in black, and seek the bone.       
         Marion Bell, who created the leading role of Fiona MacLaren in the original Broadway production of the Alan Jay Lerner-Frederick Loewe musical ''Brigadoon'' in 1947 and then married Mr. Lerner, died on Dec. 14 at the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, Calif. She was 78 and lived in Culver City.         As the innocent young woman in the mysterious Scottish town that comes back to life one day in every 100 years, Ms. Bell captivated critics as well as theatergoers. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson was so taken with the show as ''a singing pattern of enchantment'' that he hesitated to write about individual performers.         He did say, however, that ''Almost Like Being in Love'' was ''sung rapturously'' by David Brooks and Ms. Bell. The musical historian Miles Kreuger, who saw the show in its premiere engagement and later became a friend of Ms. Bell's, said this week that as Fiona ''she had the most wondrous, doe-like, ethereal quality.''         For her role in ''Brigadoon,'' she won many awards, including the Donaldson Award for best debut performance by an actress in a musical. Subsequently she made record albums for RCA Victor, including the original cast album of ''Brigadoon.''  It was to be her only New York musical.         She was born in St. Louis. By the age of 8, she was singing on radio. After the family moved to California, the director Robert Z. Leonard heard her singing at a party and was instrumental in having her signed by Metro Goldwyn Mayer.         She appeared with the Marx Brothers in ''A Night at the Opera.'' She studied voice both in Rome and in California and later sang a duet with the Metropolitan Opera tenor James Melton in the movie, ''Ziegfeld Follies.''         Mr. Lerner and Mr. Loewe apparently wanted her to play a role in their musical, ''The Day Before Spring,'' but MGM held her to her contract. Several years later, she auditioned for ''Brigadoon,'' and acted in the show for a year.         She married Mr. Lerner in 1947 and they were divorced two years later. Ms. Bell was the second of his eight wives.         In 1948, she was in the world premiere of Kurt Weill and Arnold Sundgaard's folk opera, ''Down in the Valley,'' at Indiana University and repeated her role on television. Later she sang at the St. Louis Municipal Opera, the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera and the Sacramento Music Circus. In recent years she taught voice in Culver City.         She is survived by a son, Tom Charlesworth of Portland, Ore., and two sisters, Evelyn Lewis of Hawaii and Veronica McKinley of New Castle, Pa.       
         Veronica Geng, an accomplished parodist who spun out biting pieces for The New Yorker based on chance remarks by hapless politicians and the banalities of wedding announcements, died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, said a friend, Barbara Epstein, editor of The New York Review of Books. She was 56.         The cause was a brain tumor, said  Philip Roth, the novelist, who was also a friend.         As a writer of ''casuals,'' the short articles that appear in The New Yorker, she carried on in the tradition of S. J. Perelman. A typical Geng piece was a crazed amalgam of stock phrases, as in an imaginary wedding announcement reprinted in her 1984 collection, ''Partners'': ''The bride, married at the Presbyterian Church and Trust, is an alumna of the Royal Doulton School and Loot University.  Her father is retired from the family consortium. She is also a descendant of Bergdorf Goodman of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Her previous marriage ended in pharmaceuticals.''         Her 1988 collection, ''Love Trouble Is My Business,'' included a ''letter'' from the proprietor of a dog kennel to ''Secretary Weinberger'' about a defense contractor's $87.25 bill for dog boarding: ''I wear the key to the pantry around my neck on a platinum chain, and not only is the level of the kibble bin measured twice a day but the bin itself is equipped with a state-of-the art laser lock, which cannot be opened without a microcoded propylene wafer.''         Ms. Geng was also an unofficial editor of Mr. Roth's novels. ''I always gave Veronica my books,'' he said shortly before she died.         Ms. Geng was born in 1941 in Atlanta. Her father was a career Army officer. She once told The Christian Science Monitor that she traced her humor to ''Alice in Wonderland,'' read to her from the age of 2. In it, she said, she discovered ''a sense of illogic and how funny illogic is.''         That book ''and the paperback collection of the Watergate transcripts are my two favorite books.'' Ms. Geng said. ''They're not unlike each other.''         She attended the University of Pennsylvania. In the mid-1970's her short parody of the film critic Pauline Kael, published in The New York Review of Books, caught the eye of Roger Angell, a fiction editor at The New Yorker. Mr. Angell gave her a tryout and she went on to become his  assistant.         Mr. Roth credits Ms. Geng with persuading William Shawn, then The New Yorker's editor, to publish his 1979 novella, ''The Ghost Writer,'' in two parts. From then on, he said, he  came to depend on her.         Charles McGrath, a friend and colleague at The New Yorker who is now editor of The New York Times Book Review, said: ''Her thing was high, intellectual comedy.''         In 1992, after Tina Brown took over as editor of The New Yorker, Ms. Geng and Ms. Brown had a falling out. Ms. Geng said she was dismissed; Ms. Brown said she resigned.         Ms. Geng had no immediate survivors.         Correction:  January 1, 1998, Thursday  An obituary of the parodist and editor Veronica Geng on Friday omitted a survivor. He is her brother, Steve Geng of Manhattan.
