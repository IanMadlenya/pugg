         Dorothy Maynor, a highly regarded soprano recitalist who founded the Harlem School of the Arts, died on Monday at the Chester County Hospital in West Chester, Pa. She was 85 and lived in Kennett Square, Pa.         Miss Maynor, whose career helped open the way for black artists like Marian Anderson and Leontyne Price, possessed a voice that the New Grove Dictionary of  American Music describes as "a soaring, belllike soprano capable of exquisite musical effects, supported by a sincere and ardent temperament." She took New York by storm in a sold-out recital at Town Hall in 1939 and pursued a successful recital career.         Although she committed more than 100 operatic roles to memory, she never appeared on an opera stage; there were no such opportunities for a black artist  in the late 1930's and the 1940's, when she was in her prime. (Miss Anderson, the first black singer to appear at the Metropolitan Opera, did not make her debut there until 1955.)         Miss Maynor was born in Norfolk, Va., and as a child she sang in the choir of her father's church. She entered Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) in Hampton, Va., intending to become a teacher of home economics, but she also joined the renowned Hampton Choir, with which she toured Europe in 1929. On the  advice of the choir director, R. Nathaniel Dett, she changed her major to music  and earned a bachelor's degree in 1933.         After being awarded a scholarship, she studied choir direction at the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, N.J., where she received a second bachelor's degree in music and choral conducting in 1935. While on tour in New England with the school's choir, she was encouraged by several wealthy benefactors to pursue a concert career. Three years of private study in New York followed, with Wilfried Klamroth and John Alan Haughton. At this time she changed the spelling of her name from Mainor.         After hearing her sing at the 1939 Berkshire Symphonic Festival at Tanglewood in western Massachusetts, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky reportedly jumped up  and down, shouting: "It is a miracle! It is a musical revelation! The world must hear her!" Koussevitzky, who called Miss Maynor "a native Flagstad," immediately used her in recordings with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.         She made her formal debut at Town Hall in Manhattan later that year, on Nov.  19, in a widely anticipated event that was sold out more than a week in advance. Olin Downes, reviewing the concert for The New York Times, hailed her as "one of the most remarkable soprano voices of the rising generation," called her voice "phenomenal for its range, character and varied expressive resources."         Miss Maynor began touring extensively in the United States, often appearing as a soloist with leading orchestras. She made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1940 with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by John Barbirolli. In the late 40's she toured Latin America and Europe. She often performed at benefits to aid the  war effort and black causes.         She sang at the Presidential Inaugural galas for Harry S. Truman in 1949 and  Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. In 1952, by special permission of the Daughters of the American Revolution, she appeared as a soloist with the National Symphony Orchestra at Constitution Hall in the first commercial appearance there by a black artist since Miss Anderson had been barred from performing at the hall in  1939. (Miss Anderson subsequently gave benefit performances at the hall.)         Miss Maynor recorded popular arias and songs for RCA Victor. Although she never appeared on the opera stage, she recorded the role of Leonore in "Fidelio" under Arturo Toscanini.         In 1963, she retired to work with her husband, the Rev. Shelby Rooks, at St.  James Presbyterian Church at West 141st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem, where he was pastor. That year she founded the Harlem School of the Arts. The school offered classes in music, ballet, modern dance, drama and art to poor children for minimal fees, sometimes as little as 50 cents a lesson, and lent or rented instruments to students who did not own one.         "In most schools, if you don't have a piano, you can't take lessons," Miss Maynor told one interviewer. "But we say, 'Good, you come here and practice.' "  She served as executive director of the school until 1979 and also taught there. In 1977 she raised more than $2 million to build a new facility for the school,  which originally served 20 children and now has more than 1,000 students.         "What I dream of is changing the image held by the children," she said on another occasion. "We've made them believe everything beautiful is outside the community. We would like them to make beauty in our community."         Her work with the school is recounted in "Dorothy Maynor and the Harlem School of the Arts: The Diva and the Dream" (Edwin Mellen Press, 1993), by William F. Rogers Jr.         She received honorary doctorates from many schools, including Howard University, Westminster Choir College, Oberlin College, Carnegie-Mellon University and Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C..         In 1975, she became the first black member of the Metropolitan Opera board.         She is survived by her husband.         Correction:  March 2, 1996, Saturday         An obituary last Saturday about the soprano Dorothy Maynor credited her with  one recording incorrectly. She did not record the role of Leonore in "Fidelio" with Toscanini.       
         Katrina de Hirsch, a speech therapist who was a pioneer in the field of childhood language and learning disorders, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Ms. de Hirsch, who was better known by her professional name than her legal name, Katherine Romney, was among the first researchers to call attention to the varied deficiencies that make up speech and learning disabilities.         In the mid-1960's, long before interest in dyslexia, stuttering and similar  problems became widespread, Ms. de Hirsch was writing articles for professional  journals on these topics, said Dr. Jeannette Jansky, a colleague for many years.         Ms. de Hirsch maintained a private practice in New York City and was director of the Pediatric Language Disorder Clinic at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center from 1941 to 1972. One colleague described her as a master clinician who  achieved insights into children based not only on formal testing but on observations of a child's personality and an estimation of the relationships with family and friends.         "She was a pioneer," Dr. Jansky said. "The whole field of learning disabilities did not exist when she started her practice. When she started her work, the fields of reading disorders and language disorders were not connected. But she always said reading disorders had their base in language.         "Children with delayed language development had problems with reading when they got older. Once we had polished off their language problems, they came back in a year or two with reading disorders. She came to believe that the problems were rooted in architectural differences in the cortex."         The two women devised an index to predict whether a kindergarten pupil was likely to succeed in school or to need remedial work. It formed the basis for their first book, "Predicting Reading Failure" (1966, Harper & Row), written with Dr. William Langford. A second book, "Preventing Reading Failure" (1972, Harper & Row), refined the process and focused on intervention.         In her clinical work, Ms. de Hirsch put into practice the idea that both children and their parents needed to be educated about the needs of learning-disabled pupils.         "She explained to the parents why the children were having the problems they  were having," Dr. Jansky said. "If a child misread an easy word, it looked like  carelessness. But she explained that they didn't see it. She taught them tolerance and parental support rather than criticism. The emphasis in diagnosis  was always to highlight the children's often very special talents."         In addition to her private practice, Ms. de Hirsch carried out research and wrote extensively. She also trained pediatric and psychiatric residents to recognize language problems.         A life fellow of the American Orthopsychiatric Association, Ms. de Hirsch was an honoree of the Orton Society, named after Dr. Samuel Orton, an early mentor of Ms. de Hirsch. She was a founder of the society, now called the Orton Dyslexia Society. She was a fellow of the British College of Speech Therapy and  the American Speech-Language Hearing Association.         Born in Stuttgart, Germany, Ms. de Hirsch got her training at the West End Hospital for Nervous Diseases in London, where she received a degree from the College of Speech Therapy. In 1941, she came to the United States, where Teachers College of Columbia University awarded her a bachelor's degree.         She was married three times, and became a baroness by marrying her second husband, Donald von Hirsch.  Her third husband, Alfred Romney, whom she married  in 1948, died in 1977.         She is survived by two sons, Andrew von Hirsch of Cambridge, England, and Vinal Haven, Maine, and Frank Weil of Washington; two stepsons, Andrew Romney of Manhattan and Henry Romney of Remsenburg, L.I., and four grandchildren.       
         Esther S. Manz, who was a 208-pound housewife pregnant with her fifth child when a kitchen-table gathering in 1948 inspired her to found TOPS, a weight-loss support group that grew into a 300,000-member nonprofit organization, died on Monday at the Heritage Nursing Home in Milwaukee. Mrs. Manz, who made her home in Greenfield, Wis., a suburb of Milwaukee, was 88.         TOPS, which stands for Take Off Pounds Sensibly, draws its philosophy from something the 5-foot-2-inch Mrs. Manz, then 40, observed in group sessions intended to prepare women for childbirth: the power of mutual support in helping participants remain within their doctors' guidelines for weight.         TOPS members work out a sensible diet and weight goal with their physician and provide evidence of having consulted a doctor before attending weekly meetings that include a weigh-in and provide support and encouragement for members.         Men and women who achieve their weight goals become KOPS (Keep Off Pounds Sensibly), role models who are themselves reinforced in their efforts to maintain their weight by continuing to attend meetings.         "Life is a battle," Mrs. Manz once said. "Just let us win the one on obesity."         According to data from the weekly weigh-ins, TOPS members in 12,000 chapters  in the United States and abroad lost more than 740 tons last year, a spokeswoman said yesterday.         The nonprofit organization, based in Milwaukee, is supported by membership dues -- $16 in each of the first two years and $14 thereafter. When Mrs. Manz wrote TOPS's articles of incorporation in 1952, she committed it to finding a cure for obesity, and TOPS says it has contributed more than $4.5 million to obesity research.         After Mrs. Manz and three friends established their support group at her kitchen table in Milwaukee, the organization's name took its final form as the result of a newspaper article.         Mrs. Manz said she originally thought of it as TOP. "We didn't even have a name for our club at first, but when we went down to The Milwaukee Journal to be interviewed about our organization, the reporter asked what we called ourselves," she said in the group's handbook for new members. When the article was published, the name appeared as TOPS, and Mrs. Manz said it was later suggested that the S be made to stand for "sensibly."         On Jan. 21, 1948, the first meeting of TOPS was held at a Milwaukee community center. In the early days of the organization, Mrs. Manz carried a scale with her as she made her rounds as roving ambassador, organizing meetings.         Mrs. Manz, who achieved average proportions in her effort to control her weight, became president and chairwoman of the TOPS board in 1952. Declining health prompted her to relinquish the presidency in 1991, but she remained chairwoman until her death.         Born in 1907 in Plymouth, Wis., she grew up as Esther Schuland and graduated  in 1926 from Wisconsin State Teachers College. She taught at rural Wisconsin schools, married Gilbert Manz, a steelworker, in 1929 and later moved to Milwaukee, where she became a housewife.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Manz is survived by a son, Gilbert Jr.; four daughters, Bonnie Prieben, Maureen Weigert, Barbara Canapa and Marjory von Hof;  a brother, Carl Schuland, of Green Bay, Wis., 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. All of Mrs. Manz's children live in Milwaukee except for Mrs. von Hof, a resident of Altura, Minn.       
         Professor Jean Margaret Maxwell, who helped establish the New York School of  Social Work at New York University in the 1950's and the San Diego State University School of Social Work in the 1960's, died on Feb. 22 at the Casa de Manana retirement community in San Diego. She was 81.         Ms. Maxwell, who was professor emeritus at San Diego State, worked in various positions at the National Federation of Settlements and Neighborhood Centers in  New York from 1944 to 1953, when she joined with other new faculty members at N.Y.U. to organize the social work school. She was its associate director and department head until 1958.         Partly because of her experience at N.Y.U., San Diego State recruited her in 1963 to help establish its School of Social Work. At the time, the California State University system was also creating social work schools at its Sacramento, San Francisco, Fresno and San Jose campuses.         Professor Maxwell later became associate dean at San Diego and taught as a full professor. She retired in 1979.         An expert on aging, settlement houses and social work education, she worked from 1959 to 1961 with the Committee on Aging of the National Social Welfare Assembly, a planning and coordinating body for social welfare agencies. She was  also a founder of the Council of Social Work Education, a successor to the American Association of Schools of Social Work. The council served as the first  liaison between the schools and social service agencies in the field.         Ms. Maxwell was born in Minneapolis and graduated from the University of Minnesota, where she also did graduate work at the School of Social Work. She received a master's degree in administration from the Case Western Reserve School of Social Work in 1941.       
         Dr. Jane Marion Oppenheimer, a biologist and science historian whose interests ranged from embryos to the physiological effects of weightlessness in  space, died on Tuesday at her home in Philadelphia after a brief illness. She was 84.         She retired in 1980 as the Kenan Professor Emeritus of Biology and History of Science at Bryn Mawr College, where she had taught and done research for more than four decades. But she continued to teach, write, edit and experiment for several more years and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  in 1992 in recognition of her contributions.         Many of Dr. Oppenheimer's scientific papers dealt with experimental embryology, the history of embryology, the development of the central nervous system of fishes and the history of science, particularly 18th-century medicine  in Britain.         Among her books were "Essays in the History of Embryology and Biology" (1967) and "Foundations of Experimental Embryology" (2d edition, 1974). She also edited the English version, in 1986, of "The Autobiography of Karl Ernst von Baer (1792-1876)," about a German-born doctor and anthropologist who had doubts about Darwin's approach to evolution.         She created one of four American scientific experiments done aboard a Soviet  satellite in the first American-Soviet space venture. Using killifish, a small bony junkfish, she helped analyze the effects of weightlessness on the physiology of fish eggs at five stages of their evolution. The work brought her awards from the two nations in 1975: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Achievement Award and the Soviet Kosmos Award.         Dr. Oppenheimer also won the Wilbur Cross Medal from the Yale Graduate Alumni Association. She was a president of the American Society of Zoologists and an officer in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.         Born in Philadelphia, she was a 1936 graduate of Bryn Mawr and earned a Ph.D. in zoology at Yale University. She returned to Bryn Mawr as an instructor in 1938.         She leaves no immediate family.       
         Helen Bunce, who knitted so many mittens she didn't know what to do unless she was knitting more mittens, died on Feb. 24 at a nursing home in Watertown, N.Y., where she was known as the Mitten Lady. She was 86 and had been knitting mittens until a few days before her death.         Mrs. Bunce had been a legend in Watertown and in international church circles for decades, although until December only a few people knew she was the Mitten Lady whose anonymous handmade donations to an annual church clothing drive had spread her fame far and wide.         Since 1948, when the third-grade Sunday school class at the Emmanuel Congregational Church in Watertown established a special Christmas tree to collect clothing for poor children, Mrs. Bunce had spent every otherwise spare moment knitting away.         "She could knit in her sleep," her daughter, Helen McDonald, said yesterday,  estimating that her mother had knitted at least 4,000 pairs of mittens over the  last 47 years, and probably a lot more.         "She didn't keep records in the early years," Mrs. McDonald said, "but some years she did more than 200."         For all the mittens she turned out, the Mitten Lady sobriquet was somewhat misleading. Mrs. Bunce, who knew that little heads as well as hands needed protection against the cold, knitted a matching cap for every pair of mittens and also turned out scarves.         The sets, which included a handwritten tag saying "God Loves You, and So Do I," were distributed to various churches and charities in Watertown and through  Church World Service, the Protestant relief agency, to poor children across the  nation and abroad.         As word of Mrs. Bunce's work spread, people across the country began sending  her yarn in care of the church, and she kept a scrapbook of thank-you notes from children she had helped and photographs showing some of them wearing her handiwork. Like the donated packages of yarn, the notes, addressed simply to the Mitten Lady, were delivered to the church and then passed on to her.         Mrs. Bunce, who lived in Watertown most of her life, carried her knitting wherever she went, clicking away whenever she found a spare moment. Her mittens, which always included two contrasting colors in striking designs, came in three  sizes, with the colors becoming darker as the sizes increased.         Although she suffered from osteoporosis so painful that she found it difficult to sit in a wheelchair in her last months, Mrs. Bunce, who had taught  herself to knit lying down after entering the nursing home, insisted on being taken to the church in December to make her usual surreptitious donation of her  year's production.         This time her cover was blown. She was introduced to the congregation as the  Mitten Lady, and the woman who had once explained that she labored anonymously because the purpose of her work was to help poor children and not to have people say, "Oh, that's wonderful," had to endure a five-minute ovation.         Then she went back to the nursing home and continued her knitting. Mrs. Bunce, who always made it a point to start a new pair of mittens or a cap as soon as one was completed (on the assumption, she once explained, that God would not let anything happen to her as long as she had unfinished work), apparently knew the end was near. When she died, her daughter said, her needles were empty.         Mrs. Bunce's husband of 67 years, Karl, died on Feb. 27. In addition to her daughter, of Alexandria Bay, N.Y., she is survived by two sons, Roy, of Strasbourg, France, and Jack, of Watertown; 11 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Minnie Pearl, the raucously funny radio, television and stage personality who was known as the queen of country comedy, died yesterday at a hospital in Nashville. She was 83.         No cause of death was immediately given, but Miss Pearl had been admitted to  the hospital nine days ago because of what was described as "a brain seizure or  stroke." She had given up performing in 1991 after suffering a stroke.         In the 1930's, Miss Pearl, whose real name was Sarah Cannon, created her classic backwoods character, Cousin Minnie Pearl, a wisecracking storyteller who wore a flowered straw hat with its $1.98 price tag attached and a thrift-shop cotton-print dress. The character was famous for her signature greeting, a high-pitched "How-dee! I'm just proud to be here!" and for her exuberant chatter about "ketchin' a feller."         A mainstay of "The Grand Ole Opry" for more than 50 years, Miss Pearl's monologues were built around strings of hoary jokes so corny they would make an  audience groan if told by anybody else. The jokes were often depicted as true events from the fictional rural town of Grinder's Switch. This technique of incorporating old jokes into supposedly "true" vignettes was later adapted by the monologuist Garrison Keillor to create the news and gossip he reported from  his fictional hometown, Lake Wobegon, Minn.         In real life, however, Miss Pearl was not the archetypal hayseed she portrayed for decades. Born in Centerville, Tenn., Sarah Ophelia Colley was the daughter of a well-to-do businessman in the lumber industry. As a girl, she  was only dimly aware of country music. Her mother, known as Aunt Fannie Collie,  played the organ in a local church. Miss Pearl, who aspired to be an actress and dancer, attended Ward-Belmont College, a fashionable finishing school in Nashville.         After graduation, she taught dance for a short time before being hired as a drama coach for the Wayne P. Sewall Producing Company, a small Atlanta theatrical organization that sent directors into small Southern towns to stage amateur productions in local schools. She found the model for her stage character in Baileyton, Ala., when she stayed with a family whose grande dame regaled the company with humorous tall tales.         "To help publicize the show in each town," she later recalled, "I would appear before the Lion's Club and other groups. In return for letting me announce my show, I'd do a couple of minutes' entertainment for them. I'd do an  interpretation of a country girl, Minnie Pearl."         When her father died, Miss Pearl settled in Centerville to take care of her ailing mother. At a meeting of local bankers, she revived her character and dreamed up the town of Grinder's Switch, which was actually the name of a railroad crossing three miles from her hometown.         At the meeting it was suggested that she audition for "The Grand Ole Opry." Because the producers worried that some listeners might find her hayseed character offensive, her first performance, for which she was paid $10, took place after 11 P.M.  Miss Pearl quickly became one of the show's most popular performers, and in 1940 she was made a permanent member of the Opry, remaining until 1991 when the stroke she suffered at the time left her partially paralyzed.         When Miss Pearl was 34, she married Henry Cannon, a pilot who managed her career and flew her and her co-workers to their many shows. Over the years, Miss Pearl toured with most of the leading country-music stars and appeared at Carnegie Hall in 1947. She was named Nashville's Woman of the Year in 1965 and inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1975. She recorded albums for several labels and in 1966 had a top-10 country single, "Giddyup -- Go Answer."         Discussing her alter ego, Miss Pearl once said, "Minnie Pearl is uncomplicated. She's apple pie and clothes dried in the sun and the smell of fresh bread baking. I don't think people think of her so much as a show business act as a friend. When I'm on stage, I'm just plain Minnie Pearl wearing my battered old straw hat and battered shoes. The price tag on my hat seems to be symbolic of all human frailty. There's old Minnie Pearl standing on stage in her best dress, telling everyone how proud she is to be there."

         Camilla de Leon, a dance composer and accompanist in the 1930's and 40's, died on April 3 at Middlesex Hospital in Middletown, Conn. She was 80, and lived in Middletown.         Ms. de Leon accompanied classes at the Martha Graham studio and composed for  choreographers including Pearl Primus, with whom she worked into the 1970's, and Katherine Dunham, Pearl Lang and Jean Erdman. As the only white member of the Primus troupe, Ms. de Leon frequently had to get meals and restroom keys surreptitiously for Primus's black dancers when the company toured in the South.         Ms. de Leon also worked in the musical theater. She was rehearsal pianist for the original production of "South Pacific" and musical director for "You're  a Good Man, Charlie Brown." She taught voice and piano at Wesleyan University from 1972 to her death.         She is survived by two daughters, Inara de Leon of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Winona de Leon of Monterey, Calif.; three sons, Noel, of Odense, Denmark; Michael, of Garberville, Calif., and Emile, of Middletown, and two sisters, Maude Merrill of Manhattan and Irene Novak of Westport, Conn.       
         Bernice Hanft Shepard, a professional social worker who founded a private-care agency for the home-bound and elderly in Manhattan, died on Monday  at her home on the Upper East Side. She was 74.         The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, said a friend, Betsy Flagler.         Ms. Shepard was the founder and president of Shepard Personal Services, which she managed for 16 years until illness caused her to sell the company last year.         She attended Brooklyn College and worked as a statistician for a Jewish philanthropy. At age 58, she received a master's degree in social work from Hunter College and worked in the field of alcohol abuse.         She then joined Search and Care, a neighborhood group providing services for  people who were able to finance their own care. Out of this grew her idea of a business that could offer expert personal care. Colleagues noted that she took a personal interest in her clients.         She helped establish a local chapter of the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers and advised newcomers to the field. For several years, she taught courses related to aging at Yeshiva University.         Ms. Shepard is survived by a son, Steven Hanft of Arlington, Va.; a daughter, Laura Korobkin of Chestnut Hill, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Dr. Henriette R. Klein, clinical professor emeritus of psychiatry at Columbia University and a pioneer in the study of childhood schizophrenia, died on May 11 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 94.         She researched, taught and practiced psychiatry for six decades and was associated with Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons as a special lecturer until 1993. She was the first woman to be elected president of the Association for Psychoanalytic Medicine and the first female member and president of the New York Psychiatric Society.         Dr. Klein was known for her direct style, her no-nonsense professionalism and the breadth of her interests. She was born in Evanston, Ill., and graduated  from the University of Chicago in 1924. She received her medical degree from the University of Maryland in 1932 and trained at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute from 1935 to 1940.         With her mentor, Dr. Howard W. Potter, she was co-author of a ground-breaking study in 1937 on diagnosing childhood schizophrenia. She and Dr. Potter also experimented with outpatient services for a child-care agency, a harbinger of community psychiatry.         Another focus of her work was the training of psychiatrists at Columbia's Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, which she joined in 1949. She studied the effects of psychoanalysis on the patient, a subject she repeatedly wrote about.         She took part in a study, "Anxiety in Pregnancy and Childbirth" (1950), which debunked the received wisdom that having a baby was an answer to unhappiness. Instead, the study found that having a child can aggravate underlying disturbances in women who are severely maladjusted or mentally ill.         With her husband, Dr. William A. Horwitz, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia, she explored the mechanisms of paranoia and helped broaden the dynamic explanations of that disorder. She also had a private psychiatric practice in Manhattan.         Dr. Klein organized psychiatric training centers at Emory University, New York University and the Long Island College of Medicine, which became the Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York.         Among her professional concerns were the confidentiality of patients' records, the disciplining of psychiatrists who engage in sexual relations with patients and the discouraging of long-term analysis by older psychiatrists likely to die before the patient.         Dr. Klein is survived by a daughter, Dr. Susan Harris Molnar of Scarborough,  N.Y.; a son, William Harris of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and three grandchildren. Her husband died in 1968.       
         Betty Meredith-Jones, a dance educator and a pioneer in the field of movement rehabilitation and community dance in Britain, died last Sunday at her home in Rhosili, Wales. She was 87.         Ms. Meredith-Jones, born in Wales in 1908, trained as a young dancer with Rudolf Laban, a movement theorist. She taught physical education and dance before coming to the United States in 1952. In the late 1950's she came to Manhattan, where she began teaching movement classes for the elderly. In the early 60's, at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, she established a pilot program in the rehabilitation through movement of patients with Parkinson's disease.         Ms. Meredith-Jones received a master's degree from Columbia University and taught at Teachers College of Columbia University and the New School for Social  Research.         She is survived by a sister, Georgina Meredith-Jones.       
         Mary Rosamond Haas, a professor of linguistics whose interests ranged from American Indian languages that were dying to the prehistory of languages and modern Thai, died on May 17 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 86.         She suffered a long illness, according to the University of California at Berkeley, where she retired as professor emerita in 1977.         She, along with a handful of graduate students, was trained at Yale University by Edward Sapir, the legendary linguist and anthropologist, and became a force behind the Survey of California Indian Languages. Financed by the State Legislature, the project provided the wherewithal for sending qualified graduate students into the field for studies of the spoken native American word.         The program, started as a pilot project in 1949, surveyed cultures and languages presumably doomed to oblivion. In 1953, the survey of surviving Indian tongues became official, and the graduate department of linguistics was established on the Berkeley campus.         In the 1950's and 1960's, Dr. Haas used the survey for intensive explorations of the native languages in California and beyond. Such efforts inspired more than 40 dissertations and the careers of a generation of ethnolinguists.         Dr. Haas was a graduate of Earlham College in her native Richmond, Ind. She received a degree in comparative linguistics at the University of Chicago in 1931 and a Ph.D. at Yale in 1935. Her dissertation was on Tunica, an Indian language once spoken in what is now Louisiana.         She then delved into fieldwork with various other endangered or extinct species: Natchez, the only known member of its family of languages, as well as several of the Muskogean branch-offs, like Creek-Seminole.         As the entry of the United States into World War II loomed, she started working with the Thai language. She helped prepare Thai materials for the armed  forces and taught the language in a special training program at Berkeley, an experience that led to her appointment as an assistant professor of Siamese and  linguistics in 1947. She was promoted to professor of linguistics in 1957.         Her books in print include "Language, Culture and History: Essays" (Stanford  University Press, 1978), "Prehistory of Languages" (Mouton, 1978), "Thai Vocabulary" and "Thai System of Writing" (Spoken Language Service).         Dr. Haas is survived by a brother, Robert Haas, of Elkhart Lake, Wis.       
         Miriam Gideon, a prolific composer of vocal, chamber and orchestral music, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Ms. Gideon's music was often lean in texture but driven by a lyrical impulse  and an intensity that clarified the texts she set. In her song cycles, she sometimes mixed poetry from different centuries and in different languages, with an eye toward illuminating a common theme. She was a modernist, and did not shun rhythmic complexity or free atonality when those qualities suited her needs; yet when she used angular lines or abrasive harmonies, it was always to point up an  emotional or dramatic element in the work at hand.         Her vocal works included an opera, "Fortunato" (1958), a set of Shakespeare  settings for voice and orchestra (1951), several song cycles on natural and philosophical themes, including "Questions on Nature" (1964), "The Seasons of Time" (1969) and "Creature to Creature" (1985), and song settings in French, Japanese, German, Greek, Latin and Hebrew.         A specialist in Jewish liturgical music, and a composition teacher at the Jewish Theological Seminary, Ms. Gideon composed many settings of Hebrew prayers, both for chorus and solo voice, including a complete Sabbath service.         Ms. Gideon also created a varied catalogue of instrumental works, including a Symphonia Brevis (1951), a String Quartet (1946), sonatas for flute (1943), viola (1948), cello (1967) and piano (1977). She sometimes combined exotic elements -- as in the "Fantasy on a Javanese Motive" (1948) -- with her own contemporary American style.         Ms. Gideon was born in Greeley, Colo., on Oct. 23, 1906, and grew up in Boston, where she began studying the piano at age 9, and composing soon thereafter. After doing her undergraduate work at Boston University, she earned  a master's degree in musicology at Columbia University in 1946, and studied composition privately with Lazare Saminsky and Roger Sessions. She taught composition at Brooklyn College, City College of the City University of New York, the Manhattan School of Music and the Jewish Theological Seminary, and it  was at the seminary that she earned her doctorate in composition -- after nearly a quarter century as a teacher -- in 1970.         Although she was often cited as a role model for women who wanted to make their careers as composers, Ms. Gideon was always ambivalent about her status as a pioneering woman, and she disapproved of concert and broadcast series that presented only women's works.         "I didn't know I was a woman composer until the 1960's," she said in a 1986 interview. "I knew I was a composer -- a young composer for many years, and then, suddenly, an older composer. But never a woman composer."         Ms. Gideon's husband of 40 years, the author Frederic Ewen, died in 1989. She is survived by a sister, Judith Gideon of Manhattan; a daughter-in-law, Petra Ewen of Roanoke, Va., and three grandchildren.       
         Margaret Bronson (Peggy) Clark, who designed the lighting for more than 60 Broadway productions, including "Brigadoon," "Bye Bye Birdie" and "Auntie Mame," died on Wednesday at her home in Lexington, Ga. She was 80.         She died after a series of strokes, said Elmon Webb, a friend.         Ms. Clark helped make lighting design a profession on Broadway and was one of the first women to achieve a career in the field. "She was a pioneer in creating the field," said Mr. Webb, a business agent for United Scenic Artists,  the union that represents lighting, scenic and costume designers.         Through the 1930's, lighting design was a relatively informal process, usually the province of electricians.  Ms. Clark got her first job as a lighting designer on Broadway in 1941. Her work caught the attention of Brooks Atkinson,  the drama critic of The New York Times.         She worked as an assistant to Oliver Smith on "On the Town" in 1944. Her work tended toward the naturalistic, not the experimental. "Peggy Clark's lighting gives the production a cool appearance," Mr. Atkinson noted in a 1958 review of  "The Threepenny Opera."         Ms. Clark designed the lighting for a number of George Abbott's shows, including "Paint Your Wagon," a revival of "Pal Joey," and "Wonderful Town." "George Abbot liked plenty of light downstage," Ms. Clark told The New Haven Register in 1955, "because that's where he plays all the comedy scenes."         Dame Judith Anderson, for whom Ms. Clark designed the lighting for the 1947 production of "Medea," demanded simply to "be seen," Ms. Clark said. The equipment arrived late, there was no time to rehearse and "Ms. Anderson usually  left the spot just before the light got to it."         Ms. Clark was born in Baltimore to an academic family. Her father, Dr. Eliot  R. Clark, was later a professor of anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania. Ms. Clark wanted to be an actress, but, she told The New Haven Register, "I grew so tall I was cast only in men's parts."         In 1935, she graduated from Smith College. She went on to Yale, where she studied in the Department of Drama and Design, getting her master of fine arts degree in 1938.         In 1968, Ms. Clark was elected president of the United States Scenic Artists, Local 829, the first woman to hold that job. She taught lighting design at Smith College in 1967 and 1969, and at Yale Drama School in 1969 and 1970.         For many years, she lived in Brooklyn Heights, where she kept bulldogs. She was a president of the French Bull Dog Club of America.         Ms. Clark's husband, Lloyd R. Kelley, a theatrical electrician, died in 1972. She is survived by a brother, Douglas N. Clark, a professor of mathematics at the University of Georgia in Athens.       
         Jane Howard, a writer whose works included a widely praised biography of Margaret Mead and a close look at the dynamics of families, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 61.         Ms. Howard, who also had a home in Sag Harbor, L.I., had been suffering from  cancer, friends said.         Although she once described herself as "just a garden-variety English major" at the University of Michigan, Ms. Howard had been bitten by the journalism bug  as a girl in Winnetka, Ill. Her father was a political reporter for The Chicago  Tribune.         After graduating from the University of Michigan, where she was a reporter and editor on the campus newspaper, she came to Manhattan at the age of 21 as an editorial trainee at Time-Life. Her superiors noticed her drive and intelligence, and by 1958 she was doing profiles for Life magazine.         Insatiably curious about why people do what they do, and why relationships work or don't work, Ms. Howard specialized in profiling writers, including Saul  Bellow, John Updike and Truman Capote. She once celebrated New Year's at Capote's home at Sagaponack, L.I., "eating baked potatoes and caviar," as she put it.         Her most acclaimed work was the 1984 biography "Margaret Mead: a Life." Her account of the anthropologist's long life and career was a critical and commercial triumph. Ms. Howard interviewed about 300 people and traveled as far  as Australia and New Zealand to cull fact from legend.         Her first trip to Australia produced one embarrassing and, in retrospect, humorous exchange. While in Sydney, a city of some three million, she happened to mention to an Australian sociology professor that she had never seen a live kangaroo.         The professor told her not to feel bad. In his trips to Manhattan, he said, he had never seen a live buffalo.         Ms. Howard's earlier books were "Please Touch: A Guided Tour of the Human Potential Movement" (1970), "A Different Woman" (1973) and "Families" (1978).         "A Different Woman" was an examination of the feminist movement. For "Families," Ms. Howard visited dozens of households and concluded that, contrary to superficial wisdom, families were not dying but "in flamboyant and dumbfounding ways they are changing their size and their shape and their purpose."         At her death, Ms. Howard was under contract to Simon & Schuster for a nonfiction book, tentatively titled "Heartland," on the Midwest.         Between books, she taught writing at several universities, including the University of Georgia and Yale. She participated in the Writers Workshop at the  University of Iowa. Most recently, she taught a graduate class in nonfiction at  Columbia.         She once described her religious upbringing as "knee-jerk Congregational" and said she felt most intensely religious in the presence of nature, "where the air is fresh and there's something to look at other than rectangles."         She is survived by a sister, Ann Condon of Seattle.       
         Sophia Delza Glassgold, a modern dancer and teacher and an expert in the ancient Chinese exercise form called tai chi, died on June 27 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.         She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         A graduate of Hunter College, she trained as a modern dancer and toured the  United States performing Spanish and modern dance during the 1920's.         She also performed with her sister, Elizabeth, in the late 1920's at the Neighborhood Playhouse.         She lived in Shanghai from 1948 to 1951 and was the first American dancer to  teach modern dance in Chinese theater and dance schools.         Ms. Delza also became an expert on Chinese theatrical dancing after studying  action dance roles in the classical Chinese theater with Wang Fu-Ying and Cheng  Chuan-Chien.  She gave lectures and dance recitals on the material throughout the United States.         She founded the Delza School of Tai Chi Chuan at Carnegie Hall in 1954 and later taught at schools including the State University of New York at Purchase,  the Actor's Studio and the University of Hawaii.         She also taught and lectured on tai chi in live appearances and on television, writing the first book in English on the subject.         Her writings on esthetics, dance and theater arts and exercise and health have been published in China, in Europe and in American journals that include Dance Observer, the Theater Drama Review and the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism.         Ms. Delza also published a record album on teaching tai chi and wrote four books on tai chi and modern dance, including "The Tai Chi Chuan Experience," published this year by the State University of New York Press.         Ms. Delza's husband, A. Cook Glassgold, an official of the Joint Distribution Committee in Shanghai and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency, died in 1985.         She is survived by her sister, of Manhattan.       
         Justice Birdie Amsterdam, who achieved several judicial firsts, including being the first woman elected to the New York State Supreme Court, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 95 and lived on the Lower East Side, just steps from where she was born.         Justice Amsterdam came to be called the "first lady of the judiciary" by her  peers and other admirers, a sobriquet earned during 35 years on the bench.         She was the first woman elected to the Municipal Court in New York County in 1940. She was active in the Democratic Party, but when she was up for re-election in 1949, she carried the endorsements of all three parties, all bar  associations, the Citizens' Union and the American Federation of Labor.         In 1954, she was appointed Acting Justice of the City Court, another first for a woman, and won election to the office the next year.         In 1958, she gained the Supreme Court bench as a Democrat-Liberal, supported  again by a long roster of civic, communal, educational, labor, scientific, philanthropic and religious groups. She served until 1975.         Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, the first woman on the Court of Appeals in Albany, the state's highest tribunal, recalled Justice Amsterdam's trailblazing  achievements in a 1991 article in the New York Law Journal.         The State Supreme Court was more than 250 years old before a woman was elected to it, Judge Kaye wrote, and even today women do not enjoy the status of equals in the legal profession. "Thoughts of Justice Amsterdam's arrival on the  New York State Supreme Court serve to remind of us both of how far we have advanced toward these objectives and how much they continue to elude us," she wrote.         Justice Amsterdam was one of six children of Joseph Amsterdam, a band leader  from Austria. At 12, she taught English to foreign-born neighbors. Growing up in a neighborhood of immigrants and the poor awakened a commitment to social issues that guided her life as a lawyer. Her concerns ranged from playgrounds to summer camps, from slum clearance to shelter for the aged and the infirm, and from medical care to tuition assistance that could give a student a leg up. One of her special interests was the advancement of women in the legal profession.         She graduated on a state scholarship from Hunter College High School at 17. Waiting to meet the age requirement for admission to New York University Law School, she spent a year studying economics, banking and accounting at City College. She took evening classes at N.Y.U. and held a full-time job at Mount Sinai Hospital, keeping records and accounts.         Once she received her law degree in 1922, Mount Sinai doctors helped her practice by steering friends her way. She swiftly established a reputation not only as a skillful lawyer but also as an eloquent friend of the downtrodden, a champion of women's rights and a diligent party worker. She became a Tammany Hall district co-leader on the East Side.         Justice Amsterdam was honored by scores of organizations. "Who's Who of American Women" named her outstanding woman of the year for 1960 in the legal field, citing her "pre-eminent attainments and the inspiration they offer to other women in your profession."         Justice Amsterdam is survived by a sister and brother-in-law, Cynthia and Judge Milton Sanders, with whom she shared a home on Second Avenue for 59 years, as well as another sister, Sybil Chizner of Hollywood, Fla.         Correction:  July 11, 1996, Thursday         An obituary yesterday of Justice Birdie Amsterdam, the first woman elected to New York State Supreme Court, misstated the given name of a surviving sister. She is Ruth Sanders, not Cynthia.       
         Peg Weiss, an art historian, research professor and leading scholar on the Russian modernist Wassily Kandinsky, died on Wednesday at her home in Syracuse.  She was 63.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Volker Weiss, said.         In 1982, Mrs. Weiss was the curator of "Kandinsky in Munich" at the Solomon  R. Guggenheim Museum. She also wrote three books on the artist: "Kandinsky and Old Russia: The Artist as Ethnographer and Shaman," (Yale University Press, 1995); "Kandinsky in Munich, 1896-1914," the catalogue for the Guggenheim exhibition, and "Kandinsky in Munich: The Formative Jugendstil Years," (Princeton University Press, 1979).         Besides being a research professor at Syracuse University, Mrs.  Weiss was also a Getty scholar from 1989 to 1990. Before that she was the chief curator of the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, from 1979 to 1980, and the curator of collections there from 1975 until 1979.         Mrs. Weiss was born in Denver and reared in Massachusetts. In 1950, she moved to Syracuse to study art history, earning her B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Syracuse University. In 1956 she won a scholarship to study art history in Munich, and it was there that she became interested in Kandinsky's life and work.         She taught courses on modern art at colleges and universities across the country, including Cornell University and Columbia University. She was a guest curator at the Guggenheim Museum from 1979 until 1982.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Weiss is survived by two sons, Erick, of Los Angeles and Christopher, of Syracuse.       
         Jean Muir, whose dismissal from the television series "The Aldrich Family" in 1950 brought widespread attention to the television industry's practice of blacklisting suspected Communists, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Mesa, Ariz. She was 85.         On Aug. 27, 1950, Ms. Muir was preparing to appear in the role of Mother Aldrich in the premiere episode of "The Aldrich Family," when the show was abruptly canceled by NBC and the General Foods Corporation, the sponsor of the series. The company and the network were responding to angry telephone calls and telegrams from readers of Red Channels, a publication that had included Ms. Muir on a list of suspected Communists and Communist sympathizers in television and radio.         Ms. Muir denied the charges. "I am not a Communist, have never been one, and believe that the Communists represent a vicious and destructive force, and I am  opposed to them," she said after being dismissed from "The Aldrich Family." General Foods said it had no opinion on the accuracy of the charges against Ms.  Muir but that it had no choice but to dismiss her because the accusations made her "a controversial personality." Ms. Muir did not work in television again until 1958.         Ms. Muir was born in Suffern, N.Y., and attended schools in nearby Ridgewood, N.J. She found her way into acting by chance. Returning to the United States from France after studying French at the Sorbonne, she struck up a shipboard acquaintance with members of the English company of "Bird in Hand," which was headed to New Haven for a Broadway tryout. She agreed to become an understudy, and after acting in several stock productions, she appeared in such short-lived  Broadway shows as "The Truth Game," "Peter Ibbetson," and "Life Begins." In 1933, as one of the stars of "Saint Wench," she was spotted by a talent scout and signed to a contract at Warner Brothers, which shortened her name from Jean  Muir Fullarton.         She made more than two dozen B pictures in her four years with Warner, often  playing ingenues with a bit of flash and fire. Her films included "As the Earth  Turns," "Desirable," "Gentlemen Are Born" and "The White Cockatoo." In "A Midsummer Night's Dream," she appeared in the role of Helena. She also founded and managed a little theater company.         In 1937 she left Hollywood and, after appearing in London in J. B. Priestley's "People at Sea" and the British film "Jane Steps Out," returned to the New York theater. She toured with the Group Theater production of "Golden Boy" and performed in summer stock. In 1939 she helped organize the American Guild of Variety Artists. In a brief return to films in the early 1940's, she appeared in "The Lone Wolf Meets a Lady," "One Is Beautiful," and "The Constant  Nymph."         She found her way back into television in a drama on "Matinee Theater" on NBC in 1958. From 1966 to 1976 she taught drama at Stephens College in Columbia, Mo. After retiring, she taught briefly at several other colleges and universities, including the State University of New York at Stony Brook.         She is survived by a daughter, Margaret Bauer of Mesa, and two sons, Michael  of Los Angeles and David of Belmont, Calif.         Correction:  July 27, 1996, Saturday         An obituary of the actress Jean Muir on Thursday misstated the title of one of her films. It is "And One Was Beautiful," not "One Is Beautiful."       
         Erna Lane, a dancer who as a child was one of the first students of Elizabeth Duncan, Isadora Duncan's sister, died on June 28 at Hillcrest Hospital in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 92 and lived in West Stockbridge, Mass.         Miss Lane, who was born in Munich, Germany, began her dance training at the age of 5 at the Elizabeth Duncan School in Darmstadt, and later performed throughout Europe with a group of young women from the school. She made her United States debut as a solo dancer in 1928 in New York City and taught dance to the children of wealthy New York families.         Miss Lane also began to create assemblages, and by 1963 was exhibiting her artworks in museums that included the Malkasten in Dusseldorf, Germany, the Hammond Museum in North Salem, N.Y., and galleries throughout the Berkshires, where she lived for more than three decades.         She is survived by her daughter, Irina Ohl of Chester, Vt.; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Geulah Abrahams, a modern dancer and choreographer, died on Saturday at the Princeton Medical Center in Princeton, N.J. She was 65 and had homes in Princeton and New York.         She died after a brief illness, her husband, Elihu Abrahams, said.         Ms. Abrahams performed with the Paul Taylor Dance Company in 1963 and also danced with Mary Anthony, Pearl Lang and the Merry-Go-Rounders. She was on the dance faculty at Princeton University from 1975 to 1985. While there, she choreographed a production of Stravinsky's ''Soldier's Tale'' in collaboration with Michael Graves, the architect and designer, and Michael Pratt, the conductor.         She collaborated frequently with Paul Lansky, the composer, with whom she presented a retrospective program in New York and Princeton in 1995. She also choreographed for theater and opera with various directors, including Wilford Leach, Michael Kahn and Edward Berkeley.         Ms. Abrahams founded her own modern dance company, Geulah Abrahams Danceworks, in 1985. Interested in the connections between art and science, she created ''Dances in Physics'' in 1989 and presented the work at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles. She also taught and choreographed at the Ballet West summer school in Aspen, Colo.         During the past three years, she taught at the Aspen Music Festival and was the resident choreographer of the Aspen Opera House.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Jonathan, of New York City and David, of Cambridge, Mass., and by a brother, Shmuel Govreen of Jerusalem.       
         Virginia Corwin Brautigam, a scholar who helped pioneer the field of comparative religion and who traveled the world in search of knowledge about Eastern faiths, died on Monday at a retirement community in Newtown, Pa. She was 95.         Dr. Corwin, as she was know to her students and colleagues, was a professor emeritus of religion and biblical literature at Smith College, where she taught from 1930 until  retiring in 1966.         Originally a specialist in early Christianity, Dr. Corwin's intellectual curiosity about Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam and Shinto was stimulated by a course in world religions she taught as a young assistant professor.         Her studies took her far and wide. She walked through central India with the disciples of Vinoba Bhave, a spiritual successor of Mohandas K. Gandhi who traveled on foot from village to village preaching asceticism and social reform.         In Kyoto, Japan, she was taken in by Buddhist monks as a visiting resident in their temple.         And in Vietnam she hitched a ride with the United States Army, which flew her to isolated villages deep in the interior so she could study their Buddhist traditions.         Virginia Corwin, who was born and raised in East Orange, N.J., graduated from Wellesley College, Union Theological Seminary and Yale University, where she received a doctorate in history in 1937 after studying under Robert Calhoun, Roland Bainton and Richard Niebuhr.         Her dissertation, ''St. Ignatius and Christianity in Antioch,'' was published by Yale Press in 1960.         Dr. Corwin's broadening interests, which went from the study of early Christianity to include more world religions, was emblematic of her generation of theologians. She began teaching when the field of comparitive religion was still young.         ''Her generation was involved in the forming and shaping of a whole new field of study, especially for liberal arts colleges, that changed the focus of study from normative Christianity to a whole range of religions,'' said Diana L. Eck, a professor of comparative religion and Indian studies at Harvard University, who took Dr. Corwin's class at Smith and became a lifelong friend.         Dr. Corwin remained single until she was 74 years old, when she married Herman Brautigam, a friend and colleague she had first met 40 years earlier as a student at Yale. Mr. Brautigam died in 1985.         Dr. Corwin, who lost her eyesight in the 1970's, continued teaching courses in religion to her neighbors at Pennswood Village, her retirement home, until this March.         She is survived by a brother, Theodore S. Corwin of Chatham, N.J., three step-children, and nine step-grandchildren.       
         Phyllis Pearsall, who created the famous ''A to Z'' maps of London by traversing more than 3,000 miles of roads throughout the city, died on Wednesday, her business, Geographers' A-Z Map Company, said today. She was 89 years old and lived in Shoreham, England.         Mrs. Pearsall began producing her maps, which show London's labyrinth of streets from the busiest thoroughfares to the tiniest cul-de-sacs, after getting lost using a map that was 17 years old but proved to be the most up-to-date available. To get her first edition right, she often walked for 18 hours a day, rising at 5 A.M. and eventually covering some 23,000 roads.         In 1936 Mrs. Pearsall printed  10,000 copies of her maps, selling them as indefatigably as she had compiled them. She persuaded a reluctant buyer at W. H. Smith, the British bookseller, to place an order for 250 copies, promising a refund if they went unsold.         The maps were an instant success, and have sold countless millions of copies since, the favorite of visitors and Londoners alike, including the cab drivers and others whose job it is to make their way around the city.         Phyllis Isobel Gross was born in 1906, the daughter of an Irish-Italian mother and a Hungarian mapmaker. She was sent to Roedean, a fashionable girls' boarding school, but was forced to leave at age 14 when her father went bankrupt and fled to the United States. When she returned home, she said once in an interview, the door was answered by the fully  decked-out Maharajah of Patiala, who was in the midst of having his portrait painted by Alfred Orr, Phyllis's mother's lover.         ''Then mother said: 'Alfred has an artistic temperament and couldn't possibly have a little girl in the house. Get a live-in job,' '' Mrs. Pearsall related.         So Phyllis moved to Paris, where she taught English, studied philosophy and Byzantine art, and made money by painting. When she was 21, she married a 38-year-old artist and moved to Spain. After eight years  she left him because, she said, ''he was always angry and frightened.'' The couple had no children.         Returning to London and enlisting the help of her father's draftsman, Mrs. Pearsall founded the Geographer's A-Z Map Company and went to work. It wasn't easy, she said. ''I would go down one street, find three more and have no idea where I was.''         In 1965 Mrs. Pearsall turned the company into a trust to protect it from hostile takeovers. She also set up a trustee company to hold all the shares for staff members, giving up pension and dividend rights for herself, but continuing as chairman and joint managing dirctor.         Mrs. Pearsall suffered a stroke and fractured her spine and skull in a plane crash in the Netherlands in 1946, but she remained active until very late in life. She reported to work well into her 80's, arriving in a red Mercedes that she had been allowed to drive only since the age of 59, when she passed her driving test after more than 200 lessons.         Her London map business grew to include maps of all sizes, maps of other British cities, and road atlases, but Mrs. Pearsall always said that her real love was painting. In 1986 the Royal Geographical Society held an exhibition of her drawings, paintings and etchings.         Mrs. Pearsall wrote several books, including an account of her trips through Spain, a collection of short stories, a company history and a volume describing her business philosophy, in which she advocated generosity (''bonuses to everyone''), courtesy (''no aggressive selling'') and frugality (''Micawber housekeeping''). In 1986 she was made a Member of the British Empire.         Asked once by an interviewer if the doyenne of maps still got lost, she replied, ''Always, dear.''       
         Louise Talma, a composer whose music combined a Neo-Classical spareness, clarity and lyricism with the structural rigorousness of the 12-tone school, died on Tuesday at Yaddo, the artists' colony near Saratoga Springs, N.Y., where she was composing a song cycle with chamber accompaniment. She was 89 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Talma's opera, ''The Alcestiad,'' a collaboration with Thornton Wilder, became the first work by an American woman to be presented by a major European opera company when it had its premiere at the Frankfurt Opera in 1962. In 1974, she became the first female composer to be elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.         A prolific composer who was especially adept at text setting, Ms. Talma wrote dozens of song cycles and choral works on both sacred and secular subjects. She also created a catalogue of colorfully scored chamber works and piano pieces, several of which have been recorded, most notably on a 1987 collection of her works on the CRI label, and on an earlier recording made by the Musical Heritage Society. These include ''Four-Handed Fun'' (1939), a light-spirited piano duet, as well as a set of sharp-edged bagatelles (1955) and the hauntingly beautiful ''Ambient Air'' (1983), a set of vivid evocations of nature for flute, violin, cello and piano.         Louise Juliette Talma was born in Arcachon, France, on Oct. 31, 1906, to American parents who were both professional musicians. She grew up in New York City, and studied chemistry at Columbia University while at the same time studying the piano and composition at the Institute of Musical Art, the predecessor of the Juilliard School. She also earned a music degree at New York University and a master of arts degree at Columbia.         As a student, she won prizes both as a pianist and for her compositions, and her ambition at first was to be a pianist. Between 1926 and 1935, she spent her summers studying with Isidore Philipp in France. In 1928, however, she began studying composition with Nadia Boulanger in Fontainebleau, and by 1935, Boulanger persuaded her to devote herself fully to composition. She continued her formal studies with Boulanger until 1939, and later became the first American to teach at Fontainebleau.         Boulanger's influence can be seen in the carefully etched Neo-Classicism of Ms. Talma's earliest works. In the early 1950's, she began using 12-tone techniques, principally as a way of creating themes rather than as an escape from conventional tonality. Yet lyricism and a sense of a tonal center remained crucial elements of her work, as did an approach to instrumental coloration that alluded to the styles of Ravel and Messiaen and often seemed to have more in common with the French style than with contemporary American works.         Ms. Talma taught at the Manhattan School of Music in the late 1920's, and at Hunter College for more than 50 years. She wrote ''Harmony for the College Student'' and was the co-author, with Robert Levin and James S. Harris, of ''Functional Harmony.'' She was a board member of the League of Composers, the International Society for Contemporary Music, the Fontainebleau Arts Association and the American Music Center.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Elizabeth Greig, one of the country's most accomplished women at tying fly-fishing lures who was known for her adeptness and her unusual technique, died last Saturday at Highlands Lake Center-Genesis Eldercare in Lakeland, Fla. She was 93.         An expert known for tying flies with her hands instead of with a conventional vise, Mrs. Greig was a innovator in fly-fishing at a time when mostly men participated in the sport. In the late 1930's, Mrs. Greig was a founder of Angler's Roost, a popular fly-fishing shop situated in the Chrysler Building in New York City.         Her skills were pervasive, from knowing where to wade into the fly-fishing streams of the Catskills, to the important task of choosing the feathers and other materials that made the difference between a quality or inferior fly. Scotty, as she was called, encouraged the fish tales that floated in and out of the conversations at her shop in New York. ''There were more fish caught in my shop than on most streams,'' she was once quoted as having said.         Mrs. Greig was born in Peebles, Scotland, on Sept. 10, 1902. Her father, a stone mason, taught her how to fly-fish on the shores of the River Tweed by day, and how to tie flies at the kitchen table by night.         The family eventually moved to Edinburgh, where Mrs. Greig, then 14 years old, spent four years as an apprentice at a fly-dressing factory. After marrying Robert Greig of Scotland in the early 1930's, she and her husband immigrated to Canada, where they lived for several years before moving to New York City. In the mid-1950's, they moved on to Lakeland, Fla., where Mrs. Greig continued to specialize in making fishing lures. Her husband died in 1968.         Mrs. Greig is survived by three sisters, Annie, Nan and Jean, who live in Scotland.       
         Vera Brodsky Lawrence, a pianist, editor and historian of American music whose research helped bring the works of Scott Joplin and Louis Moreau Gottschalk to the attention of contemporary performers, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         Mrs. Lawrence was best known for ''The Collected Works of Scott Joplin,'' which restored to print much of that composer's long unavailable music. The edition, published in 1971, was a catalyst in the ragtime revival of the mid-1970's. She was an artistic consultant to the Houston Grand Opera in 1975 when it staged Joplin's opera, ''Treemonisha,'' and to Deutsche Grammophon when it recorded the production the same year.         Mrs. Lawrence also published ''The Piano Music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk'' (1969), the first collected edition of an American composer's works, and ''The Wa-Wan Press, 1901-1911,'' a five-volume reprint of Arthur Farwell's pioneering American music series. Her ''Music for Patriots, Politicians and Presidents'' (1975) explored the relationship between politics and music during the 18th and 19th centuries.         Her most recent project was ''Strong on Music,'' a series that explored the musical world of 19th-century New York through the eyes of the lawyer and diarist George Templeton Strong. The first volume, ''Resonances,'' was published in 1991. A second, ''Reverberations,'' followed in 1995. Mrs. Lawrence left a third volume nearly completed.         Music history was actually Mrs. Lawrence's second career; she did not begin to devote herself fully to it until 1965, when she gave up a 40-year career as a concert pianist. She was born in Norfolk, Va., in 1909, and attended the Juilliard School, where she was a student of Josef and Rosina Lhevinne, Rubin Goldmark and Bernard Wagenaar.         Mrs. Lawrence made her debut in 1925, and performed regularly in new music concerts and with chamber groups. She was a staff pianist at CBS radio from 1939 to 1946. In 1944, she married Theodore Lawrence, an engineer for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He died in 1964.         During her years as a performer, Mrs. Lawrence taught at the Juilliard School and the Curtis Institute of Music. In 1967, she became the administrator of the publications program of the Contemporary Music Project, which sent 73 composers to 77 secondary school systems around the country.         In 1969, Mrs. Lawrence compiled and edited a library of 500 works composed as part of the project.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Cynthia Novack, an improvisational dancer and a writer and teacher, died on Sept. 27 at home in Manhattan. She was 49.         The cause was cancer, said Richard Bull, her husband.         Ms. Novack performed with the Richard Bull Dance Theater and the Improvisational Arts Ensemble, companies devoted to freewheeling yet small-scale and intimate performances of improvisational dance, which she founded with Mr. Bull.         She taught at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, at Barnard College and at the State University of New York at Brockport before joining the dance faculty at Wesleyan University in 1983. At the time of her death, she was an associate professor of dance and women's studies at the university.         Ms. Novack wrote for publications including The Drama Review, Ethnomusicology, and Women and Performance. She was the author of ''Sharing the Dance: Contact Improvisation and American Culture'' (1990) and was at work on a book about choreography and improvisation.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a stepdaughter, Katie Bull-Prichett of Manhattan, and a granddaughter.       
         Millicent Ellis Selsam, an author who filled bookshelf upon bookshelf with primers seeking to still the nagging why's with which children tax their parents' patience and knowledge, died on Saturday at Mary Manning Walsh Home in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan and Fire Island, L.I.         A writer of simple science booklets, she was credited with some 130 titles, scores of which remain in print. While they were tailored for young readers from kindergarten through the early grades, she also wrote science books for teen-agers and a few for adults.         Mrs. Selsam published her first book in 1946, ''From Egg to Chick,'' after having taught high school science in the New York City public school system. Since then her work found outlets at Harper & Row, Morrow, Macmillan, Doubleday and Walker, among other publishers.         She started a series of ''I Can Read Books'' for Harper and regularly contributed to the ''First Look at . . .'' series published by Walker. Both series introduced inquisitive children to the animal kingdom and the marvels small children discover all around them.         Her books received many awards, including the Thomas Alva Edison Award for the best juvenile science book, ''Biography of an Atom'' (1965).         She was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree at Columbia University.         She is survived by a son, Robert, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
         Hannah Green, an acclaimed author who wrote one slender novel of such delicately distilled perfection that she could hardly bring herself to compose another, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital in Manhattan, six months after the reissue of her classic work, ''The Dead of the House,'' had been received with almost as much critical enthusiasm as its original publication a generation ago. She was 69 and lived in Greenwich Village.         Her husband, the painter John Wesley, said the cause was lung cancer.         ''The Dead of the House'' was, by format, just another example of a well-worn genre, a coming-of-age novel, in this case a fictionalized account of Ms. Green's childhood in an Ohio village and on the summertime shores of Lake Michigan.         But in her hands the familiar pangs of childhood, the adolescent passage from virginity to passion and the sobering loss of a first love were so exquisitely wrought that critics were instantly smitten.         Indeed, when ''The Dead of the House'' was published by Doubleday in 1972, the author Richard Ellman said reading it was like falling in love.         ''I was, for as long as it took,'' he wrote in The New York Times Book Review, ''able to surrender my own callowness and smugness to the ecstasy that is fiction, is art.''         Other critics had similar praise, which was echoed when Books & Company/Turtle Point Press reissued the book this year. If such enthusiasm seems extreme for what was, after all, a first novel, there was ample evidence that this was a very special first novel. Among other things, the budding first novelist was 46 years old and had been working on the book for the better part of two decades.         She was also a highly schooled professional who had studied with Vladmir Nabokov at Wellesley and with Wallace Stegner while obtaining a master's degree at Stanford. She taught at Stanford for a while before coming to New York and beginning a part-time career as a teacher of creative writing, first at Columbia and later at New York University.         Ms. Green, a native of Glendale, Ohio, was also a precocious child who early on encountered the frustrations of writing that would bedevil her the rest of her life. When she was 4, her husband said, she dreamed up a story about a mischievous pig, but in trying to compose it on her slate could not even get through the title. Her childhood scrawl was so large that she ran out of space after ''The Misch.''         In later years Ms. Green's problem was not her handwriting (she composed on a manual typewriter) but her almost obsessive pursuit of a perfection that always seemed just one rewrite away.         The real wonder of ''The Dead of the House,'' her husband suggested, was not that it took so long, but that it was finished at all. ''She never wanted to let go,'' he said.         A tall, dark-haired woman who dressed conventionally and had an open, unassuming smile, away from the typewriter she seemed anything but an artist. Still, she had her transcendent moments, like the time she and her future husband met. A boyfriend had taken her to a party at Mr. Wesley's studio, the painter recalled,  and while the other guests downed canapes and quaffed beer with gusto, she approached him and asked for an orange.         By some coincidence, he said, he did have an orange, and it was immediate love.         The couple were married in 1971, and a few years later, while traveling in France, Ms. Green had another transcendent moment when at a church in Conques, in south-central France, she encountered the bones of Saint Foy, one of the last martyrs to Roman rule.         ''It blew the top of her head off,'' Mr. Wesley said, noting that for the last 25 years his wife had been writing -- and rewriting -- a book about the martyred 12-year-old girl who was betrayed by her father, refused to renounce her faith and put to death, inspiring a cult that continues in France.         Ms. Green's book, ''Golden Spark, Little Saint: My Book of the Hours of Saint Foy,'' which combines fiction with factual accounts of the Conques region and its people, is to be published by Random House next year.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Mary Lonsdale Hickler of Warwick, Mass.       
         Magda Trocme, a French parson's wife who opened her door to a single shivering refugee in 1940 and helped inspire a movement that saved thousands of Jews and others from the Nazis in World War II, died on Oct. 10 a hospital in Paris. She was 94 and lived in Paris.         Although she was a heroine to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Memorial Authority, to her dying day Mrs. Trocme could not comprehend a world that regarded it as in any way remarkable that she, her husband, and thousands of other residents of the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in the plateau region of southern France had risked their lives to feed, clothe, hide and protect those who would have died without their help.         But then Mrs. Trocme was an anomaly, a free-thinking woman whose life was dedicated to the curious principle that just as food is the answer to hunger the only rational antidote to violence is nonviolence.         Mrs. Trocme owed her own prominence in the rescue movement in part to the fact that her husband, Andre Trocme, was the charismatic pacifist pastor of the French Reformed Church in Chambon, a founder of the Cevenol boarding school there and a recognized leader of the rescue effort, which has been credited with saving some 5,000 refugees, about 3,500 of them Jewish, many of them children.         But as scores of refugees who came to her own door discovered, Mrs. Trocme was more than her husband's shadow; she was a highly organized, tireless and practical woman who knew how to find food when there was no food and just which door to knock on to find room and welcome for those her own overburdened household could not accommodate.         The almost unanimous support the rescue movement enjoyed in the area around Chambon is generally attributed to the mostly Protestant peasant population's identification with the victims of persecution.         But neither her husband nor Mrs. Trocme were natives of the region. Mrs. Trocme, whose paternal grandfather was a refugee from Czarist Russia and whose father was an engineer who had been a colonel in the Italian cavalry, was born in Florence, where she had an unconventional reaction to a conventional Catholic upbringing. While a convent student, she rejected the Church and embraced Protestantism.         While studying on a scholarship at the old School of Social Work in New York in 1925, she met Mr. Trocme, a  Protestant from northern France who was studying at the Union Theological Seminary. They were married in 1926.         After his ordination, Mr. Trocme, who was something of a free-thinker himself (he had renounced violence and become a conscientious objector in World War I) was regarded as so much of a rebel in the French Protestant church that he was sent in 1934 to Chambon in southern France, a region with a long history of tolerance since the days it had become a refuge for Huguenots fleeing the purges of Catholic France.         Like her husband, Mrs. Trocme, who taught Italian at the Cevenol school, was a thoroughgoing pacifist. But many of the villagers and farmers of the region were not. Under the rule of the collaborationist Vichy Government and the later German occupation many of them took part in the Resistance activities that were common throughout France, but what set the Chambon area apart was its role as a place of refuge.         Although her open-hearted welcome to the Jewish woman who knocked on her door one snowy night in 1940 has been considered the beginning of the Chambon movement, Mrs. Trocme's daughter, Nelly Hewitt of Minneapolis, stressed yesterday that in an area where secrecy was a way of life and virtually every home eventually harbored one or more refugees, it is impossible to know whether her mother had been the first.         Mrs. Trocme's initial effort almost backfired, her daughter recalled, when she placed her visitor's soaked shoes next to the hearth to dry and they caught fire.         After the war, Mr. Trocme became the European secretary for the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an American-based pacifist group, and during the 1950's he and his wife made fund-raising tours of the United States. He later became pastor of a church in Geneva, and after his death in 1971, Mrs. Trocme retired to Paris.         There she wondered at the attention her efforts had received over the years, including a 1989 book by Philip P. Hallie, ''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed,'' and a television documentary, ''Weapons of the Spirit.''         To her mind, at least, she had done nothing more than provide the obvious help to those in obvious need. She no more understood the fuss over her efforts to rescue Jews than the consternation she caused her neighbors  when policemen came to arrest her husband (he was later released) and she served them dinner.         ''I don't understand,'' she said. ''It was dinner time.''         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Trocme is survived by a son, Jacques, of Paris, 10 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 9, 1996, Saturday         An obituary on Oct. 19 about Magda Trocme, a Frenchwoman who helped shield Jewish refugees from the Nazis in World War II, misspelled the name of her daughter and misstated the daughter's hometown. She is Nelly Hewett, not Hewitt, of St. Paul, not Minneapolis.       
         Ruth Lewis Farkas, who was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1973 after she and her husband, the founder of the Alexander's department stores, contributed $300,000 to President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign, died on Friday at the Park Avenue home of her son Robin. She was 89.         Mrs. Farkas, who lived in Palm Beach, Fla., had been staying with Mr. Farkas and his wife, Carol, a nurse, in Manhattan since her release two weeks ago from the New York University Medical Center, where she had been treated for a heart ailment.         Despite the uproar that surrounded Mrs. Farkas's appointment and a delay in her Senate confirmation, her posting caused little stir in the tiny grand duchy of Luxembourg, which was accustomed to Americans whose path to ambassadorships was paved with political contributions.         Although Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas cast his Foreign Relations committee vote against her and denounced her appointment as demeaning the Foreign Service, Senator Gale W. McGee of Wyoming said he was satisfied that Mrs. Farkas was innocent of any impropriety and laughed about the custom of making envoys of people who make generous campaign contributions.         ''The money -- that's par for the course,'' he said. ''It used to be a cheaper price -- but that's Nixon inflation.''         In contrast to Ambassador Perle Mesta, the Washington socialite who arrived in Luxembourg in 1949 with flamboyant ways and gala parties that inspired the Broadway musical ''Call Me Madam,'' Mrs. Farkas, who held a doctorate in sociology from Columbia University and a doctorate in education from New York University, maintained a low profile.         Reserved by nature and press-shy because of the uproar that surrounded her appointment, she was more at ease as the sponsor of forums on the drug problems of teen-agers than in being a second coming of a woman known as the hostess with the mostest.         Not until two years after Mrs. Farkas arrived did she make her first splash in the social life of Luxembourg, with a charity gala that featured the singer Sacha Distel and a United States Army orchestra. The event took in $28,000 for a school for handicapped children.         She maintained close ties with the Government, gave quiet and unpretentious parties and, unlike many envoys, avoided making political statements about United States policy. Most diplomatic work was carried out by her six-member staff, and in the Luxembourg diplomatic community, which then included 13 other ambassadors, Mrs. Farkas, though serious, was not considered a heavyweight.         President Gerald R. Ford accepted her resignation in 1976 and replaced her with Rosemary L. Ginn, a longtime Republican national committeewoman from Missouri.         Mrs. Farkas settled in Florida and resumed her many philanthropic and humanitarian activities and research into male and female roles through the Role Foundation, which she established in 1967.         Ruth Lewis, one of five children of Samuel Lewis and the former Jennie Bach, was born in Manhattan in 1906. Both her parents were in the real estate business and each influenced her. ''Community living and sharing, that was my mother; intellectual pursuits, that was my father,'' Mrs. Farkas once said.         Accompanying her mother into tenements taught her about poverty, and Mrs. Farkas never forgot her mother's advice: ''No matter what your station in life, no matter what you grow up to be, always try to  contribute to those less fortunate than you.''         She met George Farkas when she was 10. Their families lived in the same apartment house, at 107th Street and Fifth Avenue, where George, whose father had died, kept a close eye on his little sister, who was Ruth Lewis's best friend.         ''I didn't like him at first because he was such a boss,'' she said.         They were married in 1928, but not until she graduated from New York University. She received a master's degree from Columbia in 1932 and  was for many years a member of the executive committee of Alexander's.         Mr. Farkas died in 1980.         In addition to Robin, Mrs. Farkas is survived by three other sons, Alexander of Highland Park, Fla., and  Bruce and Jonathan, of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Fritz and Ingeborg Kahlenberg, exiled Germans who met during World War II as members of Hidden Camera, a Dutch Resistance group that documented the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, died this month at New York University Hospital within two weeks of each other.         The Kahlenbergs, who established Film Authors, a New York film production company after they immigrated to the United States in 1946, lived in Manhattan. Mr. Kahlenberg, 80, died on Oct. 15; Mrs. Kahlenberg, 76, died on Oct. 2.         The couple's daughter, Liz Kahlenberg Bordow, said her mother had died of lung cancer and her father of complications of kidney failure.         Working secretly, the Hidden Camera photographers, led by Mr. Kahlenberg, hoarded rationed film, snapped pictures with cameras concealed in coats or handbags, developed the photographs and, in some cases, tried to smuggle them out of the country.         Under the title ''The Illegal Camera: Photography in the Netherlands During the German Occupation, 1940-1945,'' an exhibition of 75 photographs taken by members of the Hidden Camera opened in August at the Jewish Museum, at Fifth Avenue and 92d Street, where it is to run until Dec. 1.         In addition to the persecution of the Jews, the photographs at the museum cover warfare and occupation, confiscation of goods, compulsory labor, resistance, the ''Hunger Winter'' of 1944-45 when starvation was rampant, and liberation.         One of the most widely known of the Hidden Camera photographs, taken by Cas Oorthuys and included by Edward Steichen in his collection ''The Family of Man,'' studies the face of a sunken-eyed woman gnawing on a crust of bread.         ''The pictures are painful to look at,'' Sarah Boxer wrote in her review in The New York Times.         Henry Kol, the Dutch consul for press and cultural affairs in New York, credited photographs taken by Hidden Camera with providing evidence that enabled the Dutch Government in exile to persuade the Red Cross to arrange food drops.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, who was taught by her husband to operate a camera, was also involved in resistance communications, transporting munitions and the use of forged documents.         Mr. Kahlenberg, who was born in Berlin, where his father was a founder of the U.F.A. film studio, settled in Amsterdam after Hitler came to power and was a film distributor when World War II began.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, whose maiden name was Wallheimer, was born in Bremen and moved to Amsterdam with her family in 1939.         The couple, cited by the Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, for their resistance activities, were married in 1946 and settled in New York.         For a time, Mr. Kahlenberg was a producer with Telenews, which provided newsreels to movie theaters. In the 1950's, the Kahlenbergs founded Film Authors, a production company.         They produced a wide variety of documentary and travel films for such clients as Pan American Airways, the Icelandic and Scandinavian Travel Bureaus, Holland America Lines and Bermuda. David Frost, Ernie Kovacs and Jonathan Winters were among the narrators.         In addition to their daughter, of Berkeley, Calif., they are survived by  a grandchild.         Mr. Kahlenberg is also survived by a brother, Hans Kahlenberg of Chiddingfold, England. Mrs. Kahlenberg is survived by a brother, Gunthur Wallheimer, and a sister, Helga Ekker, both of Amsterdam.       
         Diana Trilling, an uncompromising cultural and social critic and a member of the circle of writers, thinkers and polemicists of the 1930's, 40's and 50's known as the New York intellectuals, died on Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         At one point, as a critic for The Nation, Mrs. Trilling read a novel a day for six and a half years, delivering challenging reviews on some of the most important works of the modern era: Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited,'' Robert Penn Warren's ''All the King's Men,'' Jean-Paul Sartre's ''Age of Reason'' and George Orwell's ''1984.''         As a reviewer, she approached her work with ''force, control and precision,'' said Paul Fussell, the scholar and author, in his introduction to a collection of her criticism titled ''Reviewing the Forties'' (Harcourt Brace, 1978). Her theme, he said, was ''the threat of monomanias and systems and theories and sentimentalities to fiction.'' Above all, he said, she was ''impatient with simplicities,'' but ''generous in recognizing real merit.''         As an intellectual living through the Depression, the rise and fall of Fascism and Communism, World War II, the Holocaust, Prohibition and the sexual revolution, Diana Trilling clung to an old-fashioned ethos.         ''My first responsibility was to my home and family,'' she once said. ''I was able to deceive myself that it was a matter of free will and competence that I took on the tasks of the home.'' She credited her husband, Lionel Trilling -- one of the century's foremost literary critics and teachers and the author of works like ''The Liberal Imagination'' that became central documents of American intellectual life -- with her success and development as a critical writer, even as she struggled to establish herself in her own right in later years.         Keeping the Flame, While Breaking Free         To everyone, she was a complicated woman, with a passion for language, a zest for cultural contention and a sharp, usually unforgiving pen. Robert Lowell called her ''a housekeeping goddess of reason.''         She began writing in 1941 and never stopped. Fifty-four years later, in her 90th year, with failing eyesight, she composed a 75-page article on the Welsh literary figure Goronwey Rees, offered it for publication to The New Yorker, then headed for her summer home on Cape Cod. Later, back in her ground-floor apartment on Claremont Avenue near Columbia University, she resumed her routine of writing from 9 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon, five days a week.         She believed that ''writers are what they write, also what they fail to write.'' No novels, no volumes of poetry or short fiction bear her name, but among her credits are five books. These include three collections of essays and reviews and an impressionistic piece of journalism, ''Mrs. Harris: The Death of the Scarsdale Diet Doctor'' (Harcourt Brace, 1981), about the sensational murder trial of Jean Harris, the headmistress of an exclusive girls' school, for the murder of her lover. She also wrote ''The Beginning of the Journey'' (Harcourt Brace, 1993), sometimes a memoir, sometimes an apologia, often a long letter of rebuke to those who thought of her as little more than a sidekick to the scholar with whom she lived for 46 years.         Still, the task of keeping Lionel Trilling's flame while trying to break free of its light sometimes seemed to envelop her. She once told an interviewer that the headline on her obituary would read: ''Diana Trilling Dies at 150. Widow of Distinguished Professor and Literary Critic Lionel Trilling.''         His expertise was acquired; he held a doctorate from Columbia University, taught there in the company of brilliant colleagues and challenged students who went on to produce some of the country's finest literature and criticism. Her expertise, on the other hand, was intuitive; her Radcliffe degree in fine arts, she said, left her ill-prepared for anything except a walk through a gallery or a museum.         ''I graduated from Radcliffe without having read a line of Homer or Dante or Chaucer, without knowing anything of Shakespeare,'' she said. So she learned from her husband, ''casually, unconsciously, by association,'' and along the way discovered that she had a natural acuity for language and an innate sense of what made a good book work.         She suggested in her memoir that Lionel Trilling often used her as an editor and tutor on style. ''What I was trying to bring to his writing was a greater directness and greater fluidity,'' she wrote. Nevertheless, she never doubted ''that, of the two of us, he was the more important writer.'' Her husband ''had more to say than I and a great deal more resonated from what he wrote.''         Her work appeared in some of the best magazines in the country, including The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Harper's and The Saturday Review, but mainly in two journals that were among those at the center of American intellectual life of the period, The Nation, where she wrote book reviews and literary criticism, and The Partisan Review, to which she contributed essays. Her writing bears out her interest in the relationship between esthetics, morality and society and her determination to express moral judgments -- her critics said moralistic judgments -- on literature and the political issues of the day.         She was a fierce anti-Communist, someone who joined some Communist-front groups in the early 1930's but who then became disaffected by the ruthlessness of Stalin, and for the rest of her public life she wore the ideals of Western democracy on her sleeve. Perhaps it was this disaffection that led her to think of herself as a rationalist bent on exposing empty slogans and ideas -- political, literary and cultural. And it was this stance, the immovable anti-Communist who insisted that all ideas be grounded in rationality and morality, that dominated her work.         'An Anxious World' Filled With Fears         A native New Yorker, she was born on July 21, 1905, one of three children of Helene Forbert Rubin and Joseph Rubin, a manufacturer of straw braid. Her parents were immigrant Polish Jews who moved with their children from Westchester to Brooklyn to Manhattan. ''Pleasure was not the principle of our home,'' Mrs. Trilling once wrote. ''I learned early in life that to laugh before breakfast was to cry before dinner.''         She described herself as an ''excessively fearful'' child. First she was afraid of the dark, then of burglars and, as she grew older, eventually of just about everything, especially being alone or leaving the house. ''I regard the whole of my life as having been lived in an anxious world,'' she said.         Her fears, indeed her fear of having so many fears, may have shaped her choice of work, she came to believe, because they made her ''too intent upon reasonableness'' and ''blocked the free play of my imagination.'' Thus she stuck to analytical writing, preferring the logical and cerebral to the fantastic.         In 1927, in a Manhattan speak-easy -- over a drink called a bullfrog (gin, apricot brandy and grenadine) -- she met Lionel Trilling. He was smart and handsome, a graduate student in literature at Columbia. In a short time, they fell in love. Later they slept together. (''Surely going to bed with a man before marriage was the most courageous act of my life,'' she said.) And in 1929, they were married.         ''With marriage I had entered Lionel's world,'' she said. ''It was with his friends that I now chiefly associated. They were not easy companions, these intellectuals. They were overbearing and arrogant, excessively competitive; they lacked magnanimity and often they lacked common courtesy. Ours was a cruelly judgmental society, often malicious and riddled with envy.''         But what a society it was, with Alfred Kazin, Irving Howe, Philip Rahv, William Phillips, Sidney Hook, Delmore Schwartz, Dwight McDonald, Hannah Arendt, Saul Bellow, Mary McCarthy, Clement Greenberg, Irving Kristol and several others striving to set the intellectual agenda of the nation.         In book-cluttered apartments on the Upper West Side, they lived what Mrs. Trilling called ''a life of significant contention.'' In the pages of The Partisan Review, Commentary, The Nation and Dissent, they debated whether America should enter World War II. They quarreled over Trotsky and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the Beats and the Columbia riots to such an extent that many of the survivors have not spoken to one another for years.         When these intellectuals were not preoccupied by ideas or pulling apart the culture, they talked incessantly, Mrs. Trilling remembered in her memoir, ''about sex, sex, and more sex, with particular emphasis upon adultery.'' Sex, she continued, ''took up as much conversational space as in later years we would give to politics.''         Wielding Her Pen With Candor         Diana Trilling's career as a critic began in 1941, at the age of 36, when she overheard a telephone conversation between her husband and Margaret Marshall, the literary editor of The Nation, who had called to ask if he could recommend someone to write the magazine's literary notes column. When her husband hung up, Mrs. Trilling looked at him and offered herself for the position.         She held the job for 10 years, often wielding her pen like a Bowie knife: ''A mad, bad, and dangerous book, Allan Seager's 'Equinox' is fiction's most recent attempt to practice psychiatry without a license.'' Or, of Truman Capote's ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'': ''I find myself deeply antipathetic to the whole artistic-moral purpose of Mr. Capote's novel. I would freely trade 80 percent of his technical skill for 20 percent more value in the uses to which it is put.''         She was proud of her reputation as a clear-eyed, uncompromising critic. She liked to tell the story of a Viennese novelist, a refugee from Nazi Austria, who ''was said to have remarked that he had lost his country, his home, his language, but that he had at least one good fortune; he has not been reviewed by me.''         As she approached her 42d birthday, she decided that she and her husband had been squandering their lives. ''We were afraid to be full grown up and to be in command of ourselves and others.'' And so she became pregnant. Their only child, James, was born shortly thereafter, in 1947. James, of Providence, R.I., survives her, as do two grandchildren.         In 1975, Lionel Trilling died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 70, and in the years that followed, she worked hard to assure his legacy, editing a 12-volume uniform edition of his work. But she also strove successfully to establish her own mark, writing essays, publishing two collections of criticism -- ''Reviewing the Forties''  and ''We Must My Darlings'' (Harcourt Brace, 1977) -- and covering the Jean Harris trial. Then, suffering from macular degeneration that left her with eyesight so poor she could no longer type, she dictated her memoir, ''The Beginning of the Journey.''         To the last, she remained contentious, complaining of America's loss of intellectual culture. ''I think the life of significant contention no longer exists,'' she told New York magazine in 1995. ''We have enormous division in our society on sectarian or ideological lines. But we don't have any discourse.'' She said that the best academic minds had drifted into esoteric specialization and she assailed multiculturalism as ''our present-day version of Stalinism -- a culture of moral virtue without thought.''         Earlier this year The New Yorker published her brief memoir of her days at summer camp, and she finished her last book, ''A Visit to Camelot,'' an account of an evening spent at the White House when John F. Kennedy was President.         Three or four times a week in her later years, friends would come to the cluttered apartment to read to her. Among them was the poet Richard Howard, who said that despite her infirmities, she remained ''remarkably autonomous.''         Often the conversation turned to Lionel Trilling. ''Seventeen years have now passed since Lionel's death,'' she wrote at the conclusion of her memoir, ''and hour by hour, minute by minute I still listen for a clock which no longer ticks.''         Correction:  October 31, 1996, Thursday         An obituary of the critic and writer Diana Trilling on Friday omitted part of the title of a collection of her essays. It is ''We Must March My Darlings.''       
         Genia Robinor, a pianist and teacher, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 95 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Robinor was a well-known piano teacher whose pupils included Andre Watts. She taught at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, the Settlement Music School in Philadelphia and the Third Street Music School in New York City.         She was born in Odessa, Russia, and was a graduate of that city's Imperial Conservatory. After immigrating to the United States, she attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she earned her degree. She appeared with a number of orchestras, including the Phildelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Marion Durham Cuyjet, a pioneering teacher of black dancers, died on Oct. 22 at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. Mrs. Cuyjet was 76 and lived in Philadelphia.         She had been suffering from cardiopulmonary disorders, according to her son, Stephen Cuyjet Jr.         Mrs. Cuyjet's most famous pupil was Judith Jamison, artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Ms. Jamison began training in ballet at the age of 6 with ''Miss Marion,'' as everyone called Mrs. Cuyjet (pronounced soo-zhay).         In addition to teaching classical ballet and other dance techniques,  Mrs. Cuyjet taught her students that ''dancers were not hybrid creatures dropped down from the clouds with no relation to earth,'' as Ms. Jamison noted in her autobiography, ''Dancing Spirit.''         Mrs. Cuyjet also provided subliminal lessons in determination and race relations. ''She looked Caucasian and rented studio space that landlords would not rent to a person they thought was black,'' Ms. Jamison wrote. ''She broke the color barrier and was constantly evicted once black children were discovered on the premises; she had to move her school seven times.''         Born in Cheswold, Del., Mrs. Cuyjet studied ballet in Philadelphia with Essie Marie Dorsey, herself a student of Michel Fokine and Mikhail Mordkin, and opened the Judimar School in 1948. Mrs. Cuyjet created dances for public events in the city, and in the late 1950's was the principal choreographer for the annual Christmas Cotillion sponsored by Heritage House, a leading black cultural organization in Philadelphia.         From 1958 into the 1970's, Mrs. Cuyjet was on the dance faculty at Maryland State College (now the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore) and also taught at Delaware State College in Dover, and Cheney State University in Cheney, Pa. She closed her studio in 1971 and trained as a movement therapist, working at the Philadelphia State Hospital for 11 years. She was also a dance panelist on the Pennsylvania State Arts Council.         Mrs. Cuyjet's husband, Stephen, died in 1980. In addition to her son, Stephen Jr., of San Diego, she is survived by a daughter, Judith Coldvin, of Marlton, N.J.; a son, Mark, of Philadelphia; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Barbara C. Salken, a professor at the Pace University School of Law in White Plains, died on Oct. 17 at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla. She was 49 and lived in Chappaqua, N.Y.         She suffered a long illness, according to the law school, where she had taught criminal law and procedure for 13 years. For three of the last seven years, she was voted the outstanding professor of the year by the graduating class, most recently at the 1996 commencement.         Professor Salken, who was a native of Richmond and a graduate of Skidmore College and Brooklyn Law School, first practiced with the Legal Aid Society in New York City. She was associated with its criminal defense division and then with the special litigation unit, where she supervised law-reform work and class-action litigation, taking part in cases that dealt with the treatment of youthful criminal offenders.         As an active member of the Association of the Bar of New York City, she served on its council on criminal justice and as chairwoman of the committee on criminal justice.         Professor Salken is survived by her husband, Matthew Rosen; a son, Billy; a sister, Judy Salken of Mahopac, N.Y., and her parents, Doris and Irvin Salken of Williamsburg, Va.       
         Ruth Waxman, who played a prominent role in Conservative Judaism, died on Oct. 18 at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 80.         She had suffered injuries in a fall at her home in Great Neck, L.I., earlier that week, her family said.         Mrs. Waxman was the wife of Rabbi Mordecai Waxman of Temple Israel in Great Neck. An early advocate of women's rights in Conservative Judaism, she lectured widely on the role of women in the synagogue.         From 1972 until two years ago, she was an editor of Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought, published by the American Jewish Congress.         She was born in Palestine and brought as a child to the United States, where her family settled in Chicago. She graduated from the University of Chicago, from which she also received a doctorate in comparative literature. She taught literature there and at Adelphi University, at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University and, most recently, at the State University at Stony Brook, L.I., and at Queens College.         Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, Rabbi Jonothan Waxman of Eberon, N.J., and David and Hillel Waxman of Great Neck; a brother, Rabbi Albert Bilgray of Tucson, Ariz., and five grandchildren.       
         Miriam Kressyn, a star of the Yiddish stage and, along with her husband, Seymour Rechtzeit, a primary force in the survival of Yiddish theater in the United States, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         As actress, singer, adapter of plays, radio personality and teacher, Ms. Kressyn was one of the most popular artists in the Yiddish-speaking theater, brightening musicals as well as plays over a period of 60 years. Although she had diverse talents, she was best known for portraying stately, ladylike characters.         She was born in Bialystok, in what is now Poland, and came to the United States in 1925. While living in Boston, she began singing on radio, then switched to the stage, singing in the chorus of a Yiddish theater. Soon she was acting, playing male and female roles. She studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and Northeastern University.         Subsequently she acted in Chicago and Philadelphia (where she met her husband), and toured Europe, South America and Africa before settling in New York. She quickly became a favorite of local audiences drawn to theaters on lower Second Avenue by stories of sentiment, nostalgia and sometimes tragedy.         For five years, she and her husband acted in musical comedies with Menasha Skulnick. She was also in I. J. Singer's ''Brothers Askenazi'' and ''Yoshe Kalb'' and in Isaac Bashevis Singer's ''Family Muskat,'' and played the title role in an adaptation of Philip Yordan's ''Anna Lucasta.''         She and her husband became known as the romantic idols of Yiddish musicals. Often she was featured in a cast with other Yiddish theater favorites, including Reizl Bozyk, Ben Bonus, Leo Fuchs, Mina Bern and Jacob Jacobs.         In reviewing the musical ''A Cowboy in Israel'' in The New York Times, Richard F. Shepard said that the actress, ''rising to the occasion as usual, plays the tsoriss-ridden heroine -- no laughs, all trouble -- who stands to inherit a fortune if only she marries.''         Eventually Ms. Kressyn began adapting plays, including ''The Flowering Peach'' by Clifford Odets, Leon Kobrin's ''Riverside Drive'' and Nahum Stutchkoff's ''Land of Dreams.'' She taught Yiddish theater at Queens College, and for 40 years she and her husband broadcast in Yiddish on WEVD radio. In 1937 she appeared in Joseph Green's Yiddish film ''Der Purimshpieler.''         Several times in her career there were suggestions that she might perform in English on Broadway (in ''The Diary of Anne Frank'') and in English-language films, but she remained in the Yiddish theater for her entire life. To the repeated charge that Yiddish theater was defunct, she would say, with characteristic enthusiasm, ''We are not dead, we are very much alive.'' Summing up her career, she said, with pride, ''Yiddish is my world.''         She is survived by her husband, who is president of the Hebrew Actors Union.       
         Dorothy Bird, an early Martha Graham dancer who also appeared on Broadway and became a noted Graham teacher, died on Tuesday at the home of her son, Casey Villard, in Etna, N.H. She was 84.         Born on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Miss Bird was a shy,  impressionable teen-ager with a vivid imagination when she made her way to the Cornish School in Seattle in 1930 to study with Graham, who was then just making her name as a modern-dance choreographer. Charmed by Graham and her unorthodox, impassioned approach to teaching dance, Miss Bird followed her to New York to study with her at the Neighborhood Playhouse and joined the Graham company in 1931.         She made her debut in ''Primitive Mysteries'' and performed small roles in such dances as ''Panorama'' and ''Chronicles'' in her six years with the group. She also demonstrated classroom exercises for Graham, but eventually realized that she was not going to become a leading Graham performer.         She had also began to feel ''enslaved,'' as she later put it, by the demanding Graham. She broke with her in 1937, moving on that year to Broadway, where she performed for 10 years in musicals including ''Lady in the Dark.''         Miss Bird also performed at resorts in the Catskills and with modern-dance groups that included the Limon Trio, dancing with Jose Limon and Beatrice Seckler through 1947. She taught modern dance for 25  years at such places as the Neighborhood Playhouse, the School of American Ballet and the 92d Street Y  and was a master teacher at New York University and other colleges in and around New York.         A witty anecdotalist and shrewd observer of modern-dance history, Miss Bird had been at work on her autobiography with a friend, Joyce  Greenberg. The book, ''A Bird's Eye View,'' will be published next year by the University of Pittsburgh Press.         Miss Bird's husband, Paul Villard, died in 1994.         In addition to her son, she is survived by three grandchildren.       
         Nell Blaine, a widely respected New York landscape painter and watercolorist, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 74 and had homes in Manhattan and Gloucester, Mass.         Ms. Blaine, who had been hospitalized since July, had been confined to a wheelchair since 1959, when she contracted polio. She died of respiratory failure brought on by post-polio syndrome, said Eric Brown, a friend and co-director of the Tibor de Nagy Gallery.         Ms. Blaine was born in Richmond, Va., in 1922, and first studied at the Richmond School of Art, now part of Virginia Commonwealth University. She moved to New York in 1942 to study painting with Hans Hofmann and later studied etching and engraving at Atelier 17 with Stanley William Hayter.         During her first years in New York, her work, which had previously been tightly realist, turned abstract, inspired by Mondrian, Leger and Jean Helion. At one time she was the youngest member of the American Abstract Artists. She was also a founding member of the Jane Street Gallery, one of Manhattan's earliest artists' cooperatives, and had her first solo show there in 1945.         Just as Ms. Blaine was becoming known as a promising abstract painter, and gaining the admiration of such critics as Clement Greenberg, she started to shift back to representation. Inspired in part by a trip with Larry Rivers in 1950 to Paris, where she was especially impressed by the work of Vuillard and Bonnard, she immersed herself in the tradition of 19th-century European painting.         From the mid-1950's, she cultivated an increasingly painterly and colorful style, usually working directly from nature, or still life, with particular emphasis on the forms and hues of flowers. Her work retained a sense of all-over structure and pulsating energy that she nonetheless credited to abstract art. ''It all goes back to Mondrian,'' she would say.         In the 1950's, Ms. Blaine was prominent among a circle of New York artists and poets that included John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, Kenneth Koch, Mr. Rivers, Jane Freilicher, Leland Bell, Louisa Matthiasdottir, Robert De Niro Sr. and Rudy Burckhardt. She had her first solo show of representational work at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in 1953 and was represented by the Poindexter Gallery until it closed in 1978, and, in recent years, by the Fischbach Gallery. During the 1950's she supported herself as a commercial artist, designing brochures for art galleries. In 1955, she designed the original logo, column heads and layout for The Village Voice.         In 1957, Ms. Blaine was featured in Life magazine as one of five leading young female artists in America. In 1959, after several months of traveling and painting in Greece, she contracted severe bulbar polio on the island of Mykonos. ''To Nell Blaine,'' an exhibition organized at Poindexter to raise money for her hospital bills, included the work of 79 artists, including Saul Steinberg, Robert Motherwell, Elaine and Willem de Kooning, Philip Guston, Mr. Rivers, Ms. Freilicher and Robert Rauschenberg.         After eight months in a New York hospital, including five months in an iron lung, she was told she would never paint again. By 1960, after intensive physical therapy, she had taught herself to paint with oils with her left hand, which was stronger, and was able to draw and make watercolors with her right. Her primary subjects became the sweeping views of the Hudson River and its flanking highways as seen from the window of her apartment on Riverside Drive, and the more intimate setting of her garden in Gloucester, where she bought a home in 1975. But she continued to travel and from 1964 and 1984 lived and worked abroad for months at a time.         Ms. Blaine's work is represented in many public and private collections and has been the subject of dozens of gallery exhibitions and museum shows, including a retrospective on view at the Muscarelle Museum of Art at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va.         In 1943, Ms. Blaine married Robert Bass, a musician; they were divorced in 1949. She is survived by her companion, Carolyn Harris, a painter.       
         Eleanor Lansing Dulles, an economic specialist for the State Department who played a major part in planning the reconstruction of West Berlin in the 1950's, died on Wednesday in the Knollwood military retirement home in Washington. She was 101.         Her death was reported by The Associated Press on Friday.         Mrs. Dulles, who was sometimes called ''the Mother of Berlin'' for her enthusiastic efforts to revitalize the economy and culture of that battered capital as it recovered from World War II, managed to carve for herself a formidable reputation even though her two brothers, John Foster Dulles and Allen Welsh Dulles, held much higher rank in the American Government.         She was offered the State Department's Berlin desk in 1952, just before Foster Dulles was named Secretary of State.         She quickly saw trouble coming, she said in a memoir published in 1980, because Foster had been criticized for using his influence to get Allen the top job in the C.I.A. and wanted to avoid further accusations of nepotism. She was already a career diplomat, and her West Berlin position came through before Mr. Dulles's appointment, yet once he was in office, he tried to force her out. He did not succeed, she noted with some satisfaction.         Mrs. Dulles said it was difficult for a woman to serve in the State Department in that era.         ''This place is a real man's world if ever there was one,'' she said in 1958. ''It's riddled with prejudices. If you are a woman in Government service you just have to work 10 times as hard -- and even then it takes much skill to paddle around the various taboos. But it is fun to see how far you can get in spite of being a woman.''         Mrs. Dulles was born in Watertown, N.Y., one of five children of a Presbyterian minister and his wife. One ancestor, John Welsh, served as envoy to Britain in Rutherford B. Hayes's Administration, and her grandfather John W. Foster and an uncle, Robert Lansing, each served as Secretary of State, under Presidents Benjamin Harrison and Woodrow Wilson, respectively.         She graduated from Bryn Mawr College with a major in social sciences, worked in refugee rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in France after World War I and returned to Bryn Mawr to earn a master's degree in labor and industrial economics.         She took odd jobs in the early 1920's -- running a punch press at the American Tube & Stamping Company in Bridgeport, Conn., and working as payroll clerk for a hair net company in Long Island City, Queens.         She also traveled extensively in Europe, studied at the London School of Economics, investigated industrial methods in 75 British firms and received a master's degree from Radcliffe College and a doctorate in economics from Harvard.         In the 1930's she studied and taught economics and finance in Paris, Geneva, Basel, Boston, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Bryn Mawr. She produced scholarly books including ''The French Franc, 1914-1928,'' ''The Facts and Their Interpretation'' and ''The Bank for International Settlements at Work.'' She wrote more than a dozen books in all.         When she was 30 she met David Simon Blondheim, a philologist who, as an Orthodox Jew, was not regarded by her family as marriage material, she indicated in her memoir. She married him anyway, in 1932. In 1934, not long before the birth of their son, Dr. Blondheim committed suicide.         Mrs. Dulles, who used her maiden surname, entered Government service in 1936 as director of financial research for the Social Security Board. In 1942 she moved on to the State Department. At the Bretton Woods international monetary conference in New Hampshire in 1944, she was a prominent member of the American delegation.         The next year, she went to Vienna as the State Department's financial attache. She demonstrated keen bargaining powers -- helping to feed starving Austrians by arranging the barter of horses for German cabbages and potatoes.         Later, as special assistant to the director of the State Department's office of German affairs, Mrs. Dulles was credited with ''working miracles,'' as one biographer put it. She helped to reduce West German unemployment and increase production.         To hasten those developments, she said, she would ''send requests from Berlin for money and rush back to Washington in time to compose favorable answers.'' She wangled more than $1 billion for West Berlin, adorning it with the now-famous Congress Hall, which Berliners for many years fondly referred to as the ''Dulleseum'' and ''Frau Dulles's Hut,'' as well as a hospital and educational centers.         Beginning in 1959, Mrs. Dulles was assigned to studying foreign aid programs and visited 60 countries on behalf of the State Department's office of intelligence and research.         She left the State Department in 1962, after her brother Allen had been dismissed from the C.I.A. in the wake of the Bay of Pigs catastrophe. Leonard Mosley wrote in his 1978 book ''Dulles'' that early in 1962, during the Kennedy Administration, Secretary of State Dean Rusk summoned her and said, ''The White House has asked me to get rid of you.''         Mrs. Dulles, in her memoirs, ''Eleanor Lansing Dulles: Chances of a Lifetime,'' published in 1980, wrote affectionately of her older brothers but did not hesitate to say that since childhood there were frictions among the siblings. She also admitted that her strong personality won her her share of enemies.         She suffered from poor eyesight since childhood and developed deafness but remained active well into her old age.         Her survivors include her son, David, of Washington, and her daughter, Ann Dulles Joor, of Manlius, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Miriam Levin Goldberg, who studied underachievement by gifted youths and taught at Teachers College of Columbia University, died on  Nov. 21 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 80 and lived in the Bronx.         The cause was emphysema, family members said.         As a faculty member at Teachers College for 26 years, Dr. Goldberg ''was very rigorous and galvanized our sense of social consciousness,'' said Dr. Susan Sacks, a former student of Dr. Goldberg's who is on the faculty at Barnard College.         Dr. Goldberg, a professor of psychology and education, was co-author, with A. Harry Passow and Abraham J. Tannenbaum, of ''Planning for Talented Youth'' (1955, Teachers College). She also wrote ''Research on the Talented'' (1965) and ''The Effect of Ability Grouping'' (1966), both published by the college.         Miriam Levin was born in 1916 in Baku in what is now Azerbaijan, and immigrated at age 5. She received her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from Teachers College.         Her husband, Carl Goldberg, died in 1972. She is survived by her son, Dr. Daniel Goldberg of Athens, Pa.; two sisters, Hannah Levin of the Bronx and Shulamis Friedman of Brooklyn; and two granddaughters.       
         Mary Cooper Jewett Gaiser, a philanthropist who served on the boards of nonprofit institutions in the fields of education, community service and the arts, died on Sunday at Deaconess Medical Center in Spokane, Wash. She was 95 and lived in Spokane.         Over the years, Mrs. Gaiser (pronounced like ''geyser'') served on the boards of numerous institutions that were beneficiaries of her largess. She was a trustee of Wellesley College, of which she was an alumna, for 18 years. She was active in fund-raising for Wellesley, and its Jewett Art Center is named for her first husband, George Frederick Jewett, who died in 1956. He was chairman and president of Potlatch Forests, a forest-products concern based in Lewiston, Idaho. .         Her philanthropy extended to other educational institutions, including the American University of Beirut, Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., and Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Calif., all of which she served as a trustee. Mrs. Gaiser had been on the national board of the Young Women's Christian Association since the late 1940's. ''Women are wonderful,'' she once declared. ''Like tea bags, they never know their strength until they get into hot water.''         She was president of the Spokane Y.W.C.A. during World War II, and oversaw programs to help women and children with problems related to the war. In addition, she was on the boards of the Spokane Arts Commission, which she helped set up, and of what is now the Spokane Symphony orchestra, in whose founding she was instrumental. In 1987, after donating $225,000 to the orchestra's endowment, she said: ''Half the fun of life is sharing. People are missing a lot of satisfaction if they don't get pleasure from using their abilities to help others.''         She and Mr. Jewett also played an important role in the construction of the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Spokane.         A doctor's daughter, Mrs. Gaiser was born in Ogdensburg, N.Y., received a bachelor's degree from Wellesley in 1923, and taught school in Bronxville, N.Y. until she married Mr. Jewett in 1925. They lived in communities in Idaho until they moved to Spokane in 1937. She married Dr. David Wesley Gaiser, a surgeon, in 1961, and he died in 1985.         Mrs. Gaiser is survived by a son, George Frederick Jewett Jr. of San Francisco; a daughter, Margaret Jewett Greer of Chevy Chase, Md.; six grandchildren; nine great-grandchildren; a sister, Janet Cooper Dakin of Irvington, Va., and a brother, Dr. William Grant Cooper Jr., of Little Rock, Ark.       
         Carol Robbins, a trained musician, educator and co-director of the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy at New York University, died on Dec. 12 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 54.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Clive Robbins.         She started her musical education at 8 and, by the time she finished high school, was an accomplished vocalist, church organist and accompanist. She earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in music education at the Crane School of Music at State University College in Potsdam, N.Y., and was certified as a teacher for youngsters with perceptual handicaps. She started training in music therapy in 1966 with Paul Nordoff and Dr. Robbins, founders of a creative music therapy practiced at schools in this country and Europe. Her own career began at the Little Red School House in Poughkeepsie.         After she and Dr. Robbins were married in 1975, the couple worked as a team. They developed a music curriculum for the New York State School for the Deaf in Rome, N.Y., working with severely hearing-impaired youngsters.         With Prof. Arthur Boothroyd they researched musical perception by such children as a basis for establishing techniques aimed at getting even the most profoundly deaf among them to play music.         Mrs. Robbins's vocal and keyboard skills at improvisation added versatility to their work and freedom to explore. Together, the Robbinses wrote ''Music for the Hearing Impaired and Other Special Groups: A Resource Manual and Curriculum Guide'' (MMB Music, 1980), a standard text in this specialized field.         She taught Nordoff-Robbins music therapy at institutes and schools in London, Germany and Japan and traveled worldwide to lecture and teach. She and Dr. Robbins returned to this country in 1989 to establish and direct the center at N.Y.U. within the Graduate Music Therapy Program, where it provides treatment, training and research.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Robbins is survived by a daughter, Debra Matteson of Ilion, N.Y.; her mother, Adalyn Matteson, and her siblings, Christine Phinney and David Matteson, all of Oswego.       
         Anne Schwerner, a retired New York teacher and the mother of Michael H. Schwerner, a 24-year-old civil-rights worker killed by Ku Klux Klansmen near Philadelphia, Miss., in 1964, died on Friday at a nursing home in Kettering, Ohio. A former resident of Pelham, N.Y., she was 84.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Born Anne Seigel in the Bronx, she graduated from Hunter College in biology, earned a master's degree in education at Queens College and started a teaching career in the city's public schools. She then taught at New Rochelle High School for 20 years until her retirement in 1976.         After their son's death, she and her husband, Nathan, helped raise money for groups like the Congress on Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and lobbied for Federal voting-rights legislation.         Mrs. Schwerner is survived by another son, Stephen of Yellow Springs, Ohio; her brother, Morris Seigel, a resident of Florida, and two granddaughters. Nathan Schwerner, a retired wig manufacturer, died in 1991.       
         Barbara Jordan, the black Congresswoman and scholar who stirred the nation with her Churchillian denunciations of the Watergate abuses of President Richard M. Nixon, died today in her home state of Texas at the age of 59.         Afflicted with multiple sclerosis, Ms. Jordan died from viral pneumonia as a  complication of leukemia, according to officials of the University of Texas in Austin, where she taught.         Ms. Jordan, the first black elected to Congress from Texas after Reconstruction, retired from the House in 1979 after three terms to teach political ethics at the university's Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, never losing her potent talent for public speaking even from the confines of a wheelchair.         Most recently, her rich, impassioned voice was heard once more in Congress when, as chairwoman of the Commission on Immigration Reform, she spoke out last  year against a proposal to deny automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants born in this country. "To deny birthright citizenship would derail this engine of American liberty," she warned with the same eloquence that mesmerized her American audience on July 25, 1974, when Representative Jordan argued for the impeachment of President Nixon.         Ms. Jordan, whom her students recalled as never being without a copy of the Constitution in her purse, rooted that Watergate speech in her faith in the Constitution's promise and in her personal history as a child of the Jim Crow South.         "I felt somehow for many years that George Washington and Alexander Hamilton  just left me out by mistake," she declared, catching the nation's attention with measured, sepulchral oratory from her seat on the House Judiciary Committee. "But through the process of amendment, interpretation and court decision I have  finally been included in 'We, the people.' "         Then, with a smoldering glance across the proceedings of the historic Constitutional crisis, Ms. Jordan added, "My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total, and I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution."         Ms. Jordan was one of American politics' pioneer black women. In 1966, she was elected as the first black state Senator in Texas, and went on to be the first woman and first black elected to Congress from Texas. In 1976, she was the first black woman to deliver a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention, riveting her audience on national television as she spoke magisterially from the stage at New York's Madison Square Garden.         "All blacks are militant in their guts," she told an interviewer during her first Congressional campaign. "But militancy is expressed in different ways."         As a model of the Democratic politician from the New South, Ms. Jordan was less an angry or confrontational liberal than an imposing master of the process  and its details. A consummate politician from her earliest days in the Texas Legislature, Ms. Jordan won a seat on the House Judiciary Committee though only  a freshman by importuning her political mentor and friend, former President Lyndon B. Johnson, to pull some strings.         "She proved that black is beautiful before we knew what it meant," Mr. Johnson said of her. His widow, Lady Bird Johnson, led Texans in mourning their  native daughter. "I feel a stabbing sense of loss at the passing of a good friend," Mrs. Johnson said today.         Ms. Jordan's political prowess saw her ascend to the post of Speaker pro tem  in the Texas Senate six years after having arrived there as a political oddity and an outcast.         The youngest of three sisters, Barbara Charline Jordan was born on Feb. 21, 1936, into the poverty of Houston's Fourth Ward. She attended Houston's segregated public schools and graduated magna cum laude with debating honors from the all-black Texas Southern University. Her father, Benjamin, a Baptist minister, moonlighted as a warehouse clerk to help her pay for college, where her scholarship and assertiveness were honed.         As leader of the debating team, Ms. Jordan, known as B. J. to her friends, later proudly recalled maneuvering the Harvard team to a draw. "When an all-black team ties Harvard, it wins," she said.         Ms. Jordan received a law degree in 1959 from Boston University and was soon  at practice from her family's dining-room table. Eventually, she had a second-story office above a print shop near her family's simple frame house.         "I never wanted to be run of the mill," she told Molly Ivins, the Texas writer who was a friend since 1969 and likened interviewing Ms. Jordan to "a bit like grilling God" because of the care, scholarship and booming authority of her speech.         "We were poor," Ms. Jordan said of her strict but loving upbringing. "But so  was everyone around us, so we did not notice it."         When Miss Jordan was 11, she quit her piano lessons -- a defiant act that angered her father. He told her that the only good jobs for black women were in  teaching music or in performing, and asked her what she intended to do if she could not play the piano. "I don't know," she recalled telling him, "but I'll manage somehow."         As a Congressional newcomer, Ms. Jordan served notice that she had received 80 percent of the vote and would therefore have far broader interests than the Black Caucus agenda, and would hardly be a "female chauvinist."         "You know, Barbara wasn't really that concerned about the guilt or innocence  of Nixon," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Manhattan Democrat who served with Ms. Jordan on the impeachment hearings. "She was most concerned that the Constitution not be distorted for political reasons."         Some of Ms. Jordan's earliest politicking was as a young lawyer when she directed one of Houston's first voter drives in support of the Kennedy-Johnson ticket in 1960. She lost her first two bids for elective office in rough-and-tumble, racism-tinged bouts. But she succeeded when state legislative  districts were finally redrawn and she became the first black of either sex to be elected to the Texas Senate since 1883.         Even amid the political turmoil of 1974, when Congresswoman Jordan contended  that the Watergate conspirings had put the nation "on the edge of repression and tyranny," the outspoken Texan still led with her optimism. During that summer of the Watergate crisis, she took care to visit the graduates of Howard University  and urge them: "Reaffirm what ought to be. Get back to the truth; that's old, but get back to it. Get back to what's honest; tell government to do that. Affirm the civil liberties of the people of this country. Do that."         Ms. Jordan is survived by her mother, Arylenne; two sisters, Bennie Creswell  and Rose Mary McGowan, and a brother-in-law, John McGowan, all of Houston.       
         Karen Machover, a psychologist who developed a method of personality analysis based on an interpretation of drawings of the human figure, died on Monday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 93.         Like the Rorschach inkblots, the Machover test is intended to serve as a sort of screen on which people project their thoughts, anxieties and conflicts. First, the test taker is told simply to draw a person. Next, the subject draws a figure of the opposite sex. Then a personality description is prepared from an analysis of such features as the figures' size, stance and position on the page.         Mrs. Machover wrote a book on her research that is still in print, "Personality Projection in the Drawing of the Human Figure: A Method of Personality Investigation" (Charles C. Thomas, 1949).         Born in Minsk, Belarus, Mrs. Machover came to the United States in 1910 with  her mother and four sisters. She worked for many years at Bellevue Hospital and  then at Kings County Hospital, retiring in 1970. She also maintained a private practice as a psychotherapist into the mid-80's.         In addition, she taught at Brooklyn College, SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn and New York University, from which she had received her master's degree in psychology. It was at N.Y.U. in the 1930's that she met Solomon Machover, a student who became her husband. He died in 1976.         Mrs. Machover is survived by a son, Robert Machover of Milford, N.J., and a grandson.       
         Liz Williamson, a jazz dance authority, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Wonza Sinclair.         Ms. Williamson performed with Alvin Ailey's first company in 1958, dancing in the premiere of "Blues Suite," which started Ailey's choreographic career in  New York. She also danced with Donald McKayle and the Merry-Go-Rounders, and performed as a solo artist. She appeared on television, in films and in musicals, including City Center revivals of "Finian's Rainbow" and "Carmen Jones."         Ms. Williamson was born in Winston-Salem, N.C.She received a bachelor's degree in romance languages from Radcliffe College and a master's degree in dance from New York University. She wrote about the history of jazz dancing and  taught around the world, at schools and festivals that included the International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss., in 1986 and 1990. In 1973, she was the first artist-in-residence at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, where she choreographed "The Many Faces of Jazz," a piece with a cast of 65 dancers. She continued to teach up until her death.         Ms. Williamson's husband, William Elliott Williamson, died in 1991.         In addition to her daughter, of Brooklyn, she is survived by a grandson.       
         Judith Kaplan Eisenstein, an author, musicologist and composer, died yesterday of a heart attack in Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md., where she was being treated for a broken hip. She was 86 and lived in Silver Spring, Md.         The oldest daughter of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist branch of Judaism, Dr. Eisenstein was the first woman to have  a bat mitzvah, in 1922.         No thunder sounded," she said in 1992, recalling the ceremony. "No lightning struck."         But opening to women the bar mitzvah rite that had long marked the passage of Jewish males into religious adulthood proved to be the first of many changes broadening the role of women in Judaism, including in recent years their ordination as rabbis.         Today the bat mitzvah ceremony, usually carried out when girls are 12, is an  established practice within the Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist branches of Judaism, and parallel celebrations are common in some quarters of Orthodox Judaism as well.         From 1929 to 1954, Dr. Eisenstein taught music education and the history of Jewish music at Jewish Theological Seminary's Teacher's Institute, now known as  the Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies in Manhattan.         While there she published a Jewish songbook for children, "Gateway to Jewish  Song," which was followed by other books of Jewish music and musical history for young people.  From 1942 to 1974, she wrote seven cantatas on Jewish themes, among them the frequently performed, "What Is Torah," which she wrote with her husband, Rabbi Ira Eisenstein.         In 1959, at the age of 50, Dr. Eisenstein, who had earned a master's degree in music education at Columbia University's Teachers College, began work for her Ph.D. at the School of Sacred Music of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of  Religion in New York. After receiving her degree, she taught there from 1966 to  1979, teaching as well at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia.         The smallest branch of Judaism, Reconstructionism views Judaism as what Dr. Eisenstein's father, Rabbi Kaplan, called the "evolving religious civilization of the Jewish people," emphasizing the cultural and moral heritage of the Jewish people but not traditional supernatural and theistic beliefs.         Dr. Eisenstein, who was born on Sept. 10, 1909, studied at the Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School. An early marriage ended in divorce and in 1934 she married Rabbi Eisenstein, the assistant rabbi at the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, the Manhattan synagogue that her father headed.         She collaborated with her husband on five of her cantatas. In February 1952,  on the eve of a Jewish Music Festival in New York, Dr. Eisenstein defended the idea of a distinctive Jewish music. While Jews had borrowed much musically from  the nations and peoples they had lived among, she wrote in The New York Times, the music of Jews "bears the unmistakable stamp of their own peculiar wistfulness, puritanism, or wry humor."         When she was 82, 12 years past the biblical life span of 70, Dr. Eisenstein had a second bat mitzvah, at which she was also honored by feminist and Jewish leaders, including Betty Friedan, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Ruth W. Messinger, Elizabeth Holtzman, Rabbi Rachel Cowan and Blu Greenberg.         At that time, Dr. Eistenstein expressed disappointment that bat mitzvah ceremonies, like bar mitzvahs, were often overshadowed by lavish parties. "Bat mitzvah began not just as a statement of feminism," she said, "but as a statement of dedication to something larger than oneself."         In addition to her husband, Dr. Eisenstein is survived by two daughters, Miriam Eisenstein of Gaithersburg, Md., and Ann Eisenstein of Manhattan; three sisters, Hadassah Musher and Selma Goldman, both of Manhattan, and Naomi Wenner  of Chevy Chase, Md., and one grandchild.       
         Maria A. Rudzinska, a protozoologist who used electron microscopy to uncover  the eating habits of the parasite that causes malaria, died last Friday at her home in Manhattan. Dr. Rudzinska, who was an emeritus professor of parasitology  at Rockefeller University, was 92.         She came to Rockefeller in 1951, at a time when the use of the electron microscope in biology was in its infancy. She trained with the cell biologists Keith Porter and George Palade and then joined the laboratory of William Trager, a leading parasitologist.         It was in Dr. Trager's lab that she used the microscope to show that the malaria protozoa, a one-celled organism that enters the human body through mosquito bites, consumes red blood cells by ingesting portions of them into parts of its cell called vacuoles.         "It is a common way for cells to feed," said Dr. Trager, now an emeritus professor of parasitology at Rockefeller. "But no one had guessed that this was  the way malaria parasites feed."         Dr. Trager said her work also confirmed that the parasite entered the blood cell before eating it. "There was some controversy as to whether the parasite was inside the cell or not," he said. "At the level of the light microscope, it  was not easy to be sure."         Her research helped scientists find ways to treat the disease, he said.         The malaria parasite was not Dr. Rudzinska's favorite protozoa, however, Dr.  Trager said. That distinction fell to an organism called tokophrya. Unlike most  single-cell organisms, which live a rather mundane life restricted largely to dividing, tokophrya, she discovered, has specific life cycles.         "As a baby, it's a swimming little thing," Dr. Trager said. "But then it settles down, forms a stalk, and metamorphoses into quite a different-looking creature." It also has a reproductive cycle, and a period of old age.         "The thing she found was, if you give it a lot to eat, this process of aging  was greatly accelerated," Dr. Trager said. Overfed, tokophrya grew old faster and died earlier. The organism has been used by researchers who study the aging  process.         Dr. Rudzinska, who was so identified with the protozoa that she once received a post card at the laboratory addressed only to "Dr. Tokophrya," occasionally had difficulty finding specimens, which proliferate in fresh water ponds. After  one steady source on Long Island dried up, she found some closer to home -- in a fountain on the Rockefeller campus.         Dr. Rudzinska became an emeritus professor in 1975, but was still active in the lab. In her later years, she worked with Harvard researchers to discover how the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is carried by deer ticks.         She was born in Dabrowa, Poland, and earned advanced degrees in biology and zoology from the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. During World War II, she taught at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lvov, and participated in underground  teaching during the Nazi occupation.         After the war she came to the United States with her husband, Alexander Rudzinski, an international lawyer who was a member of the Polish delegation to  the fledgling United Nations. When the Communists took over the Polish Government, however, Mr. Rudzinski resigned, and the couple were granted asylum  in the United States.         Her husband died about five years ago.
