         Barbara Gamarekian, a former reporter on the arts and Washington society for The New York Times who was previously a press aide in the Kennedy and Johnson White Houses, died yesterday in Washington. She was 78.         The cause was peritoneal cancer, said a niece, Rachel Hughes.         Ms. Gamarekian arrived in Washington in 1957 to work on the legislative staff of Senator Hubert H. Humphrey.         She joined the presidential campaign staff of John F. Kennedy and was one of nine assistants to President Kennedy's press secretary, Pierre E. Salinger. She was in charge of photo and television coverage.         ''Ours was not the posh West Wing of television fame,'' she wrote in an article in The Times in 2001 that reflected the kind of observation she brought to her many articles about architecture.         ''The room sported harsh overhead lighting, government-issue furniture and limp, gray-green tie-backs on the windows.''         In 2001, she wrote an article for The Times on her experience in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, telling of her surreal night in a bomb shelter under the East Wing that she had never known existed.         Last year, some of her other memories of the Kennedy White House were in the news when an interview she gave in 1964 for the John F. Kennedy Library came to light.         In it, she spoke of President Kennedy's romantic liaison with a college-age intern who could not type. Ms. Gamarekian told some details to the historian Robert Dallek when he was researching his book, ''An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963.'' The transcript, which Ms. Gamarekian had originally wanted sealed indefinitely, then became public.         ''Certainly it is something that I never discussed because if you are working for the administration, you feel a loyalty to it,'' she said of the affair in the library interview. ''It is the sort of thing you don't discuss, something you profess complete ignorance of when you attend the inevitable cocktail parties where this is the subject for discussion.''         Barbara Soellner was born Aug. 31, 1925, in Schenectady, N.Y.         In 1966, she was hired as an administrative assistant to the chief of the Washington bureau of The Times and eventually became a reporter specializing in cultural news in Washington.         Her subjects ranged beyond the Kennedy Center and National Endowment for the Arts to include a cookbook by Ralph Nader's mother and how men and women communicate. She became particularly known for her articles on what she called the movers and shakers of Washington. She retired from The Times in 1991.         Ms. Gamarekian, who was divorced, is survived by her brother, Glenn Soellner of Burnt Hill, N.Y., and her sister, Robin Hughes of Schenectady.         Her last article, which appeared in The Times in October, brought a light touch to her musings about losing her hair as a result of chemotherapy.         She said her penciled eyebrows gave her the look of an ''aging 1920's flapper.''       
         Lisa Gubernick, an author and reporter who wrote about the entertainment industry for The Wall Street Journal and as the Hollywood correspondent for Forbes magazine, died yesterday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 48 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was colon cancer, said Laurie Cohen, a family friend.         Ms. Gubernick began her career writing about finance. She became a senior writer at The American Lawyer in 1984 and started its spinoff newsletter Takeover Control Alert. She joined Forbes in July 1984, was its Hollywood correspondent from 1987 to 1990, and became a senior editor in 1990. She joined The Journal in 1998, covering entertainment for its Weekend Journal section.         She wrote ''Squandered Fortune: The Life and Times of Huntington Hartford'' (Putnam, 1991) and ''Get Hot or Go Home: Trisha Yearwood, The Making of a Nashville Star'' (Morrow, 1993).         Ms. Gubernick was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College.         She is survived by her mother, Grace, of Manhattan; her husband, Paul Fishleder, an editor at The New York Times; and her daughter, Lily.       
         Gloria Emerson, a journalist and author who wrote with angry dignity about the effects of war on Americans, Vietnamese and Palestinians, was found dead by friends and the police yesterday morning in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 75 and left no immediate survivors.         The medical examiner's office said that it had not ruled on the cause of death. Her physician, Karen Brudney, said Ms. Emerson had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, which she feared would leave her unable to write, and she left many notes at the apartment indicating that she had taken her own life.         Both as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times in Vietnam in the early 1970's and later as a writer of nonfiction books and a novel, Ms. Emerson wrote passionately about ordinary people and soldiers ground up by the machinery of war in places like Vietnam, Gaza and Algeria.         War as she wrote about it was not ennobling but debasing, a misery that inflicted physical suffering and psychic damage on civilians, children, and soldiers on both sides. Her literary model was Graham Greene, whose dark portrayal of the early days of the American war in Vietnam influenced her articles and her style. ''Loving Graham Greene'' was the title she gave her novel, published by Random House in 2000.         She was working in the London bureau of The Times in 1969 when, as she wrote in an obituary she left with a covering note that was dated Tuesday, ''Ms. Emerson requested that she be sent to Vietnam because she had been in that country in 1956 and wanted to go back to write about the Vietnamese people and the immense unhappy changes in their lives, not a subject widely covered by the huge press corps who were preoccupied with covering the military story.''         Her articles from Vietnam, many reported with the help of Nguyen Ngoc Luong, her interpreter, brought alive for many readers people who had been an abstraction, the Vietnamese whose ''hearts and minds'' the United States went to war to win, but lost to communist adversaries who prevailed despite millions of casualties.         One of her articles after the unsuccessful South Vietnamese attempt to cut off North Vietnamese supply lines in Laos in 1971 reported how Sergeant Co, an infantry platoon leader, clung to the skids of an American helicopter to get out alive. '''Each helicopter could have been the last one, so what choice was there for me?' he asked. 'Only the madmen would stay and politely wait for the next helicopter.'''         Her literary voice was always gravely serious. In person, she was well dressed, precise in speech and eccentrically funny.         She was constantly giving money to veterans, refugees and street beggars. She could be possessive and domineering, especially toward the photographers whose work she thought would outlast her articles published with them; the words she compared to ice cubes that melted in the sun.         As Ms. Emerson put it in her own obituary: ''Her dispatches from Vietnam won a George Polk Award for excellence in foreign reporting, and, later, a Matrix Award from New York Women in Communications. Her nonfiction book on the war, 'Winners & Losers' (Random House, 1977), won a National Book Award in 1978 but she described it as 'too huge and somewhat messy.' Its subject was the effects of the conflict on some Americans, or 'an absence of the effect,' as she once said.''         Typical of ''Winners & Losers'' were lines like these, about Joseph (Teddy) Humber Jr., who lost both his legs in a mine explosion in Vietnam in 1972 and came home to his family in Westboro, Mass. ''Teddy did not seem to always know what the others were saying,'' she wrote. ''He seemed busy with something else; perhaps it was pain. He sat at the table without moving, often without hearing.''         Another book in 1985, ''Some American Men,'' published by Simon & Schuster, ranged further into the souls of her countrymen and their afflictions in sports and love as well as in war. ''Gaza, a Year in the Intifada,'' about a year she spent with Palestinians in what she called ''an occupied land,'' was published by The Atlantic Monthly Press in 1991.         ''Made to feel inferior, treated with contempt and cruelty, the Gazans struggled to transcend their own feelings of helplessness,'' she wrote then.         ''The book provoked hostility among friends, and others felt it was anti-Israel, but Ms. Emerson insisted this was not the reason for writing it,'' she explained later, in the obituary she left behind. ''She hoped to provide a primer for those who felt the situation in the Middle East was too complicated or too controversial to understand.''         Born in New York City to William B. Emerson and Ruth Shaw Emerson in 1929, she began her career in The Times's women's news department in 1957, describing herself on her application as a widow, giving her married name as Znamiecki.         ''I applied for a job at The New York Times many years ago, and felt correctly that my life depended on it,'' she explained in a note written just before her death. ''I didn't go to college, I ran away from an alcoholic wretched home and went to work on a hotel giveaway magazine.'' She continued, ''Getting a job on the women's page was a gift from heaven although I hated writing about shoes and clothes, all under the eye of the advertising department who measured editorial mention of retailers. You cannot imagine what it was like in those days.''         She left the paper in 1960 to live in Brussels with Charles A. Brofferio, whom she described as ''an ill-suited husband'' she divorced a year later.         The Times hired her back as a reporter in Paris in 1964 ''on the understanding that I would cover the haute couture collections twice a year,'' she explained. Moving to the paper's London bureau in late 1968, she made her way to Belfast to write some articles about the conflict in Northern Ireland, and in 1970, as she put it, ''I was allowed to go to Vietnam because the war was supposed to be over so it didn't matter if a female was sent. Et voilà!''       
         Ilona Marton, an award-winning journalist who was imprisoned for her coverage of events leading up to the Hungarian uprising of 1956, died Saturday at her home in Silver Spring, Md. She was 92.         The cause was heart failure, her daughter, Kati Marton, said.         With her husband, Dr. Marton received a George Polk Award in 1957. The award is presented annually for reporting, often at great personal risk, in the public interest.         Writing for United Press, the precursor of United Press International, Dr. Marton covered the Communist takeover of Hungary, often in competition with her husband, Endre Marton, a reporter for The Associated Press.         ''She became a journalist, although that was an almost recklessly brave thing to do in the chilliest days of the cold war, because she wanted to be with my father,'' Kati Marton said in a telephone interview.         In 1955, the Martons were arrested on manufactured charges of spying for the United States. They were tried and convicted by a secret Hungarian military court but freed the following year, in time to cover the anti-Communist uprising and its suppression by Soviet forces.         After the uprising, Dr. Marton helped organize a general strike, an activity that placed her in renewed danger of arrest. Alerted that the secret police were closing in, the Martons and their children were smuggled out of Hungary, first to Vienna and later to the United States. There Dr. Marton worked as a French teacher in Maryland high schools.         Ilona Marton was born March 14, 1912, in the Hungarian town of Miskolc. Her parents were Jewish -- the family's original name was Neumann -- and at 19 she adopted the surname Nyilas to pass as Catholic. In 1944, her parents were deported to Auschwitz, where both died.         Dr. Marton earned a master's degree in history and a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Debrecen. After an early marriage that ended in divorce, she married Mr. Marton in 1943. He survives her, along with a sister, Magda, of Budapest; three children, Kati, of Manhattan, a journalist; Andrew, of Fort Worth; and Julia Marton-Lefevre of London; and four grandchildren.       
         Iris Chang, a journalist whose best-selling book, ''The Rape of Nanking,'' a chronicle of the atrocities committed in that city by occupying Japanese forces, helped break a six-decade-long international silence on the subject, committed suicide on Tuesday near Los Gatos, Calif. She was 36 and lived in San Jose.         Ms. Chang's literary agent, Susan Rabiner, announced the death.         Ms. Chang was found in her car on a rural road south of Los Gatos, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, the local authorities told The San Francisco Chronicle. She had left a suicide note at home that she had painstakingly written, edited and rewritten, her husband, Brett Douglas said in a telephone interview yesterday.         ''The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II'' was published by Basic Books in 1997, the 60th anniversary of the massacre. The book documented the events in Nanking (now Nanjing) during the second Sino-Japanese War, in the years leading up to World War II.         In December 1937 Japanese troops entered the city, which until shortly before the invasion had been the Chinese capital. In less than two months they murdered more than 300,000 civilians and raped more than 80,000 women. Ms. Chang's book was the first full-length nonfiction account of the event.         Reviewing ''The Rape of Nanking'' in The New York Times Book Review, Orville Schell called it an ''important new book,'' adding that Ms. Chang ''recounts the grisly massacre with understandable outrage.''         She had a keen personal interest in the subject. Ms. Chang's grandparents had fled Nanking just before the occupation, eventually settling in the United States. Growing up in the Midwest, she heard family stories of the massacre, but as an adult she was unable to find much about it in print. In China and Japan, and even in the West, the subject had been almost completely lost to history.         ''The whole issue had scar tissue growing over it, but it had never really healed,'' Mr. Schell, the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime observer of China, said in a telephone interview. ''She sort of threw the curtain back on a period that the Chinese Communist Party and the Japanese hoped was shrouded in official declarations of a new collaboration. But it turned out there was a lot of unfinished business.''         Fluent in Mandarin, Ms. Chang traveled to China, where she scoured archives and interviewed elderly survivors. What she learned would force her to describe the indescribable:         ''Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women, slice off their breasts, nail them alive to walls,'' Ms. Chang wrote. ''Fathers were forced to rape their daughters, and sons their mothers, as other family members watched. Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs and the roasting of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were practiced, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying people to their waists and watching them torn apart by German shepherds. So sickening was the spectacle that even Nazis in the city were horrified.''         ''The Rape of Nanking'' spent 10 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, and close to half a million copies have been sold, Ms. Rabiner said.         The book drew wide international attention. In Japan it prompted outrage among conservatives. (A planned Japanese edition was cancelled in 1999.) Elsewhere it engendered demands for the Japanese government to make reparations or, at least, a formal apology, something Ms. Chang to the end of her life felt had been inadequately done.         ''There have been all sorts of little fragments and shards and bits and pieces,'' Mr. Schell said. ''But no one has done what Willy Brandt did: got down on his knees in the Warsaw ghetto and asked forgiveness.''         Iris Shun-Ru Chang was born on March 28, 1968, in Princeton, N.J. She grew up in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., where her father, a physicist, and her mother, a microbiologist, taught at the University of Illinois. Ms. Chang received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Illinois in 1989. After working briefly as a reporter for The Associated Press and The Chicago Tribune, she earned a master's degree from the writing program of Johns Hopkins University in 1991.         She published her first book, ''Thread of the Silkworm'' (Basic Books, 1995), when she was just 27. It told the story of Tsien Hsue-shen, a Chinese-born scientist deported from the United States during the McCarthy era, who returned to China and founded that country's intercontinental missile program. Ms. Chang also wrote ''The Chinese in America: A Narrative History,'' published last year by Viking.         At the time of her death, she was researching a book on American soldiers who served in tank units on the Bataan peninsula before World War II, many of whom were captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. In the course of her research several months ago, Ms. Chang became severely depressed and had to be hospitalized, Ms. Rabiner said.         Besides her husband, Ms. Chang is survived by her parents, Shau-Jin and Ying-Ying, and a brother, Michael, all of San Jose; and by a son, Christopher.         In a 1998 interview with The Straits Times of Singapore, Ms. Chang described her reasons for writing ''The Rape of Nanking'':         ''I wrote it out of a sense of rage,'' she said. ''I didn't really care if I made a cent from it. It was important to me that the world knew what happened in Nanking back in 1937.''       
         Mona Van Duyn, a poet laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner who spoke with a distinctly female voice from suburbia, died on Thursday at her home in suburban St. Louis. She was 83.         Her death was announced by Alfred A. Knopf, which published her ''Selected Poems'' two years ago. Her first book in nine years, it includes nearly half of the poems published in her previous eight volumes, starting with ''Valentines to the Wide World'' in 1959.         Knopf said Ms. Van Duyn (pronounced dine) had recently been found to have bone cancer.         To readers unfamiliar with her work, ''Selected Poems'' presented a generous and judicious sampling of a long and successful career, Brian Henry wrote in The New York Times Book Review.         ''Characterized by candor and compassion,'' he said, ''Van Duyn's poetry depicts the pleasures and drudgeries of middle-class American life, an approach that at its best becomes an exploration of the spiritual and psychological dimensions of that life.         ''A pioneer of the poetry of the suburbs -- now a common mode in which the ordinary is routinely revealed as extraordinary -- Van Duyn also knows that the ordinary is frequently just that.''         Mr. Henry, editor of the magazine Verse and director of the creative writing program at the University of Georgia, mentioned the rare incendiary moments in her work but added that, ''Her poetry is primarily, and literally, civil, seeking to uphold the accepted foundations of civilization -- marriage and friendship, love and sympathy -- while occasionally plumbing those foundations for cracks.''         Mr. Henry wrote that he considered Ms. Van Duyn's first three books to be her best, especially ''To See, To Take,'' her second, which won the National Book Award for Poetry in 1971. In it she interwove religious and mythological themes, like divine and human love and the violence of love, with less exalted topics.         In one poem, for example, she compared her work to home canning, writing:         Oh, I know, I know that, great or humble, the arts         in their helplessness can save but a few selves         by such disguises from Time's hideous bite,         and yet, a sweating Proust of the pantry shelves,         I cupboard these pickled peaches in Time's despite.         Ms. Van Duyn was selected by the Library of Congress in 1992 to serve a term as the United States poet laureate. She was the sixth laureate and the first woman to be chosen.         When notified by James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress at the time, Ms. Van Duyn said it was clear to her that the selectors who made the choice were ''getting very nervous'' about the absence of a woman as laureate.         Before the position was formally established by Congress in 1985, it had a forerunner in the library's poetry consultant. There were about two dozen of them, but only a handful were women.         A year before becoming poet laureate, Ms. Van Duyn won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. The award cited her for ''Near Changes'' (Knopf, 1990). She also received, among many others, the Bollingen Prize in 1970; the Carl Sandburg Prize of Cornell College in 1982; the Hart Crane Memorial Award in 1968; the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 1989; the Shelley Memorial Prize of the Poetry Society of America in 1987; and a Guggenheim fellowship in 1972. She was also a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and the National Academy of Arts and Sciences.         Mona Jane Van Duyn was born on May 9, 1921, in Waterloo, Iowa, and graduated from the University of Northern Iowa in 1942, when it was the Iowa State Teachers College. She received a master's degree from the University of Iowa the next near and taught English there until 1946. In 1943 she married Jarvis A. Thurston, whom she met in a writing class and who became a professor of English; he survives her.         She also had an academic career, teaching at the University of Louisville, in Kentucky, and at Washington University in St. Louis, as well as at writing seminars and conferences.         Between ''Valentines'' and ''Selected Poems,'' she also published, among others, ''A Time of Bees'' (1964); ''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems'' (1982); ''If It Be Not I: Collected Poems 1959-1982'' (1992), which included much of her earlier work; and ''Firefall'' (1992), which remains in print at Knopf.         ''I don't know why that is,'' she said 14 years ago as the newly chosen laureate, musing about why women were not anthologized or consulted as frequently as men. ''Perhaps it is because younger women are able to teach, or take the time to raise children. Even for older women, one's life is complicated. It is difficult to be called by a reporter or the Library of Congress when one is cooking a complicated recipe.''         Or, as she once put it in another context:         The world is perverse,         but it could be worse.         (''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems.'')         Correction:  December 23, 2004, Thursday  An obituary of the poet Mona Van Duyn on Dec. 4 misstated the first line of a couplet from her poem ''Sonnet for Minimalists'' and misidentified the first book in which it appeared. The couplet reads, ''The world's perverse/but it could be worse' -- not ''The world is perverse.'' The sonnet was first published in book form in ''Near Changes'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1990), not in ''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems'' (Atheneum, 1982).
