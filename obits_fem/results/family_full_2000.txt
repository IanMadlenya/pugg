         Marian Cowles Botsford, a former executive in the fabric-design and  women's wear fields, died on Dec. 27 at her home in Santa Fe. She was 79.         She had a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Botsford was born in Buffalo to Edwin Cowles, an engineer and inventor, and Marian Tomkins Cowles. She was a great-granddaughter of an earlier Edwin Cowles,  who founded The Cleveland Leader newspaper.         She graduated in 1937 from Chatham Hall, a boarding school in Chatham, Va., and in 1941 from Smith College. She became a designer and executive with Jack Lenor Larsen Inc., a Manhattan-based designer and manufacturer of fabrics for interior design, and an executive at B. H. Wragge, also in Manhattan, which made women's wear.         She married Stephen B. Botsford, The New Yorker magazine's president from 1956 to 1961, in 1966. He died in 1967.         She is survived by a son from an early marriage, James E. Mitchell of Philadelphia; a sister, Jeanne C. Fleischmann of Manhattan, who is the widow of Peter F. Fleischmann, a chairman of The New Yorker; and two grandchildren.       
         Anne Devenney, the spark plug of community organization who helped keep the tidy, solid neighborhoods of the northwest Bronx from turning into another burned-out urban slum, died Jan. 9 in the Bronx. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A former resident of Norwood, the Bronx, she recently lived with her daughters in Yonkers.         Mrs. Devenney was a founder, president emeritus and living legend of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, which started in the mid-1970's. An umbrella organization for nine community groups, it champions home ownership, tenant-controlled housing, street safety and local investment.         ''She was a no-nonsense Bronx grandmother who took leadership of a whole part of the Bronx in some of its darkest times as the head of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition,'' said the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, who had known her for some 20 years. ''She led the charge against arson for profit, housing deterioration and unresponsive politicians. She was a real original.''         At times, it seemed that her coalition was fighting sluggish bureaucracies and corporate obtuseness as much as the obvious symptoms of urban blight. It took on the problems of drug dealing, street crime, vacant buildings and the flight of residents that those things would set off, but it also attacked mortgage redlining and the deterioration of city services.         Anne O'Hanlon was a child of the Depression, the youngest of seven children born to Irish immigrant parents in Hell's Kitchen, on the West Side of Manhattan. She lived in tenements there, in Harlem and in Morningside Heights. As a teenager, she washed and ironed and scrubbed floors for the well-to-do on Riverside Drive for $1.25 a day.         She dropped out of high school and got a $12-a-week dime-store job, but returned to night classes to earn a high school diploma. A defining experience of her youth was the eviction of her family from their apartment house, which was demolished to make room for a ramp to the George Washington Bridge.         In 1941, she married John Devenney, and in 1956, the couple moved to Putnam Valley, N.Y., from which Mr. Devenney commuted to his draftsman's job in New York City. But the suburbs were not her natural habitat, and Mrs. Devenney later said that she hated being dependent on a car and that all the rain and snow and hard mud for months on end made her long for the swept pavements of the city.         In 1962, the family moved back to the Bronx into a fifth-floor five-room apartment on Perry Avenue, but in a few years, the ailments of the inner city moved into the neighborhood. Black and Hispanic refugees from the South Bronx moved in, with the causes of their flight in pursuit.         Landlords, frightened by the wave of arson sweeping the borough, began to neglect their buildings and even abandon them. Many white working-class families started to think of moving to other places for a haven. But Mrs. Devenney's upbringing among people of different races and creeds had taught her that the struggle against community destruction knew no color.         Banding together with members of the clergy and young community organizers, she began to haunt hallways and community centers, trying to shake people out of their complacency and into partnerships with residents of surrounding areas where the blight was setting in.         The result was the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition. It and its affiliated groups badgered city officials for decent sanitation services and the money to keep streets, parks and other public places in good repair. They trooped to City Hall, demanding action against landlords who burned their buildings for the insurance money.         They homed in on redlining by insurers that refused to write policies in their neighborhoods for fear of losses and by banks that denied mortgages in the community despite the large amounts of deposits that they held from its residents.         Coalition members picketed corporate headquarters, invaded annual meetings with proxies from stock-owning churches, and met personally with politicians and executives who knew little of the people living in those communities.         Mrs. Devenney's husband died in 1993.         She is survived by two daughters, Betty Devenney and Carol Gibney, both of Yonkers; two sons, John, of Macon, Ga., and Joseph, of Mahopac, N.Y.; 14 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Devenney stayed in the forefront of the campaign for neighborhood survival until the late 1980's, negotiating with commissioners, mayors and banking and insurance executives for a fair share of city services and private-sector investment.         She described herself as ''conservative-liberal-radical,'' explaining, ''I have to be conservative because I want to conserve my neighborhood, liberal to keep my mind open and radical to carry a picket sign.''       
         Hazel Wolf, an ardent environmentalist whose life spanned the 20th century and whose causes encompassed the era's social turmoil, died in Port Angeles, Wash., on Wednesday. She was 101 and lived in Seattle.         Since the early 1960's Ms. Wolf was a leader in the Audubon Society, serving as secretary of the Seattle chapter for 37 years and helping to establish 21 of the 26 Audubon chapters in Washington. She was also active in the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, as its one-time president and as editor of its newsletter until her death.         Born in the 19th century, Ms. Wolf had long spoken of wanting to witness the 21st. She told the oral historian Studs Terkel, who profiled her in his 1995 book ''Coming of Age,'' that she intended to live until the year 2000. ''Then I'm going,'' she said.         Especially in the Seattle region, but also beyond, she was elder stateswoman in a community of intersecting social causes, recognized by the Association of Biologists and Ecologists of Nicaragua for conservation work there, by the Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility with their Paul Beeson Peace Award, by the National Audubon Society with its medal of excellence and last year by Seattle with its Spirit of America Award.         But long before the environmental movement blossomed, providing a cause that made her celebrated in her later years, Ms. Wolf was steeped in struggles over human rights, communism, labor issues, peace, feminism and immigration.         Hazel Anna Cummings Anderson was born on March 10, 1898, in Victoria, British Columbia. Her father was Canadian and her mother was American. After separating from her first husband, Edward Dalziel, she moved to the United States in 1923 with her daughter, finding work as a legal secretary, her lifelong career.         She joined the Communist Party during the Depression, attracted by its support for social welfare programs like food subsidies, unemployment aid and social security.         Her first party meeting, she recalled in a speech years later, was at a home where the local sheriff was at that moment trying to evict a family. ''I joined in what was occurring,'' she said. ''As the sheriff's men brought the furniture out to pile it on the sidewalk, the rest of us picked it up and took it into the house by the back door. This went on for quite a while until the sheriff and his men, who were not very enthusiastic in the first place, left in despair and frustration.''         Ms. Wolf said she lost interest in the party during World War II, as the wartime boom made issues of economic security less compelling to her. But years after she left the party, the government tried to expel her, starting a personal and legal struggle that shaped her life. That fight lasted 15 years, as McCarthyism rose and fell. She once joked that a lawyer she worked for at the time spent so much effort on her case that it was not clear who was working for whom.         The experience led her into advocacy for the rights of immigrants, a cause she never gave up. ''The foreign born were the earliest victims of the McCarthy witch hunt,'' she said 10 years ago in a talk to a high school class. ''They still have a hard and uncertain life.''         In that lecture, as on many other occasions, Ms. Wolf recounted being thrown in jail briefly in 1958, charged with sedition though she had left the Communist Party 13 years before. She told the two other women in her jail cell that she had been accused of conspiring to overthrow the government by violent means. ''What a wonderful idea,'' one of her fellow prisoners said.         ''I never did try to overthrow the government, or if I did, I didn't do a very good job,'' Ms. Wolf said.         But her associates said she never gave up trying to overthrow whatever she saw as unjust, whether it was the behavior of big corporations or the policies of the United States in Nicaragua. Her reputation grew, and she became a frequent public speaker (many of her speeches can be found on the World Wide Web at members.tripod.com/HazelWolf). Only a broken hip prevented her from joining the protests by unions and environmentalists in Seattle during the recent meeting of the World Trade Organization, said Brock Evans, president of the Western Outdoor Clubs.         ''One of her major causes was always for labor to join with environmentalists,'' he said. Another was for environmentalists to include Native Americans, blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups in their movement.         ''People gang up to protect all kinds of things -- civil liberties, freedom of speech,'' Ms. Wolf once wrote. ''It's in our genes to gang up. Anytime we want anything, we gang up.''         Summing up her many causes, she told the American Immigration Lawyers Association last year, ''We lost most of the battles but we won the war in all of them.''         She told them insouciantly that when she finally became an American citizen in 1974, after taking the oath and forswearing allegiance to foreign potentates, she went to a bar to celebrate with friends. ''I proposed the following toast: 'To hell with Queen Elizabeth and to hell with Richard Nixon, too.' ''         She is survived by her daughter, Nydia Levick of Port Angeles, five grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and four great-great grandchildren. Her second marriage, to Herbert Wolf, also ended in divorce.         Ms. Wolf was already at most people's retirement age when a friend persuaded her to join the Audubon Society in the early 1960's. It was the era when Rachel Carson was warning that pesticides and the eradication of habitats were threatening the earth with a silent spring with no song birds, but more than that book or her friend's arm-twisting, it was bird-watching (specifically, observing a brown creeper grubbing in the woods) that sparked her deep involvement with Audubon. For decades more, she continued to go to the woods for inspiration and to urge others along the environmental path.         But she spiced her advocacy with a dollop of salt. In a speech last year on saving the endangered salmon of the Pacific Northwest, she reminded her Seattle University audience of the first reason to do so: the fish are ''good to eat.''         And in a speech on sustainable forestry practices in 1998, she said her goal was not, as she quoted the poet, to ''spare that tree, cut not a single bough,'' but rather to make sure there would always be forests for wild creatures and to provide homes, furniture, paper and ''probably even skateboards.''       
         Filomen D'Agostino Greenberg, a self-taught stock trader who used her good fortune to help her alma mater, New York University Law School, grow into an academic leader, died Friday. She was 101 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Arriving from Coney Island one morning in 1917 to start classes, Fil D'Agostino -- as she was called by friends -- found five small rooms crammed into a single building east of Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. Fresh out of high school, she got a $3-a-week clerk's job and received her law degree in 1920.         While she was practicing negligence and criminal law, she married Max Greenberg, a 1919 New York University law graduate who became a highly successful expert in contract law; he died in 1980.         In World War II, Mrs. Greenberg worked as a government censor. One day she came across a letter filled with arcane abbreviations and fractions that read like code. She realized that she was looking at stock-market quotations. Her interest piqued, she reached for the daily paper, and a new carer opened up.         Since her husband showed no interest in the market, she pursued it on her own, but they both began many years of strong financial support for the law school. She continued her investments, and her donations, after her husband's death.         By 1990, her gifts totaled more than $6 million, which made her the school's biggest benefactor at the time. Her help made possible the Filomen D'Agostino Residence Hall for about 370 students; its inspiration was her difficult trip back and forth from Brooklyn every day when she was a student. Her help also financed the Greenberg Lounge on the campus, the Greenberg Faculty Research Fund and the Greenberg Professorship in Contract Law.         She is survived by a sister, Deborah Johnston.         Law, Mrs. Greenberg once said, was not her first career choice. ''I wanted to study medicine,'' she said, ''but no school in New York would admit a woman, and my family was too poor to send me away to study.''       
         Eva Julia Neer, a biochemist and heart researcher at Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, died on Sunday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 62.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, her family said.         Dr. Neer was widely known for her investigations into the ways a certain class of proteins helps people see and smell, lets brain cells communicate and makes the body respond to hormones and most prescription drugs. In more than 30 years of research, she combined the tools of chemistry, biology, physics and molecular biology to explain how cells interpret the messages they get from light, hormones and neurotransmitters.         Dr. Neer spent most of her professional life in the cardiovascular unit at the hospital and last went to her laboratory the week before she died, working on the last of her many scientific papers. She was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, its Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences.         Born Eva Augenblick in Warsaw, she arrived in New York at age 8 and grew up in Queens and Scarsdale. She attended Radcliffe College, graduated from Barnard College in 1957 and received her medical degree at Columbia University in 1963.         After finishing her internship and residencies, she joined the staff at Harvard as a researcher in biology in 1966. She was appointed an assistant professor in biochemistry at the medical school in 1976 and became a full professor in 1991.         She joined what was then Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in 1976 as an associate in medicine and was named a biochemist at Brigham and Women's six years later. She also was associated with the American Heart Association as an investigator and with the biochemistry section of the National Institutes of Health, which gave her its N.I.H. Merit Award in 1989.         Dr. Neer is survived by her husband, Dr. Robert Neer, and their two sons, Robert Jr. and Richard, all of Cambridge.       
         Bonnie Cashin, one of the first designers to create and popularize that uniquely American approach to dress called sportswear, died Thursday after open heart surgery at New York University Medical Center. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Cashin was one of a handful of women in the 1940's and 1950's who made an important contribution to American fashion, at a time when Parisian couturiers dominated the runways and supplied most of the original fashions for manufacturers to copy. The breakthroughs achieved by Ms. Cashin and designers like Claire McCardell, Vera Maxwell, Anne Klein and Anne Fogarty still influence the way women dress, and paved the way for the success of American designers like Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein.         Renowned for her loose-fitting sportswear, Ms. Cashin described her unstudied, casual designs as ''articulating with the body.'' She was an early proponent of layering -- using several layers of light, fluid clothes, rather than one heavy garment. She pioneered the use of grommets in place of buttons and was the first important designer to make ponchos for women, introducing lightweight capes and ponchos that, she explained, ''didn't look like a horse should wear them.''         As far back as 1943, she showed boots with tweed suits and included them in almost every subsequent collection. Her ''pocketbook'' pocket, with a snap closing, was another feature that long distinguished Cashin designs. She was ahead of her time when she introduced canvas raincoats in 1952, industrial zippers in 1955, jumpsuits in 1956 and suede Indian dresses with fringes in 1957.         She opened her own business, Bonnie Cashin Designs, in 1952 and for the two ensuing decades also designed leather, jersey, canvas and tweed clothes for Philip Sills. In addition, she created handbags for Coach Leatherware, gloves for Crescendoe-Superb and rainwear for Modelia. In the early 1970's, she branched out into knitwear with styles knitted to shape, rather than cut and sewn, and with welt hems instead of traditional hems or ribbed cuffs. A popular innovation was a roomy turtleneck that did not require a zipper to get over the head.         Although her themes were often adopted by other designers, Cashin clothes had a look of their own. Her tweed ponchos were bound in leather, and her coats had a special, supple swing. For several years, there were Cashin departments in chic Paris and London stores.         ''Women buy Cashin clothes because they are cozy and comfortable, not because they bowl people over,'' the fashion writer Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times in 1968.         Her gloves had many of the same features as her clothes. Grommets were arranged in the back of one style so that the glove could almost have served as a set of brass knuckles. Brass toggles not only were ornamental but also held a pair of gloves together or attached them to a belt. Some had drawstrings at the top that could be tightened to keep out the wind.         Her classic designs for Coach in the early 1960's were the shoulder bag and what was called the Basic, a smaller clutch style with a removable shoulder strap. The first bag she designed, a leather carryall modeled after paper shopping bags, was later discontinued but has since become ubiquitous in the collections of numerous handbag companies.         She was intolerant of anything ugly, in appearance or design. When she traveled, she draped lengths of Thai silk in her hotel rooms and ordered quantities of flowers. She was also generous on the road, dispensing items in her wardrobe to anyone who admired them. She usually returned with a different wardrobe from the one she had packed, not only because she had given away her clothing but also because she was interested in acquiring fashion ideas from other countries.         ''Travel is my education,'' she said in a 1961 interview with Charlotte Curtis in The Times. ''Even if I don't use an idea right away, it's there.'' The idea of layering came from time she spent in Asia. ''The Japanese refer to cold weather as a nine-layer day,'' she explained in 1950. ''Hot is a one-layer day.''         One of her best-known innovations was the ''dog leash'' skirt, which came about because she was constantly holding her skirt going up steps in her country home in Briarcliff, N.Y. The long wool skirt could be instantly shortened by latching a small brass ring sewn near the bottom to a small brass clasp at the waistline.         Ms. Cashin was born on Sept. 28, 1915, in Oakland, Calif., the daughter of Carl Cashin, a photographer and inventor, and Eunice Cashin. The family lived in several towns in northern California during Ms. Cashin's early years, and in each her mother would open a custom dress shop. As a child she was given fabric scraps as playthings and soon began sewing and designing.         Shortly before her graduation from high school, she showed some of her sketches to the director of a Los Angeles ballet company and was hired to make costumes for the next performance. After graduation, she joined the company as its designer and in 1934 accompanied the manager to New York when he took over the Roxy Theater. Not yet 20, she created three costume changes a week for each of the variety theater's 24 dancers.         She often called her Roxy experience her ''formal schooling in design'' and credited it with her later ability to create clothes that looked good on figures in motion. The theater also propelled her into designing street clothes, initially a collection of sportswear for Adler & Adler, a manufacturing concern.         After the United States entered World War II, she was appointed to a committee to design uniforms for women in the armed forces. But the war also imposed restrictions on the civilian use of fabrics and trim. She returned to costume design, which had more leeway with fabrics, and moved to Hollywood. There, she joined 20th Century Fox and created the clothes for some 60 films, including ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' ''Laura'' and ''Anna and the King of Siam.''         Ms. Cashin enjoyed the work in Hollywood, explaining: ''I wasn't designing for fashion, but for characteristics, which is the way I like to design clothes for daily wear. I like to design clothes for a woman who plays a particular role in life, not simply to design clothes that follow a certain trend, or that express some new silhouette.''         She remained in Hollywood until 1949, when she returned to New York. Her casual, layered clothes struck a responsive chord in American women. Within three years, she had won the first of her Coty Awards and organized Bonnie Cashin Designs.         Ms. Cashin was also chosen the first designer for Patterns of The Times, American Designer Series, a monthly feature in The New York Times during the 1950's that made designer patterns available for home sewing.         She was inducted into the Coty American Fashion Critics Hall of Fame in 1972 after receiving her second Coty Award in 1968. Her designs are in more than a dozen museums and some 30 university collections.         She was among the designers highlighted in the 1998 Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute exhibition ''American Ingenuity: Sportswear 1930's-1970's.'' A retrospective of her work is scheduled to open in September at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.         In 1979, she established the Innovative Design Fund awards, a nonprofit organization based in New York that gave up to $10,000 to designers with original ideas in home furnishings, textiles and fashion so they could transform their sketches into marketable products.         During her early design years, she was married briefly to Robert Sterner, an art director. They were later divorced. She is survived by her longtime companion, Curtis Kellar.         Bernadine Morris summed up Ms. Cashin's fashion philosophy and appeal in a 1968 article in The Times: ''In a day when most fashions seem stamped out by cookie cutters, hers look as if they had been touched with human hands.''         ''They have an uncompromising integrity, freedom and joy,'' Mrs. Morris wrote.         Her own career philosophy was summed up in a framed unsigned cartoon of trapeze performers she had hanging in her Manhattan apartment. One high-wire performer is advising the other, ''You've got to know when to let go.''       
         Anna Holbrook Clark, who transcended a secretarial job to become an influential policy adviser to Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and worked at five levels of government, died on Jan. 28 in a Manhattan nursing home. She was 95.         The era in which Ms. Clark served the dynamic mayor known as ''the Little Flower'' seems almost impossibly quaint: he had no telephone on his desk and wandered into her cubbyhole to take calls. But it was the Depression era, and as the country moved toward World War II she was at the center of events during a turbulent period at City Hall.         ''I do not think that anyone who stops to consider it can deny that we are in the midst of a social revolution,'' Ms. Clark said in a paper on economic strategies written for Mayor La Guardia in 1940. She saw the mayor's office as ''one of the nerve centers of the world,'' according to an oral history she prepared in the 1980's.         The pace of life -- eventually as secretary of the Board of Estimate, the panel of top elected officials that then ran city government -- was blistering: Mayor La Guardia resented staff members taking lunch, barely tolerated their vacations and routinely punished unproductive commissioners by making them wait five or six hours for appointments.         Ms. Clark was one of dozens of women promoted by Mayor La Guardia to positions of influence as part of his reformist philosophy. She eventually held jobs at the city, county, state, federal and international levels. Her approach to her often-chaotic working environment was steady, soft-spoken and utterly attentive.         ''You told her something once,'' said Susan Alt, former president of the Women's Civic Club, a policy analysis and advocacy organization of which Ms. Clark was a member throughout her adult life.         Ms. Clark possessed a steely determination learned from her grandmother Kate, a suffragist and prohibitionist who frequently campaigned on street corners.         Women won the right to vote when Ms. Clark was 16. Her mother took her along to the polling place even though she was too young to vote. Smiling broadly, the mother told officials that her daughter was 21 -- a bit of calculated revenge for centuries of female disenfranchisement.         Anna Clark was born in the Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights in 1904. She was the oldest of five children. One sister contracted polio and another died of influenza in 1918, leaving a long shadow over the family, said a niece, Cheryl Chalmers.         But spirited discussions of public affairs obscured the sadness. Talk often revolved around corruption cases that her father, John Kirkland Clark, investigated as a lawyer in the Manhattan district attorney's office.         Ms. Clark attended the Barnard School for Girls, but she later regretted that the school taught her little science. She graduated from Smith College, majoring in government. Her first job was with a magazine published for social workers.         She then received a one-year fellowship to Bryn Mawr College to study bias in the news. Her next job was as a writer for The American City, a technical journal for city government managers. She was laid off during the Depression.         ''I remember saying to my family that I thought if I were a man I might try for a job in city government,'' she said in her oral history. Her father suggested speaking to his secretary, who just happened to be Mayor La Guardia's sister. ''I'm not averse to using contacts,'' Ms. Clark said.         The result was an interview with the mayor at his temporary offices in the Empire State Building during a renovation of City Hall. In the middle of the session, an aide scurried in and whispered in the mayor's ear. The mayor jumped up. ''I have to go to a fire,'' he said. ''Come back on Monday.''         She was not sure she wanted the job, which involved reorganizing extensive files, supervising three secretaries and much more. But when it was offered, at a salary of $2,600 a year, she grabbed it. Eight months later she received a raise of $280 a year, according to a one-paragraph report in The New York Times.         She was meeting people like Robert Moses, the man behind the city and state's highways, bridges and parks. Introducing her, Mayor La Guardia said, ''She's a career woman.'' Mr. Moses looked at her and asked how long that would last.         She never married, perhaps because her social life was circumscribed by the mountains of work she habitually brought home. She was tall and slender, and had ''a sweet manner of speaking,'' said Edith Spivack, 89, a lawyer who worked in the La Guardia administration. Her voice was authoritative, and she squinted a bit when making an important point, said Richard K. Lieberman, director of the La Guardia and Wagner Archives.         Ms. Spivack said: ''She was neat and tidy. She was all the things a lady should be.''         As the war deepened, the Board of Estimate did less and less. So Ms. Clark went to Washington to work in the Pentagon, the State Department and the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency.         After the war she used a recommendation from Mr. Moses to get a job working on transportation issues in Nassau County. She then worked for the United Nations, raising money for Unicef and helping refugees in Bremen, Germany.         For years Ms. Clark continued to fight for civic improvements, as a member of her Upper East Side community board and in other forums. She led the successful fight to expand bus service on First Avenue to better serve the hospitals there. She lobbied to build four tracks rather than the planned two on the Second Avenue subway should that ill-starred line ever be built.         She is survived by a sister, Margaret Vander Veer of Charlotte, N. C.       
         Sarah Caudwell, the British author whose modest but ecstatically received output of three erudite and maliciously witty mystery novels led at least one critic to compare her to Oscar Wilde, died on Jan. 28 at her home in London. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, said Barney Karpfinger, her agent.         Ms. Caudwell produced her first novel, ''Thus Was Adonis Murdered,'' in 1981, during an accomplished career as a Chancery barrister. The novel was set in Lincoln's Inn Fields, where the author had practiced law. It featured a sleuth, Hilary Tamar, who taught law at Oxford, as did Ms. Caudwell.         Although the story revolved around the lusty antics of ''a decorative little group'' of junior barristers, it was the classical erudition and acerbic tongue of the narrator, whose sex is never stated, that set the droll tone of the series. ''I am an  historian'' was Tamar's explanation for the devious workings of his or her mind. ''My profession largely consists of speaking ill of the dead.''         ''The Shortest Way to Hades''  (1985) and ''The Sirens Sang of Murder'' (1989) continued in the same elegantly mannered style, with stories bound up in arcane areas of British law and steeped in obscure allusions to classical literature. (A crucial clue in ''The Shortest Way to Hades'' is embedded in Book XI of ''The Odyssey.'') Her final novel, ''The Sybil in Her Grave,'' which deals with insider stock trading and corporate takeovers, will be published in June by Delacorte Press.         The incisiveness of her legal points won her admirers among members of the profession, including Robert Bork (who was once quoted as saying, ''In my opinion, there can't be too many Sarah Caudwell novels''), while the gleeful savagery of her satiric style made her a darling of the critics. Newgate Callendar, in The New York Times Book Review, praised her for writing ''in a kind of English that has not been around since the days of Oscar Wilde.''         Sarah Caudwell was born May 27, 1939, to the author and journalist Claud Cockburn and his wife, Jean Ross, the actress and writer who was Christopher Isherwood's model for Sally Bowles in his Berlin stories and the musical ''Cabaret.'' Ms. Caudwell chose the surname Caudwell because it was a family name. She is survived by her half-brothers, the political writers Alexander, Andrew and Patrick Cockburn.         Her family ''recognized how much of Sarah there was in her characters,'' Andrew Cockburn said. ''There are certain aspects of Hilary Tamar, certain eccentricities, that are pure Sarah, although not Sarah's pipe-smoking. And, of course, that acuity of mind. Sarah had this incredibly sharp brain, which was evidenced by her success at both navigating and portraying what someone in Oliver Cromwell's Parliament once called 'the tortuous, ungodly jungle of English law.' ''         She graduated from Aberdeen University and received her law degree at St. Ann's College, Oxford. When she arrived there, the Oxford Union, a prestigious debating society, was still closed to women, said Andrew Cockburn. She led the fight that changed that, and she made her point at one off-limits event that she attended dressed as a man. Her disguise was discovered and she was ejected, but ultimately won the war.         She joined the Chancery bar in 1966 and worked in property and tax law. When she joined Lloyds Bank, she became a senior executive in the trust department.         ''As a woman, she had to have had a first-class mind to join the Chancery bar, to have built up a successful practice and to have become a senior executive at Lloyds,'' said a friend and fellow barrister, John Tackebury. ''All these institutions were highly resistant to women at a senior level, and certainly to a woman who smoked a pipe.''       
         Doris Kenner-Jackson, a founding member of the Shirelles, one of the first and most emotionally affecting of pop's girl groups, died on Friday at a hospital in Sacramento, Calif. She was 58.         The cause was breast cancer, said her niece, Lauren Nance.         Ms. Kenner-Jackson was born Doris Coley in 1941 in Goldsboro, N.C., and moved with her family to Passaic, N.J., as a teenager. She soon began performing at parties and talent shows with her friends Shirley Owens (later Shirley Alston Reeves), Addie Harris and Beverly Lee.         A classmate introduced the foursome to her mother, Florence Greenberg, the pioneering manager and a founder of Tiara Records, who soon signed the group to record for her label.         The Shirelles co-wrote their first single, the precocious schoolyard round ''I Met Him on a Sunday,'' which earned so much radio play that Decca Records bought it and distributed it nationally. After that, the group recorded many hits and earned ardent fans including the Beatles, who covered the quartet's songs ''Baby It's You'' and ''Boys.''         Ms. Kenner-Jackson usually sang harmonies during the Shirelles' heyday, but she did take the lead on the group's passionate version of the Five Royales' song, ''Dedicated to the One I Love.'' Her vocals captured the reckless yearning of the teenage heart.         She also sang the lead on many lesser-known Shirelles songs, including ''Blue Holiday'' and ''I Saw a Tear.''         The Shirelles stayed together until 1968, broke up and reunited, and finally splintered in the 1970's. Ms. Kenner-Jackson kept performing in one of three postbreakup versions of the group.         She briefly worked for Federal Express in the 1970's, but mostly stayed active on the oldies-revival circuit. Despite her two-year fight with cancer, she was entertaining audiences until a few weeks before her death, said Ms. Nance, of Paterson, N.J.         In 1994, when the Rhythm and Blues Foundation gave the Shirelles a Heritage Award, Ms. Kenner-Jackson sang with the group's other surviving members, Ms. Alston Reeves and Ms. Lee, for the first time in 19 years, Harris having died in 1982. The threesome met again when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.         Ms. Kenner-Jackson, who was married and divorced twice, is survived by four children, Antonio Kenner, Gary Kenner, Tracey Jackson, and Staci Jackson-Richardson, all of Sacramento; two sisters, Ernestine Francies of Passaic and Agnes Coley of Bloomfield, N.J.; a brother, Jeremiah Coley of Paterson, four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Nuala Pelletier, the office manager for The New York Times Company Foundation, died of breast cancer on Sunday at her home in Sparkill, N.Y. She was 63.         Mrs. Pelletier, a native of Dublin, was with the foundation, which gives grants to nonprofit organizations, for eight years.         Mrs. Pelletier, the former Madeline Nuala Moran, began working for The Times in 1959, where she was joined by other members of her family as the years passed. Her husband, Robert Pelletier, who died in 1997, was a Times art director; her daughter, Alexandra, is a news assistant on the Times national desk; her sister, Clare Salvaggio, is a staff assistant on the Times Magazine staff, and another sister, Cecilia Moran, was a  Times secretary, now retired.         Besides her two sisters and her daughter, Alexandra, of Sparkill, Mrs. Pelletier is survived by her mother, Madeline Moran of Chestnut Ridge, N.Y.; another daughter, Etain, also of Sparkill; a son, Kieran, of Turbotville, Pa.; another sister, Marie Long of Jersey City; three brothers, John Moran of Manalapan, N.J., Joseph Moran of Ireland, and Robert Moran of Wappinger Falls, N.Y.; and two grandsons.       
         Louisa Matthiasdottir, an exemplar of the strain of painterly representation that runs through the history of postwar American art, died Saturday at O'Connor Hospital in Delhi, N.Y. She was 83 and lived in New York from 1942 until late 1999, when she moved to Delhi to live with her daughter, Temma Bell, who is also painter.         Ms. Matthiasdottir, whose nickname was Ulla, was born in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1917. She came to New York in 1942 and had her first solo show at the Jane Street Gallery, New York's first artists' cooperative, in 1948. A laconic, independent woman, she gave few interviews and did not teach painting or write about her work. ''As to painting, I just start painting and that's about it,'' she once said.         Those few words summed up a style that was similarly cryptic and to the point, and that reduced the world to a series of simple, blocky shapes and angled planes of clear, ringing color, all dispatched with a crisp, unfettered directness that allowed no reworking.         It was a style that was at once cool and celebratory, and Ms. Matthiasdottir deployed it evenhandedly. Her work included portraits and self-portraits, still lifes, interiors and distilled, light-filled paintings of the coastal landscape of Iceland, which she depicted as sparsely populated by houses, horses or sheep. She maintained close ties to Iceland, where she came to be viewed as something of a national treasure. She visited almost annually and retained her Icelandic citizenship.         Although Ms. Matthiasdottir enjoyed both critical and financial success in New York, especially after 1970, official recognition proved elusive. She was, for example, included in only one Whitney Biennial, in 1973, and is not represented in any of the city's four major museums. She was one of several postwar artists who, despite Abstract Expressionism's unanimous success, persisted in the notion that abstraction and representation were not mutually exclusive states, that one could paint from reality in a way that gave form, color and paint a power all their own.         The artists who acted on this belief in the late 1940's and early 50's included Robert de Niro Sr. and his wife, Catherine Admiral, Nicholas Carone, Fairfield Porter, Alex Katz and later Nell Blaine, as well as San Franciscans like David Park. Yet Ms. Matthiasdottir's style took root in Iceland before the war.         She was born into a well-to-do family in Reykjavik, where her father was a prominent surgeon. Her parents encouraged her painting, she once said, because they never saw her do anything else. In 1934 she was sent to Copenhagen, where she enrolled in a three-year course at the School of Commercial Art, which encouraged her penchant for simplification and bright color. In 1938 her parents took her to Paris, where she studied with Marcel Gromaire and encountered the work of Matisse. She then returned to Reykjavik and worked for two years among the city's small, struggling avant-garde.         Ms. Matthiasdottir developed a style that merged the post-Impressionism of Edvard Munch with the palette of Fauvism, as well as the influences of less well-known Scandinavian modernists. When she came to New York she intended to study at the Art Students League, but ended up attending classes taught by Hans Hofmann, whose emphasis on structure and strong color she found compatible. Within a year of her arrival she met Leland Bell, a tall, handsome painter who was as voluble as she was aloof. Their marriage in 1944 marked the beginning of a partnership that included side-by-side studios in their house on 16th Street, occasional double exhibitions and a shared gallery, the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery on Madison Avenue, where Ms. Matthiasdottir had 17 solo shows between 1964 and 1991.         Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the Indiana Art Museum in Bloomington and the National Gallery of Iceland in Reykjavik.         Mr. Bell died in 1991. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Matthiasdottir is survived by four granddaughters.         Correction:  March 4, 2000, Saturday  An obituary of the artist Louisa Matthiasdottir on Thursday misstated the given name of a postwar artist with whom she shared the belief that abstraction and representationalism were not mutually exclusive approaches to painting. The artist was Virginia Admiral, not Catherine.       
         Barbara Cooney, an author and illustrator of children's books whose first work was published in 1940 and whose 110th, ''Basket Moon,'' appeared last fall, died on Friday at a hospital in Portland, Me. She was 83 and lived in Damariscotta, Me.         Miss Cooney honored the admonition she ascribed to her best-loved character, Miss Rumphius, who said, ''You must do something to make the world more beautiful.''         She won the Caldecott Medal for illustration twice, first in 1958 for a version of Chaucer's ''Chanticleer and the Fox'' in full color in the scratchboard technique she had been using for roughly 20 years. Her second Caldecott, in 1980, was for paintings for Donald Hall's ''Ox-Cart Man'' that were in a distinctive primitive folk art style.         Each prize changed the artistic course of her career. After the first she began to paint, and after the second she began to write her own stories to illustrate, including what she retrospectively called a trilogy -- ''Miss Rumphius'' (1982), ''Island Boy'' (1988) and ''Hattie and the Wild Waves'' (1990). They made up what she said was ''as close to any autobiography as I will ever get.''         She was born in 1917 at the Hotel Bossert in Brooklyn Heights, which was built by her maternal grandfather. ''Hattie and the Wild Waves'' describes in detail her artist mother's childhood in a wealthy German-American family.         Miss Cooney grew up on Long Island and began summering in Maine at age 2. She graduated from Smith College in 1938 and studied lithography and etching at the Art Students League in New York.         She married Dr. Charles Talbot Porter and reared four children while he practiced medicine in Pepperell, Mass., later moving to a house overlooking the sea in Damariscotta.         The somewhat awed narrator of ''Miss Rumphius'' describes her great-aunt as ''little and old'' but adds, ''she has not always been that way.'' Miss Rumphius is also known as the Lupine Lady because, after an adventurous life, she has returned to the Maine coast, where she harvests and scatters the seeds of her favorite plant. ''Island Boy'' tells the story of Matthais Tibbetts, who lived almost his entire life on a remote Maine island.         Maine, the much-loved scene of many of Miss Cooney's books, treasured the author in turn. In 1989 the Maine Library Association created the Lupine Award to honor outstanding children's books by state residents or authors of books about Maine, beginning with Miss Cooney, and in 1996 Gov. Angus King proclaimed her a Living Treasure of the State of Maine. In 1997 Miss Cooney announced a donation of $550,000 to the library in Damariscotta, and later added $300,000. Groundbreaking for a library costing $2 million will be next month.         Miss Cooney received many honorary degrees and won numerous awards in addition to the Caldecotts, including the American Book Award for ''Miss Rumphius'' in 1983.         In addition to her husband and four children, she is survived by two brothers, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.         Miss Cooney's work is much admired for its historical detail and accuracy, from the embroidery on Eleanor Roosevelt's baptismal gown (''Eleanor'') to details of Finnish folklore (''Louhi, Witch of North Farm'').         In her 1959 Caldecott acceptance speech she explained: ''How many children will know that the magpie sitting in my pollarded willow in 'Chanticleer and the Fox' is an evil omen? How many children will realize that every flower and grass in the book grew in Chaucer's time in England? How many children will know or care? Maybe not a single one. Still I keep piling it on. Detail after detail. Whom am I pleasing -- besides myself? I don't know. Yet if I put enough in my pictures, there may be something for everyone. Not all will be understood, but some will be understood now and maybe more later.''       
         Christi Finch, whose catering shop, Word of Mouth, was among the first to produce luxury takeout food on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, died on Tuesday. She was 54.         Her death, at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, came after a prolonged gastrointestinal illness, her family said.         Ms. Finch's down-home charm made even the newest customers feel welcome when they shopped for  delicacies like brandied pate and a spiced pumpkin mousse or homespun offerings like meatloaf and giant chocolate chip cookies.         Ms. Finch and her partner, Eileen Weinberg, opened the first Word of Mouth on East 72nd Street near Lexington Avenue in 1976, at a time when most takeout food consisted of mundane fare. The partners had met at  Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital, where they both worked in administration. Discovering a shared love of food, the two self-taught cooks baked  cakes for doctors, some of whom became their backers.         Together Ms. Finch and Ms. Weinberg turned out their interpretations of ethnic foods, with a strong emphasis on Mediterranean cuisines, including Moroccan specialties, then rare in New York City. They offered copious portions of dishes that were at once lusty, yet subtly stylish, and their high prices rarely deterred affluent neighborhood customers.         Shortly after the shop moved to its present quarters at 1012 Lexington Avenue in 1979, Ms. Weinberg left to open a restaurant and her own takeout food shop, Good and Plenty to Go, in the Theater District.         Ms. Finch also opened Cafe Word of Mouth and began to work on a cookbook. The restaurant and cafe are still open.         Christi Kangas grew up in a food-oriented family in Cutler City, Ore.  Her father, George Kangas, was in the grocery business, and her mother, Janice, tested recipes at home for a local flour mill. Ms. Finch's lifelong appreciation of the freshest seasonal produce began in the vegetable garden of her grandmother.         As a young woman, Ms. Finch settled in New York, where she married Thomas Finch in 1967; they were divorced a few years later.         She is survived by her daughter, Pilar; her parents, of Lincoln City, Ore.; and her sisters, Kathryn Amrani, Sheila Coventry and Sharon Borgford, who all live in the Portland, Ore., area.       
         Margaret Rosezarian Harris, a musician and educator who was the first black woman to conduct the  symphony orchestras of Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Minnesota and 11 other American cities, died on March 7 in New York City. She was 56 and lived in Elmsford, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said Sandra G. Owen, a friend.         Ms. Harris was born in Chicago on Sept. 15, 1943, the only child of Dewey and Clara Townsend Harris. Before her fourth birthday, she played a public piano recital of 18 short pieces and three encores, all performed from memory. She was soon performing in halls as far from home as the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, earning as much as $2,000 a performance.         When she was 6, her parents ended the tours and placed her in school. At 10 she performed with the Chicago Symphony and won a scholarship to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.  Ms. Harris's mother moved with her to Philadelphia, working there as a dressmaker. Her father, a Pennsylvania Railroad mechanic, remained in Chicago, visiting his wife and daughter regularly until his death in 1967.         Ms. Harris later earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the Juilliard School. Her graduate work was supported by a grant from the Leopold Schepp Foundation. Ms. Harris would later become a trustee of the foundation.         Though piano was her first love and she played solo recitals in the United States and abroad, Ms. Harris gained the most prominence as a conductor. She worked on Broadway as well, notably as music director of the musical ''Hair,'' a position she took over in 1970. Her orchestra was made up of seven male musicians, all older than she.         ''They don't give me a bit of trouble personally or professionally,'' Ms. Harris was quoted as saying in a New York Times article about this pioneering engagement for a black woman. She added, ''It's like having an unlimited charge account at Saks Fifth Avenue.''         In 1995, she was invited by the United States Information Service of the United States Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to serve as an American cultural specialist for a production there of ''Porgy and Bess.''         Among her compositions are two ballets, an opera called ''King David'' and two piano concertos, the second of which was performed twice with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Zubin Mehta.         Last month Ms. Harris was appointed associate dean of the Pennsylvania Academy of Music in Lancaster, a position she was scheduled to assume in June.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Katharine Washburn, an essayist, editor, anthologist and translator whose legacy includes a cornucopia of verse from the dawn of civilization to the present, died Wednesday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 57.         The apparent cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Ms. Washburn was editor, with John S. Major, of ''World Poetry: An Anthology of Verse From Antiquity to Our Time'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), an updated and expanded version of Mark Van Doren's 1928 ''Anthology of World Poetry.''         At 1,338 pages, including the index, the volume contains 1,600 poems ranging over more than 4,000 years, from ancient Sumer and Egypt to the late 20th century. The editors organized it in eight chronological parts from the Bronze Age forward, with each section subdivided by language.         Most of the poems were translated into English for the anthology by other poets. Its English-language verse sampled the best from Chaucer to the present.         Ms. Washburn herself translated poetry from classical and modern European languages. Among her earlier work was a 1986 translation from the German of poems by Paul Celan (North Point, 1986). At her death, she was working on a novel, ''The Translator's Apology.''         She was co-editor of ''Dumbing Down: Essays on the Strip Mining of American Culture'' (Norton, 1996). It presented the worried views of observers from many vantage points of the present state of American life, art and thought.         She co-edited ''Tongues of Angels, Tongues of Man: A Book of Sermons'' (Doubleday, 1999). It was filled with the ringing words of preachers addressing the vagaries of the world, from the Sermon on the Mount to Savonarola's contempt for the vanities of Renaissance Florence to the anti-Nazi defiance of the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer.         Ms. Washburn was a graduate of Pembroke-Brown University and earned an M.A. at Columbia University, where she also received a Ph.D. in classic Greek. In the 1980's she was on the editorial staff of the Book-of-the-Month Club, and her articles appeared in The New York Times Book Review, Partisan Review, Parnassus and New Republic, among others.         She is survived by her husband, Sherwood; her parents, Calman Winegarden of Toledo, Ohio, and Margaret Winegarden of Rochester; a sister, Mary Hoyle of San Francisco; and three sons, Andrew, Michael and Will, of Brooklyn.       
         Polita Grau, a member of a prominent Cuban political family who helped to spirit thousands of children out of Castro's Cuba, which later jailed her for nearly 14 years as a C.I.A. conspirator, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Miami. She was 84.         Ms. Grau, politically engaged since adolescence, spent four separate periods in exile in Miami because of her work. There, many admired her for her work in helping smuggle thousands of children out of Cuba in Operation Pedro Pan, a secret program run by the Catholic Church in the United States with the aid of the State Department.         She came to Miami from her native Havana for the first time during her senior year in high school, graduating there from a local parochial school.         She was a niece of Dr. Ramon Grau San Martin, a professor of physiology who served as Cuba's provisional president in 1933 and '34 and as president from 1944 to 1948. During his first term, Dr. Grau, a bachelor, made his niece, then known as Maria Leopoldina Grau, his official first lady at state events.         Dr. Grau had been a central figure in the student rebellion against President Gerardo Machado (1925-33), a nationalist who grew increasingly autocratic. Ms. Grau was involved in the campus rebellion as a member of radical and liberal student groups.         Born into a wealthy family, she at first also supported the movement that sent the dictator Fulgencio Batista into exile in 1959. But her enthusiasm for the ensuing Castro regime did not last when it instituted its program of nationalizing businesses.         With her brother, Ramon Grau Alsina, she helped send some 14,000 children to Miami in the early 1960's. They were the offspring of parents who feared their Communist indoctrination or were involved in the anti-Castro resistance.         Once in the United States, they were placed by the church in camps or foster homes; some of them were never reunited with their parents.         Ms. Grau and her brother were arrested in 1965 and accused of plotting to overthrow Fidel Castro, who was then Cuba's prime minister. They were convicted for their role in Pedro Pan and of having had dealings with the Central Intelligence Agency, which denied the connection.         Both got 30-year sentences, but Ms. Grau was freed in 1978 when Mr. Castro released a large number of political prisoners as part of a relaxation encouraged by President Jimmy Carter. Ramon Grau was freed in 1986 and followed her to Miami, where he died in 1998.         Ms. Grau's survivors include a daughter, Hilda Aguero, six grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.       
         Nancy Binns Reed, a composer of musicals and operas, died on Saturday at her home in Burke, Va. She was 75. The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Reed, who wrote some 250 compositions, ranging from songs to marches to operas, achieved her widest success with the 1953 pop song ''Oh, Happy Day,'' which she co-wrote with Don Howard Koplow. Mrs. Reed also wrote a musical, ''Tocqueville!'' in 1976 and ''The Blue Opera,'' a contemporary treatment of Orpheus and Eurydice.         Her husband, Ogden Cartwright Reed, died in 1980. She is survived by a daughter, Amy Reed Geiger of Fairbanks, Alaska; three sons, Hayward C., of Spokane, Wash., Ogden Cartwright Reed Jr. of Philadelphia and Chris B., of Los Angeles.       
         Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, Miss Sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.         She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein musical ''Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the actress Uta Hagen. Miss Sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' Miss Hagen said at a program at the Kaye Playhouse in honor of Miss Sokolow's 85th birthday.         Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''She has influenced us all.''         Miss Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience.         If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she  was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established National Council on the Arts.         Among her most famous pieces was ''Rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also titled ''Rooms''  (1966), which featured, among others, Martha Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''Bullfight'' and ''A Moment in Love.''         Miss Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. Her ''Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit.         In 1967 Miss Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''Street Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New York.         Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.''         Analyzing her outlook, Miss Sokolow once said: ''I don't have a dim view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''         Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents immigrated  from Russia, and she was born in Hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;  her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the Socialist Party.         The family lived in poverty on the Lower East Side. But like many immigrants, the Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. She continued her training at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years.         Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering humanity, Miss Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving Russians.         She played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940. Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young Mexican choreographers.         Miss Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ''Lyric Suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been danced by Miss Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and several ballet companies.         Miss Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in 1958. Miss Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and choreographer.         In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio.         Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.         Not all her dances were somber. ''Magritte, Magritte'' was based upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''Odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''Poem'' was lyrical. Nevertheless, ''Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode  that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers.         A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Miss Sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''September Sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. Miss Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award.         Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on you. But I love dance more than I love you.''         Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the choreographer Anna Sokolow on Thursday referred incorrectly to her departure from the 1967 rock musical ''Hair.'' She was dismissed before it opened; she did not withdraw.       
         Lucia Dlugoszewski, a composer and the artistic director of the Erick Hawkins Dance Company, was found dead on Tuesday in her Greenwich Village apartment. According to music reference sources she was 68.         She died of natural causes, said Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner.         Ms. Dlugoszewski was a prominent contemporary composer in her own right but also created scores for many signature works by Hawkins, to whom she was married. She assumed direction of his modern-dance company in 1996, two years after his death.         She made her formal debut as a choreographer last year in a program presented by the 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Project, which is sponsoring a program of her choreography performed by the Hawkins company at the 91st Street Playhouse in Manhattan through Sunday afternoon. ''The company will live on, and Erick and Lucy will live on with us,'' Louis Kavouras, a dancer, rehearsal director and company archivist, said yesterday.         Ms. Dlugoszewski was celebrated in New York dance for her unparalleled gift for inspiring intense affection, admiration and exasperation all at once as she exuberantly buttonholed countless company directors, choreographers, dancers and writers to involve them in her own and Hawkins's projects. Beneath that hectic, usually disheveled exterior, however, was a poetic, gutsy composer known for her experimentation with timbre or tonal quality and color, her invention of percussion instruments and the freshness of her musical structures, in works made for the timbre piano and traditional orchestra instruments. She created, Virgil Thomson once said, ''far-out music of great delicacy, originality and beauty of sound.''         Born in Detroit, Ms. Dlugoszewski studied physics at Wayne State University before moving in the late 1940's to New York City, where she studied piano with Grete Sultan, music analysis with Felix Salzer and composition with Varese. Around 1951 she developed the timbre piano, a conventional piano whose strings are struck with beaters and played with a variety of bows and plectra, or pieces of wood, metal and ivory. She later created percussion and friction instruments, constructed by the sculptor Ralph Dorazio, for musicians performing for Hawkins.         Soon after her arrival in New York, she was taken up by painters and poets in the New York School, among them Robert Motherwell, John Ashbery and Ad Reinhardt. Her first concert in New York, in 1957, was sponsored by the artists David Smith and Herman Cherry. Her first reviewer was Frank O'Hara. Recognition from musicians came with the orchestral works she composed in the 1970's.         Her music has been performed by the New York Philharmonic, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the Louisville Orchestra, the Seattle Symphony and the American Composers Orchestra.         Ms. Dlugoszewski was the first woman to win the Koussevitzky International Recording Award, in 1977, and has also been honored by the National Institute of Arts and Letters.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Alice Sheets Marriott, matriarch of the tight-knit family whose name stands on thousands of hotels worldwide, died on Monday in Washington. She was 92.         Beginning in 1927 with a single root beer stand, Mrs. Marriott and her husband, J. Willard Marriott Sr., built one of the world's leading hospitality companies. Today, Marriott International, which is still run by the Marriott family, has more than 140,000 workers and annual sales approaching $10 billion.         Along the way, Mrs. Marriott also raised a family that now numbers two children, eight grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren. She ''personified the American dream,'' Marriott International said in a statement.         Alice Sheets was born in Salt Lake City, on Oct. 19, 1907. In June 1927, while still a teenager, she graduated with honors from the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree in Spanish. Two days later, she married Mr. Marriott, another University of Utah graduate, and the couple set off in a Ford Model T to Washington, where Mr. Marriott had just opened a root beer stand. There she worked as the shop's bookkeeper, taking its hard-earned nickels to the bank each day.         As summer turned to fall, root beer sales slipped, leaving the Marriotts anxious to expand their menu. Mrs. Marriott spoke to the chef of the Mexican Embassy to learn the recipes for tamales and chili con carne. The Marriotts practiced the dishes in their apartment for two days, then added them to the menu at the stand, which they renamed The Hot Shoppe. The spicy dishes were a hit, and the Marriotts quickly opened more Hot Shoppes.         ''Almost from the start, my parents -- especially my father -- launched the process of figuring out how to do something right and then writing it down. From washing windows to burnishing silverware to arranging buffet tables and processing customers' checks, no aspect of the workplace went untouched,'' J. W. Marriott Jr., wrote in his 1997 memoir, ''The Spirit to Serve: Marriott's Way.''         A devotion to detail served the Marriotts well, as the chain thrived, eventually expanding to 65 sites. The Marriott family was also growing -- J. W. Jr. was born in 1932, and Richard followed in 1939.         Then, in 1957, the Marriotts moved into the hotel business, which was taking off in tandem with the interstate highways. Mrs. Marriott spent much of the night before the opening of the first Marriott hotel, the Twin Bridges Motor Hotel in Arlington, Va., helping hang pictures in each of its 365 rooms.         By offering travelers a consistent, dependable and safe night's rest, the Marriott chain quickly surpassed more established competitors. Today, many hotel operators consider Marriott the world's top hotel company, with a reputation for treating employees and customers fairly.         As Marriott grew, Mrs. Marriott spent more time on charity work in the Washington area, including serving two 10-year terms on the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. A conservative Republican, she was vice chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1965 to 1976, and honorary chairman of the 1973 Nixon inaugural committee.       
         Lila Kedrova, the Russian-born actress whose portrayals of an aging French prostitute in screen and stage versions of ''Zorba the Greek'' won her an Academy Award and a Tony, died on Feb. 16 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. She was believed to be around 82.         Her death was announced in The Sault Star on Feb. 17 but was not reported by news agencies.         Although she appeared in scores of films and plays in England, Canada and on the Continent that won her accolades ranging from a French Cesar for the film ''Razzia sur la Chnouf'' (1955), the Evening Standard Award in London for her stage role in ''The Cherry Orchard'' in 1969, a Genie Award (Canada's equivalent of the Oscar) for ''Eliza's Horoscope'' (1970) and a Golden Mask at Taormina in Sicily for the film ''Tell Me a Riddle'' (1980), Ms. Kedrova was best known her for portrayal of Madame Hortense in ''Zorba.''         In the film and Broadway musical adaptations of the 1946 Nikos Kazantzakis novel ''Zorba, the Greek,'' which starred Anthony Quinn, Miss Kedrova won raves as the earthy Zorba's aging, dying mistress.         ''The old woman of Lila Kedrova is brilliantly realized, a wrinkled and tacky relic of a once successful coquette, still hopeful, audacious and courageous,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in his review of the 1964 film in The New York Times.         When she recreated her role on Broadway in 1983, Frank Rich of The Times described Ms. Kedrova's Madame Hortense as ''a small, round, smeary-faced woman out of a Toulouse-Lautrec canvas'' who could bat ''her big, Betty Boop eyes with a schoolgirl's blushing flirtatiousness.''         He said: ''Miss Kedrova may indeed be of a certain age, but we see the young 'cabaret star' she claims to have once been; we also see that the old Hortense is remembering the young Hortense just as we do. No wonder Miss Kedrova shimmers, and no wonder our eyes mist over.''         The role that won Miss Kedrova her Oscar as best supporting actress and her Tony for best featured actress in a musical was first offered by the film's Greek director, Michael Cacoyannis, to Simone Signoret.         But, Miss Kedrova said, after two days on location in Crete, Miss Signoret withdrew, and Mr. Cacoyannis telephoned Ms. Kedrova in Paris to invite her to join his cast.         ''I accepted, but in fact my feelings were ambivalent,'' she told The Times of London some years ago. ''It was a fascinating role, but not perhaps for me. What had I in common with this vulgarian, this whore, 20 years older than myself? Then I thought I must try to understand her heart, enter completely into her mentality and find what is most real and sincere in myself. I found I could do this, but I was quite amazed, quite unprepared to win the Academy Award.''         There was one other problem, Miss Kedrova told Nora Ephron in a profile in The New York Post in 1965. When Mr. Cacoyannis called, he asked if Miss Kedrova spoke English.         ''He asked me the question in French,'' she said. ''And I replied, 'Oui.' It was the biggest lie in my life.''         But remembering the lyrics to a few American songs she had sung and expressions like ''How do you do?'' and ''Thank you,'' she got the part.         Miss Kedrova, who was born in Leningrad into the Kedroffs, a distinguished and well-to-do musical family, fled the aftermath of the Russian Revolution with them and became an emigree in Paris.         A restless child, she was a frequent truant and runaway. ''Once I joined the Gypsies; another time I took a job in a circus pulling a bear on a chain,'' she told The Times of London. ''When I was 12, I fell in love with the theater and knew then what I wanted to do. And though my parents had planned a musical career for me, they allowed me to join a troupe of Russian actors, resident in Paris, who played according to the Stanislavsky method. I was with them for three years.         ''In those days I acted with complete spontaneity, lived my parts almost instinctively, and it was some time before I realized that any talent, however bright, needs guarding and guiding.''         So she studied drama with the actor-director Pierre Valde, who became her first husband.         In the early 1950's she began to achieve critical and popular success onstage in France, where she starred in productions like ''The Rose Tattoo,'' ''A View From the Bridge,'' ''A Taste of Honey'' and ''The Brothers Karamazov.''         Her second husband, Richard Howard, a director whom she married in 1969, said that Miss Kedrova, who had no other immediate survivors, made her last stage appearance in the early 1990's at the Chichester Festival and her last film in 1993. The couple maintained homes in Toronto and Paris as well as Sault Ste. Marie.         Some reference books listed Miss Kedrova's year of birth as 1918, and Mr. Howard pointed out that other, later dates were to be found elsewhere. He said that when her family fled Russia, they left their papers behind. And the false papers they were given in France were confiscated by the Nazis.         ''She liked it that way,'' Mr. Howard said of her agelessness. ''I remember her telling me that it was wonderful because she could choose to be any age she wanted to be, and that she wanted to be 16.''       
         Micheline Glover, who as an 18-year-old girl worked for the French Resistance during World War II, delivering secret messages under the eyes of unwitting German soldiers, died April 15 in White Plains Hospital in White Plains, N.Y. She was 76.         Mrs. Glover, who was born in Paris, received a citation after the war from Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for one of her activities in the Resistance: rescuing Allied airmen shot down by the Nazis.         She recalled in a privately published memoir that she was first drawn to the Resistance -- the clandestine underground that sought to disrupt the German occupation of France -- when at age 16 she joined a student protest march in Paris. German troops fired on the students with machine guns, killing several.         Two years later, after Mrs. Glover had moved with her family to Montlucon, she discovered that her English tutor was in the Resistance, and she asked him whether she could do something ''to help our cause.''         Soon Mrs. Glover became a courier for Pierre Kaan, a philosophy professor who was a major figure in the Resistance. Professor Kaan, who was Jewish, was eventually captured and killed in a Nazi death camp.         Mrs. Glover's first assignments were riding trains throughout the country, carrying secret messages taped to her back. In this work, she seems to have had nerves of steel.         Once, the train in which she was riding came to a sudden halt. She and the other passengers were told to leave the train to have their identification papers checked. Mrs. Glover's papers were found to be unacceptable, and she was instructed to stand aside while other passengers were checked and questioned. She followed orders, but when the passengers with acceptable identification papers were told to return to the train, Mrs. Glover slipped away from her forgetful guard and quietly boarded the train as it pulled out of the station.         On one occasion, she recalled in her memoir, she sat in a cafe filled with German soldiers and passed messages to her contact, sipping a glass of wine.         Another time, in still another cafe filled with enemy soldiers, her contact whispered a desperate request to her to help him repair the package he was carrying. She did his bidding, but not without first discovering that the package contained a deflated rubber raft destined for some secret mission.         A more elaborate and perhaps even more dangerous mission involved photographing the damage sustained by a large tire factory that had been bombed by American aircraft.         She could not afford to be caught prowling a factory that produced strategic war materials, but in the rubble she came upon two American airmen who had been shot down in the attack. Somehow, she would have to spirit them out of the country. She procured a couple of bicycles for the airmen to ride by night, only to discover that neither knew how to ride a bicycle.         ''I was very glad we did not meet any German patrols on our way,'' she wrote.         One of the airmen was later killed; the other escaped.         Mrs. Glover finished the war as an interpreter and was awarded a medal of honor from the French government.         She met her husband, Garlan Glover, at a Red Cross dance in Paris. The couple married and moved to White Plains in 1955. Mrs. Glover then devoted herself to raising a family.         Micheline Blum-Picard was born in Paris, the daughter of a French government official. She attended school in Montlucon.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Glover is survived by a daughter, Christiane, of Ossining, N.Y.; four sons, Derek of Ridgefield, Conn., Brian of White Plains, Renny of Boulder, Colo., and Wayne of North White Plains; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Glover recalled that in her Resistance work, after she received word that Allied forces were about to land on the Normandy coast, she asked to take part in the fighting. Her superiors decided that she could not be allowed to serve as a combat soldier, but rather as a nurse.         Nevertheless, she got her way. Even as a nurse, she was permitted to carry a rifle, a pistol and a hand grenade. She recalled that she fired repeatedly once the landings began, but could not be certain whether she hit anyone.       
         Jane Trahey, one of the most prominent advertising women of the 1960's, who was best known for Blackglama's ''What Becomes a Legend Most?'' campaign, died of cancer Saturday at her home in Kent, Conn. She was 76.         Known as a brilliant copywriter, Ms. Trahey was also credited with catchy slogans for Dynel, Union Carbide's synthetic hair (''It's not fake anything. It's real Dynel.''), Danskin Inc. (''Danskins Are Not Just for Dancing.'') and Echo Scarves (''The Echo of an Interesting Woman.'').         Among her other clients were Elizabeth Arden, Bill Blass, Olivetti typewriters, Hamilton watches, Pauline Trigere fashions and Ebony magazine. She also created public service advertising for the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, for which she served as vice president and member of the board. Ms. Trahey  was named Advertising Woman of the Year in 1969 by the American Advertising Federation.         Ms. Trahey founded Trahey Advertising Inc. in New York in 1960. The name was changed in 1966 to Trahey/Wolf after she formed a partnership with Henry Wolf, the photographer and art director. After Mr. Wolf left in the early 1970's to open his own production company,  Ms. Trahey then took as a partner Peter Rogers, who had been working for her as an account executive and de facto office manager.         She and Mr. Rogers worked together on the Blackglama ads starting in 1968. The ads in the early years featured celebrities like Barbra Streisand, Lauren Bacall and Maria Callas swathed in mink, with the catch phrase ''What becomes a legend most?'' The celebrities were considered so glamorous that they were never identified by name. The ads continued to be produced by Mr. Rogers after Ms. Trahey gave up the agency business in the mid-1970's. The last ad, featuring Tommy Tune, ran in 1996, making it one of Madison Avenue's longest-running campaigns.         Ms. Trahey was too creative to worry about the details of running a business, recalled Rocky Piliero, who worked as production manager of her agency starting in 1969 and is still working with Mr. Rogers. ''It was a very informal company, like a playground,'' Mr. Piliero said yesterday. ''Ms. Trahey didn't like accounts. She liked projects. She liked to do something new. She'd be gung-ho for six months, then get bored.''         To keep her fertile mind active, Ms. Trahey also gave lectures to professional women's organizations and wrote scores of magazine articles, novels, humorous pamphlets, a play and a self-help book called ''Jane Trahey on Women & Power: Who's Got It. How to Get It.''         Her play, ''Ring Round the Bathtub,'' which was produced on Broadway in 1972 and starred Elizabeth Ashley, was a sentimental look at an American family in Chicago, her hometown, during the Depression. She also wrote of her youthful experiences in ''Life With Mother Superior,'' a novel that was made into a film called ''The Trouble with Angels'' starring Rosalind Russell and Hayley Mills.         Her other books included ''Thursdays Till Nine,'' a humorous novel about a fictional Texas department store inspired by an early job at Neiman Marcus, and ''Pecked to Death by Goslings,'' based on her experiences converting a Connecticut barn into a home.         She called the converted barn Versailles, she said in a 1964 article in The New York Times, ''not because it looks like it, but because it costs as much.'' She later sold that house.         Ms. Trahey's first job was at The Chicago Tribune in the clippings library, known as the morgue. ''My mother never got over it,'' Ms. Trahey recalled years later. ''Every time she would call and someone would answer ''the morgue'' she'd cross herself and hang up.''         Her entry into advertising came at the Carson Pirie Scott department store in Chicago. In 1947 she went to Dallas as advertising director of Neiman Marcus, rising to become sales promotion director before leaving for New York to start her own agency.         After leaving the agency in the 1970's, she divided her time for many years between Chicago and New York, working as a consultant, before settling in Connecticut two years ago with Jacqueline Babbin, a friend for 40 years. But wherever she lived, Ms. Trahey never stopped writing or lecturing and could occasionally be cajoled into taking on a challenging project, as she did in 1981 for Joe Famolare, who had been making thick-soled shoes and fashionable clogs since 1970. When fashions changed, Mr. Famolare called on Ms. Trahey, who put his picture in the ads and turned him into a celebrity.         Ms. Trahey is survived by her sister, Anita Richter, and a niece, Kristina Richter Becker, both of Englewood, N.J.       
         Sister Mary Geraldine Tobia, a longtime co-director of the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park, a social service agency serving people in that section of Brooklyn, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 59 and lived at the center, which is at 345 43rd Street in Sunset Park.         The cause was cancer, said Jennifer Howse, a friend who headed the center's advisory board for the last 10 years.         Sister Mary Geraldine, who was a Sister of the Good Shepherd, and Sister Mary Paul Janchill were the co-founders of the center in 1978.         It provides comprehensive neighborhood services to children, young people and families in Sunset Park, a generally poor, largely immigrant neighborhood. Most of the people who live there are Hispanic, and part of the neighborhood has been mostly peopled by Chinese immigrants over the last seven or eight years.         In an interview in 1993, Sister Mary Geraldine said, ''We are more like the old settlement house than we are anything else.''         By that time the center's services, besides family counseling, had come to include child care, a food bank, job placement, a sports league, centers for teenagers, even a thrift shop.         ''She treated everybody she worked with as a family member, and that became the model for the Center for Family Life, and in fact became a model for similar institutions across the country,'' said David Saltzman, executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation, which fights poverty in New York City and worked with Sister Mary Geraldine for the last 12 years.         Bishop Joseph M. Sullivan, auxiliary Roman Catholic bishop of Brooklyn for human services, said Sister Mary Geraldine ''was a woman of extraordinary energy and very upbeat mentality and believed in hands-on dealing with community problems and issues.''         He added: ''''She believed most of the solutions should be fashioned within the communities where the kids lived. There was never a day that I recall, in observing her, where she was down. She always thought there was a solution to every problem, there was a way of dealing with reality that could really turn the thing around.''         From the time of the center's founding until Sister Mary Geraldine's death, she and Sister Mary Paul were its co-directors, with equal authority in administering it.         Sister Mary Geraldine was the center's project director, in charge of its afterschool and evening programs for children, in two elementary schools and a middle school in Sunset Park.         Sister Mary Geraldine also supervised many of the center's other operations and its administrative and maintenance staffs.         For her part, Sister Mary Paul has been the center's clinical director, overseeing clinical social workers in their work within the neighborhood.         Despite Sister Mary Geraldine's death, the center's various operations are to be continued as they have been for 22 years. Its financing comes from government sources and from private charitable organizations like the Robin Hood Foundation.         The honors she received include an Ecumenical Woman of the Year award in 1978 from the Brooklyn Division of the Council of Churches of the City of New York and a Robin Hood Foundation Heroes Award in 1991.         Sister Mary Geraldine was born and raised in Newark, and received a bachelor's degree, magna cum laude, in 1967 from Fordham, a master's degree in 1976 from the family and community relations department of Teachers College at Columbia, and a master's degree in 1985 from Columbia's School of Social Work.         Surviving are her mother, Bridget Cappozzi Tobia of Newark, and numerous cousins.       
         Ulla Isaksson, who wrote screenplays for two Ingmar Bergman films and novels about women's issues, died on April 20 in Stockholm after a long illness. She was 83.         In 1958 Mr. Bergman directed ''Brink of Life,'' which Ms. Isaksson (pronounced EE-sack-sohn) adapted  from one of her short stories. Two years later they collaborated again on ''The Virgin Spring,'' which was inspired by a 13th-century ballad about a deeply religious farming family whose young daughter is raped and murdered. The film, which starred Max von Sydow, Gunnel Lindblom and Brigitta Pettersson, received an Academy Award as best foreign film in 1960.         ''Brink of Life,'' which starred Eva Dahlbeck, Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Andersson, Erland Josephson and Mr. von Sydow, is set in a maternity ward and chronicles the psychological and physical traumas of several women during childbirth.         ''It is to the credit of the director and the scenarist that the drama, like life itself, does not come up with neatly contrived answers to all the problems posed,'' wrote A. H. Weiler in The New York Times when the film was introduced to American audiences in 1959. The film received acting and directing awards at the Cannes International Film Festival.         Ms. Isaksson's novels include ''The Tree,'' ''Paradise Square,'' ''The Birthday'' and ''The Women's House.''         ''She was not an aesthetic writer,'' said Per Westberg, a member of the Swedish Academy who had known Ms. Isaksson for 45 years. ''She pondered great problems -- between good and evil, between men and women. She was a true moralist.''         With her husband, Erik Hjalmar Linder, a critic, author and literary historian, Ms. Isaksson wrote what is widely considered to be the definitive biography of Elin Wagner, one of Sweden's earliest and foremost feminist novelists, who died in 1949.         When Mr. Linder was stricken with Alzheimer's disease, Ms. Isaksson wrote ''The Book About E,'' a memoir about caring for him. Her husband died in 1994.         Ulla Margareta Lundberg was born on June 12, 1916, in Stockholm.  According to Mr. Westberg, she grew up in a very religious household.         ''Her early writing is trying to break loose from it but still keep some of the moral vigor,'' he said. ''That early work is about women who are trying to emancipate themselves. Today it sounds very banal, because so many books have been written on that subject. But she was a role model for the next generation of women writers.''         Ms. Isaksson is survived by two sons from a previous marriage, Hans Isaksson and Gunnar Isaksson; a sister, Kerstin M. Lundberg; and five grandchildren, all of Stockholm.       
         Evelyn Graham Irons, a war correspondent who had a romance with the Bloomsbury novelist and poet Vita Sackville-West, died April 3 at her home in Brewster, N.Y. She was two months short of her 100th birthday.         Ms. Irons was a 30-year-old editor of the women's page of The Daily Mail in London when she met Sackville-West in 1931. She had gone to interview the 38-year-old writer at her home, Sissinghurst Castle, renowned for its famous gardens, which Sackville-West spent much of her life designing and tending.         The romance was tangled. Sackville-West had already begun her enduring relationship with Violet Trefusis, the daughter of Alice Keppel, Edward VII's mistress. And Ms. Irons was romantically involved at the time with Olive Rinder, who soon also fell in love with Sackville-West.         Victoria Glendenning wrote in her 1983 biography, ''Vita: The Life of Vita Sackville-West,'' that by January 1932, the three women were in a menage a trois that ended later that year when Ms. Irons met and fell in love with another woman, Joy McSweeney. Ms. McSweeney remained her companion until she died in the 1980's.         The love poems dated 1931 in Vita Sackville-West's ''Collected Poems'' are addressed to Ms. Irons, although Ms. Glendenning notes that ''the more erotic ones'' were never published. Ms. Irons and Sackville-West remained close friends and corresponded warmly until Sackville-West's death in 1962.         Evelyn Irons was born in Glasgow on June 17, 1900. After graduating from Somerville College, Oxford, she began working as a journalist for The Daily Mail, then The Evening Standard. At the outbreak of World War II, The Standard made her a war correspondent. Suspecting that British commanders would not welcome a woman at their headquarters, she accredited herself to the First French Army and crossed the Rhine with Charles de Gaulle and accompanied French troops through Germany and Austria.         She is believed to be the first female war correspondent to reach Hitler's retreat at Berchtesgaden and was the first to win the Croix de Guerre.         Ms. Irons moved to New York in 1952. In 1954, she rode into Guatemala on a mule during a revolution there, getting to the action and filing her dispatches well ahead of her colleagues. She became the New York bureau chief for The Sunday Times of London at the end of the 1950's.         No immediate family members survive her.       
         Margo Kaufman, a humorist, writer and radio commentator with a keen instinct for the comedic possibilities in the mundane, died on Friday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 46.         The cause was breast cancer, her husband, Eric Mankin, said.         In her writings for such publications as The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and Cosmopolitan magazine, Ms. Kaufman established her gift for homing in on the hilarity -- and sometimes pathos -- in everyday life. She regaled readers with accounts of traveling with her family, tedious home renovations and her beloved pug dogs or, after her cancer was diagnosed in 1989, with details of her illness and its often painful treatment.         Piping and sardonic, her distinctive voice was familiar to radio listeners in Los Angeles, where she was a regular commentator on KABC, and nationally, with frequent appearances on National Public Radio's ''Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me.''         She eventually elaborated upon the essays in three books, ''1-800-Am-I-Nuts?,'' ''This Damn House!: My Subcontract with America'' and ''Clara, the Early Years: The Story of the Pug Who Ruled My Life.''         A graduate of Northwestern University, Ms. Kaufman began her career as a columnist for City Paper, an alternative weekly in her native Baltimore, and continued writing after she moved to Los Angeles, first at the LA Weekly and then for national publications.         An aficionado of pug dogs, which she regarded as ''living proof that God has a sense of humor,'' Ms. Kaufman proudly carried a business card identifying herself as a Hollywood correspondent for Pug Talk magazine.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her son, Nicholas; her father, Allan Pearlstein of Boca Raton, Fla.; her mother, Gloria Asnes of New York; a sister, Laurie Goldberg of Atlanta; a brother, Robert Pearlstein of Baltimore; and a grandmother, Flora Pearlstein of Baltimore.         ''You just can't get through life without a sense of humor these days,'' Ms. Kaufman told an audience in 1993, a year after learning that her cancer had spread. ''The most awful things can be really funny. You have to be able to laugh or it gets too depressing.''       
         Dr. Ruth Erica Benesch, a biochemist and educator who teamed with her husband at Columbia University to advance the knowledge of how the body's red blood cells function, died on March 25 at her home in the Bronx. She was 75.         The cause was vascular disease, her family said.         She and her husband, Dr. Reinhold Benesch, shared a laboratory at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and studied the mechanisms by which hemoglobin transports oxygen to living tissues. In 1966, they discovered that one particular phosphorous compound, called 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, had an important role in loosening the bonds between hemoglobin and oxygen.         Max F. Perutz, the British biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1962, wrote that the discovery by the Benesches in 1966 ''opened a new era'' of knowledge about the respiratory system. Their work, he said, generated a ''flood of papers'' from scientists around the world and made Mrs. Benesch one of the most-cited women in science in the 1970's.         The couple were professors of biochemistry at Columbia. He died in 1987; she became an emeritus professor of biochemistry in 1995.         Born Ruth Erica Baade in Paris, she was raised in Berlin. In 1939, she  escaped a few months before the war in Europe, taken out by the a Kindertransport program, which rescued Jewish children from Germany. She graduated in 1946 from the University of London, came to the United States the following year and received a Ph.D. in biochemistry at Northwestern University in 1951.         She was affiliated with Johns Hopkins University, the State University of Iowa and the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Mass., before she joined the staff at Columbia as a research associate in 1960. She was named an associate professor in 1972 and a full professor in 1980.         Dr. Benesch is survived by a son, Andrew, of Highland Park, N.J.; a daughter, Susan, of Milford, Conn.; a sister, Madeleine, of London; and two granddaughters.         Correction:  April 15, 2000, Saturday  An obituary on April 4 about Dr. Ruth Erica Benesch, a Columbia University biochemist, misstated her maiden name and the year of the death of her husband and collaborator, Dr. Reinhold Benesch. Her maiden name was Leroi, not Baade. Her husband died in 1986, not 1987.       
         Dina Abramowicz, the longtime librarian at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research whose firsthand and encyclopedic knowledge of the lost Yiddish world of Eastern Europe made her a treasured resource for hundreds of scholars and writers for more than half a century, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.         She was 90 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Abramowicz had a formidable memory, and not only for those who peopled her cherished birthplace, Vilna, Lithuania, the great center of Yiddish culture now known as Vilnius, where the YIVO collection originated.         Her mind was a mental card catalog for hundreds of rare and obscure books and historical materials in the dusty YIVO stacks. And she hunted them down for scholars like Irving Howe and novelists like Leon Uris as well as for thousands of ordinary people trying to research their family histories.         When George F. Kennan, the diplomat and historian, was looking for material one day on a 19th century convert to Christianity, she led him not only to the entry in the library's precious Russian-Jewish encyclopedia but also to a scarce book in Yiddish about Jewish apostates.         ''This is the sort of book that Dina knew off the top of her head,'' said Zachary Baker, who succeeded Ms. Abramowicz as YIVO's head librarian and now is curator of Judaica at Stanford University's library.         Her friend Esther Hautzig, a Manhattan book editor and writer who grew up in Vilna, said of her, ''No computer on earth can store the information she had in her brain because she lived through it.'' She remembers Ms. Abramowicz as the librarian who provided her with her first library card.         Almost daily, Ms. Abramowicz received inquiries from journalists and writers who liked to season their prose with a word or two of Yiddish. They relied on Ms. Abramowicz as their authority for the transliterated spelling of words like bobe (grandmother) and yichus (pedigree).         Though less than five feet tall and dainty in an Old World way, Ms. Abramowicz could be flintlike in her insistence upon historical and linguistic accuracy. When a letter to The New York Times stated that the word ''Holocaust'' was first used in the Dec. 24, 1942, daily bulletin of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, she made sure to write a corrective letter. The agency's bulletin, she pointed out, used a term translatable as atrocities, not Holocaust, and the probable first use of Holocaust to refer to the mass slaughter of Jews was from the May 14, 1943, Polish daily Nowy Dzien, which used the Polish word for holocaust, calopalenie, to describe the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto.         Her life, sorrowful as parts of it were, had a striking symmetry, from Vilna to the New York home of the archives rescued from Vilna.         Vilna was fiercely loved by its Jewish inhabitants as the ''Jerusalem of Lithuania,'' a city of writers like Chaim Grade and Abraham Sutzkever. Ms. Abramowicz was the librarian first of Vilna's Jewish children's library and then, after the Nazis herded Jews into ghettos, of the ghetto library. When she came to New York in 1946, she soon went to work for the transplanted version of one of Vilna's most important institutions, the YIVO library, many of whose thousands of books and artifacts had been smuggled out by a ragtag band of slave laborers and partisans known as the paper brigade.         She was YIVO's head librarian for 25 years, until 1987; then in her late 70's, she was eased off to work as research librarian, a position she held until her death.         The daughter of teachers, Ms. Abramowicz was born in 1909, when Vilna was part of the czar's empire; it was to live under Polish, Lithuanian, German and Soviet Russian governments before she left. She grew up speaking Russian, but when the Germans occupied Vilna during World War I, they allowed Jews to start their own schools, as part of a divide-and-conquer strategy, and Dina's parents sent her to Yiddish-language elementary and high schools.         After studying Polish literature in university, she went to work for her first library, the Kinderbibliotek. She also became a member of YIVO, the  acronym for the Yiddish name of the Yiddish Scientific Institute, an organization founded in 1925. It soon became a repository of manuscripts of Sholem Aleichem and Biaklik, records of Jewish communal governments and other historical documents as well as thousands of books.         When the Germans invaded in World War II and crammed Vilna's 56,000 Jews into neighborhood ghettos, Herman Kruk, a librarian, tried to maintain an oasis of normality in the madness by setting up a library, and he asked Ms. Abramowicz to staff it.         ''How can we think of a library under these conditions, and who will come to read books there?'' she remembered asking a fellow librarian.         ''Since there was nothing one could do about this absurd situation, what was the use of talking and wondering?'' was the answer she remembered getting.         In its first year, the library circulated 100,000 books to its starving, brutalized readers, mostly, it turned out, escapist fiction.         In September 1943, the ghetto was liquidated. Ms. Abramowicz's mother was dispatched to Treblinka, where she was killed; Ms. Abramowicz to a labor camp. By a stroke of fortune, the door on the cattle train opened on the Vilna platform and she simply walked off. She wound up in a less rigorous camp, one for workers who processed fur for the German army's winter coats. She escaped into the woods and joined Jewish resistance fighters as a nurse's helper.         After the war, she found her father in New York, where he had traveled just before the war broke out in September 1939. She soon met Max Weinreich, a surviving YIVO founder, and joined him in reconstituting the YIVO collection in New York.         Beyond helping scholars who visited the Vanderbilt mansion that for years housed YIVO and its new home on West 16th Street, Ms. Abramowicz seemed to take on the search for roots as a personal compulsion.         ''At certain periods of your life, you start to want to find out what happened to your parents,'' she said once. ''I think it is the survival instinct of a people trying to find out who they are.''         Other than two nephews and a niece, Ms. Abramowicz left no survivors. But her name endures in dozens of acknowledgments by the authors whose research she shepherded. In his tribute in ''The World of Our Fathers,'' the classic work about the immigrant Jews of New York,  Mr. Howe thanked YIVO for making the book possible, ''especially its indefatigable and splendid librarian, Dina Abramowicz.''       
         Claire Trevor, an Academy Award-winning actress who epitomized cynical but warm-hearted careerists -- reporters, gun molls, saloon entertainers and trollops -- died Saturday at a hospital near her home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 91 and had suffered from respiratory ailments in recent months, said Richard Elbaum, a spokesman for the family.         A Brooklyn native who became enamored of stage acting and found her way into the movies during Hollywood's golden age, Miss Trevor appeared in nearly 70 films, working under legendary directors like John Huston and John Ford and playing alongside such famous leading men as John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart.         She played the former girlfriend of a gangster (Humphrey Bogart) who becomes a burned-out streetwalker in ''Dead End'' (1937) and a freewheeling woman forced out of town by bluenoses in the classic version of ''Stagecoach'' (1939). She was the alcoholic mistress of a mobster played by Edward G. Robinson in ''Key Largo'' (1948) and a spunky jet passenger in ''The High and the Mighty'' (1954).         She may be best remembered for ''Key Largo,'' for which she won the Oscar for best supporting actress playing the part of Gaye Dawn, a has-been cabaret singer who, in one emotionally charged scene, is forced by her sadistic lover to sing ''Moanin' Low'' in return for a drink. Feebly, she manages to sob through the song, but Mr. Robinson's character denies her because, he says, her singing was ''rotten.''         Miss Trevor also received Academy Award nominations for ''The High and the Mighty'' and ''Dead End.''         The blond, smoky-voiced Miss Trevor was a dedicated performer who repeatedly breathed fresh life into her films, many of which sorely needed her grace and gumption. Early on she became a ''queen of the B's,'' the low-budget action movies that rounded off double bills. But she got plenty of ''A'' roles, making the most of them.         In other key roles, she was a faithless lover in ''The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse'' (1938), a conspiratorial killer in ''Murder, My Sweet'' (1945), a vitriolic Broadway actress in ''The Velvet Touch'' (1948), an overprotective mother in ''Marjorie Morningstar'' (1958) and a scornful shrew in two melodramas, ''Two Weeks in Another Town'' (1962) and ''How to Murder Your Wife'' (1965).         The modest Miss Trevor was one of the few actresses whose seemingly effortless talent made most viewers take her for granted, while film buffs cherished her. Looking back, she concluded that she never became a top star because she lacked the drive that energizes them. ''I didn't know,'' she said, ''that to make a real career in Hollywood you have to become a 'personality,' have to cultivate publicity departments and become known as 'The Ear' or even 'The Toe.' ''         On television, she won an Emmy award in an acclaimed 1956 revival of ''Dodsworth,'' with Fredric March in the title role. She artfully portrayed his vain wife, who consorts with shallow lovers in a futile battle against age. Miss Trevor said she enjoyed working for television because it provided her with a wider, more sympathetic range of roles. But she said she never wanted to sacrifice personal happiness for her career. ''As for a TV series, never,'' she said, ''Life's too short and, frankly, I'm not terribly ambitious.''         Claire Trevor was born Claire Wemlinger on March 8, 1909, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, the only child of Noel and Betty Wemlinger. (Mr. Elbaum said Miss Trevor's stepson, Donald Bren, said she was born in 1910; many reference works list her birth in 1909.) Her father was a Fifth Avenue merchant tailor who soon moved the family to Larchmont in Westchester County. After her graduation from high school, Miss Trevor took art courses for six months at Columbia University before studying for six more months at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She began honing her craft in repertory theater in Michigan, St. Louis and Long Island and through shorts filmed in Brooklyn.         These appearances led to starring roles in two Broadway plays, ''Whistling in the Dark,'' a hit, and ''The Party's Over,'' a flop. The Fox movie company had noticed her, however, and offered a five-year contract. Although she wanted to stay in the theater, she had no immediate stage prospects and accepted Fox's offer, arriving in Hollywood in 1933.         She then made 14 Fox quickies over four years. Most were action-adventure pictures dominated by the leading men, but she won wide praise for playing several hard-bitten newspaper reporters. ''I worked like a demon, and I knew it was a job,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1995. ''Saturday night, you never could plan on going out to dinner because we'd break for dinner for one hour and work till 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the morning.''         Spencer Tracy was the early co-star she admired most, and she said she quickly began imitating ''the clever way he throws away a line.'' Another favorite leading man was Mr. Robinson, with whom she appeared in ''Big Town,'' a popular radio series, from 1937 to 1940. He played Steve Wilson, editor of the mythical Illustrated Press, and she was Lorelei Kilbourne, his ace reporter and foil.         Her longtime wish to return to Broadway materialized in 1947, when she and Philip Dorn co-starred in a comedy, ''The Big Two.'' The consensus of critics was that they gave the play much more artistry and vitality than it deserved. It closed after 21 performances.         Her private life was far different from the lives of the sassy characters she played. She was married to Clark Andrews, director of her radio show, from 1938 to 1942, when they divorced. In 1943 she married Cylos Dunsmoore, a Navy lieutenant. The marriage produced a son, Charles, but ended in divorce in 1947.         Her third marriage, to Milton Bren, a film producer, lasted from 1948 until his death in 1979 of a brain tumor. Mr. Bren had two sons from a previous marriage, later prompting Miss Trevor to recall fondly that they had ''an instant family.'' In 1978 Miss Trevor lost her son, Charles, in an airliner disaster.         The losses of her son and husband in the span of a year left her devastated, and she moved to New York, settling into a Fifth Avenue apartment and embarking on a busy social schedule. She also occasionally returned to acting, in her last role playing an aging schoolteacher in the 1987 television movie ''Norman Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties.''         Miss Trevor would later return to California, where she was also known as a generous philanthropist.         She is survived by her stepsons, Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Company, a real estate investment firm in Newport Beach, and Peter Bren, president of Koll-Bren-Schreiber, a real estate investment firm in New York.       
         Judge Kathryn A. McDonald, who as administrator of the family court system of New York City was a champion of children's rights, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 82 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her  daughter, K. Ann McDonald.         Judge McDonald, a graduate of Columbia's law school, was named the administrative judge for the five New York City Family Court complexes in 1986. She had the title of administrative judge of the Family Court of New York City and retired from the post in 1995.         During her tenure, she tried to improve the courts despite an explosion in the number of cases, budget cuts and crumbling facilities. The courts faced other new problems in the 90's, as well. In 1995, with difficult custody decisions being complicated by AIDS, and by relatives who had taken in the children, grown to love them and become unwilling to give them up without a fight, Judge McDonald said: ''A lot of the custody cases in the last few years have been families fighting each other. It's an in-house thing. It's an awkward thing.''         In 1987, she said that largely because of drug addiction, more and more of the Family Court cases involved abused or neglected children, who had flooded the court system and in turn had overburdened the foster care system.         After receiving her law degree in 1963, she became a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society's juvenile rights division and then attorney-in-charge of Legal Aid's Manhattan office. In 1976, she became a Family Court judge. She was briefly supervising judge of the Family Court in New York County before becoming the administrative judge.         Before entering law school in 1960, she worked in personnel and labor relations for 20 years. But one afternoon, she and a friend watched proceedings in Family Court at time when poor children were not given assigned counsel. Recalling that experience in an interview in 1986, she said: ''The rich kids all had lawyers, and the poor kids had nobody. I decided that I wanted to become a lawyer and represent children.''         While she was the administrative judge, she also headed the New York Judicial Committee on Women in the Courts, which was established after a two-year study had found that ''gender bias against women litigants, attorneys and court employees is a pervasive problem.''         In that post she carried out recommendations intended to rid the state courts of sex bias.         With her in charge, the committee reported in 1987 that sensitivity training for judges and other programs had helped reduce such bias.         Kathryn Austin was born in Albany, grew up in Long Lake, N.Y., and received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from Cornell. She was married for six decades to Robert J. McDonald, who was a tax lawyer with the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell. He died last year.         Besides her daughter, K. Ann McDonald of Manhattan, a litigation lawyer with the Manhattan law firm of Robinson Murphy & McDonald, Judge McDonald is survived by a brother, Malcolm Patrick Austin of Chicago.       
         Barbara Cartland, whose outpouring of more than 700 romance novels during seven decades made her the undisputed queen of a genre for hundreds of millions of readers the world over, died yesterday at her home near Hatfield in Hertfordshire, England. She was 98.         Throughout her professional life, Dame Barbara possessed a most uncommon ability: she was able to turn out 50,000-word novels at the rate of two a month. During the 1980's, when she was hardly young, she routinely produced 23 titles a year. With all of it she still managed to live the good life in Camfield Place, her gracious 400-acre estate in Hertfordshire,  with Twi-Twi, her Pekingese, and with her white Rolls-Royce ever at the ready, a pink mohair rug neatly folded in the back seat, there to keep guests comfortable when they were driven to her home from the station.         And although her name may not have been taken seriously by the more serious students of comparative literature or by the subscribers to literary supplements, about one billion copies of her 723 books were printed and sold in 36 languages.  Bantam and Jove Publications were among her several American publishers.         She has appeared in The Guinness Book of Records as the world's best-selling author, breaking records for 18 years.         In a century in which so many writers struggled against censorship laws for the right to describe a variety of sexual activities in explicit terms, Dame Barbara's prose remained dedicated to an unlikely celebration of the adventures of passionate virgins.         ''People don't roll around naked in my books,'' she said in an interview in 1987. ''I do allow them to go to bed if they're married, but it's all very wonderful and the moon beams.''         It was the way to sustain an approach to fiction writing that remained essentially unchanged from the early 1920's to the end of her days. She was totally convinced of its appropriateness. When it was suggested that she could be a tad more risque, she replied, ''You can't get more naked than naked, can you, and then where do you go from there?''         Her virgin heroines were typically fresh as April's peach blossoms. They were always wide-eyed, idealistic and impecunious, as demure as they were determined to struggle against all manner of vicissitudes in their quest to find Mr. Right.         He, in turn, was invariably a dark, square-jawed chap, perhaps with bulging biceps, incessantly given to splendid thoughts despite his worldliness. He was furthermore possessed of that indefinable magnetism that seems to surround men who have an enormous bankroll, a title and all the connections needed to keep good women out of harm's way forever.         Dame Barbara never asked anything of her heroines that she didn't ask of herself. Although twice married and the mother of three, she did not really like being kissed or touched, wrote a biographer with whom she cooperated, Gwen Robyns. ''It was part of the strange complex which meant she was a virgin not only physically but also mentally and spiritually,'' Ms. Robyns wrote in 1985.         The process by which a man and a woman found each other usually occurred in Regency, Victorian or Georgian times, and before they got to live happily ever after, her characters said things like, ''Oh, Miss, there is evil in this house,'' or, ''My son will never marry; I am his life.''         Her narrative style provided ample cement for such dialogue.         ''All she knew was that she was close against him and he was kissing her wildly, passionately, demandingly and the world stood still,'' she wrote in ''Fire in the Blood,'' published in 1983. ''He kissed her until he carried her as he had before up the peak of Olympus, and they were no longer human but one with the gods.'' Even with stuff as racy as this, readers came away thinking that her heroines remained as untouched as they had been in Chapter 1.         ''My heroines are always virgins,'' the writer said in 1973. ''They never go to bed without a ring on their fingers; not until page 118 at least.'' She also asserted that her notion of a truly sexy man was one who was ''fully clothed and preferably in uniform.''         People who watched Dame Barbara in action were not sure how she produced so much work. She wrote so quickly that even her fans were not always in agreement as to how many titles she had produced at any given time. Since mere typewriters could never keep up with her, she neatly avoided them and dictated her fiction to awestruck assistants who wrote furiously, backed up by tape recorders.         She was frequently able to dictate 7,000 words in an afternoon session, which usually lasted a few hours. She held forth from a sofa, a hot water bottle at her feet, her dog cuddled next to her, asleep. Her secretaries were not permitted to sneeze or cough while she dictated.         Perhaps in part because of her approach to dictating, her prose offers a prodigious number of one-sentence paragraphs, closer in its look to wire-service journalism than to the pages of Faulkner or Fitzgerald. In addition to her books she wrote some 30 plays. Asked why she wrote so much, she replied, ''I wanted the money.'' On other occasions, however, she denounced society's materialism, if not her own.         Barbara Hamilton Cartland was born in Warwickshire County, England, on July 9, 1901, the daughter of Bertram Cartland and Nancy H. Scobell Cartland, who was better known as Polly. Mr. Cartland was handsome and charming and came from a prominent family. But he could never have been the prototype for the novels his daughter would write. He was not a very good provider, and when his father's fortune was lost, forcing the family members to sell their house, it was Polly Cartland who led them into a home far less commodious than the one they had lost. The new one she rented offered only six bedrooms, a tennis court, stables and a garden that nobody had tended lately.         ''Poor I may be, but common I am not,'' Polly said, sounding not unlike the heroines her daughter would later create. The Cartlands made do, and young Barbara and her two brothers spent their formative years this way, learning to play tiddlywinks and other games. By the time she was 19, Dame Barbara said, she had rejected four proposals of marriage.         After she completed finishing school, she turned to writing and produced her first novel, ''Jigsaw,'' in 1922 when she was 21. It did not get good reviews -- one critic called it a ''modern feverish novel of the amateur'' -- but it went into six editions and was translated into five languages.         She married Alexander McCorquodale in 1927. He was a rich Scotsman widely known as an accomplished salmon fisherman. They were divorced five years later, and although she said she did not like the McCorquodale family much, she married Hugh McCorquodale, Alexander's cousin, in 1936. This marriage lasted until Hugh's death in 1963.         In addition to her writing, Dame Barbara found time to support many charities, promote aviation and work to improve the plight of pensioners and the acceptance of Gypsies in England. She was also credited with popularizing a swimming pool on the roof of the Hotel Piccadilly in London. She tried her hand at designing wallpaper and lent her name to a perfume. The perfume venture was unsuccessful, she said, because the perfume was not expensive enough.         In 1950 she moved into Camfield Place, a palace built in 1867, in which Beatrix Potter wrote ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' at the turn of the century. In 1991 she was made a Dame of the British Empire. She said she was sure the honor was not for her contributions to literature but for her efforts of behalf of charities and the Gypsies.         Dame Barbara is survived by a daughter, Raine, Countess Spencer, who was the stepmother of Diana, Princess of Wales; and two sons, Ian and Hugh McCorquodale.         Dame Barbara was steadfast in her belief in vitamins -- at one point she took 78 a day -- and in yoga, clairvoyance, fruit sugar, ginseng, garlic and honey. She wrote so convincingly that honey was an aphrodisiac in ''The Magic of Honey,'' published in 1970, that a temporary shortage was created in Britain.         She had no use for smoking, white bread, white sugar and most forms of alcohol, but she drank brandy when she visited New York in 1981 because, she said, she could taste chlorine in the water.       
         Penelope Fitzgerald, who began a prize-winning literary career late in life with a series of understated novels written in lilting prose, died on Friday in Highgate, London. She was 83 and lived in London.         Ms. Fitzgerald was the author of the 1995 novel ''The Blue Flower'' about the German poet Novalis and his hapless love for a 12-year-old girl. The book won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1998, defeating works by authors Philip Roth and Don DeLillo.         The writer A. S. Byatt once called Ms. Fitzgerald ''Jane Austen's nearest heir, for precision and invention.'' Ms. Fitzgerald published her first novel, a mystery, ''The Golden Child,'' in 1977, when she was 60. The book was written to entertain her dying husband, Desmond Fitzgerald. But despite her late start, Ms. Fitzgerald wrote 13 books, including biographies. They were leavened with a forgiving humor and gentle flashes of illumination. She won England's  Booker Prize for ''Offshore'' in 1979.         Her books were short, usually around 200 pages, and comprised of brief, pointed scenes. For her early books, she drew on her own life. There was her experience working in a bookshop and living in an abandoned warehouse in Suffolk, recounted in ''The Bookshop'' in 1978. That novel was short-listed for the Booker Prize. Then came her story of trying to survive as a young mother on a houseboat on the Thames in ''Offshore.'' In ''Human Voices'' (1980) she used material from her job at the BBC during World War II. ''At Freddie's,'' 1982, was based on her job teaching child actors.         Ms. Fitzgerald's characters were people fallen into difficult circumstances, struggling to cope. She once called them ''exterminatees,'' which she defined as ''likely to be stamped out with other things unlikely to succeed.'' Yet there was a deep sympathy, an underlying moral vision in her work. She did not write religious books, but she once described herself as religious.         Everything in Ms. Fitzgerald's background ordained her for an intellectual career, and yet for much of her adult life she was beleaguered, coping with a husband who drank and had difficulty keeping a job, and raising three children. She was born in 1916. Both her grandfathers were Anglican bishops. Her father, Edmund Valpy Knox, was the editor of Punch. One uncle, Ronald, was a Catholic convert, a Monsignor and a  spokesman for the church. Another uncle, Dillwyn, was a Greek scholar and cryptographer who helped break German codes in World War I and II. A third uncle, Wilfred, became an Anglo-Catholic priest. It was a deeply competitive family, with Ms. Fitzgerald, her brother, Rawle, who became a foreign correspondent, and their uncles vying at the dinner table at literary games. She later wrote a biography of her father and his brothers, ''The Knox Brothers,'' published in 1977. Ms. Fitzgerald's mother, Christina, was one of the first female students at Somerville College, Oxford. Penelope was sent to boarding school at the age of 7, an experience that devastated her.  Then, when she was 18 and about to go to Somerville herself, her mother died.         At Somerville, she studied with J. R. R. Tolkien and graduated with honors in 1938. She married Desmond Fitzgerald, a major in the Irish Guards. He had been trained as a barrister, but became a travel agent.  Ms. Fitzgerald once told an interviewer that her husband ''didn't have much luck in life.'' She supplemented the family income by working at various jobs, including in the Ministry of Food. With her husband, she was editor of ''The World Review,'' a small literary journal. The family moved often and ended up living on a dilapidated houseboat in London. In 1963 it sank for the second time. ''A lot of people would have gone down, too,'' Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria told a writer for The New York Times magazine last year. ''My dad was drinking a lot then.  Somehow, my mum pulled herself together.'' The family moved to public housing and Ms. Fitzgerald became its main breadwinner. She is survived by Maria, of London; another daughter, Christina Dooley, of Cornwall; a son, Valpy Fitzgerald of Oxford, and nine grandchildren.         Ms. Fitzgerald published her first book, a biography of the Victorian artist Edward Burne-Jones, in 1975. Yet despite the difficulties of her life as a young married woman, she refused to blame the delay in her writing career on her obligations as a wife and mother. ''In all that time, I could have written books and I didn't,'' she told The Times Magazine. ''I think you can write at any time of  your life.'' She was also reticent about her marriage.         Indeed, there was a delicate, elusive quality about Ms. Fitzgerald.  She had an apologetic, modest manner that concealed an underlying strength. ''She's prepared to play the scatty old lady,'' A. S. Byatt told the Times. ''But there's a steely intelligence under that gentle scattiness.''         In her later works, Ms. Fitzgerald departed somewhat from the autobiographical mode of her earlier fiction. She wrote ''The Beginning of Spring'' (1988), set in pre-Revolutionary Russia. ''The Gate of Angels,'' was about Cambridge in 1912 and based loosely on her uncles' lives. She loved the research involved in historical fiction, she said, but found writing incurably painful.  ''I hate writing, ,'' she told Publisher's Weekly. ''You just welcome any interruption that comes.''         Her editor at HarperCollins in London, Stuart Proffitt, compared her recent books to Beethoven in his ''late period,'' he said, '''where everything is getting pared down but the content is more concentrated.''         Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria said that she worked until the week she died. Her final book, ''The Means of Escape,'' a story collection, is to be published next fall by Counterpoint.         ''I have remained true to my deepest convictions,'' Ms. Fitzgerald said in 1998. ''I mean to the courage of those who are born to be defeated, the weaknesses of the strong, and the tragedy of misunderstandings and missed opportunities, which I have done my best to treat as comedy, for otherwise how can we manage to bear it?''         Correction:  May 8, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the British novelist Penelope Fitzgerald on Wednesday misidentified the publisher of ''The Means of Escape,'' her story collection due this fall. It is Houghton Mifflin, not Counterpoint.       
         Helen Beardsley, a mother of 20 who recounted the story of her unusual family in a book that was later made into a popular movie, died  April 26 at a hospital in Healdsburg, Calif. She was 70 and lived in Santa Rosa, Calif.         The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, her family said.         In 1968, Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda starred in the film ''Yours, Mine and Ours,'' based on Mrs. Beardsley's 1964 book, ''Who Gets the Drumstick?'' (Random House), which recounted the logistical problems of raising 20 children in a modern middle-class American family.         Mrs. Beardsley's first husband, Lt. Richard Dale North, a Navy pilot, died in a fighter-jet crash in 1960, when she was six months pregnant with their eighth child. The next year, she married another naval officer, Chief Warrant Officer Francis L. Beardsley, whose wife had recently died of diabetes, leaving him with their 10 children. The 18 children ranged in age from 6 months to 15 years. By 1964, the Beardsleys had two additional children of their own.         ''I was the oldest of the North boys,'' said Nicholas North, who became a middle child. ''I had lost a father, but all of a sudden I had older brothers.''         Teresa Wyble, the youngest of the North children, said that when the families joined, it was as if she had gained a twin. ''There is only six months between my sister Joan and I, and there are several of us like that,'' Mrs. Wyble said. She said the household had at least one birthday in every month but May.         When the Beardleys were first married, they lived in a two-story, four-bedroom house in Carmel, Calif. Later, using proceeds from the book and movie, they added a floor, five bedrooms and five bathrooms.         A bread company used the children in its commercials in the 1960's and delivered 50 loaves to the Beardsleys every two weeks. The Navy commissary listed the family as a restaurant so that the Beardsleys could buy food at wholesale prices.         Helen Eileen Brandmeir was born April 5, 1930, in Seattle. She studied nursing at Seattle University. She was named Mother of the Year by the National Campfire Girls in 1963 and was a member of the California Advisory Commission on the Status of Women.         When Mr. Beardsley retired from the Navy in 1968, the couple opened three bakeries in Monterey, Calif. In 1973, Mrs. Beardsley went to work for the Carmel Community Hospital. She later worked as a cardiovascular technologist at a hospital in Fresno, Calif. The couple retired to Santa Rosa in 1986.         Mrs. Beardsley is survived by her husband; 20 children; 44 grandchildren; and 2 great-grandchildren.         Explaining once how she had managed to keep the house running smoothly, Mrs. Beardsley said, ''I think the military background helped.''       
         Diane Divers Blair, who taught and practiced politics in Arkansas for 30 years, becoming fast friends with Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, died on Monday at her home in Fayetteville, Ark. She was 61.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         At her death she was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Arkansas, where she lectured and wrote from 1968 until her retirement three years ago.         Mrs. Blair befriended the Clintons in the mid-1970's. She worked as a researcher for Mr. Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992, and as an adviser in his 1996 re-election effort. In 1993, Mr. Clinton appointed her to the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.         The friendship drew scrutiny in Mr. Clinton's first term after it was revealed that Mrs. Blair's husband, James B. Blair, the chief counsel to Tyson Foods, had helped Mrs. Clinton make nearly $100,000 in profits from trading in commodity futures.         Professor Blair was a regular guest at the White House, and the Clintons reciprocated, visiting her in Fayetteville three times in recent months during her illness.         The Clintons are expected to attend a memorial service for her next month.         Professor Blair was born in Washington. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Cornell University in 1959 and received an M.A. in political science at the University of Arkansas in 1967.         In between she worked as an analyst for the President's Committee on Government Contracts, a researcher for the Senate Special Committee on Unemployment and legislative secretary to Senator Stuart Symington, Democrat of Missouri.         After moving to Arkansas, she served Governors Dale L. Bumpers and David H. Pryor on various state commissions.         In 1980, Governor Clinton appointed her a commissioner of the Arkansas Educational Television Network, and she served until 1993. The board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting elected her chairman in 1997 for a two-year term.         In addition to writing many articles and book chapters, she was the author of ''Arkansas Government and Politics: Do the People Rule?'' (University of Nebraska Press, 1988).         In addition to her husband of 21 years, Professor Blair is survived by a son and a daughter by an earlier marriage, William R. Kincaid of Washington and Kathryn K. Jong of Fayetteville; two stepdaughters and a stepson, Heather E. Blair of Chicago, Arden S. Blair of Columbia, Md., and James R. Blair of Fort Worth; a sister, Lois Alard of Fayetteville, and two grandchildren.       
         Nora Kahn Piore, a New York economist and health policy expert, died Saturday at New York Hospital. She was 87 and lived in Greenwich Village.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         She was born in the Bronx, the daughter of Alexander Kahn, a founder of the New York Liberal Party and former general manager of The Jewish Daily Forward.         She graduated Phi Beta Kappa in economics in 1933 from the University of Wisconsin, where she received an M.A. in the subject a year later.         Over her long career, Mrs. Piore was a union organizer and supervisor of education for union members; a research economist for a Senate subcommittee dealing with health legislation; a special economic assistant in the New York City Health Department; and head of a joint project with Hunter College that analyzed the economics of health initiatives in President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society program.         From 1972 to 1982, she was a professor of public health economics at Columbia University, and from 1971 to 1982, was associate director of its Center for Community Health Systems. In that capacity, she provided raw data that helped budget makers at City Hall and in Albany to allocate Medicare and Medicaid money.         Until the late 1980's, she continued consulting for health-related foundations and agencies and was a director of the Health Services Improvement Fund of Blue Cross-Blue Shield.         Her husband of 70 years, Dr. Emanuel R. Piore, died last month.         She is survived by a son, Michael J., of Boston; two daughters, Dr. Margot Onek of Washington and Jane Gilman of South Orange, N.J.; a sister, Jeanne Barnett of Alexandria, Va.; and six grandchildren.       
         Jane Prizant Gilman, a lawyer who was long active in civic, civil  rights and political organizations, died June 7 in Middletown, N.Y. She was 73 and lived in Hudson, N.Y., and Middletown.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         Born in Manhattan, Mrs. Gilman studied at Adelphi University and St. John's University before she received her law degree from New York University in 1950. In 1956, she moved to Orange County and became a partner in the firm of Gilman, Gilman & Guerreiro.         She held leadership positions in the Orange Association for the Help of Retarded Children, the County Health Organization and local branches of the N.A.A.C.P. and the League of Women Voters.         In the mid-1950's, she was a lawyer for the Temporary Commission on the Courts of the State of New York, a panel on court reform known as the Tweed Commission.         In April, the Orange County Human Rights Commission honored her for her pro bono work for poor women and others needing legal help. She was in private practice in Middletown until her death.         She was married in 1957 to Benjamin A. Gilman, a law partner and fellow Republican, and in 1972 worked in his successful campaign for Congress. Her own bid for the nomination for state attorney general in 1978 was rebuffed by the party organization in Albany.         After her divorce that year from Representative Gilman, she married Manuel G. Guerreiro, a former judge on the Family Court of New York City, who died in 1994. She is survived by a daughter, Susan Harts of Bedford Hills, N.Y.; two sons, Jonathan P. Gilman of Flemington, N.J., and Harrison P. Gilman of Middletown; a stepdaughter, Beatriz A. Guerreiro-Rowe of Darien, Conn.; a stepson, Matthew Guerreiro of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Dooley, who watched more than 4,000 consecutive Boston Red Sox home games over 55 seasons from her front-row box seat, died Monday in Boston, hours before her beloved Red Sox suffered a 22-1 beating from the Yankees. She was 87, a year younger than Fenway Park, the home of the Red Sox.         In 1996, Ted Williams, the greatest Red Sox player of them all, said of Ms. Dooley: ''Forever, she's the greatest Red Sox fan there'll ever be. Every time I get a chance to get around here I like to do it, because she's really a big league gal.''         Ms. Dooley shrugged off that accolade.         ''I do not consider myself a fan,'' she said. ''I am a friend of the Red Sox.''         Lib Dooley was a faithful friend. She called Williams Theodore and telephoned him on his every birthday. When Bobby Doerr retired, she started sending him clippings from Boston newspapers.         Dom DiMaggio was another of her Red Sox favorites. Upon learning of her death, he told The Boston Globe: ''She was a perfect lady. I remember so well when she presented us with our American League championship rings after we won in 1946. She was so thrilled. The Red Sox were practically her whole life, from what I could gather.''         They were indeed. From 1944 until 1998, she did not miss a home game and sometimes made road trips. Illness forced her to miss some games in 1998 and 1999. This year, she made only opening day and last month's Red Sox Hall of Fame dinner.         She would sit in Box 36-A in the front row behind the Red Sox on-deck circle, delivering Oreos and Starbursts to the players and then watching the game intently. Despite her close seat, she said only one foul ball came her way, by Carroll Hardy in the early 1960's. She caught it and broke two fingers.         She never married. She attended Boston College at night, and then, for 39 years, was a gym and health teacher in the Boston public school system. In 1956, she moved to an apartment in Kenmore Square. It was seven minutes from Fenway Park, she said, a little longer as age made walking more difficult.         She came by baseball naturally. In 1901, her father, John Stephen Dooley, helped the new Red Sox team get a home at the Huntington Avenue Grounds. According to her family, the father attended every season opener from 1894 until 1970, when he died at 97. ''I despise bridge and I hate gossip,'' Lib Dooley said. ''I wanted something where I could go by myself without anyone ruining it by saying, 'I can't do it this week.' Baseball gets you out in the fresh air and keeps you from talking about your neighbors.''         Her friendship with players did not alter her perspective.         ''The fans are really baseball, not the players,'' she said. ''You can always get someone to play ball. It doesn't have to be someone who gets $4 million to work two hours a day.''         David Leary, her 24-year-old grandnephew, sat in her seat at Monday night's game. Afterward, he got a game ball to place in her coffin.         Her survivors include four sisters, Winifred A. Dooley, Katherine M. Dooley and Anna Martin, all of Milton, Mass., and Mary Jane Boyd of Texas.       
         Mary Benson, an author, journalist and political campaigner who wrote passionately about the struggle for racial equality in her native South Africa,  died at home in London on Monday, her literary agent, Felicity Bryan, said. She was 80.         Miss Benson's books included a novel, ''At the Still Point,'' and biographies of Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela, his wife at the time, written while Mr. Mandela was still serving his long prison term and decades before he would become president of South Africa. In her memoir, ''A Far Cry: The Making of a South African,'' Miss Benson told how her early racial prejudice gave way to a wholehearted repudiation of white minority rule in South Africa.         Along the way, she grew close to many of the leading figures in the anti-apartheid movement, and her tiny apartment in St. John's Wood became an unofficial refuge for South Africans working for the cause in London.         It was Miss Benson whom Mr. Mandela sought out one evening in 1962 when, after slipping illegally out of South Africa to raise support in West and East Africa, he made a quick side trip to London. She had been expecting Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress; when she opened the door, Mr. Mandela was standing beside him.         ''I can't think what I gave them to eat, because I am a very indifferent cook, but it was quite an extraordinary evening,'' Miss Benson recalled in 1996, describing how Mr. Mandela paced up and down her apartment, brimming with ideas. ''He talked so excitedly and with such enthusiasm. It was unforgettable.''         Mary Benson was born into the privileged world of country clubs and servants in white South Africa in 1919. Passionate about films and bored by life at home, she traveled to Hollywood on a cargo ship as a teenager, using a mix of charm and determination to win interviews with Jimmy Stewart and other movie stars, about whom she then wrote.         Restless and daring, Miss Benson served as an aide to various British generals in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. She worked as a volunteer with displaced persons after the war, before becoming secretary to the director David Lean.         It was not until 1948, when she read Alan Paton's ''Cry, the Beloved Country'' that Miss Benson saw her country with new eyes and discovered the cause that was to be her life's passion. She began a correspondence with Mr. Paton (she was also to develop intense correspondences and lifelong friendships with Athol Fugard, among others) and campaigned in London for the rights of black Africans. She helped found the Africa Bureau with the Rev. Michael Scott, an Anglican priest who championed Namibian independence and with whom she fell in love.         Miss Benson returned to South Africa in 1957, becoming secretary of the defense fund for the 156 people, Mr. Mandela among them, who had been charged with treason for opposing the country's apartheid laws. Compelled to leave the post when she became ill with a debilitating form of arthritis that was to dog her throughout her life, Miss Benson turned her attention to writing. When the African National Congress was banned, she continued to support its leaders, visiting Mr. Mandela when he was forced underground and at least once accompanying him in a car in which he posed as her chauffeur.         Among Miss Benson's first books was a history of the outlawed African National Congress, published in the United States as ''South Africa: The Struggle for a Birthright.'' In 1964, after reporting on the political trials that resulted in long prison terms for the A.N.C.'s members, Miss Benson was placed under house arrest and her passport was confiscated. She left the country in 1966, returning only once in the next 24 years -- for a month in 1968, to be at her father's deathbed -- but continued to write about South Africa through the late 1990's. She never married.         Among other projects, Miss Benson also edited Athol Fugard's ''Notebooks'' and wrote a number of radio plays for the BBC. She was also the author of ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater.''         On the occasion of Miss Benson's 80th birthday in December, Mr. Mandela sent a message from South Africa. ''It reminds me of all the great help you gave to me and my family while I was in prison,'' he wrote. ''I send you all my thanks and appreciation of your generous friendship over half a lifetime.''         Correction:  June 23, 2000, Friday  An obituary yesterday about the South African writer Mary Benson misstated the title of one of her books. It is ''Athol Fugard and Barney Simon: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater,'' not ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith.''       
         Barbara T. Christian, a professor of African-American studies at the University of California at Berkeley and a pioneer of contemporary American literary feminism, died on June 25 at her home in Berkeley. She was 56.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Patricia McBroom, a university spokeswoman.         The author and editor of several books and 100 articles and reviews, Ms. Christian was best known for her landmark study ''Black Women Novelists: The Development of a Tradition.'' It appeared in 1980 amid a general rediscovery of the work of such writers as Zora Neale Hurston and Nella Larsen and the rise to prominence of several younger authors, including Toni Morrison and Alice Walker.         Ms. Christian was a leading critical presence in the growing debates over the relationship among race, class and gender. Her widely cited article ''The Race for Theory'' challenged the increasing domination of African-American literary study by those who were primarily interested in theory rather than in writers and their work.         Born in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, Ms. Christian entered Marquette University in Wisconsin at the age of 15. After she graduated cum laude in 1963, her family urged her to study medicine, but she instead chose graduate study at Columbia University, from which she received a doctorate in contemporary British and American literature in 1970. During her graduate studies, she also taught at the City College of the City University of New York.         In 1971, she was appointed assistant professor at Berkeley. A year later, she was instrumental in the establishment of the department of African-American studies, where she taught until her death. She was chairwoman of the department from 1978 until 1983. She led Berkeley's new doctoral program in ethnic studies from 1986 to 1989.         In 1978, she became the first African-American woman to be granted tenure at Berkeley. In 1986, she became the first to be promoted to full professor. In 1991, she won the university's Distinguished Teaching Award, the first African-American to do so. This year, she received the Berkeley Citation ''for distinguished achievement and for notable service to the university.''         In a letter supporting her nomination, Henry Louis Gates Jr. of Harvard University wrote that Ms. Christian ''has emerged as the senior figure among African-American feminists.'' Arnold Rampersad of Stanford University called her ''a major shaper and guide in the general area where the subjects of literature, race and feminism meet.''         Ms. Christian's marriage to David Henderson, a poet and a biographer of Jimi Hendrix, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Najuma Ide Christian of Berkeley; her parents, Judge Alphonso A. and Ruth Christian of St. Thomas; three sisters, Dr. Cora Christian of St. Croix, Reubina Gomez of St. Thomas and Alicia Wells of Philadelphia; two brothers, Alphonso Christian of Washington and Delano Christian of San Francisco; and a stepson, Imetai Malik Henderson of New York.       
         Neuma Goncalves da Silva, a central figure in the slums that served as the testing ground for the composers, seamstresses and fiercely talented layabouts who catapulted samba into an art form, died on Monday in Rio de Janeiro. She was 78.         A poor woman all her life, Ms. Goncalves da Silva rose to national prominence because of her role in the samba school of Mangueira, a sprawling favela in Rio de Janeiro. Her home became a meeting place for the creators of samba, the frenetic, drum-heavy music that accompanies the hip-gyrating dance of the same name.         She founded the women's wing, or ''feminine department,'' of the Mangueira samba school and was its president for several terms. She often sought out the carpenters and sculptors who built the floats, and the seamstresses and designers who created the costumes for the annual Carnival celebration. The school's official colors, pink and green, often show up among the victors in samba competitions.         Ms. Goncalves da Silva was a behind-the-scenes force in electing the male-dominated leadership of the school. Candidacies like that of the acting Mangueira president, Elmo Jose dos Santos, were often said to have been hatched from her modest home on Visconde de Niteroi street.         Ms. Goncalves da Silva also entertained celebrities like the composer Heitor Villa-Lobos and the musician Noel Rosa, as well as many politicians.         One governor recognized Ms. Goncalves da Silva's social role by giving her a telephone, the first in the favela.         The eldest daughter in her poor family, Ms. Goncalves da Silva was born in 1922 in Madureira, another Rio neighborhood, and moved to Mangueira as a child. At the time, samba was emerging as a type of lingua franca among the variants of African-inspired music and dance practiced in Rio.         In 1928, her father, Saturnino Goncalves, was a founder of the Mangueira Samba School and Recreational Society, together with Jose Gomes da Costa, also known as Ze Espinguela, a master of organization who arranged the first competitions among Rio's samba schools. Other founders were the legendary composers Angenor da Silva, or Cartola, and Carlos Moreira de Castro, better known as Carlos Cachaca.         Immersed as she was in music as a child, Ms. Goncalves da Silva, not surprisingly, made samba central to her life, which was always one of economic hardship. To make ends meet, according to one account, she took to washing clothes by hand after being denied a factory job because she was black.         ''Samba never leaves us sad,'' Ms. Goncalves da Silva, affectionately known as Dona Neuma, told one interviewer. ''It never leaves us with that disease which is nostalgia.''         When Maria Tereza Goulart, the wife of Brazil's former president, Joao Goulart, visited Ms. Goncalves da Silva to see the Mangueira school for herself, she was reported to have danced until the wee hours. A headline in a local newspaper read, ''The first lady of the country is received by the first lady of samba.''         Ms. Goncalves da Silva is survived by four children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.         As samba evolved over the years into a commercialized, multimillion-dollar industry, Ms. Goncalves da Silva wondered whether the musical form could still capture with frivolity the ferocity of existence, as it did when the Mangueira samba school was starting out.         ''These days samba is manufactured instead of delivered from within us,'' she said. ''But I think samba is on a slow voyage to victory.''         After Ms. Goncalves da Silva's burial on Tuesday, her friends and family members gathered to dance until 3 in the morning to some of the legendary sambas with which she was associated.       
         Dr. Josephine D. Martin, a psychiatrist who helped rootless children, troubled adolescents and terrified civil rights activists in a lifelong crusade to weld the healing of personal and social wounds, died on July 6 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         Dr. Martin, who lived in Manhattan and East Hampton, had long battled an autoimmune disorder, her family said.         She became known as the unofficial doctor to the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, or more personally, ''the little lady doctor from up North.'' She had gone to Mississippi to work with children under a precursor of the Head Start program and diagnosed their bloated stomachs as resulting from acute malnutrition. She soon found herself holding the hands of civil rights workers as they experienced daily intimidation and humiliation.         ''She was just something we had never seen before,'' said Unita Blackwell, one of the leaders in the fight to register black voters in Mississippi in the 1960's, and now the mayor of Mayersville, Miss. ''She was a white woman who was caring and loving.''         As Molotov cocktails exploded on Ms. Blackwell's lawn in the Freedom Summer of 1964, Dr. Martin sent Ms. Blackwell's traumatized 7-year-old son to Vermont to attend summer camp. An abandoned New York City child she took under her wing when he was 4 is now a lawyer who will help direct a foundation to be set up in her honor.         Josephine Diaz was born in Tampa, Fla., on Dec. 31, 1915. Her father was born in Spain, became a cigar-maker, then immigrated to Tampa. When Josephine was very young, her family moved to New York City, where she attended elementary and high school.         She contracted tuberculosis as a teenager and spent two years in a sanitarium. At 19, she married a  fellow patient, a social worker named Earl Martin. They worked together organizing people who had had tuberculosis to fight for better treatment.         Meanwhile, she attended several colleges. At the State University of New York in Buffalo, she was offered a scholarship to medical school, but the couple moved because of Mr. Martin's job. She eventually graduated from Hunter College.         She then worked at jobs in medical research and marine biology. Eventually, in her 30's, she entered medical school at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, borrowing and working to pay tuition.         After divorcing Mr. Martin, she married Cedric H. Belfrage, one of the founders of the leftist National Guardian. He was forced to leave the United States because of his political views, said Dr. Martin's third and last husband, Robert J. Schwartz. (Mr. Belfrage is deceased, as is Mr. Martin.)         Dr. Martin went with Mr. Belfrage to London, where she qualified to work for the National Health System; while there, she treated W.E.B. Du Bois, the sociologist and black protest leader, for a heart ailment.         Increasingly, she felt she needed to know more about patients' personal histories and living conditions. Psychiatry seemed a way to bridge the gap.         Back in New York, she entered a psychiatric residency at Bellevue Hospital and stayed on as a full-time psychiatrist working with children and adolescents. She started a day program for mentally ill youths, and, because public schools often refused to accept them, she also set up an educational program for them at Bellevue.         In 1967, after her divorce from Mr. Belfrage, she married Mr. Schwartz, a banker who had helped her with financial matters. Mr. Schwartz was also an economist who organized members of his profession to push for arms reductions. He became a leading advocate of investing in socially responsible enterprises.         ''All my husbands were wonderful men, each appropriate for his time,'' Dr. Martin liked to say.         On July 4, 1963, she and Mr. Schwartz went to Baltimore to participate in a demonstration against an amusement park that refused to admit blacks. They spent the night in jail. On July 8, the Baltimore City Council passed an emergency resolution to set up a human rights commission to mediate the park's racial problems.         ''What better way to spend the Fourth of July than to go to jail in the war for independence for millions of Americans whose freedom from tyranny did not come with the Declaration of Independence of 1776?'' she wrote in the National Guardian at the time.         In 1964, Dr. Martin took an extended vacation from Bellevue to go south, where she worked in the Mississippi Child Development Center, the forerunner of Head Start. Her interest in the South dated to 1950, when she became friends with Claude Williams, a white preacher working to integrate his church in Fungo Hollow, Ala.         She quickly became involved in the civil rights movement as tensions were escalating. She contributed her medical knowledge in teaching sessions and her psychiatric skills in individual sessions with frayed and frightened campaigners.         ''Some, more disturbed, under constant stress, decompensated or engaged in provocative behavior, putting themselves and others at risk,'' Dr. Martin wrote in an autobiographical essay. ''On occasion, hospitalization became necessary.''         She sent the troubled civil rights workers to Manhattan, to Gracie Square Hospital, where she had contacts, for fear of what might happen to them in Southern hospitals.         In his 1972 book, ''The Making of a Black Revolutionary,'' James Forman wrote a personal inscription in the copy he gave Dr. Martin. It said that she ''helped me to unravel many of the conflicting tendencies caused by a very active life, enabling me to bring focus and greater clarity to this head.''         Mr. Schwartz said that several times Mr. Forman, a leader in the Southern struggle, would arrive at their Manhattan apartment saying it was impossible to return to Mississippi. He would consult with Dr. Martin, and ''10 days later he was back again,'' Mr. Schwartz said.         Likening the situation to a M.A.S.H. unit, Ms. Blackwell said, ''She was the doctor who was on the battleground.''         Dr. Martin soon found other battlegrounds back home. Working for St. Luke's-Roosevelt, she set up an innovative home care psychiatric program for residents of welfare hotels. At the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, she worked with troubled adolescents, homeless families and others who needed help.         At the same time, she socialized in Mr. Schwartz's world of Wall Street financiers. During a pause in the conversation, she would say, ''How about giving some clothing to the poor kids at Bellevue?''         Boxes would soon arrive at the hospital's door.         Dr. Martin said her life added up to simply doing the next right thing. ''I had never had the notion that my role was to 'do good' or 'empower' anybody,'' she said, ''but to be able to offer my skills as needed, to live my life as seemed right to me.''       
         Ruth Werner, a colorful and successful Soviet spy whose exploits included radioing invaluable atomic bomb data to Moscow in the middle of World War II, died on July 7 in Berlin. She was 93.         In her 20 years as an intelligence operative in China, Poland, Switzerland and England, she had a number of close calls. But she always managed to extricate herself from the predicament -- unlike Klaus Fuchs, the agent who fed her the British atomic bomb secrets, who was imprisoned in Britain for nine and a half years, or Richard Sorge, the master spy who recruited her, who was executed in Japan in 1941.         Her espionage work was entwined with her romantic life, which included an affair with one of her spy chiefs; later she married a British Communist to become a British citizen and only later came to love him. She told some but not all of her story in a 1974 autobiography, still observing the iron rules of conspiracy by never mentioning Mr. Fuchs, who was still alive.         Ms. Werner was known by the code name Sonja, which was given to her by Mr. Sorge in 1933. Ruth Werner was her pen name. All of her identities had their roots in a prosperous Jewish household in Berlin, where she was born Ursula Ruth Kuczynski, one of six children of Robert Rene and Berta Kuczynski. Her father was a distinguished economist.         Ms. Werner was drawn early to the Communist movement and became a member of the German Communist Party at 19. She was immediately fired by the publishing house where she worked. Soon afterward she met and married Rolf Hamburger, an architect.         She started writing for the party newspaper, Rote Fahne. In 1930, having been told by the party that she would be contacted in Shanghai, she moved with her husband to China.         They began a pleasant bourgeois life, but she was waiting impatiently for the promised contact. It took four months and friendship with Agnes Smedley, an American leftist journalist, who introduced her to Mr. Sorge. Mr. Sorge, then 35, had been the Shanghai agent of the Soviet Army's intelligence service for a year. The service was known by its Russian initials, G.R.U.         Mr. Sorge asked whether she was ready to face danger. She nodded and agreed to make room available for his clandestine meetings with Chinese Communists, the chief interest of Moscow.         Ms. Werner joined the ring without her husband's knowledge, stored weapons and hid a Chinese comrade who was on the run. Two years later, when Mr. Sorge left Shanghai for Moscow, he recommended her to the G.R.U.         Though her marriage was deteriorating, she and her husband had had a son, Michael, while in Shanghai. When the G.R.U. asked her to go to Moscow for training, she left the boy with in-laws in Czechoslovakia.         In the G.R.U. school she learned Morse code, Russian and how to build radio transmitters and receivers. In February 1934 she was sent to turbulent Manchuria, which had been seized from China by the Japanese. Her boss was Ernst, a former sailor, with whom she became romantically involved.         ''Our transmitter was the link between the partisans and the Soviet Union,'' she wrote. She sent coded messages twice a week, and bought and transported chemicals for explosives for the Chinese Communist partisans.         In 1935, Moscow, fearing the two spies were about to be exposed, ordered Ms. Werner and Ernst to flee China. She accepted an assignment in Poland, this time with her husband, although she was pregnant with Ernst's child. Her daughter, Janina, was born in April 1936.         In late 1938 she was sent to Switzerland to set up a new spy ring, again with her husband, but he soon left her and went to the Far East. In February 1939 she met Len Beurton, an English Communist who had fought in Spain with the international brigades. For him, he once wrote, it was ''love at first sight; she had a very good figure.''         In 1940, the G.R.U. authorized a marriage of convenience by which Ms. Werner became British, but the love came to be mutual -- the marriage lasted until his death three years ago.         Ms. Werner had already begun clandestine transmissions from a radio set she had built in her rented house near Oxford when, in 1941, she met Mr. Fuchs, who was working at the British atomic research facility nearby.         The two spies would bicycle into the countryside for their meetings, and Mr. Fuchs would hand over written materials that, Ms. Werner once told an interviewer, were ''like hieroglyphics.''         Norman Moss, author of ''Klaus Fuchs: The Man Who Stole the Atomic Bomb'' (1987), said that Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin's chief aide, set up the Soviet atomic bomb project in 1942 as a result of the information transmitted by Mr. Fuchs and Ms. Werner, and that the information saved the Soviet researchers a great deal of time. The Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb in 1949.         Ms. Werner was also running other agents, including a Royal Air Force officer, a specialist in submarine radar and even her brother and father. She was once told that the chief of G.R.U. had said, ''If we had five Sonjas in England, the war would end sooner.''         In the early 1950's she and her family -- another son, Peter, had been born in 1943 -- left England for East Berlin. Her only connection with the G.R.U. after that was in 1969, when she was invited to a ceremony to receive her second Red Banner, the highest Soviet military decoration.         She turned to writing, producing some short stories; a biography of Olga Benario, a German Communist who was gassed by the Nazis in 1942; and her autobiography.         She is survived by her three children, five grandchildren and three sisters.       
         Emily Maxwell, the wife of the author and New Yorker editor William Maxwell, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her daughter Kate Maxwell said.         Mrs. Maxwell published short articles and reminiscences in The New Yorker, and from 1957 to 1965, she wrote year-end reviews of children's books for the magazine's Christmas list. She was also a painter.         Mr. Maxwell dedicated a number of his books to his wife. One of them, ''The Old Man at the Railroad Crossing and Other Tales'' (1957), is a collection of fables he wrote for her, some as bedtime stories when she couldn't sleep, and others as Christmas gifts for the family.         In addition to her daughter Kate, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband; another daughter, Brookie Maxwell, also of Manhattan; a grandson; and two brothers, Robert Noyes of Portland, Ore., and H. F. Noyes of Athens, Greece.       
         Nija Battle, who brought a swaggering sense of sophistication to the furs she designed for the music world's most tireless clotheshorses, died last Thursday while on a business trip in Montreal. She was 37.         The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her sister, Saddiya Battle.         For a designer who did not have a store, who often met her future clients at clubs or outside restaurants, and who, until the editor Andre Leon Talley wrote about her in Vogue last year, was almost unknown in the fashion world, Ms. Battle had a large following. Her custom-made furs were worn by entertainers like Whitney Houston, Lil' Kim, Kid Rock and Puff Daddy, who had her make trousers for him in black sheared mink.         And although much of the attention at the Costume Institute's ''Rock Style'' gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last December was focused on fashion nabobs like Tom Ford of Gucci and Donatella Versace, it was Ms. Battle of Brooklyn who designed the wraps worn by Naomi Campbell, Iman, Lynn Whitfield and Mary J. Blige, who had on a turquoise fur chubby.         Ms. Battle began making furs about 10 years ago, though in a sense, she started as a child when she and her sister would take skins given to them by their father, an avid hunter, and turn them into blankets and doll clothes. The family lived in Brooklyn but had relatives in North Carolina, and Ms. Battle, who was part Tuscarora Indian, often visited a grandmother there who raised minks.         After getting experience with Orchard Street furriers, Ms. Battle started her own business and gradually gained a following among rap and hip-hop stars who saw her out wearing her own designs.         ''When people like Puff Daddy were photographed for magazines, they'd say to the stylists, 'I'm wearing my own coat,' '' recalled her sister. They meant, of course, Ms. Battle's furs. She also created coats for a number of sports stars, and, on occasion, made identical styles for their wives and children.         Her custom-made designs, often dyed in colors like champagne, burgundy and green, projected a high urban style -- what Mr. Talley called ''a ghetto fabulousness'' -- that not only appealed to Ms. Battle's celebrated clientele but also evoked the 1970's in fashion. She was certainly among the first designers to recognize the appeal of reviving that era.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by her mother, Gladys, and her brother, Saleem Muhammad, both of Brooklyn.       
         Ronne Wohl Wulwick, a founder of Hineni, an outreach group that encourages young Jews to reconnect to their heritage, died last Saturday at her home in Old Westbury, N.Y. She was 85.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Wulwick, a Bronx native who also lived in Palm Beach, Fla., helped establish Hineni in the early 1970's and remained an active member. The organization is based in the Hineni Heritage Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Wulwick was also involved in Fight for Sight, an organization that fosters vision research, and was active in groups for teenage suicide prevention. She helped raise money for Hadassah, the Anti-Defamation League and the United Jewish Appeal. She also helped start a fundraising campaign for Long Island Jewish Hospital in Hyde Park, N.Y.         Mrs. Wulwick's first husband, Joseph S. Wohl, to whom she was married for 46 years, died in 1979. She is survived by Sam Wulwick, whom she married in 1988; three daughters, Elinor Wohl of Manhattan, Nancy Drake of Aspen, Colo., and Vicki Greenberg of Lawrence, N.Y.; a son, Larry W. Wohl of Manhattan; a brother, Jack Jaffess of Miami; and seven grandchildren.       
         Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in the 1950's led to a movement that found American homes for thousands of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell, Ore., after a stroke on July 24. She was 96.         Mrs. Holt first attracted national attention when she and her husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were American soldiers.         In 1954, Mrs. Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore., to watch a film about Amerasian children in South Korean orphanages.         ''We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Mrs. Holt later wrote in ''The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on adoption. ''We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching for someone to care.''         At first, the Holts sent money to South Korean orphanages but soon decided that the children needed families. They were both about 50 years old, and had already reared six biological children. Each wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Mrs. Holt later recalled, but each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take so many.         At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more than two foreign-born children. But in 1955, Congress passed the Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from infancy to 3 1/2. Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the process easier.         At the Holt house, soon there were children lined up to get a daily dose of vitamins, and the washing machine ran day and night.         Mr. Holt returned to South Korea for more children, while Mrs. Holt found families in the United States willing to take them.         In 1956, they founded the agency that would become Holt International Children's Services. At the time, there was no system in place for international adoptions. The Korean-American children were the first such large group to be adopted.         The Holts, who were Baptist, believed with missionary fervor that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American families. Holt International now handles about 1,000 international adoptions each year from 12 countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year.         Until days before her death, Grandma Holt, as she came to be known, was active in the agency. One of her daughters, Molly Holt, works for the Holt agency in South Korea.         She is also survived by nine other children, Barbara Chambers, Suzanne Peterson, Linda Pack, Robert Holt, Mary Last, Christine Russell, Helen Stampe, Paul Holt and Betty Blankenship; three sisters, Beulah Stronczek, Katherine Stanger and Grace Fisher; a brother, William L. Holt; 19 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.         Though the poverty they had seen in the Korean film footage shocked them, the Holts had seen hard times themselves. Bertha Marian Holt was born on Feb. 5, 1904, in Des Moines. Her father was a schoolteacher and a mail carrier. She received a degree in nursing in 1926, and the next year married a cousin, Harry Holt. The couple moved to South Dakota, where they became ''custom farmers,'' working land owned by others until they had saved enough to buy their own.         In the face of drought and poor farming conditions, Mr. Holt also milled flour and mined lignite coal. But during the Depression, the Holts left their farm for taxes owed and moved to the Willamette Valley in Oregon.         There the Holts prospered, eventually owning a lumber mill, but in 1950 Mr. Holt suffered a heart attack. The Holts turned to prayer, asking God to give them a mission and allow Mr. Holt more time to live. The orphans, they believed, were that mission.         While in South Korea in 1964, Harry Holt suffered another heart attack and died. Many thought the agency would close, but Mrs. Holt took over, traveling endlessly. She also worked to improve conditions at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other countries to set up adoption programs.         ''She would say, 'You know, I'm just a grandma, but here's what I think,' '' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, who was adopted through the Holt agency and now works there as a vice president.         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson named Mrs. Holt the National Mother of the Year, and in 1995 she became the only non-Korean to receive the Korea National Merit Award. But, Ms. Cox said, Mrs. Holt liked to say that she preferred the  photographs that children sent from all over the world.         ''She championed the idea that love and a safe, permanent home could transcend differences of nationality, race and ethnic background,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after Mrs. Holt's death.         In letters to agency employees, adopted children and adoptive families, Mrs. Holt spoke frequently of the Lord and quoted the Bible, which she said she had read 40 times.         Those who knew her said she seemed to have enormous energy. In 1996, she set the world record for the 400 meter race in the over-90 age group at the Hayward Classic in Eugene.       
         Constance Stuart Larrabee, a photographer who recorded the vanishing tribes of southern Africa, the World War II battlefields of Europe and her life on Maryland's tranquil Eastern Shore, died on July 27 at her home in Chestertown, Md. She was 85.         Known as Constance Stuart earlier in her career, Mrs. Larrabee in 1997 donated her African images to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African Art, her World War II pictures to the Corcoran Gallery and her views of the Eastern Shore to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum.         All three institutions simultaneously exhibited those collections in 1998. A traveling display, titled ''South Africa, 1936-1949 -- Photographs by Constance Stuart Larrabee,'' is being readied for a national tour by the Museum of African Art.         Yale University staged a 120-picture retrospective in 1995, presenting the remarkable panoply of her work. It opened with family portraits of Ndebele people in tribal garb, particularly of mothers with infants, and other tribal groups at work, rest and play.         She photographed South African soldiers fighting their way up the Italian boot, as well as the liberation of Paris, with Gen. Charles de Gaulle, in profile, addressing a crowd. Finally, the show ended on a genteel note in Maryland, where she bred Norwich and Norfolk terriers on a farm and depicted the rivers and creeks, wildlife and people of her surroundings.         Two of her South African photographs were included in Edward Steichen's famous international exhibition and collection of the mid-1950's, ''The Family of Man.'' The Museum of Modern Art billed it as ''the greatest photographic exhibition of all time,'' and she shared the credits with the likes of Margaret Bourke-White, Frank Capra and Henri Cartier-Bresson.         Born in England, Mrs. Larrabee grew up in Pretoria, South Africa, and studied photography in London and Munich. In 1936 she started a portrait studio in Pretoria to capture the white South African elite along with visitors like Noel Coward and members of the British royal family.         Apart from her commercial work, she began to chronicle the vanishing ethnic cultures of Bushmen, Transkei peoples and others in the region. Her exhibitions drew national attention and led to her appointment as a war photographer.         She accompanied the South African Sixth Armored Division and the American Sixth Army as they swept through Europe. At one point she came under German artillery fire aboard a French tank.         She arrived in the United States in 1949, married Col. Sterling Loop Larrabee and settled in Chestertown, where she established a long association with Washington College. She supported its arts programs and helped establish the Constance Stuart Larrabee Arts Center.         Her husband died in 1975. No immediate family members survive.       
         Frieda Mae Hardin, who joined the Navy during World War I, when women were still denied the right to vote, and at a widely noted ceremony  79 years later symbolized the achievements of all the women in the armed forces, died last Wednesday in Livermore, Calif. She was 103.         Wearing a World War I ''yeomanette'' uniform and a wide-brimmed hat inscribed with ''U.S. Naval Reserve,'' Mrs. Hardin provided the emotional high point at the ceremony, held in October 1997 at Arlington National Cemetery to dedicate the Women in Military Service for America Memorial, honoring almost  two million women who had served.         Making her way to the speaker's stand before an audience estimated at 30,000, Mrs. Hardin was accompanied by her son Jerald Kirsten, a retired Navy captain.         ''Loud voice, mother,'' he said.         Mrs. Hardin's audience heard her loud and clear. ''In my 101 years of living, I have observed many wonderful achievements, but none as important or as meaningful as the progress of women taking their  rightful place in society,'' she said.         ''To those women now in military service, I say, 'Carry on.' To those  young women who may be thinking about a career in the military service, I say, 'Go for it.' ''         The 10-minute talk brought three standing ovations and left many in the crowd in tears.         When Frieda Mae Green was born on Sept. 22, 1896, in Eden Valley,  Minn., a formal role for women in the armed forces could hardly have been foreseen. Women had served in a quasi-military capacity, as nurses, but there were no women in the regular Navy or Army.         In March 1917, however, with America's entry into World War I imminent, Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels called on women to enlist in the Naval Reserve to free sailors for combat duty.         Frieda's father, a railroad worker, had moved the family to Kentucky and then Ohio, and she had taken a job at a department store in the town of Portsmouth. One day in 1918, she saw a notice that a Navy recruiter was arriving. ''I heard about the Navy taking women on a Saturday night, and I signed up first thing Monday morning,'' she would recall.         According to her son Jerald, when she phoned her mother to tell her what she had done, ''Her mother said, 'Frieda, you get home this instant!' '' Frieda's mother took her back to the recruiting station and told the Navy man that she could not sign up without her father's permission. But the next day, her father said, ''Let her go,'' and off she went.         She was among almost 12,000 women who served in the Navy during World War I as clerks, draftsmen, translators, camouflage designers and recruiters. They were  formally designated yeomen (f), for female, but were known as yeomanettes. She was on active duty from September 1918 to March 1919 at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Virginia, performing clerical duties and receiving an outstanding grade in reading proficiency and perfect marks in obedience and sobriety, the three areas in which the Navy graded women. (She would remain a teetotaler, even refusing a glass of celebratory champagne while flying to the 1997 memorial ceremony.)         By 1920, all the yeomanettes were released from duty, and women would not be permitted to serve in the Navy again until the Waves were established in World War II.         After leaving the Navy, Frieda Green married William Kirsten, a chef, and they settled in the Lodi-Stockton area of California. She remained in Northern California the rest of her life, and had been a resident of a Livermore nursing home for several years when she died there last week.         She is survived by four children from her marriage to Mr. Kirsten: Captain Kirsten, of Lodi, Roy Kirsten of Stockton and Warren Kirsten of Sacramento, all military veterans, and Mary Botto of Stockton; 12 grandchildren; 25 great-grandchildren; and 29 great-great-grandchildren. William Kirsten and three other husbands died before her, the last of them Robert Hardin.         In speaking at the memorial dedication, Mrs. Hardin said that ''a world of opportunity'' awaited women in the military.         ''For my part, I have always been very proud of my Navy service,'' she  told the audience. ''It is not likely that I will be meeting with you again,  so I bid each of you a fond farewell.''         Among those in the crowd was a woman named Ann Darr, who had served during World War II in the Women's Air Force Service Pilots, or Wasps. Reflecting on that moment at the memorial, she would write, ''When Frieda Mae Hardin spoke, reminding us she couldn't vote when she signed up, saying to the young people, 'Go for it!' we were almost ready to serve again.''       
         Lena Cymbrowitz, a first-term state assemblywoman from Brooklyn, died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 43.         Her family said she had been ill for a long time, but gave no details.         Ms. Cymbrowitz, a Democrat, represented the 45th District, which includes Sheepshead Bay, Manhattan Beach, Gerritsen Beach and parts of Flatbush, Midwood and Brighton Beach.         A member of the committees on agriculture, children and families, health, insurance, and social services, she was an advocate of allocating more state money to provide mammographies for detection of  breast cancer in women.         She is survived by her husband, Steven; a son, Jay; and a daughter, Jennifer.       
         Helen Culver Ewing Breasted, who worked at Hull House in Chicago with Jane Addams, its founder and a family friend, died Sunday at her home in Tamworth, N.H. She was 90 and also had a home in Sewickley, Pa.         Mrs. Breasted, a native of Chicago, attended Vassar College. As a volunteer at Hull House in the 1930's, she helped settle newly arrived immigrants. Hull House, founded in 1889, was one of the first settlement houses.         In 1935 she married James Henry Breasted Jr., an art historian who later became chairman of the art and art history department at the Kent School in Kent, Conn. He died in 1983.         Mrs. Breasted is survived by two sons, James, of Carbondale, Colo., and John, of Great Barrington, Mass.; three daughters, Barbara Whitesides of Newton, Mass., Mary Breasted Smyth of Sewickley, and Helen Breasted Horton of Cape Elizabeth, Me.; a sister, Katherine Hocking of Madison, N.H.; and five grandchildren.       
         Helen Quinn, who for more than 30 years presided firmly over the Metropolitan Opera patrons who lined up every Saturday morning to buy standing-room tickets for the next  week's performances, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 76.         The cause was food poisoning, said  Josephine Rowe, a friend.         Often called the Queen of Standees by the hundreds of people who compliantly allowed her to take charge of the ticket queue, Ms. Quinn was a herself a veteran of standing-room lines at the Met. In 1943, having just finished high school in Manhattan, she attended a performance of Mozart's ''Magic Flute'' at the Met and was instantly hooked on opera. Soon she was attending five or six performances a week, almost always as a standee.         In 1966, on her own initiative, she more or less imposed a system on the standee process that the throng of regulars was apparently happy to abide by. Standing-room tickets for the week go on sale at 10 a.m. on Saturday. Under Ms. Quinn's system, as opera buffs arrived, many as early as 4 or 5 a.m., they wrote their names on a numbered list on her clipboard, then went home or to a coffee shop across the street, leaving Ms. Quinn to wait in their place.         Around 9 a.m., the expectant standing-room ticket buyers would return, and Ms. Quinn began barking commands with a vocal power that many a hefty dramatic soprano would covet. Happy that someone was in charge, the opera buffs complied. Ms. Quinn tolerated no dissent, even from the Luciano Pavarotti fans, who tended, she said in a 1994 interview in The New York Times, to be the most pushy.         ''The Pavarotti people can be a little ferocious,'' she said. ''If I had to live with a group of people the rest of my life, I would pick the Wagnerites. They're the most patient. Domingo people are a close second. The Pavarotti people are at the bottom of the list. I don't mix with them personally. They're loud in their deportment, they talk among themselves and they want extra places for their friends.''         Cutting ahead in the line was absolutely verboten, as Wotan would put it. ''When I see someone crashing the line,'' Ms. Quinn was quoted as saying, ''I pounce.'' Her tactic was to expose the intruder to the orderly faithful. ''Believe me, it works,'' she said. ''It's the most humiliating experience for anyone.''         Ms. Quinn, who was born in New Jersey on April 15, 1924, was rather circumspect about her private life. At 14 her family moved to New York City. After graduating from high school, she took her first job as a key-punch operator for Columbia Pictures. In the early 1960's, when she heard that a new Metropolitan Opera House would be built, she moved to  an apartment on West 57th Street to be close. She lived there until her death. She is survived by a sister, Jean Magrow of Oceanside, N.J.         After Ms. Quinn had for some time been running the standing-room line,  a procedure to which the Met gave tacit approval, some regular standees urged her to begin collecting tips for her efforts. She decided to do so.         ''I figured that running the line was my contribution to the Met,'' she said. ''But people kept saying to me:  'Helen, wise up. You're performing a public service.'' ' Most patrons offered her a dollar as they turned in their slips, but those who did not  received the same consideration.         Ms. Rowe, who has been Ms. Quinn's partner in running the standing-room line since 1995, said she planned to continue the work alone.       
         Miki Denhof, one of the first women to be the art director of a magazine, and a noted mentor of fashion photographers, died on Wednesday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 88.         In 1945, when Ms. Denhof joined Conde Nast, its fashion and lifestyle magazines were widely influential for their use of elegant typography and conceptual photography, approaches in which she, too, excelled. The executive art director, Alexander Liberman, installed Ms. Denhof as promotion art director of Vogue. There, ''she was a creative force and arbiter of quality,'' said a friend and colleague, Estelle Ellis.         ''She also developed a keen ability to edit pictures into narrative sequences and was deft with type,'' Ms. Ellis continued. ''She transcended the conventions of advertising design at that time.''         Later named the editorial art director for House and Garden and Glamour magazines, Ms. Denhof collaborated with Mr. Liberman, refining the typographic and photographic styles that characterized those publications.         But she was not simply a stylist. ''Miki always had a sense of the big picture,'' said Don Wise, who was art director of the Glamour promotion art department in the 1950's. ''She designed in an intellectual way, using words as integral parts of her pictures. Now designers routinely integrate type and image, but she did it before most others.''         In the 60's, at Glamour, she nurtured and mentored many American and European-emigre photographers, including David Bailey, Frank Horvat, Jeanloup Sieff, Louis Faurer and Saul Leiter.         ''She was the only art director I wouldn't question,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''She could put 22 pictures on a spread and I wouldn't worry. She'd always do it right.''         Ms. Denhof was born in 1912 in Trieste, Italy, raised in Austria and educated in Vienna and Berlin. She left Germany for New York with her family in 1938.         One of her earliest design jobs was as an assistant to the Modernist designer Paul Rand at Esquire and Apparel Arts magazines. She was also art director of Conde Nast Books, responsible for such titles as ''Vanity Fair: Photographs of an Age 1914-1936'' with Diane Edkins, and ''The Successful Face'' with Amy Green.         After leaving Conde Nast in 1977 she designed exhibitions, catalogs and a documentary book for the Guild Hall in East Hampton, which also mounted an exhibition of her editorial layouts.         She spent the last few years archiving the photo albums and diaries of her father, Bernhard Bardach, a doctor in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. Recently she donated 900 of the photographs to the Leo Baeck Institute in New York. Some were used in the 1999 exhibition ''Fighting for the Fatherland: The Patriotism of Jews in World War I.''         Ms. Denhof was divorced from Hans Denhof, who is deceased. She has no immediate survivors.       
         Ethel Brown Fitzgerald, a former New York City teacher and school administrator, lawyer and musician, died July 19 at a hospital in upstate Amsterdam. She was 68 and lived in Fonda, N.Y., and Brooklyn.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Fitzgerald spent 16 often contentious years on the City Board of Education's semiautonomous Board of Examiners, from 1974 until the State Legislature restructured it out of existence in 1990. She served variously as a member, vice chairwoman and chairwoman.         The examiners tested prospective teachers and supervisors and drew up lists from which the school board appointed job candidates. Their critics charged the panel had become a cumbersome anachronism and a bottleneck.         In Mrs. Fitzgerald's view the chancellor and school board were trying to circumvent the merit system. Indeed, she asserted, they flirted with the very Tammany Hall-style patronage system that led to the creation of the independent examiners in the first place, in 1898.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Fitzgerald was a 1954 music graduate of Hunter College and taught orchestral and choral music in the public schools until 1967. As Ethel Brown, a member of the musicians' union, she played the cello with professional symphony orchestras.         By 1968 she had completed her graduate work at Brooklyn College, Columbia University and New York University. She received the certificate of an education supervisor and administrator from Hunter, and, in 1981, she received a doctor of laws degree from Brooklyn Law School.         She held a number of positions as assistant principal, principal and teachers' trainer before being appointed to the Board of Examiners, then practically a lifetime job. In recent years she had been in private law practice in Fonda.         Mrs. Fitzgerald is survived by a son, Dr. Kim Fitzgerald of Cleveland; her mother, Effie Hargett Brown of Fonda; and six grandchildren.       
         Mary MacLeod Trump, a philanthropist who supported charities near her home in Jamaica, Queens, and elsewhere, died on Monday at 88 at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, her family said.         Mrs. Trump was born Mary MacLeod on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland on May 10, 1912. On a visit to New York City in the 1930's, she met Fred C. Trump. They married in 1936 and settled in Jamaica Estates, and Mr. Trump went on to become one of the city's biggest developers.         Mrs. Trump was the mainstay of the Women's Auxiliary of Jamaica Hospital and of the Jamaica Day Nursery. The Trumps were also active in the Salvation Army, the Boy Scouts of America and the Lighthouse for the Blind, among others. A pavilion at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center bears their name. They also gave buildings to the National Kidney Foundation of New York/ New Jersey and to Community Mainstreaming Associates of Great Neck, N.Y., which provides homes for the disabled.         Mr. Trump died last year. Mrs. Trump is survived by four children: Donald, the developer and casino operator; Robert, the president of his father's property management company; Maryanne, a federal judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; Elizabeth, an executive with Chase Manhattan Bank; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         Sister M. Isolina Ferre, a Catholic nun from a wealthy family in Puerto Rico who was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Clinton last August for over half a century of charity and peacemaking, died on Thursday in her native city of Ponce. She was 85.         ''Armed only with her faith, she taught gangs in New York City to solve their differences without violence,'' President Clinton said in a statement last week. ''In Puerto Rico, her community service centers, the Centros Isolina Ferre, transformed ravaged neighborhoods by operating clinics and helping residents to empower themselves.''         Sister Isolina won the Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the government can give a civilian, for establishing charitable centers in New York City and Appalachia, in addition to Puerto Rico.         A friend and fellow nun in Sister Isolina's order, the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity, said that Sister Isolina successfully mediated a conflict between warring Puerto Rican youth gangs in Brooklyn in the 1950's and 60's while she was the director of a Catholic charitable center there.         The friend said Sister Isolina's success as a peacemaker was the result of her interpersonal skills, her training in sociology at Fordham and the insights provided by her Puerto Rican heritage.         She also worked with Portuguese immigrants in New England and black youths in Brooklyn.         She won a Rockefeller Public Service Award in 1980 for her work in revitalizing communities and neighborhoods and organizing local groups to serve the unemployed, underskilled, delinquent, sick and handicapped.         Sister Isolina was born into a Puerto Rican family that owns two leading newspapers. Her brother, Luis, was a governor of Puerto Rico, and established the ruling New Progressive Party. She employed her family's influence in establishing charitable organizations.         In 1935, while on a trip to Havana, she decided to join the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity.  She studied at St. Joseph College for Women and at Fordham University. Her work in Puerto Rico included founding a vocational school in Ponce.         She is survived by her brother.       
         Grace Halsell, a journalist whose curiosity about ''a wider world'' led her to experience life on society's fringes by disguising herself as women of different races, died on Aug. 16  in Washington, where she lived. She was 77.         Inspired by John Howard Griffin's 1961 book ''Black Like Me,'' in which the author darkened his skin to pass as black, Ms. Halsell took pills that were used to alleviate pigmentation problems, supplemented by extensive tanning sessions, to cross the color barrier. Further transformed by a wig and dark contact lenses, she moved in 1968 first to Harlem and then to the Deep South, where at the height of the civil rights movement she took a job as a cleaning woman.         She wrote about this in her 1969 book, ''Soul Sister,'' in which she described the anonymity and degradation of being a black domestic in a world of white employers, one of whom tried to rape her. The book sold more than one million paperback copies and was translated into six languages.         ''Soul Sister'' was followed in 1973 by ''Bessie Yellowhair,'' based on her life on a Navajo reservation and as a American Indian nanny for a Los Angeles family, and in 1978 by ''The Illegals,'' in which she wrote of crossing the border with a group of Mexican immigrants. In the 1980's she lived undercover with a group of Christian fundamentalists.         The daughter of a West Texas cattleman, she was reared on her father's tales of frontier life on the Great Plains. ''I never felt anything I did was anything at all compared to his stories,'' she wrote in her 1996 autobiography, ''In Their Shoes.''         After high school she accepted a job at The Avalanche-Journal, the only newspaper in Lubbock, Tex., where she attended a local college while working full time. She eventually studied anthropology at Columbia University and in 1945 became the first woman to cover the police beat at The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. While working as a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Houston Post in the mid-1960's she was recruited by President Lyndon B. Johnson for a secretarial position on his White House staff. When she told him she did not take dictation, she was assigned to write official statements and became the highest ranking woman on his staff during her three-year tenure.         She is survived by a brother and a sister, both of Texas.         Shortly after the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Ms. Halsell left the White House for the journey she described as ''embracing the Other.''         ''I wanted to strip myself to see who I was, to see if there was anything there,'' she said.       
         Dawn Langley Simmons, an author whose tumultuous life included a sex change operation and an interracial marriage that scandalized her adopted hometown, Charleston, S.C., died on Sept. 18 at her daughter's home there. She was 77.         Mrs. Simmons, who was the adopted child of the English actress Margaret Rutherford, had Parkinson's disease, said her daughter, Natasha.         Mrs. Simmons was the author of more than 20 books, including novels, biographies, and books for her children. Several of her books understandably touched on her life experiences, given a journey that started on an English estate, touched down on an Indian reservation and stirred deep turmoil in civil-rights-era Charleston.         Jack Hitt, a journalist who grew up in Charleston across the street from Mrs. Simmons and wrote about her for GQ magazine, remembered her as a figure with a piercing stare, a pillbox hat and ''a Dippity-Do hairstyle -- a dowdy doppelganger of Jackie Kennedy.''         Mrs. Simmons was a person around whom legends swirled, Mr. Hitt said. She lived in a grand house filled with antiques and with a hidden garden. She was said to have had a coming-out party for two of her dogs, who were displayed on velvet cushions in the living room, dressed in chenille, long gloves and pearls.         Mrs. Simmons was named Gordon Langley Hall when she was born, at Sissinghurst, the estate of the writer Vita Sackville-West, in Heathfield, Sussex, England. Gordon was the illegitimate child of Jack Copper, Sackville-West's chauffeur (a grandfather was Rudyard Kipling's gardener) and Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, who came, Mrs. Simmons always said, from a high social class.         Mrs. Simmons said she was born with an adrenal abnormality that causes the female genitalia to resemble a man's and was thus raised as a boy. She always maintained that she was -- unequivocally -- female.         As a boy, young Gordon played with Sackville-West's son, Nigel Nicolson. Mr. Nicolson remembered Gordon in a telephone conversation from England last Friday. ''We called him 'Dinky,' and I always think of him that way,'' he said, adding that young Gordon always looked like a boy.         At Sissinghurst, the young Gordon met Virginia Woolf, Ms. Sackville-West's lover and the author of ''Orlando,'' a novel about a boy who changes into a beautiful woman. ''Had she lived a little longer, Vita would have been intrigued to know that the child 'Dinky,' as she called me, would become a real-life Orlando,'' Mrs. Simmons wrote in her memoir, ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend,''(1995, Wyrick & Company).         In his late teens, Mr. Hall emigrated to Ontario, where he worked as a missionary, teacher and midwife among the Ojibwa Indians, according to his book about his experiences, ''Me Papoose Sitter'' (Crowell, 1955). He became an editor for The Winnipeg Free Press, and from 1953 to 1956 was society editor of The Nevada Daily Mail in Missouri. Mr. Nicolson said he was ''a very good journalist.''         He also wrote books about Princess Margaret, Jacqueline Kennedy and American Evangelism. According to the reference work ''Contemporary Authors,'' a critic named W. H. Archer praised Mr. Hall's ''Rose for Mrs. Lincoln: A Biography of Mary Todd Lincoln'' (Beacon Press, 1970), calling it ''scrupulously researched'' and written in ''a charmingly premeditated style.''         In New York in his 20's, Mr. Hall met Margaret Rutherford, who became enchanted with him and, with her husband, Stringer Davis, adopted him.         In that period Mr. Hall also befriended the painter Isabel Whitney, who left him $2 million at her death in 1962, he said. Around that time, he moved to Charleston, settling into a faded 1840 house on Society Street in the Ansonborough section, which had a large gay population. He became friendly with Charleston's grandes dames, restored his house and filled it with Chippendale furniture, mirrors said to belong to George Washington, and bed steps said to have been owned by Robert E. Lee.         In 1968 he underwent a sex change operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and became Dawn Pepita Langley Hall.         The following year Dawn Hall married her 22-year-old black butler, John-Paul Simmons. The publisher of ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' was quoted as calling it the first documented interracial marriage in Charleston's history. A bomb threat forced the couple to move the wedding from a Baptist church to the bride's home, and the gifts were destroyed by a firebomb.         In England, Miss Rutherford was reported to have said, ''I am delighted that Gordon has become a woman, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of another race, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of a lower station, but I understand the man is a Baptist!''         Soon, Mrs. Simmons appeared to be pregnant. Then in 1972, she began strolling with a baby carriage bearing a little girl whom she called Natasha.         That was the final straw for many people in Charleston. Mrs. Simmons claimed that a white man broke into her house wearing a ski mask and beat her, breaking her nose and foot and necessitating hospitalization.         She also said that her husband beat her. In 1974, after a period of turbulence in which she accused her husband of selling her belongings to buy whisky, the family moved to Catskill, N.Y. Some time later, Mr. Simmons was confined to a mental institution near Albany. His daughter says he is now an outpatient.         Mrs. Simmons spent most of her later years in Hudson, N.Y., where she was an active member of a local Episcopal church and a leader of its youth group. She continued to support her husband and daughter on her meager earnings as a writer.         Her daughter said she would prefer not to discuss her mother's past. ''I would like her to be remembered as the grandmother that she was, as a family woman,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''She was devoted to my children.''         In addition to her husband and daughter, Mrs. Simmons is survived by three grandchildren.         After she published ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' in 1995, her childhood friend, Mr. Nicolson, reminisced about her in The Spectator. ''I have maligned her in the past, mocked her strange fate and refused to meet her,'' he wrote.         ''She had asked me for help in arranging an English marriage,'' he wrote, ''and when she called on me, I hid.'' On a trip to Charleston, he avoided meeting her, but saw her on television. ''I saw on the wall behind her photographs of my mother,'' he continued. ''For the first time I was touched.''         But ''there is not a word of reproach for me in her book,'' Mr. Nicolson marveled. ''Like everything else about Dinky, it is gallant, resilient and unfailingly generous.''       
         Beah Richards, whose distinguished career as an actress on stage, screen and television over 50 years was capped this month when she won an Emmy as a guest actor on ''The Practice,'' died on Thursday in Vicksburg, Miss. She was 80. She was born in Vicksburg and lived in Los Angeles until Memorial Day, when she returned to her home city.         Ms. Richards's characters were exemplars of stalwart, soulful women: Sister Margaret, the pastor of a storefront church in James Baldwin's play ''The Amen Corner''; Mr. Poitier's mother in ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' (a role for which she was nominated for an Academy Award); Baby Suggs, a former slave who becomes a spiritual leader, in the film version of Toni Morrison's ''Beloved.''         As she once said, ''I have played everybody's mother.'' In addition to Mr. Poitier, her ''sons'' included James Earl Jones, Danny Glover, Delroy Lindo and Eriq LaSalle.         In 1959 she was the understudy to Claudia McNeil as Lena Younger in the original Broadway production of Lorraine Hansberry's ''Raisin in the Sun'' and went on to play the role in the 25th-anniversary production of the play at the Yale Repertory Theater.         Lena Younger was, in fact, an archetypal Richards character, a woman who bravely moves from a slum into a lily white community in Chicago. With the conviction of a Rosa Parks, she leads her family into block-busting not as an act of revolution but as her birthright. It is simply time for a change. As this urban pioneer, Ms. Richards was indomitable but not overbearing, creating a deeply moving portrait exactly as large as life. In this production, directed by Dennis Scott, Mr. Lindo played the son, Walter Lee Younger, a role created by Mr. Poitier, and Mary Alice was her daughter-in-law.         In 1984 she was Mr. Glover's mother in ''And the Children Shall Lead'' on the PBS ''Wonderworks'' series. Her role was that of a woman who worked as a maid for a sheriff in a small Southern town. When civil rights workers raise her consciousness, she confronts her employer, and he fires her. As was generally the case with Ms. Richards's characters, she rises to the challenge.         Ms. Richards was the daughter of a Baptist minister and a seamstress. Many years later she spoke of being insulted and stoned by white children as she walked to school. As she said, ''I suffered every day in my life in that town.''         She studied at Dillard University in New Orleans and in 1948 began her acting career at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego. Moving to New York, she was in the long-running Off Broadway revival of Louis Peterson's ''Take a Giant Step,'' with Bill Gunn, Frances Foster, Rosetta LeNoire and Godfrey Cambridge. When the play was filmed, Ms. Richards repeated her role as the grandmother.         Her first Broadway role was in ''The Miracle Worker,'' followed by ''Purlie Victorious.'' Then came ''The Amen Corner,'' in which she played in Los Angeles as well as in New York. She was in Mike Nichols's production of ''The Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center and also performed a one-woman show, ''A Black Woman Speaks.''         Ms. Richards's films included ''Hurry Sundown,'' ''Drugstore Cowboy'' and ''The Great White Hope'' (as the mother of the boxer Jack Jefferson, played by Mr. Jones). She won an Emmy in 1988 for a guest appearance on ''Frank's Place'' and was in ''Roots: the Next Generation'' and ''The Bill Cosby Show.'' On ''E.R.,'' she had a running role as Mr. La Salle's mother.         She was divorced from Hugh Harrell, an artist. There are no immediate survivors.         Looking back to her childhood as the daughter of a minister, Ms. Richards said: ''I always relate the theater to the church. There is the sharpness of image, the poetry. And like the church, the theater must always be an exploration for truth.''       
         Mary Shepard, the modest illustrator whose line drawings of Mary Poppins brought to life the ultimate British nanny in a series of seven books by P. L. Travers published from 1933 to 1988, died in London on Sept. 4. She was 90.         Her father was E. H. Shepard, the illustrator of ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' and ''The Wind in the Willows.'' When ''Mary Poppins'' was being readied for publication, Pamela Travers wanted him to do the pictures.         He was too busy, but, as Miss Travers wrote almost a half-century later, on a friend's mantle she saw a Christmas card that had ''a happy imperfection, a sense of wonder.'' It was done by Mary Shepard, then 23 and just out of the Slade School of Art.         Travers's editor, Peter Llewelyn Davis (in the tight British literary world he was one of the Lost Boys befriended by J. M. Barrie, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks, the parents in ''Mary Poppins,'' bore more than a passing resemblance to the Darlings of ''Peter Pan''), worried about Miss Shepard's inexperience, but their collaboration had begun.         And it was a collaboration. In an attic, Travers said, she found a wooden peg Dutch doll with painted coal-black hair, a turned-up nose and small, bright blue eyes that became the model.         That doll was later sent to the Donnell Library in Manhattan. But Miss Shepard bought a similar one to use as she drew. She wanted the nanny to stand in the fifth ballet position, with feet turned out and nearly parallel, but Travers insisted on the more comfortable fourth position, with the feet at right angles. Travers died in 1996 at the age of 96.         In the 1964 Walt Disney movie starring Julie Andrews, the time period and decor were pushed back from the 1930's of the book illustrations to a plush Edwardian era, but Ms. Andrews's costume and bearing stayed true to Miss Shepard's drawings (with her feet back to the fifth position), and Miss Shepard received a payment from the filmmakers.         Mary Eleanor Jessie Shepard was born on Christmas Day 1909. She had an idyllic Edwardian childhood and an artistic education.         In 1937 she married E. V. Knox, a friend and colleague of her father's, and outside publishing was known as Mary Knox. Her husband, who had been a widower, was the editor of Punch, the humor magazine. She was only seven years older than Knox's daughter, Penelope, who as Penelope Fitzgerald began publishing novels in her late 50's and died last spring at the age of 83. Knox died in 1971.         As they grew older, the two women became more like sisters. They lived near each other, talked every day and took care of each other, especially after Knox's death.         Miss Shepard was Auntie Mary to Fitzgerald's three children and had only one other relative, Minette Hunt, the daughter of her brother, who was killed in World War II. Her last drawings were made for a Fitzgerald grandchild, shortly after she entered the nursing home where she spent her last years. She did not know that Penelope had died.         A family memorial service was held at the Hampstead Parish Church on Sept. 14, where Miss Shepard worshiped daily as long as she was able. She was so modest that she said she did not wish to be buried with her husband in the pretty Hampstead cemetery because her name would add clutter to his stone.         Instead, the Fitzgerald children, Maria Fitzgerald, Tina Dooley and Balphy Fitzgerald, have arranged that twin stones be placed next to Knox's. They will be side by side above the cremated remains of Penelope and Mary, one showing a hand with a pen, the other, a hand with a paintbrush.       
         Lady Sarah Consuelo Spencer-Churchill, a volunteer worker who was a cousin of Winston Churchill, died on Friday in Middletown, Conn. She was 78 and lived in Old Lyme, Conn. Her family said she died during surgery.         Lady Sarah was a sister of John George Vanderbilt Henry Spencer-Churchill, the 11th Duke of Marlborough. She was a granddaughter of the American heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt, whose marriage to the ninth Duke of Marlborough ended in divorce.         Lady Sarah raised funds for battered women and other charitable causes in Connecticut. She paid for a church and did volunteer hospital work in Jamaica. There, gunmen attacked and robbed her in 1977 in her home near Montego Bay.         During World War II, she did war work as a mechanic in a London factory. She came to the United States in 1945.         She was a volunteer for the Heart Fund, the Kidney Foundation, the Parkinson's Disease Foundation, Southampton Hospital on Long Island, and Just One Break, a nonprofit placement agency for the disabled.         Lady Sarah was born in Northamptonshire, England, and grew up partly in Blenheim Palace. Her father was the 10th Duke of Marlborough. Her mother was born Alexandra Mary Cadogan, a granddaughter of the fifth Earl Cadogan.         Her marriages to Edwin F. Russell in 1943, Guy Burgos in 1966 and Theodorous Roubanis in 1967 all ended in divorce.         Besides her brother the duke, she is survived by four daughters, Serena Balfour of London, Consuelo Russell and Jacqueline Williams, both of Manhattan, and Alexandra Birch of Pennsylvania; a sister, Lady Rosemary Muir of Berkshire, England; a brother, Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill of London; and 10 grandchildren.       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later served as editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.         Ms. Fanning died of colon cancer at her Boston home, where she lived with her husband and was writing a book about her years in Alaska. She was regarded as a pioneering figure in the world of journalism, especially because she was working at a time when few women held positions of power within the industry.         Under her ownership, the Daily News fought its way up from a circulation of 12,000 to 50,000, becoming Alaska's largest newspaper. Along the way, it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for a 15-part series on the powerful Teamsters union in Alaska.         The newspaper also took controversial liberal stands on gun control, environmental issues and the land rights of Alaskan natives, earning it the enmity of the business establishment.         Nothing in Ms. Fanning's childhood and early married life hinted that she would, at nearly age 40, reinvent herself as a risk-taking journalist.         She was born on Oct. 18, 1927, in Joliet, Ill. The only child of a bank president, she went to private schools, made her debut at a tea dance in 1945 and graduated from Smith College in 1949. That year, she met Marshall Field IV, a multimillionaire whose family owned a department store chain and published The Chicago Sun-Times.         She once credited that marriage as her introduction and informal education in the world of journalism, but never considered working in the field until much later. While her husband ran the business, she volunteered at various charities. Society columnists dubbed her ''the Grace Kelly of Chicago.''         But in 1963, Ms. Fanning and her husband divorced because of what she later called her discontent with the high-society lifestyle. She joined the Christian Science church. Then in 1965, she piled her three children into a Buick station wagon and drove north on the Alaska Highway.         ''After the divorce, my life was on a downhill slide,'' she told a writer for Town & Country in 1986. ''I needed to grab onto something solid and permanent.''         She found that in the rugged land of Alaska.         At the end of their road trip, the family settled in Anchorage. The Daily News, an eight-page tabloid that was then overshadowed by The Anchorage Times, hired Ms. Fanning to organize its library for $2 an hour. She quickly moved up through the ranks to become a reporter whose byline appeared frequently on the front page. She once credited Alaska with fostering the kind of opportunities that anyone with willpower and an entrepreneurial spirit could take advantage of.         In 1966, she married Larry Fanning, who had worked as editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He had gone to Alaska to help Ms. Fanning sell her house but became enamored with the state. Against the advice of several friends, the two bought the Daily News in 1967. The newspaper began running investigative stories that riled the corporate establishment. Many businesses refused to advertise in the newspaper.         Mr. Fanning died at his desk of a heart attack in 1971. His wife became the sole editor and publisher, and persisted in keeping up the newspaper's crusading efforts. Under her tenure, and with large infusions of money from Ted Field, Ms. Fanning's son from her first marriage, the newspaper continued to thrive. It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.         In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor. She married her third husband, Amos Mathews, around the same time. During her five years at The Monitor, she was credited with building up the publication's news coverage. But in 1988, she and two other top editors resigned over budget cuts imposed by the church.         After she left The Monitor, Ms. Fanning spent a year at the Institute of Politics at Harvard. She then taught classes as an adjunct professor at Boston University until 1993.         While living in Boston, Ms. Fanning also held influential positions at several news organizations. She became the first woman president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and she joined the board of directors of The Boston Globe Newspaper Company in 1992. From 1988 to 1989, she sat on the board of directors of The Associated Press. She also served on the board of several charitable foundations.         In her final years, she began work on a memoir about her work in Alaska. She never really left the state that she loved -- she and her husband kept a home in Anchorage where they lived for four months each year. The two also traveled extensively, taking trips to Syria, Jordan, Russia and Malaysia.         Ms. Fanning is survived by her husband and three children: Mr. Field of Los Angeles, Katherine Stephen of Washington, D.C., and Barbara Field of Boston.       
         Jacquelyn Reinach, a writer, composer, television producer and co-creator of the ''Sweet Pickles'' series of children's books, which featured characters like Accusing Alligator and Smarty Stork, died on Sept. 30 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 70.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son Barron. A former smoker, she had produced anti-tobacco programs for the American Cancer Society and other groups.         Although Ms. Reinach wrote more than 50 books and 600 songs, several musical shows and educational productions and contributed to Shari Lewis's television series ''Lamb Chop Play Along'' on PBS, she was best known for the ''Sweet Pickles'' books first published in 1976.         The series, which she created with Richard Hefter, a writer and illustrator, and Ruth Lerner Perle, based on a menagerie of alphabetical animals with gentle foibles, sold more than 50 million copies. It also secured her a substantial fortune as the books and marketing tie-ins went on to generate more than $200 million in worldwide sales. The books, which went out of print in the mid-1990's, are now traded regularly on eBay and may be revived under a new publishing contract, Mr. Hefter said.         Mr. Hefter said the phenomenon began with the notion of ''a peer group with no authority figures.''         ''There'd be no parents, no family, just alphabetic characters equally divided between male and female,'' he said. ''Because Jackie was a psychologist by training, each character was given a specific personality trait.''         ''The behaviors were never corrected,'' he added. ''Goof-Off Goose always goofs off, and others learn to accept it. Accusing Alligator learns a lesson but remains the same. They're all lovable in their foibles, and none are menacing.''         Ms. Reinach came up with the series title to suggest that life's problems were resolvable pickles, Mr. Hefter said. ''Holt, Reinhart hated the name, so we kept it,'' he said. The publisher sold 10 million copies, and the Weekly Reader Book Club, owned by Xerox, sold 40 million more.         The first 26 books used characters going through the alphabet -- Bashful Bear, Clever Camel, all the way to Zany Zebra -- but when a demanding public clamored for more, the partners made up 14 new stories with the same cast.         Jacquelyn Krasne Reinach was born in Omaha, grew up in Beverly Hills and graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of California at Los Angeles before moving to New York. She wrote scripts for the Fran Allison ''Learn at Home'' television series and worked with Shari Lewis on a series of ''Headstart'' books for McGraw-Hill. She won an Emmy in 1993 for a young people's anti-smoking program, ''Know the Facts: Keep Your Power,'' and wrote and produced a traveling school program for the American Heart Association.         In 1966 she was the organizing force behind an effort by Upper East Side parents to occupy their restless sons on weekends. Called Operation Saturday, it shuttled the boys from sports fields to airport freight hangars and magazine photo labs.         Among her 600 songs was ''Liberation, Now!'' which became the feminist anthem of the Women's Strike for Peace in 1970. (That year she also wrote a 300-recipe feminist cookbook: ''How to Enjoy the Leisure Life in a Beach House, Mountain Cabin, Lake Shack, Ski Chalet, Trailer, Country Home or City Apartment.'') Another song, ''The Family,'' became the theme of the United Nations' Year of the Family in 1994.         Her shows included ''Love Is Spoken Here,'' written with Stanley Ralph Ross and staged at the Maine State Music Theater.         Ms. Reinach's first three marriages ended in divorce. In addition to her son Barron, of Manhattan, she is survived by her fourth husband, Dion Neutra, an architect and the son and partner of the modernist architect Richard Neutra, whom she married this year; another son, Alan, of Fillmore, Calif.; a brother, Donald Krasne of Beverly Hills; and her mother, Dorothy Krasne of Los Angeles.         In her final months Ms. Reinach kept up a busy schedule and signed a contract to publish three new children's books. ''She had 25 years of things to do,'' said her son Barron. The first new book is to be published this spring: ''Mr. Raccoon, Where's Your Spoon?''       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later was editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.

It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.         In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor.

         Dr. Miriam M. Salpeter, a neurobiologist whose research contributed to the understanding and treatment of neuromuscular disorders like myasthenia gravis, died on Tuesday at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, N.Y. A resident of Ithaca, she was 71.         The cause was thyroid cancer, her family said.         Dr. Salpeter was chairwoman of the department of neurobiology and behavior at Cornell University from 1982 to 1988. At her death, she was a professor in the department, a position she had held since 1973.         Dr. Salpeter specialized in electron microscopy and the study of regeneration and synapses, the minute space between nerve or muscle cells through which nerve impulses are transmitted. She wrote about 150 scientific papers and edited several books on the subject, including ''The Vertebrate Neuromuscular Junction.''         An expert in cell biology, she teamed with Dr. Lewis Bachmann, an Austrian scientist, and Dr. Edwin E. Salpeter, her husband, to invent a technique that lets scientists see individual signaling molecules and to determine their position and quantity in cells, crucial measurements.         She later applied the discovery of the technique, quantitative electron microscopic radiography, to biological questions related to synapses.  The technique shed new light on the function of the neuromuscular synapse and the disorders associated with it. One such disorder, myasthenia gravis, stems from faulty nerve conduction. It often causes serious chronic muscle weakness in the face and neck, resulting in drooping eyelids, slurred speech and double vision.         Known as Mika, she was born Mirle Mark in Riga, Latvia. Her family moved to Canada and, in 1945, on to New York, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa in psychology from Hunter College in 1950.         She received a Ph.D. in psychobiology and neuroanatomy at Cornell in 1953 and did postgraduate work in neuroanatomy and cell biology at Cornell and Case Western Reserve University.         Besides her husband, a Cornell professor emeritus, she is survived by two daughters, Judy Salpeter of Berkeley, Calif., and Dr. Shelley Salpeter of Woodside, Calif.; a sister, Naomi Lasher of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.       
         Sophie Koulomzin, a leading Orthodox Christian educator whose life encompassed the history of 20th-century Russia and the experience of Russian emigres, died in Valley Cottage, N.Y., on Friday. She was 96.         A longtime seminary instructor in the United States, she wrote widely used textbooks and church histories for use by emigres and lived to see them published in Russia, where she visited and lectured in the last few years of her life.         She was born Sophie Schidlovsky  in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1903, the daughter of Sergei Schidlovsky, the last vice president of the Czar's Duma, or Parliament.         A life of privilege was replaced by one of poverty as the family endured the first years of Soviet rule, then fled, first to Estonia, where her father died, then Berlin, then Paris.         In Germany, she studied philosophy at the University of Berlin and took part in philosophical discussions led by Nikolai Berdyaev, the Rev. Sergius Bulgakov and Semyon Frank, leading Russian religious thinkers and former Marxists who became liberal Christians and were expelled from the Soviet Union by Lenin in 1922. They were formative in her development as a broad-minded Orthodox Christian activist.         In 1926, a scholarship from the John D. Rockefeller Fund took her to the United States, where she graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in religious education.         Returning to Paris, she became a leader of the Russian Christian Student Movement, taught emigre children and edited two volumes of church school lessons. The student organization was financed by the Young Men's Christian Association, which at the time actively supported the efforts of Russian emigres to establish their church in exile.         Mrs. Koulomzin also did social work among poor Russian emigres, working with Elizabeth Skobtsova, who became an Orthodox nun known as Mother Maria and died in the Ravensbruck concentration camp after trying to help save Jews during the German occupation.         Mrs. Koulomzin was married in 1932 to Nikita Koulomzin, an engineer who was also of aristocratic descent, who survives her. She is also survived by their daughters, Elizabeth Lopukhin, Olga Poloukhine and Xenia Kalinin; their son, George; 11 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.         Surviving the occupation, the family lived in Paris and then in the French provinces, where they helped Soviet prisoners of war taken by the Germans.         In 1948, the Koulomzins moved to Nyack, N.Y. Mrs. Koulomzin worked as a religious educator, creating an English-language education program and lecturing across the country. She founded the Orthodox Christian Education Commission to coordinate the work of the various Orthodox Christian ethnic groups in America.         Beginning in 1954, she taught for nearly 20 years at St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, N.Y.,         After her official retirement in 1974, she continued working. At the time of her death she was president of Religious Books for Russia, founded to send Bibles and religious literature to Russia; it has continued its work in Russia.         Mrs. Koulomzin's books, including ''God Is With Us,'' ''History of the Orthodox Church'' and 'Our Church and Our Children,'' have become classic texts in Orthodox religious education. In recent years her books were widely published in Russia. Her memoir, ''Many Worlds: A Russian Life,'' written when she was 77, ends with an account of her first visit back to her homeland, in 1970.         ''Now I had again come briefly in touch with life there and suddenly I realized that there was no absolute break, no complete separation,'' she wrote. ''My life, my own life, such as it was, came easily in touch with the flow of life that went on in Russia. I was together with Russia in the life of the Church, I was together with Russia in the search for spiritual values that is going on there.''       
         Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, the first woman in the world to serve as a prime minister, died yesterday shortly after voting in Sri Lanka's elections. She was 84.         Mrs. Bandaranaike's final act was to vote in a parliamentary election she hoped would return the family's party to power leading a governing coalition known as the People's Alliance. Her death from a heart attack on Election Day seemed poetically timed for a woman whose family business is politics and whose political career spanned four decades.         Mrs. Bandaranaike rose to power in 1960 as a bereaved wife and mother of three, just a year after her husband, Solomon, then prime minister, was assassinated by a Buddhist monk. She quickly established herself as the undisputed leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party -- founded by her husband -- and a formidable politician in her own right.         She also became the matriarch of a political dynasty. In the final years of her life, her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, succeeded her as the standard bearer of the family party and has served as president of the country since 1994. The father, mother and daughter have led Sri Lanka for 21 of the 52 years since it gained its independence from the British.         ''Mrs. Bandaranaike's legacy is this: After her husband died, there was so much confusion and the party was almost collapsing,'' said K. M. de Silva, a Sri Lankan historian. ''She was an untried leader. But she not only survived, she sustained the party and the family in politics.''         Her body was taken to her stately  home on Rosemead Place in the Cinnamon Gardens section of Colombo, the capital. State radio canceled regular programs to play elegiac music and state television looked back on her life.         She will be buried alongside her husband on Saturday in a state funeral at the family's ancestral home in Horagulla. Friday and Saturday have been declared days of national mourning. All liquor shops, bars, cinemas and slaughterhouses have been ordered to close.         ''She was a heroic mother of the nation,'' the Sri Lanka Freedom Party said in a statement.         But the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has come to stand for very different policies and values than it had in her day.         Mrs. Kumaratunga firmly repudiated her mother's brand of Sinhalese nationalism, which had inflamed ethnic tensions between the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese majority and the predominantly Hindu Tamil minority. The daughter's years in office have been dominated by her as-yet-fruitless efforts to end a 17-year-old war with separatist Tamil rebels. Mrs. Kumaratunga also steered the party toward a more open, market-oriented economy and away from the centralized, state-dominated socialism that had been her mother's trademark.         Mrs. Bandaranaike was born Sirimavo Ratwatte on April 17, 1916, into one of the island nation's wealthy feudal families, one that was at the pinnacle of Sri Lanka's social hierarchy. In 1940 -- 60 years ago today -- she married S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, the scion of an elite, feudal clan that had thrived for generations with the patronage of the British Empire.         Mr. Bandaranaike made the transition from his Anglicized, upper-class background to become a populist and a nationalist. And his wife carried forward his passions with even greater decisiveness and vigor,  historians say. She was a shrewd political leader with a wide base in the Sinhalese majority.         In a recent interview, Anura, the Bandaranaike's youngest child and only son, said their father had been the affectionate, demonstrative parent while their mother was aloof.         Mrs. Bandaranaike -- known simply as Mrs. B -- served twice as  head of state, from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1977. She nationalized many foreign and local enterprises and left Sri Lanka's economy into one that was heavily state dominated.         She also zealously pursued efforts to make Sinhalese the sole national language, a stance that deeply alienated the country's Tamil speakers. And she changed the university admissions policy to benefit the Sinhalese, disadvantaging the Tamils.         During five years of her daughter's presidency, Mrs. Bandaranaike served as prime minister, which had become a largely ceremonial role under the Constitution adopted in 1978. Increasingly feeble and unable to speak clearly, she resigned as prime minister in August, though she retained her seat in Parliament.         She lived on Rosemead Place with her elder daughter, Sunethra, a philanthropist who is 57 and never got involved in politics.         But the political family she had nurtured splintered in her later years. Her son, Anura, 51, who lives  next to his mother's home in the family compound, went over to the family's despised rival, the United National Party, after his sister, now 55, won the right to succeed their mother. But both the son, as a leader of the opposition, and the daughter, as president, have carried on the family's political tradition.       
         Sonja Bullaty, a photographer noted for lyrical composition and startling use of color and light in a vast body of work created during a five-decade collaboration with her husband, Angelo Lomeo, died on Oct. 5 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 76, and had homes in Manhattan and Bellmont, Vt.         The cause was cancer, Mr. Lomeo said.         Born in Prague into a Jewish banking family, Ms. Bullaty received her first camera at 14, a consolation gift from her father for having to abandon school and normal teenage activities as their world darkened with the approach of war.         ''I have loved the camera ever since, because it gave me joy and it gave me a life,'' she said. ''In the following difficult years I had no camera but often saw things indelibly etched on my mind. Perhaps to this day I search for some of those missing images.''         She was deported to Poland on her 18th birthday and spent the next four years in captivity, first in the Lodz Ghetto, then in the Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen concentration camps. Toward the end of the war, she escaped a death march near Dresden, which was then in flames, by hiding with a girlfriend in a haystack in the barn where the prisoners had been held for the night. Although Nazi soldiers, armed with pitchforks, were sent back to roust the women, they remained undetected, and Ms. Bullaty managed by stay alive until liberation allowed her to return to Prague.         There, she discovered that none of her family had survived.         Eventually, she sought out the well-known Czech photographer Josef Sudek and over time became what he called his ''apprentice-martyr,'' mixing chemicals for the darkroom, filing negatives and absorbing the unwritten rules of composition as she watched him print his dark, moody, almost abstract works. Master and pupil, they shared an affinity for the simplicity of windows and the mystery of reflections, and a fondness for patriotic kitsch and the seemingly banal. Ms. Bullaty wrote about her mentor in a 1978 book, ''Sudek.''         In 1947, she arrived in New York, her boat fare paid by distant relatives who found her name on a survivors' list and invited her to stay with them.         That same year, she met Mr. Lomeo when she inquired over an intercom about a darkroom in the building he managed and he went in search of the woman behind a voice he called ''the most beautiful I had ever heard.'' He offered her a gift of apples, and they became almost immediately inseparable. They married in 1951, and for five decades lived and worked together while managing to retain their individual visual perspectives. He is her only survivor.         During the next decade, the couple built a reputation photographing paintings and sculptures in museums and galleries.         They began shooting in black and white and were well into their joint career when they turned, in the early 1970's, to the vivid, saturated color now associated with them.         Critics often remarked on the painterly aspects of their compositions, on the evocations of Hopper and Magritte, of van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne and the Venetian colorists.         Together they made six books, ''Provence,'' ''Tuscany,'' ''Venice and the Veneto,'' ''Circle of Seasons: Central Park Celebrated,'' ''Vermont in All Weathers,'' and ''America America,'' published this year by Abbeville Press. Their photographs appeared in Life, Time and Audubon magazines and have been exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the International Center of Photography and George Eastman House in Rochester.         ''I want to express with it what I see, experience and feel, a world real or surreal, sad or funny, but a world uniquely my own,'' Ms. Bullaty said of the guiding force behind her work. ''Perhaps to live I needed to know there is beauty.''       
         Mireille Johnston, an author and television figure widely known for her cookbooks on French regional cuisines, died Oct. 5 at her home in Paris. She was 65.         Her death was unexpected, and the cause was not immediately clear, her family said.         Mrs. Johnston was born in France, received degrees from French and American universities, married an American in 1959 and lived for years in the United States before returning to France in 1977. She was bilingual and better known to Americans and Britons than to the French.         Her first cookbook, ''The Cuisine of the Sun'' (Biscuit Books, 1976), was applauded by the food critic Mimi Sheraton in The New York Times Book Review.         The book ''stays within the boundaries of Provence, concentrating on the author's native city, Nice,'' Ms. Sheraton wrote. ''There are wonderfully clear, complete and authentic recipes,'' she added. ''Appetizers, soups, fish and vegetable dishes are strong points in this collection, all so appetizing it was hard to read through without dashing into the kitchen to try some.''         In working on that book, Mrs. Johnston recalled last year, ''I wrote a sort of cookbook about my experiences, and I realized food was the key to so much -- a way of observing pleasures and economic trends in society.''         Her next cookbook, ''The Cuisine of the Rose'' (1982), was about classical Burgundian and Lyonnais cooking. The work was praised by other food connoisseurs, especially for its recipe for chicken with crawfish or shrimp.         Mrs. Johnston's book ''The French Family Feast'' (1988) was about home cooking and family dining traditions.         She also commented on French cuisine for American television. And she chatted with cooks and producers of food in various parts of France on two series of BBC television programs, titled ''A Cook's Tour of France,'' which were broadcast and rebroadcast in the 1990's.         She wrote two volumes, based on the series and bearing its title, about French regional cuisines and cultures. The volumes were published in the 90's -- first separately, then as a single book.         Her parents were Jean-Philippe and Marguerite Sigard Busticaccia.         From 1961 to 1968, she was an instructor in French literature, successively, at Yale, Barnard and Sarah Lawrence.         She is survived by her husband, Thomas M. C. Johnston, who is a former aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and two daughters, Margaret-Brooke Johnston-Clarke and Elizabeth Johnston, both of Paris.       
         Gwen Verdon, whose high-kicking artistry, flaming red hair and head-turning figure made her an unforgettable presence in musicals like ''Can-Can,'' ''Damn Yankees'' and ''Chicago,'' died yesterday in Woodstock, Vt. She was 75 and had homes in Bronxville, N.Y., and Quogue, N.Y.         She died at the home of her daughter, Nicole Fosse.         Widely regarded as the best dancer ever to brighten the Broadway stage, Ms. Verdon was also a performer who brought more than physical excitement to her roles. A highly capable actress as well as an exceptional dancer, she was adept at enriching the characters she played. Whether oozing seductive come-ons as the Devil's sexy troubleshooter in ''Damn Yankees'' or brooding over a whiskey as a disillusioned prostitute in a waterfront dive in ''New Girl in Town,'' a musical adaptation of  O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' she always reached for, and found, her character's heart.         The League of American Theaters and Producers said yesterday that the lights of Broadway's marquees would be dimmed in her memory at 8 p.m. last night.         Ms. Verdon's first Broadway success was explosive. In 1953 she auditioned for the Cole Porter musical ''Can-Can,'' and won a part as a featured dancer in the show, which was written and directed by Abe Burrows and had choreography by Michael Kidd. The show's star was the temperamental French actress and singer Lilo, who was not amused by the way audiences were applauding this redheaded newcomer during out-of-town tryouts and who saw to it that Ms. Verdon's part was cut back. Ms. Verdon, in turn, was disgusted enough to announce that she was quitting the show, and maybe even giving up dancing.         But on opening night on Broadway,  she delivered a fiery Apache dance that brought the audience to its feet -- and kept them there. She was already back in her dressing room for a costume change when one of the producers came pounding in to tell her that the audience was chanting her name and cheering and that she had to come back for a curtain call so that the show could continue. She took her bows, wearing a bathrobe, and knew she had arrived. Brooks Atkinson, in his review in The New York Times, cheered the ''impudence, recklessness and humor'' of her dancing and called her ''the practical star of the show.'' It was a late arrival for a dancer -- she was 28 and had been performing since the age of 3 -- but it was unforgettable.         ''Can-Can'' made Ms. Verdon a marquee name and brought her her first Tony Award. Nevertheless, she left the show before it ended its run and returned to working with the Hollywood choreographer Jack Cole, whose assistant she had been in the early 1950's. She was working on a film with Cole when she was approached by the producers of a new Broadway musical to be called ''Damn Yankees.'' Written by George Abbott and Douglass Wallop, the story centered on a Faustian deal made by a passionate baseball fan who agrees to sell his soul to the Devil for the chance to help his beloved Washington Senators beat the New York Yankees.         A Life and Career Linked to Fosse         The show had music and lyrics by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross and was to be directed by Abbott. Ms. Verdon was offered the part of Lola, the Devil's No. 1 helper. She wasn't eager to return to Broadway despite her success in ''Can-Can,'' but finally signed on. It would be her first experience with an up-and-coming choreographer named Bob Fosse, fresh from his first Broadway success with ''The Pajama Game.''         From that point on, Ms. Verdon's life and career were inextricably linked to Fosse. She was to become the living embodiment of his work on Broadway, and he in turn became her mentor, her lover and eventually her husband. Fosse soon found that working with Ms. Verdon was more of a collaboration than a tutorial. ''The happiest times I ever had with Gwen were when we were working together'' he said in an interview in 1971. ''They stimulated all sorts of things.''         For Ms. Verdon, working with Fosse provided ''direction like I've never had in my life.'' Years later, looking back on that experience, she recalled how ''Bob choreographs down to the second joint of your little finger.''         ''Damn Yankees'' opened to bravos in May 1955. Ms. Verdon's co-stars were Ray Walston as the Devil and Stephen Douglass as the hapless fan who is transformed into the home-run-hitting Joe Hardy. As Lola, Ms. Verdon brought the house down with her slinky rendition of ''Whatever Lola Wants,'' a locker-room seduction scene in which her sultry yet playful striptease for Shoeless Joe was hot enough to tempt the Devil himself. ''Damn Yankees'' racked up over a thousand performances and brought Ms. Verdon her second Tony. It was an impressive showing for a performer who spent her early childhood years laced into orthopedic boots to correct legs that had been weakened and deformed by a series of illnesses.         Gwyneth Evelyn Verdon was born on Jan. 16, 1925, in Culver City, Calif. Her parents were British expatriates. Her mother, Gertrude, had been a member of Denishawn, the influential modern dance troupe.Her father, Joseph, was an electrician at MGM. Show business was part of the household, and baby Gwyneth was pointed toward the stage from the time she could walk. When she wasn't wearing those knee-high corrective boots, she was being taught basic ballet, ballroom dancing and learning how to tap and do the old soft-shoe. At age 6, she was already performing in theaters where she was billed as ''the fastest little tapper in the world.'' By the time she graduated from high school, her career seemed well on its way.         But then, at 17, she eloped with a writer for The Hollywood Reporter, James Henaghan. The marriage lasted five years, until Mr. Henaghan's freewheeling lifestyle brought it to an end. The couple had a son, Jimmy, and after the divorce Ms. Verdon left him in the care of her parents and resumed her career.         She auditioned for Cole and was hired by the talented, ferociously  abrasive dance director. She became a member of Cole's troupe for five years and made her Broadway debut in his 1950 flop, ''Alive and Kicking.'' Cole's connections with Hollywood studios brought her work as a ''specialty dancer'' in several films, including ''On the Riviera.'' She also coached stars like Jane Russell in the art of moving sexily on screen.         When Mr. Kidd made his offer of a part in ''Can-Can,'' she was weary of anonymity, weary of Cole -- a perfectionist given to tantrums -- and ready to leave Hollywood for a second chance at success on Broadway. She wouldn't be seen on screen again until 1958, when she got star billing opposite Tab Hunter in the film adaptation of ''Damn Yankees.''         Ms. Verdon's fourth Broadway show was ''New Girl in Town,'' based on O'Neill's bleak tale about a waterfront prostitute's redemption through love. Directed by Abbott, with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill and choreography by Bob Fosse, ''New Girl in Town'' opened in May 1957 with Ms. Verdon in the title role. Brooks Atkinson called her performance ''sobering and admirable'' but found the show an uneasy blend of the antic and tragic. Nevertheless, Ms. Verdon came away with Tony No. 3, which she shared with her co-star, Thelma Ritter.         The musical that became the perfect showcase for Ms. Verdon's gifts as both dancer and actress was also the first of her shows to be both choreographed and directed by Fosse. The 1959 ''Redhead,'' which had music by Albert Hague and lyrics by Dorothy Fields had been written for the British music hall star Beatrice Lillie. But Ms. Lillie turned out to be otherwise engaged and Ms. Verdon agreed to star on the condition that Fosse be the director.         Ms. Verdon was cast as Essie Whimple, a shy worker in a London waxworks museum. It was a role in which she had ample opportunity to display her acting talent. And in the dances created for her by Fosse, she did everything from a tango to a ragtime strut, from Chaplinesque comedy to a brassy music-hall routine.She won another Tony Award, her fourth.         The following year, when ''Redhead'' was on tour in Chicago, Miss Verdon and Fosse were married, and by the time the tour reached Los Angeles she had decided to retire from show business with the intention of concentrating on family life. In 1963 their daughter, Nicole, was born. She is also survived by her son, Jimmy Henaghan of Los Angeles; four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.         Dance-Hall Hostess With Heart         It wasn't until 1966 that Ms. Verdon returned to the stage, in ''Sweet Charity.'' The musical had its unlikely roots in Fellini's film classic ''Nights of Cabiria.'' Once again, Fosse was director and choreographer. Ms. Verdon played the role immortalized by Giulietta Masina although the character had been changed from a Roman prostitute to a New York dance-hall hostess.         Even though the critics were less than ecstatic about ''Sweet Charity,'' Ms. Verdon was given numbers like ''Hey, Big Spender'' that added to her legend as a peerless performer on Broadway. The musical ran for more than 600 performances and became something of a cult favorite long after it closed. But increasing fatigue led Ms. Verdon to surrender the lead to Helen Gallagher before the show's run ended. When the 1968 Hollywood film version was being cast, Ms. Verdon lost out to the younger Shirley MacLaine.         Meanwhile, Fosse's open infidelities were disrupting their marriage, and by 1971 the couple were legally separated although they continued to work together on occasion and were never divorced.         A Chance To Play Roxie         In 1972, with her career as a dancer clearly drawing to a close, Ms. Verdon tried her hand at a thriller called ''Children! Children!'' which quickly flopped. But there was one more Broadway musical waiting in the wings and it would reunite Ms. Verdon and Fosse once again, onstage if not in marriage.         ''Chicago,'' which began life as a stage play in the 20's and then became a vehicle for Ginger Rogers in the 1942 film ''Roxie Hart,'' was a show Ms. Verdon had wanted to do for years. When Fosse decided to take it on as a musical, and John Kander and Fred Ebb signed on to write the score, Ms. Verdon at last got her chance to play Roxie, a woman jailed, tried and acquitted for shooting her lover.         When it opened in 1975, ''Chicago'' won applause for its three leads, Ms. Verdon, Chita Rivera and Jerry Orbach. Clive Barnes in The Times saluted ''three superlative, knock-em-in-the-aisles performances by three stars who glitter like gold dust all evening,'' but most of the critics found it too determinedly seedy and cynical for its own good. It proved to be Ms. Verdon's farewell to Broadway. Her successor in the role was Ann Reinking, Fosse's companion, who also restaged Fosse's choreography for the show's highly successful revival in 1996.         At Fosse's request, Ms. Verdon served as superviser of his 1978 musical, ''Dancin,' '' and also worked with him on his 1979 autobiographical film, ''All That Jazz.''         In 1983 Ms. Verdon appeared in a made-for-television movie, ''Legs,'' as the choreographer of the Rockettes. Her television appearances included ABC's daytime serial ''All My Children.''         The urge to perform also drew her back to Hollywood in the 1980's. She had a small role ''The Cotton Club'' (1984), and was part of a lauded acting ensemble in ''Cocoon'' (1985).         In 1999 she made an offstage return to Broadway as the artistic adviser for the musical ''Fosse,'' a compilation of highlights from his career. Ms. Verdon was with Fosse in 1987 when he died of a heart attack at age 60 on a Washington sidewalk, minutes after the opening of the revival of ''Sweet Charity,'' which she had helped him reconstruct. She attended to his funeral and, despite their many marital difficulties and years of separation, wholeheartedly assumed the duties of devoted widow, nourishing and helping to preserve his dance legacy, in which she had played such a vital role.         Their collaboration was relatively brief, but remarkably productive and intensely shared. Reflecting on their years together in an interview before Fosse's death, she said: ''I was a great dancer when he got hold of me, but he developed me, he created me.'' She made the most of it.         Correction:  October 24, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the Broadway dancer Gwen Verdon on Thursday misstated the title of a song in the 1966 musical ''Sweet Charity'' and misattributed the performance. The title was ''Big Spender,'' not ''Hey, Big Spender,'' and the performance was by a group of dancers, not by Ms. Verdon.       
         Frances Mercer, a model who took up acting and went on to appear in films and on Broadway, radio and television, died on Nov. 12 in Los Angeles. She was 85.         Born in New Rochelle, N.Y., on Oct. 21, 1915, Ms. Mercer began her modeling career while still a teenager and was a leading model in New York before making her film debut in 1938 in ''Vivacious Lady'' with Ginger Rogers and James Stewart.         In her brief but busy career in Hollywood, she made nine films, including ''The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle'' with Rogers and Fred Astaire; ''The Mad Miss Manton'' with Barbara Stanwyck; ''Beauty for the Asking'' with Lucille Ball; and ''Society Lawyer'' with Walter Pidgeon.         She returned to New York in 1939 to appear in the Broadway musical ''Very Warm for May,'' by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II. Her second Broadway show was ''Something for the Boys'' (1943), starring Ethel Merman and written by Cole Porter and Herbert and Dorothy Fields.         Television provided her with still another career change. Ms. Mercer appeared in the soap opera ''For Better or Worse'' and as a nurse in the syndicated medical series ''Dr. Hudson's Secret Journal,'' which ran from 1955 to 1957.         Her three marriages ended in divorce. No immediate family members survive.       
         Luise Kraus Addiss, an art-loving New Yorker who was the first person to be a member of the Metropolitan Museum for 75 years, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 101.         Mrs. Addiss was 99 when she set that record in 1999, the museum said. She received flowers and an invitation to lunch and a tour of the museum from Philippe de Montebello, its director, on a Monday, when it is closed. She was still a member when she died.         She was born in Akron, Ohio, where her Austrian-born father ran a plumbing business. She became the first girl in her family to go to college, and she arrived in New York in 1922 to study for a master's degree in home economics at Columbia University. She joined the Metropolitan in 1924.         Mrs. Addiss became a home economist at what is now the Community Service Society of New York and retired from the society after 40 years, when she was 65. Then she studied painting, was a consultant to the Head Start program for 10 years and then worked for Unicef for 10 years on projects like advocating breast feeding in developing countries.         She married Edward F. Addiss, a Burlington Industries executive, when she was 29. He died in 1954.         She is survived by two sons, James, of Manhattan, and Stephen, of Richmond; a daughter, Penelope Yungblut of Round Hill, Va.; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Pauline Baerwald Falk, a philanthropist and a collector of Asian art who was also a former president of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, died Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Mrs. Falk worked with Jewish refugees and other displaced people before and during World War II.         She was active in the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, a refugee organization, and became a founding member of the National Refugee Service (now the New York Association for New Americans), the Council for Jewish Women and the Jewish Social Service Association. She was also a founder of the New Lincoln School, a successor to the Lincoln School, in Manhattan.         She graduated from Smith College in 1932 and attended Columbia University's School of Social Work. In 1935, she married Myron S. Falk Jr.  Mr. Falk, who died in 1992 at 85, began amassing a vast collection of Asian art after making a trip to China in 1936.         The couple lent their artwork to museums and advised art institutions.         Mrs. Falk is survived by two daughters, Patricia, of Manhattan, and Nancy, of Cambridge, Mass.; a son, Michael, of Oakland, Calif.; six grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Belcher Dyk, one of the last surviving participants in the women's suffrage movement, died in her apartment in Rochester on Nov. 18. She was 99.         In a life that included working with delinquent girls, writing three books on psychology and producing anthropological studies of Navajo Indians with her husband, she never lost her fierce commitment to equality.         Only the protests of family members prevented her from going door to door in her wheelchair to canvass for Hillary Rodham Clinton's senatorial campaign in New York this fall. ''If I have learned one thing, New York needs a woman's touch,'' she said at rally for Mrs. Clinton on Aug. 22.         ''My mother was a suffragette,'' she said in the opening line of the Ken Burns documentary on the suffragists, ''Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,'' which was shown last year on the Public Broadcasting System. Her choice of word was surprising, said her daughter, Penelope Carter, of Rochester.         ''The word suffragette reminded her of the Rockettes,'' Ms. Carter said. ''She was a suffragist.''         Mrs. Dyk's deepest inspiration was her mother, Annie Manson Belcher. She was one of the first women admitted to Tufts Medical School in the late 19th century, but school officials made her drop out when she married, Ms. Carter said. The free spirit of Mrs. Belcher, who by then was married to Arthur Fuller Belcher, a lawyer, is suggested by a family story of borrowing a minister's house for a Maine vacation. When a a house of ill repute next door burned down, Mrs. Belcher graciously invited the prostitutes to stay in the minister's house, engendering a local scandal.         Mrs. Dyk and her mother walked side by side down Beacon Avenue in Boston to demand the vote. Both were overjoyed when the 19th Amendment became part of the Constitution on Aug. 26, 1920.         ''We had worked so long,'' Mrs. Dyk said in the documentary. ''If you had worked years to do it, if you believed in it, if you thought great things were going to come out of it -- great in terms of the position of women in our culture, position of women in jobs, position of women everywhere -- and this was going to improve that . . . I mean lives would be changed.''         Later in the documentary, she said she feared that women's lives ''haven't changed as much as we hoped for.'' She told friends and family members that if women had voted as a bloc, they could have effected more change. ''I don't know if we did enough with it,'' she said.         Mrs. Clinton, however, lauded her contributions in a statement after her death. ''Her devotion to her family, her profession and her work in both the local and global community is an example for women everywhere,'' the first lady said.         Mrs. Dyk was born in Portland, Me., on March 25, 1901. She was proud to say that her pedigree included several families from the Mayflower, including Myles Standish. She grew up in Newton Center, Mass., and, like her mother, attended Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass. She earned a master's degree in economics from Simmons College in Boston, and did further graduate work at the University of Wisconsin and the University of California at Berkeley.         She worked as a psychiatric social worker with delinquent girls in upstate New York, where, among other things, she taught her clients to play pool. She worked as a researcher at what was then called the Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York in Brooklyn, and was co-author of three books: ''Anxiety in Pregnancy and Childbirth'' (Hoeber, 1950); ''Psychological Differentiation'' (Wiley, 1962); and ''Left Handed'' (Columbia University Press, 1980).         She completed the last volume with her husband, Walter Dyk, an anthropologist who studied Navajo Indians. His principal work, called ''a revelation of the real life of the tribe'' by The New Yorker, was in the form of an autobiography of one man, ''Son of Old Man Hat,'' (Harcourt Brace, 1938).         After his death in 1972, Mrs. Dyk took transcripts of taped conversations and other research and wrote ''Left Handed,'' a continuation of the first book.         Ms. Carter said her mother's strong will was evident when Mr. Dyk was suffering from Parkinson's disease and cancer and she was juggling two jobs and raising two children in the 1950's and 1960's. ''What choice did I have? I did what I had to do,'' she said.         But when she had choices, she took an unconventional approach. ''One of my earliest memories was her looking me in the eye and saying with just a bit of venom, 'Don't be so good,' '' Ms. Carter said. ''She meant you've to have some spirit, go against the grain.''         Mrs. Dyk emphasized to her daughter that it was not necessary to marry, and that it was important to get the education that would allow her to live independently. When Ms. Carter began smoking, Mrs. Dyk said it was fine with her. With nothing to rebel against, the girl quit the next day.         In addition to Ms. Carter, Mrs. Dyk is survived by her son, Timothy, of Washington, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Dyk smoked into her 80's, drove into her 90's and voted in the recent election. She recalled how she felt when she was among the first women to vote.         ''I was terribly frightened that I would push the wrong lever,'' she said. ''I still go into that booth with the same feeling -- what if I voted Republican?''       
         Pauline Baerwald Falk, a philanthropist and a collector of Asian art who was also a former president of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, died Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Mrs. Falk worked with Jewish refugees and other displaced people before and during World War II.         She was active in the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, a refugee organization, and became a founding member of the National Refugee Service (now the New York Association for New Americans), the Council for Jewish Women and the Jewish Social Service Association. She was also a founder of the New Lincoln School, a successor to the Lincoln School, in Manhattan.         She graduated from Smith College in 1932 and attended Columbia University's School of Social Work. In 1935, she married Myron S. Falk Jr.         Mr. Falk, who died in 1992 at 85, began amassing a vast collection of Asian art after making a trip to China in 1936.         The couple lent their artwork to museums and advised art institutions.         Mrs. Falk is survived by two daughters, Patricia, of Manhattan, and Nancy, of Cambridge, Mass.; a son, Michael, of Oakland, Calif.; six grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         Lucia Evangelista, a former soprano, a notable figure in New Jersey cultural circles and the wife of the renowned American bass Jerome Hines, died on Oct. 26 in North Plainfield, N.J. She was 83 and had been suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease.         Ms. Evangelista was born in Genoa, Italy, on April 30, 1917. She studied voice at the Verdi Conservatory in her hometown and made her operatic debut at 19 as Mimi in ''La Boheme'' at the Teatro Politeama Genovese. After touring in Italy, she moved to the United States in 1947, then sang for two seasons with the New York City Opera.         In 1952 she sang Violetta in a one-hour abridged version of ''La Traviata'' for the ''Opera Cameos'' television program, which was widely shown. That same year she married Mr. Hines, a leading bass at the Metropolitan Opera. They eventually settled in Scotch Plains, N.J.         The couple made several concert tours together. After Ms. Evangelista retired from singing in 1957 to raise a family, she worked as an administrator and fund-raiser for arts organizations. She and Mr. Hines were co-founders of Opera Music Theater International, a training company for young singers. She also organized a series of benefits for the New Jersey State Opera, which were held at places like the Newark Museum and the Meadowlands.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by four sons, John and Russell, of Scotch Plains; David, of Boston; and Andrew, of Macungie, Pa.; and by 12 grandchildren.       
         Amalia Hernandez, the founder of the internationally successful Ballet Folklorico de Mexico, died on Saturday in Mexico City. She was 83.         Ms. Hernandez, a specialist in Mexican folk dance, created programs that resembled fiestas, notable for eye-catching choreography and colorful costumes. Her work included ensembles based on regional dances, hypothetical reconstructions of Aztec and Mayan ceremonies, scenes from Mexican history and evocations of village festivals.         In a review in The New York Times in 1965, Allen Hughes said: ''The company's performances are splendidly polished. Everything, including much estimable and intricate dancing, is done with a smoothness that belies the complexity of the show as a whole.''         One of her most famous works is  ''Deer Dance of the Yaqui Indians,'' based on a dance associated with this Mexican tribe. In Ms. Hernandez's version, a man wearing a headdress of antlers represents a deer pursued by hunters. The choreography is demanding and poignant. Commenting in The Times in 1976, Anna Kisselgoff called the dance ''a deeply moving testimony to the empathy of the hunters for the hunted.''         ''This is the way of the world,'' she continued. ''Man must kill his prey, but he respects that prey and endows it with noble qualities.''         Ballet Folklorico began as a company of eight in 1952. It gained national prominence in Mexico after being featured on weekly television programs in the 1950's.         The company eventually had more than 300 members and a school of its own. It often sent groups on tour while other dancers continued to perform at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the Mexico City opera house. Ballet Folklorico offered the first of many New York seasons in 1962 and was  popular at European dance festivals.         Born into a wealthy ranching family, Ms. Hernandez had lessons in classical ballet as a young woman. Later, she studied with La Argentinita, a specialist in Spanish dance, and with the American-born choreographer who called herself Waldeen and helped introduce modern dance to Mexico. But Ms. Hernandez chose to specialize in native dances, reworking local traditions to make them effective for the stage.         Discussing her approach in an interview in The Times in 1983, Ms. Hernandez observed: ''The authentic folklore was created either for a religious purpose or for fun, and dancing was basically something to do and not to watch. Folklore has to be theatricalized, adapted to the need of the theater and the audience.''         She is survived by two daughters, Viviana Basantes and Norma Lopez Hernandez (Ms. Lopez helped Ms. Hernandez direct the company in recent years); a son, Jose Luis Martinez; and a grandson, Salvador Lopez, also with the company.       
         Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, whose deep sense of obligation to others and passion for charity work led her to build an international network of homes and treatment centers for the sick and disabled, died on Thursday at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St. Edmunds, England. She was 77.         A small woman of indomitable energy who ate sparingly and often got out of bed at 4:30 a.m. and who liked to supervise her dozens of projects herself and delegate as little as possible, Lady Ryder was gripped by the notion that she had a moral mission to help the less advantaged -- the poor, the sick, the displaced.         She had a religious view of suffering and grace, once telling an interviewer, ''I believe that to be with people who are suffering, whoever they are, makes one humble.''         Her name was familiar to the British public through the 500 or so Sue Ryder charity shops in cities and towns across the country. Sales from the stores, which volunteers run and sell both new and used goods, are used to raise money for the Sue Ryder Foundation, the group that runs the Sue Ryder centers. Lady Ryder bought her own clothes from the stores.         She first got an inkling of what would be her life's work as a girl in Leeds, when her mother took her on mercy missions to the poor in the woeful slums there. Born Margaret Susan Ryder in 1923 into a prosperous farming family outside Leeds, Sue, as she was called, was the youngest of her mother's five surviving children.         As the Depression ground on in the mid-1930's, the family fell on hard times and left the family home and moved to what had been a summer cottage in Thurlow, Suffolk.         Sue Ryder, who once thought that she would become a nun, married a young naval officer at 18. He was killed in the war several weeks later.         Lying about her age, she volunteered as a nurse and was soon sent to work at the Polish section of the Special Operations Executive, which ran spies and helped resistance organizations in enemy territory. Her work there gave her a lifelong sympathy for refugees and for prisoners and other casualties of war.         It also left her with an abiding admiration for Poland. She took the name of the country's capital as part of her title when she was elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer in 1979.         After the war, she worked in camps for displaced persons and, among other activities, organized trips to British vacation houses for survivors of concentration camp. She also did relief work in France, meeting the practical problems she encountered with a typically stubborn belief in her abilities. Once, a truck that she was driving laden with stoves and drugs to combat tuberculosis and typhus broke down in midjourney. She pushed it to the side of the road with the help of passers-by and proceeded to clean the carburetor and replace the spark plugs herself before setting off again.         In 1953, she used a small inheritance and some borrowed money to found the Sue Ryder Foundation, whose symbol is rosemary, a sign of remembrance. The foundation was dedicated to the memory of those who had been killed in the two world wars.         Soon after, she opened the first Sue Ryder Home, for disabled people. By 1965, she had established 30 homes, where those bearing the scars of the war lived in comfort and without restriction, in England, Germany, Greece, Poland and Yugoslavia.         As Europe rebuilt itself after the war, Sue Ryder became a champion for the dispossessed. She traveled 50,000 miles a year, often driving, carrying supplies across the Continent, supervising the homebuilding and visiting refugees.         Through the years, Lady Ryder's organization continued to expand. There are now 20 homes in Britain and 80 centers in 20 countries around the world. In Britain, the organization has 2,500 employees.         There are residential centers and day-care centers that provide help for those with long-term illnesses and for those who need palliative care, and centers for people with neurological and degenerative diseases. Each year in Britain, 3,000 people are cared for at the residential centers, 12,000 visits are made to the day centers, and more than 37,000 home visits are made by the nursing staff.         In 1998, Lady Ryder retired as a trustee of the organization that she founded as a dispute about its future raged. She founded a new group, the Bouverie Foundation. The Sue Ryder Foundation has been renamed Sue Ryder Care, and it is being reorganized and modernized.         In 1959, Sue Ryder married Group Capt. Leonard Cheshire, a war hero and holder of the Victoria Cross. It was a true meeting of interests. Captain Cheshire, it happened, had his own charitable foundation, and he first met his future wife when she visited one of his homes for the disabled. Her husband. was elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer in 1991. He died the next year. The couple had two children, Jeremy and Elizabeth, who survive.         In 1979, the Queen Mother opened the Sue Ryder Foundation Museum in Cavendish, with exhibitions that included Lady Ryder's war uniforms and a reconstruction of her mother's room. But Lady Ryder insisted that her work was about the people whom she helped rather than herself.         The museum, she said, was a tribute ''to all those who suffered and who continue to suffer.''         ''It is intended,'' she added, ''to show the misery in the world and the needs which exist more vividly than the written word could do. It is not dedicated to me.''       
         Rosalind Baker Wilson, an editor and writer who published a memoir of her father, Edmund Wilson, one of America's foremost men of letters, died on Oct. 30 in Syracuse. She was 79 and lived in Talcottville, N.Y.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said Tim Page, a friend.         Ms. Wilson was the author of ''Near the Magician: A Memoir of My Father, Edmund Wilson'' (Weidenfeld, 1990). She also published short stories and served as an editor at The New Yorker and Houghton Mifflin, the publisher.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Wilson attended Bennington College and Columbia University and started her career in the 1940's. In the 1960's she moved to Talcottville, the Black River family seat Edmund Wilson memorialized in ''Upstate'' (1970).         She was Wilson's elder daughter, by the first of his four wives, Mary Blair.         She is survived by a stepbrother, Reuell Kimball Wilson of London, Ont.; and a stepsister, Helen Miranda Wilson of Wellfleet, Mass.         Correction:  November 11, 2000, Saturday  An obituary of the writer and editor Rosalind Baker Wilson on Thursday misstated her relationship to two survivors. Reuel Wilson of London, Ontario, was her half brother and Helen Miranda Wilson of Wellfleet, Mass., her half sister -- not stepbrother and stepsister.         Correction:  January 8, 2001, Monday  An obituary on Nov. 9 about Rosalind Baker Wilson, a writer and daughter of the critic Edmund Wilson, misstated her age. She was 77, not 79. This correction was delayed by an editing lapse.       
         Teresa Sterne, a pioneering producer of classical recordings, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said a friend, Norma Hurlburt, executive director of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.         As the director of Nonesuch Records from 1965 through 1979, Ms. Sterne turned a small budget label into one of the most adventurous companies in the recording business.  When she was invited to take charge of Nonesuch, the label was a subsidiary of the pop-oriented and profitable Elektra Records. Nonesuch's business had consisted mostly of acquiring the rights to existing recordings of Baroque music by European ensembles and reissuing them at budget prices in the United States.         Ms. Sterne, called Tracey by her friends and colleagues, brought a vision to the job born of her long experience in music. She had been a piano prodigy, and though she gave up public performance as an adult, she maintained close ties with the composers and performers of her day.         At Nonesuch she brought attention to areas of music neglected by the major labels, particularly contemporary music and American vernacular music. She championed American composers like George Crumb, Elliott Carter, Morton Subotnick, Charles Wuorinen and Donald Martino, not just recording their works but commissioning them, an unusual move for the leader of a record company. She also issued important recordings of lesser-known works by Schoenberg, Busoni, Stravinsky and other major figures.         She nurtured relationships with several excellent performers not widely known at the time, like the pianist Paul Jacobs, the mezzo-soprano Jan DeGaetani and the pianist Gilbert Kalish. Many of the artists she discovered were first recognized  for their work in contemporary music. Ms. Sterne encouraged them to  record past works that interested them as well, like Jacobs's critically hailed recording of the Debussy etudes and Mr. Kalish's engaging survey of the Haydn piano sonatas.         The mezzo-soprano Joan Morris and her husband and professional partner, the composer and pianist William Bolcom, made some popular Nonesuch recordings of vernacular American songs from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. And Ms. Sterne sparked a nationwide craze for ragtime with a series of Scott Joplin piano works played by Joshua Rifkin.         She was also in the forefront of the early instrument movement in Baroque and Renaissance repertory. And under her leadership, Nonesuch's Explorer series introduced music from Bali, India, Peru and other countries to a wider audience. Ms. Sterne believed that every record she produced should have a purpose, and she involved herself with everything, from the packaging to the liner notes.         But in late 1979 she was dismissed from Nonesuch. Early in her tenure the record label had been acquired by Warner Communications, and by the mid-1970's, it was grouped under a parent company, Elektra/Asylum/ Nonesuch, headed by Joe Smith. Warner officials asserted that Nonesuch was losing money. In an interview with The Boston Globe at the time, Mr. Smith said: ''Nonesuch is in business, and it is losing its credibility in its marketplace. We can't make records that sell only outside the Russian Tea Room.''         Ms. Sterne argued that the losses were mostly caused by the parent company's poor marketing and distribution. A letter condemning her dismissal, written by 10 Pulitzer Prize-winning composers, including Mr. Carter and Aaron Copland, was sent to the vice president of Warner Communications and widely circulated in the press, to no avail.         Ms. Sterne never anticipated becoming a record producer. She was born in Brooklyn on March 29, 1927, to a cultured family with a toehold on the middle class. Her mother was a cellist who gave up her career to nurture her musical daughter. Ms. Sterne's father, a violinist, deserted the family when she was 14. Her paternal uncle, Robert Sterne, a professional violinist, became an important mentor.         From the age of 10, she was educated at home by private tutors, living with her mother and a beloved aunt in ''a kind of aristocratic poverty,'' as she once told a friend. In 1939, when she was 12, she made her professional debut as a pianist playing Grieg's Piano Concerto with the NBC Symphony Orchestra at Madison Square Garden. The next year she played Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto with the New York Philharmonic at Lewisohn Stadium, winning cheers from the audience and glowing reviews from critics. Her career as a prodigy flourished.         But after such a rarefied and isolated upbringing, Ms. Sterne felt that she lacked the pragmatism and confidence to pursue a professional career. Wanting experience in the real world, she became a secretary, soon winding up in the offices of the powerful manager Sol Hurok, where she nurtured the careers of other young artists. A series of administrative jobs, including assistant to the director at Vanguard Records, led to her  hiring by Nonesuch.         Ms. Sterne, who never married, leaves no immediate survivors. After her dismissal from Nonesuch, the company went through many changes. Earlier this year, Robert Hurwitz, its director since 1984 and a great admirer of Ms. Sterne, issued a two-disc recording in tribute to her, containing highlights from favorite albums she had produced and live recordings of performances she gave in her early years as a piano prodigy.       
         Alice Recknagel Ireys, one of the most prominent landscape architects of the second half of the 20th century, with more than 1,000 public and private projects to her name, died Tuesday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.         A bridge between the 19th-century tradition of gracious landscaping for grand estates and elegant modern design for postwar suburban homes, she also created many major public garden spaces. Important projects can be seen in both the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.         One of her famous designs was for the Fragrance Garden at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which became a prototype internationally for gardens used by people with disabilities.         Born in Brooklyn on April 24, 1911, as Alice Recknagel, Mrs. Ireys lived all her life in the Brooklyn Heights town house occupied since 1835 by five generations of her family.         Her serious gardening began in a youth program at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which was founded in 1910, a year before her birth.         ''The Burpee company provided the seeds, and after we planted them and followed their growth, we were allowed to take the plants home,'' she recalled in an interview not long before her death.         In 1935, she completed her formal training as a landscape architect at the Cambridge School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture in Massachusetts when it was affiliated with Smith College.         Before setting up her own practice in 1947 in her home, she worked in Manhattan with other landscape architects, mostly women, on public housing projects, public playgrounds, college campuses and lakeside plantings at the 1939 New York World's Fair.         Mrs. Ireys traveled to England and France and worked in 17 states, but it was her native Brooklyn, with its famous botanic garden, that commanded her attention and affection over a lifetime.         She was one of the remaining links to a golden age of landscape architecture as a profession for women, beginning around the end of the 19th century. Her principles formed a critical transition in American garden history between the great estate era and the explosion of suburban and town gardens that followed World War II.         By scaling down and reconfiguring broad terraces, flower walks and parterres, she conferred on modest properties the same sense of privilege and gracious outdoor living that had once been reserved for country estates. She made a great virtue of the serpentine line to give the illusion of length and breadth.         She emphasized the simple pleasures of walking around flower beds, sitting under the dappled shade of a tree or dining with friends on a terrace. Achieving this, however, required underlying construction and a sophisticated selection of plants and trees compatible with the climate and the care that could be supplied.         ''To produce a living functional picture as well as a beautiful one'' was how Mrs. Ireys defined garden design in the first of her four books, ''How to Plan and Plant Your Own Property'' (1967). Her books, with their accessible prose, site plans and photographs, have served as basic training for many in the next generation of professional landscape architects and for amateurs as well.         She also wrote ''Small Gardens for City and Country'' (1978) and two books published in 1991 for W. Atlee Burpee & Company, ''Designs for American Gardens'' and ''Garden Designs,'' which included her popular planting plans, originally published in Burpee catalogs.         Mrs. Ireys considered it a challenge to design a garden of any size. ''Once,'' she reminisced, ''I met a woman who wanted a garden but could not afford one, so we made a deal. I designed and planted her garden, and she delivered two loaves of homemade bread to us once a week for two years. My children were thrilled.''         Galen Williams, a landscape designer in East Hampton, N.Y, who assisted her, recalled: ''Her eye was so finely tuned that once after appraising a mock-up for a front and side fence, Mrs. Ireys requested that one section be lowered by an inch and the other by a half-inch. The next time it was perfect.''         After a major planting of evergreens was completed by Mrs. Ireys, Ms. Williams recalled, ''the trees instantly looked as if they had been there for 50 years.''         The way her gardens settled into the landscape gave them a sense of timelessness, even though they had to be carefully monitored.         ''If you do well in people's gardens, they keep coming back,'' was Mrs. Ireys's summation of her long career. But she could also bluntly tell one client to remove a row of azaleas because ''it looks like motel planting.''         In later years, she inspected large gardens from the vantage of a golf cart, using her cane as a pointer.         In Manhattan, Mrs. Ireys's public work can be seen in the colonial-style garden behind the Mount Vernon Hotel Museum and Garden, the former Abigail Adams Smith Museum on East 61st Street, a 1799 carriage house that became a popular hotel on the East River.         In 1988, at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, she designed two gardens, the Mae L. Wien Cutting Garden and Helen's Garden of Fragrant Plants, a memorial to Helen Goodhart Altschul, who was blind for the last 20 years of her life. Both demonstrate an array of visual tricks that make small plots appear larger.         In 1978, Mrs. Ireys was elected a fellow in the American Society of Landscape Architects. In 1991, she received the Liberty Hyde Bailey Award from the American Horticultural Society. Recently, she gave her professional papers to Smith College. A documentary film about her life and work, ''The Living Landscapes of Alice Recknagel Ireys,'' by Malcolm MacDougall, was released this year.         Mrs. Ireys is survived by a sister, Catherine Ropes of Hartsdale, N.Y.; two daughters, Catherine Gandel of Los Angeles and Dr. Anne Lennon of Green Harbor, Mass.; a son, Dr. Henry T. Ireys of Baltimore; and five grandsons. Her husband, Henry T. Ireys, whom she married in 1943, died in 1963.         Next June, Mrs. Ireys was to receive the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Better Earth Award, recognizing people who are engaged in important environmental work in the community that benefits the planet. As a lecturer and designer at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden for more than 50 years, Mrs. Ireys considered the garden her true home and did her most important community project for it.         The Fragrance Garden she designed there was completed in 1955 and later extensively restored. It is accessible to the blind and to visitors who use wheelchairs. An oval garden with raised perimeter beds that can be easily touched and smelled, the Fragrance Garden is divided into four sections with Braille labels: fragrant flowers, plants for touch, plants with scented leaves and kitchen herbs. The flagstone walk around the central lawn makes it easy to move around the edges.         ''At night when I can't sleep,'' Mrs. Ireys said, ''I think about my different jobs and what fun they all were.''       
         Christabel Leighton-Porter, who became the sweetheart of British troops in World War II as the model for a comic strip heroine who was forever shedding her clothes, died Dec. 6 in Horsham, England. She was 87.         While American troops ogled pinups of Betty Grable and the Varga girls of Esquire magazine, British soldiers, sailors and airmen went to war inspired by The Daily Mirror's comic strip ''Jane.''         Six days a week, Jane, a curvaceous blonde secret agent -- Mrs. Leighton-Porter as drawn by Norman Pett -- found herself in madcap escapades. Jane tangled with Nazi spies, tumbled down cliffs and became caught in tree branches in episodes that invariably concluded with her stripped down to her underclothes.         When she was not posing as Jane, Mrs. Leighton-Porter traveled around England in a chorus-girl show, ''Jane in The Mirror,'' entertaining servicemen and bucking up home front morale.         ''Suddenly I became a sweetheart all over the world,'' she recalled. ''One admiral told me that there wasn't anybody on the ships, from the lowest rating to the highest in the fleet, who didn't have a drawing of Jane in his pocket or on his bunk.''         Christabel Jane Drewry was born on April 11, 1913, in Eastleigh, England; her father worked at the town carriage works. In her late teens, she became an artist's model, and in 1939 she was acclaimed Britain's Perfect Girl in a beauty pageant at the London Palladium.         She was discovered by Mr. Pett while modeling at an art school in Birmingham, where she also worked as a telephone operator. Mr. Pett had been drawing for The Daily Mirror since 1932, when he created ''Jane's Journal: The Diary of a Bright Young Thing,'' using his wife, Mary, as a model. But Mrs. Pett grew interested in golf as the years passed and the newspaper became interested in a Jane who revealed some flesh.         When Britain went to war in 1939, Mrs. Leighton-Porter's Jane began to lose her garments and the comic strip began to gain a huge audience on the fighting fronts. Bomber crews painted Jane on Lancaster fuselages, submarines went to war with weeks of her advance comic panels stored away, and tank crews plastered Jane's undraped likeness on their turrets. Churchill is said to have cited Jane's morale-boosting as Britain's secret weapon.         Jane finally shed every stitch of her clothing in a September 1944 episode. The Daily Mirror reported that a British infantry division was so inspired that it advanced six miles in France the very next day.         Notwithstanding her achievements in the war effort, Mrs. Leighton-Porter had to negotiate with the lord chamberlain, the court official responsible for censoring stage shows, when she made her stage appearances in scanty outfits. ''They were never offensive,'' she said of those shows. ''I was very modest.''         Jane received numerous marriage proposals, but the smitten soldiers  did not know that the real Jane was married, something Mrs. Leighton-Porter kept secret so as not to disappoint her fans. Her husband, Arthur, was a Royal Air Force pilot.         Mrs. Leighton-Porter continued modeling for ''Jane'' after the war, and when Mr. Pett left The Daily Mirror in 1948, the drawings were taken over by his assistant, Michael Hubbard. The next year, Mrs. Leighton-Porter appeared in the British movie ''The Adventures of Jane.''         The comic strip continued until 1959, when Jane sailed into the sunset with her boyfriend, Georgie Porgie. Mrs. Leighton-Porter settled into family life in Bermuda and in England, turning to more staid endeavors like sponsoring teas for a cricket team in Horsham.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Simon.         Neither Jane nor Mrs. Leighton-Porter was forgotten. The BBC developed a television show based on the ''Jane'' comic strip in the early 1980's, and Mrs. Leighton-Porter appeared at servicemen's reunions. In 1993, the Imperial War Museum displayed her 1940's frilly knickers in its exhibition ''Forces Sweethearts,'' the story of wartime romance from World War I to the gulf war. In June 1994, Mrs. Leighton-Porter attended ceremonies observing the 50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.         When she reflected on the comic strip's popularity, Mrs. Leighton-Porter chose not to dwell on the risque. ''I think it was because Jane was a bit girl-next-doorish, a bit of England for the boys,'' she said. ''Jane became a cult thing really, and I think wives and girlfriends were glad that their boys had something to get a kick out of.''       
         Rosemarie Kanzler, who rose from humble beginnings in the Swiss Alps to become one of the most glamorous figures in the international set for more than five decades, died Dec. 9 at her estate in Argentina. She was 85. Her butler found her in her swimming pool after she had suffered a stroke, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Kanzler, who was married five times, was said to have made the original introductions that led to several famous marriages. Henry Ford II met his second wife, the Italian-born Cristina Vettore Austin, at one of Mrs. Kanzler's homes. Mr. Ford's daughter, Charlotte Ford, met Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon whom she later married, at the Kanzler residence in St. Moritz. Over her lifetime, Mrs. Kanzler decorated and lived in 23 residences throughout the world.         Mrs. Kanzler was also credited with introducing Henry Fonda to his third wife, Countess Afdera Franchetti, and Oscar de la Renta to Francoise de Langlade, his first wife.         Born in Zurich on Jan. 24, 1915, to Giovanni Ravelli, an Italian construction worker, and his German wife, Rosemarie Ravelli was in her early 20's when she left Switzerland with Peter Kreuder, a German theater and film composer. Intent on a singing career, she joined Mr. Kreuder's traveling troupe of entertainers but within several years fled Europe.         She landed in Cuba and soon went on to Mexico City, where in 1944 she married Manuel Reachi, a film producer. They were divorced in 1948, and she moved on to Hollywood, Paris and the South of France. In 1953 she married Carlos Oriani, a Mexican entrepreneur. They were divorced the next year.         Within months she was married again, to Frederick Weicker, an uncle of the former Connecticut governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and an heir to the Squibb pharmaceutical empire. She was a widow four months later when Mr. Weicker died at his fishing camp. In 1955 she married Ernest Kanzler, a Detroit business executive who was head of the War Production Board during World War II. Mr. Kanzler, who died in 1967 and was an uncle by marriage of Henry Ford, was associated with the Ford company and was a director of the Detroit Lions football team.         A 1973 marriage to Jean Pierre Marcie-Riviere, a French banker, ended in divorce in 1989. Mrs. Kanzler went back to using the name of her fourth husband and will be buried next to him in Detroit.         Her survivors include a stepdaughter, Katrina Maxtone-Graham of Manhattan; a stepson, Ernest Kanzler Jr., of Arizona; and eight step-grandchildren.         ''I always knew what I wanted and figured out a way to get it,'' she told Kathryn Livingston, a New York writer who collaborated on her memoir, ''Yesterday Is Gone,'' recently published in Germany. But, she added, destiny also played a part, and it was important to know when to end a chapter, buy an airline ticket and get out and start a new life.         ''I always had a good nose for timing changes,'' she said.       
         Ilona Karmel Zucker, a Holocaust survivor who based much of her writing on her experiences in Nazi labor camps, died on Nov. 30 in Cambridge, Mass. She was 75.         Born in Krakow, Poland, Ms. Karmel endured the war years in the city's ghetto and in three nearby camps, where she composed her first literary work, ''Songs From Behind the Barbed Wire,'' a collection of poems written secretly on the backs of worksheets.         At Buchenwald, the last of the camps, both of her legs were crushed by a tank. During two years of postwar convalescence in a Swedish hospital, she learned to walk again and taught herself English by correspondence with Oxford University. She then immigrated to the United States in 1948, attending Hunter College before graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Radcliffe College, where she was a protegee of the poet Archibald MacLeish.         She began her career as a short-story writer, winning the Mademoiselle College Fiction Prize in 1951 for ''Fru Holm.'' Her first novel, ''Stephania,'' completed while she was at Radcliffe and published in 1953, drew on her experiences in Sweden.         Her 1969 novel, ''An Estate of Memory,'' based on life in a Polish camp and centering on four prisoners who conspire to save the life of a child, is considered by scholars to be among the most resonant accounts of the Holocaust.         A review in The New York Times called it ''a very good book,'' adding that ''like Solzhenitsyn, Ilona Karmel has succeeded in writing about life in the prison camps'' as ''plausible, possible human experience.''         The work, translated into German in 1997, was recently reissued in paperback.         While pursuing her writing, Ms. Karmel taught in day care schools in a career that spanned a 10-year stay in Germany, where she worked in an orphanage.         On returning to the United States in 1978 with her husband, the physicist and philosopher Francis Zucker, she was appointed to a senior lectureship in the writing program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she remained until her retirement in 1995.         In 1995 M.I.T. named the Ilona Karmel Writing Prizes in her honor.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Peggy McMartin Buckey, a principal defendant in the Virginia McMartin Pre-School child-molestation case, who went free after a costly seven-year ordeal when prosecutors gave up, died on Friday in Torrance, Calif. She was 74 and lived in Torrance.         The local authorities said Mrs. Buckey was found unconscious in her home and was pronounced dead at a hospital.         Mrs. Buckey was the main administrator of the school that her family operated in Manhattan Beach, a Los Angeles suburb. The case turned into a legal and emotional crucible for her, her son and daughter, her mother and three teachers, as well as the accusing parents.         It started in August 1983 when a mother called the police to say that her 2 1/2-year-old son had been molested at the school.         In a case that many found reminiscent of the witchcraft trials of yore, the ensuing investigation soon received lurid reports of children being raped and sodomized, of dead rabbits, satanic rites and drinking blood. Eventually the case went through two trials, the last ending with a hung jury. The prosecution cost Los Angeles County at least $15 million.         On the basis of testimony from children and doctors but little corroborating evidence, a grand jury in March 1984 indicted Mrs. Buckey; her son, Raymond; her daughter, Peggy Ann Buckey; her mother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the school; and three teachers. After a lengthy preliminary hearing, the trial judge in January 1986 ordered all seven to stand trial on a total of 135 counts of molesting 14 children.         Days later, even the prosecution termed the evidence against all but Mrs. Buckey and her son ''incredibly weak.'' The charges against the five other defendants were dropped.         Mrs. Buckey and Raymond Buckey first went to trial in April 1987. Two years later the county jury voted acquittals on some charges and deadlocked on others. A second trial of Mr. Buckey alone ended in a hung jury, after which prosecutors chose to drop the matter.         ''I've gone through hell,'' Mrs. Buckey said at the time, ''and now we've lost everything.'' By then she had spent two years behind bars before raising bail and her son had spent five.         The case came to symbolize the hazards in abuse investigations.         Experts in the field held that children's accounts of abuse tended to have a basis of truth because they had no reason to invent such events.         But in the McMartin case and others like it, critics contended, zealous prosecutors and poorly trained social workers, faced with anxious parents, may unknowingly coach children to tell stories of abuse or embroider on them.         Mrs. Buckey's survivors include her husband, Charles, and her son and daughter. Her mother, Virginia McMartin, died in 1995.       
         Eloise Jarvis McGraw, author of ''The Moorchild,'' a 1996 Newbery Honor book, and other novels for children, died on Thursday in Portland, Ore. She was 84 and lived in Oswego Lake, Ore.         Mrs. McGraw began writing at the age of 8, shortly after her family moved from Houston, where she was born, to Oklahoma City.         Her first novel, ''Sawdust in His Shoes,'' was published in 1950, and a steady stream of books for children and adults followed, including ''Moccasin Trail'' and ''The Golden Goblet,'' which were also Newbery Honor books.         Another novel for young people, ''A Really Weird Summer,'' won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.         She was married for 59 years to William Corbin McGraw, who wrote for children as William Corbin. He died last year. For nearly 30 years the McGraws lived on a filbert farm in Oregon before retiring to Oswego Lake.         Mrs. McGraw did the cover art for many of her books, including ''The Moorchild,'' a medieval fantasy.         She is survived by her son and daughter, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Libertad Lamarque Bouza, a singer and actress whose career ranged from the gritty days of early tango recordings in Argentina to the contemporary daily soap operas produced for mass audiences in the Spanish-speaking world, died on Dec. 12 in Mexico City. She was 92.         Ms. Lamarque gained renown after leaving Argentina for Mexico in 1946, following an incident on the Buenos Aires set of the 1944 movie ''The Circus Procession.'' She was said to have quarreled with a young actress named Eva Duarte.         The next year Duarte married Col. Juan Domingo Peron, and in 1946, Peron became president of Argentina. Exercising her power as first lady, Eva Duarte Peron effectively prevented any studio in Argentina from hiring Ms. Lamarque.         After she moved to Mexico City in the 1940's, during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, Ms. Lamarque's career blossomed. She acted in the first film that the Spanish director Luis Bunuel made in Mexico, ''The Great Casino,'' and appeared in some 60 other films.         ''Strangely, even with a strong Argentine accent that never quite went away, she became the darling of Mexican cinema,'' said Carl Mora, an expert on Latin American film at the University of New Mexico. ''Her magnetic presence made for quite a life trajectory.''         It was in Rosario, the provincial Argentine city where Ms. Lamarque was born, that she began her artistic career. Her father was Gaudencio Lamarque, a Uruguayan descendant of French immigrants and a militant anarchist. Because he was imprisoned at the time of her birth, his daughter was named Libertad, or Liberty. Together with six half-brothers and -sisters, she began acting as a child in plays inspired by anarchist ideas.         In 1926, when Ms. Lamarque turned 18, her family moved to Buenos Aires. She soon found work singing in comedy shows. Then a music studio hired her to record tango songs, and she began to attract attention. Ms. Lamarque also started acting, making her debut in the 1929 silent film ''Adios, Argentina,'' which was made by the Italian director Mario Parpagnoli in a single day. In 1932 she starred in ''Tango,'' Argentina's first sound film.         Ms. Lamarque's first marriage, to Emilio Romero, who worked as a prompter in the theater, turned sour shortly after they exchanged vows in 1928. Still, because divorce was illegal at the time in Argentina, it took Ms. Lamarque 12 years to become legally separated from him.         In 1935 she was reported to have attempted suicide while on tour in Chile. That same year her husband took their daughter, Mirtha, with him to live in neighboring Uruguay. After an effort involving a lawyer and several friends, including Hector Artola, her new romantic partner and future husband, Ms. Lamarque succeeded in gaining custody of her daughter.         While in Argentina, Ms. Lamarque acted in more than 20 movies, including ''Honeysuckle,'' ''When I Return to Your Side'' and ''In This Gray Afternoon.'' But it was in Mexico that she took her place as a leading figure in Latin American cinema, and later in the melodramatic world of daily telenovelas, or soap operas. In later years she divided her time between Mexico City and Miami, but refused to retire.         Earlier this year the Mexican Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences awarded her a lifetime achievement award. At the time of her death she was playing a Mother Superior in ''Angelface,'' a popular telenovela.         Ms. Lamarque is survived by her daughter, Mirtha Romero Lamarque, of Argentina.       
         Felicia Shpritzer, who in the early 1960's broke a gender barrier in the New York Police Department when she earned a sergeant's stripes, paving the way for the advancement of women in police work across the country, died on Tuesday at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 and lived in New York City.         ''She did great good and it had a national impact,'' said Patrick V. Murphy, the New York City police commissioner in the early 1970's, who knew her.         After being rejected as a candidate to take the sergeant's qualification test, Policewoman Shpritzer sued the city, won the court battle and then became 1 of 2 of the 127 policewomen who took the test to pass it.         ''I'm sure there were a lot of women before Shpritzer who sought advancement in the department and then gave up, figuring it was not worth the risk,'' Commissioner Murphy said. ''But Shpritzer was determined and very professional. I had great admiration for her.''         Policewoman Shpritzer served almost 20 years as a policewoman in the Juvenile Aid Bureau before she and five other women applied to take a test for possible promotion to the rank of sergeant in 1961. Two weeks before the test was held, all six women's applications were rejected.         It was then that Policewoman Shpritzer filed suit against the New York City Department of Personnel, arguing that to deny her a chance to become a sergeant was ''discriminatory, archaic and illegal.''         She also cited a section of the City Administrative Code providing that any member of the Police Department assigned to the Juvenile Aid Bureau ''shall retain his or her rank and pay in the force and shall be eligible for promotion as if serving in the uniformed forces.'' Accordingly, she said, she should not be barred from taking the qualifying test.         Police Commissioner Michael J. Murphy -- a predecessor of Patrick V. Murphy -- opposed her suit, submitting an affidavit in which he declared that women lacked the physical strength and endurance required of a police sergeant. He also pointed to a section of the code that read, ''There shall only be one rank of policewomen within the Police Department.''         In June 1963, the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, ruled in Policewoman Shpritzer's favor, and the following year she and 126 other policewomen took the four-hour test at Brooklyn Technical High School. The atmosphere was tense. The only candidate interviewed by a reporter for The New York Times who was willing to give her name was Policewoman Shpritzer.         ''Pass or fail,'' she said defiantly, ''I will never regret having made the opportunity available to women.''         The two women who passed that day were Policewoman Shpritzer and Gertrude Schimmel, who in 1971 became the city's first policewoman to serve as a captain. Their immediate assignment as sergeants was to supervise about 160 policewomen attached to the Bureau of Policewomen.         Thus, no policeman was to be supervised by a woman, although both  female sergeants indicated at a public announcement of their promotions that they would continue to seek advancement in the department.         Accepting the change, Commissioner Michael Murphy called the appointment of the two women ''a significant milestone in our department's history,'' adding, ''We welcome them, and wish them well.''         Felicia Shpritzer was born on Nov. 12, 1913, in Gloversville, N.Y., but soon moved with her family to New York City, where she graduated from Washington Irving High School.  She received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Hunter College, a master's degree in speech from the University of Michigan and a master's degree in police science from the City University of New York.         She was appointed to the force in 1942, serving 17 years in the Youth Division, where 57 of the 278 women in the department were assigned. At the time of her lawsuit she had a spotless record and had received a number of Police Department awards and citations.         After 34 years with the Police Department, she retired as a lieutenant in 1976.         She is survived by a brother, Saul, of Oceanside, Calif., two nephews, one niece, two grand-nieces and two grand-nephews.       
         Marvel Jackson Cooke, who has been described as the first black woman to work for a white-owned mainstream newspaper, died on Nov. 29 in Manhattan. She was 99 and was a longtime resident of Sugar Hill, Harlem.         Born in Mankato, Minn., and a graduate of the University of Minnesota, Marvel Jackson moved to New York in 1926 and worked as secretary for W. E. B. DuBois, editor of The Crisis, the magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Later, she worked for The Amsterdam News and The People's Voice in Harlem.         At The Amsterdam News, she helped organize a unit of the American Newspaper Guild, which struck for 11 weeks in 1935. On the picket line, she met Benjamin J. Davis, later a New York City Council member, who invited her to join the Communist Party.         In 1949, she went to work for The Daily Compass, a successor to the experimental newspaper PM. ''There were no black workers there and no women,'' Ms. Cooke said in 1988. At the time of her hiring, The Chicago Defender, a black-owned paper, called Ms. Cooke the first black woman to get a job as a reporter on a mainstream white-owned paper.         Ms. Cooke's race helped her gain access to certain news events. On one occasion, she was assigned to write about killings committed by a young black man who had been sent home to Brownsville, Brooklyn, from a prison for the criminally insane. The family talked to her while the community barred The Compass's white reporter, Ms. Cooke told Kay Mills in an interview for a 1988 book, ''A Place in the News: From the Women's Pages to the Front Page.''         Ms. Cooke wrote a series about the exploitation of domestic workers. She went to a pickup point in the Bronx to be hired with others seeking work by the day. Some on the corner warned her about employers who turned clocks back so they could pay less, even though the pay was only 80 cents an hour. Sure enough, the woman who hired her tried this trick, but Ms. Cooke insisted on being paid for the full five hours of scrubbing and ironing.         The Compass promoted the series with truck signs that said: ''Read: I Was a Slave, by Marvel Cooke.''         After The Compass closed on Nov. 3, 1952, Ms. Cooke left journalism and worked for left-leaning organizations like the Committee for the Arts, Sciences and Professions and, later, the Angela Davis Defense Fund.         Ms. Cooke's husband, Cecil Cooke, died in 1978. She is survived by a sister, Helen Wilkins Claytor of Grand Rapids, Mich., a former national president of the Y.W.C.A.
