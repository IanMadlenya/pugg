Evelyn Ames, a poet and prose writer whose works on wildlife and the environment were praised by reviewers as graceful and intense, but not sentimental, died on Thursday at St. Johnland Nursing Home in Kings Park, L.I. She was 81 years old and had homes in Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., and Martha's Vineyard.         ''A Glimpse of Eden,'' recounting a safari in East Africa, joined ''a poet's urge to describe her experience in beautiful and even fanciful terms, and a thinker's urge to generalize about it,'' wrote Orville Prescott in a 1967 review in The New York Times.         ''She strikes just the right note when she remarks on the bond of sympathy she felt for lions,'' the critic wrote, concluding, ''It takes a poet like Evelyn Ames to see the 'tender affection' of lions.'' John C. Devlin of The Times termed the work ''sharp-eyed and lyrical.''         Other volumes included ''In Time Like Glass: Reflections on a Journey in Asia'' (1974); ''Only the Loving,'' a 1952 novel; and two books of poetry: ''The Hawk From Heaven'' (1957) and ''Dust on a Precipice'' (1981).         Daughter of a Professor         The writer, whose given name was Evelyn Perkins, was born to a physics professor and an actress in Hamden, Conn., grew up in Hartford, and was educated at Milton Academy and Vassar College.

        Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan.         Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.         During her 20 years as curator, Dr. Szladits scoured England to bargain for diaries and first editions; in this country, she cajoled American authors to think of the Berg first when parting with their papers. In the faintly discernible accent of her native Hungary, she was fond of joking, though without affectation, ''Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.''         Everyone from the president of the library to her assistants called Dr. Szladits by her first name. She, in turn, was on a first-name basis with her precious manuscripts. When she spoke of ''Tom,'' she meant T. S. Eliot, of ''Wystan,'' W. H. Auden, and of ''Virginia,'' her greatly admired diarist and novelist, Virginia Woolf.         Sitting in her cramped office off the Berg's reading and exhibition rooms on the third floor of the library on Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, Dr. Szladits liked to reach for the exact quotation from one of the tens of thousands of documents in the collection.         'We Protect the Written Word'         Last year, when she mounted a show on diarists, it included 50 of her famous authors, including James Boswell, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville and, of course, Virginia Woolf, whose manuscripts in 33 volumes are one of the prizes in the Berg. She liked to quote ''Virginia,'' who said, ''Fortunately, intellect has no gender.''         Dr. Szladits considered the Berg not a musty repository of the past but a working collection that was used by biographers from all over the world.         ''We protect the written word at the Berg,'' she told Whitney Balliett, who wrote a profile about her in The New Yorker on Dec. 31, 1984 - the first such article about a librarian in the magazine's history. ''It is a research collection, not a museum. It has to be used. It is alive. My role at the Berg is to stand still and allow the collection to grow. In fact, I try to make time itself stand still here. I try to create quiet and the timelessness that allows for the pursuit of truth.''         Auden's Handwritten Notebooks         Born in Budapest, she immigrated to the United States in 1950 and became a naturalized citizen in 1956. After receiving her doctorate in Hungary, she did postgraduate work at the Sorbonne in Paris, University College in London and Columbia University. She joined the New York Public Library in 1955 and was appointed curator of the Berg Collection in 1969.         Among her most significant acquisitions were Auden's handwritten notebooks. She also established or expanded files on Conrad Aiken, H. G. Wells, Muriel Rukeyser, Evelyn Waugh, Samuel Beckett, William Faulkner, May Sarton, Washington Irving, Walt Whitman and Oliver Wendell Holmes.         ''I am buying in eternity,'' Dr. Szladits once remarked.         Paul Fasana, the library's Andrew W. Mellon Director of Research Libraries, said yesterday: ''Lola was an original. Her standards, for herself and others, were high and at times unattainable. Her dedication to the ideal of literary scholarship was fierce. But she was also loving and human.''         Dr. Szladits was married to Charles Szladits, a professor of law at Columbia University, who died in 1986.         A memorial service will be held on May 5 in the Celeste Bartos Forum of the library, and a book fund in her name will be established for the Berg Collection.

        Dr. Ora M. Rosen, a research scientist who was a leading investigator of the ways hormones and other factors control the development of cells, died of breast cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 55 years old.         Dr. Ora M. Rosen, a research scientist who was a leading investigator of the ways hormones and other factors control the development of cells, died of breast cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 55 years old.         Dr. Rosen held the Abby Rockefeller Mauze Chair of Experimental Therapeutics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and, as an American Cancer Society research professor, headed the center's laboratory of developmental and membrane biology.         In 1985 Dr. Rosen and colleagues at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, in collaboration with scientists at Genentech Inc., achieved a breakthrough in cell biology by cloning the gene for the human insulin receptor, the cell surface molecule to which insulin binds.         By accomplishing the cloning they opened the way for detailed investigation of how the insulin receptor transmits signals from the surface of the cell to the interior. More recently Dr. Rosen and her associates had been applying a wide range of biochemical and genetic techniques to determine how the receptor molecule gets its message to the cell's metabolic machinery.         Broader Look Into Insulin's Role         Their work also led to a broader inquiry into the role of insulin in normal cell function and in diabetes and other disorders.         Dr. Rosen, who was born in Manhattan, received an M.D. degree from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. After studying cell biology and biochemistry at New York University and at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, she joined the faculty at Einstein in 1966 and became chairwoman of the molecular pharmacology department. She joined the staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering in 1984.         Last year Dr. Rosen was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jerard Hurwitz, also an American Cancer Society research professor at Sloan-Kettering; two sons, Isaac, of Manhattan, and Gideon, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and a brother, Ezra Mendelsohn of Jerusalem.

Weeks, a physicist whose professional career spanned nearly six decades, died of a stroke on Monday at Newton Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 97 years old and lived in Wellesley, Mass.         From 1930 to 1956, except for two years in World War II, Dr. Weeks was a professor and head of the physics department at Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa. For six years after her retirement from Wilson she coordinated a program at the United States Army's arsenal at Watertown, Mass., that developed radiological shielding materials for use against nuclear weapons, neutrons and gamma rays.         Leaving the Army's Materials Research Agency in 1964, she became a spectroscopist, studying solar satellites at the Harvard College Observatory. She retired in 1976 at the age of 83.         Dr. Weeks, a native of Philadelphia and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Wellesley College, went to work in 1917 as an assistant examiner for the United States Patent Office and, concurrently, an assistant at the National Bureau of Standards. From 1920 to 1924, while studying and teaching physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she earned her master's degree.         In 1924 she began a new, if short-lived, career in retailing. Obtaining a second master's degree, from the Prince School of Business at Simmons College, she became an employment supervisor for Jordan Marsh, the Boston department store.         In 1928 she returned to academic life, teaching physics at Wellesley while earning her Ph.D. in mathematics at M.I.T. in 1930.

Brenda Lansdown, a retired professor of education who introduced new teaching methods in China, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 86 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass. The cause of death was pneumonia, said Harriet Harvey, a friend.         In the 1940's Ms. Lansdown taught at the Dalton School and the City and Country School in Manhattan, where she developed a ''hands-on'' method of teaching science to elementary and high school students, known as the investigative colloquium method. She later became a professor of education at Brooklyn College and also taught at Hunter College and the Harvard Graduate School of Education.         In 1974, at the age of 70, she began the study of Mandarin, and in 1979 was invited to Peking Normal University to introduce her teaching method to China. The method differs sharply from traditionial Chinese pedagogy, in which rote memorization is emphasized over creative thinking and problem solving.         Translated Into Chinese         Her book, ''Teaching Elementary Science Through Investigation and Colloquium,'' first published in 1971, was translated into Chinese, and more than 30,000 copies have been distributed to educators in China. Videotapes of her demonstration classes have been beamed by satellite to schools in the provinces.         In the last six years Ms. Lansdown raised funds in the United States for an experimental work-study cooperative school in a remote area of China that uses hands-on principles to teach Chinese farmers animal husbandry, agriculture and forestry.         Ms. Lansdown, a native of London, attended St. Paul's School there and graduated from Lausanne University in Switzerland.         She is survived by a brother, Merton, of Dorset, England.

A Legal Clinic         As co-director of the legal clinic, training students in the practice of law, she specialized in public-interest disputes, individual rights and immigration cases.         Ms. McCarthy was a product of the 1960's civil-rights and antiwar campaigns. Opposed to violence, she turned to politics when the marches on the Pentagon and elsewhere deteriorated into street clashes.         She skipped a semester in her sophomore year at Radcliffe in 1968 to enlist in the Presidential campaign of Mr. McCarthy. With her mother, Abigail, and other family members, she scoured campuses and the country for votes for the former Minnesota Democratic Senator.         Because of her academic record, she was nevertheless permitted to graduate with her class in 1969. She later did advanced legal studies at Georgetown Law School.

Mary Shaw Shorb, a microbiologist whose research led to the discovery of vitamin B12 in 1947, died Saturday at Greater Laurel-Beltsville Hospital in Maryland.         She was 83 years old and lived in Beltsville. The hospital said she died of a kidney ailment.         Dr. Shorb, a research professor emerita of poultry husbandry at the University of Maryland, was working at the Maryland Agricultural Experimental Station in the mid-1940's in search of a microorganism that would be useful in treating pernicious anemia, a disease that was fatal until the 1920's, when a liver extract was developed to treat it.         Bacterium Discovered         Since the extract had to be injected in a costly and painful process, scientists sought an alternative. Dr. Shorb found a bacterium, Lactobacillus lactis Dorner, that was present in tomato juice and liver extract, making possible the creation of the vitamin.         Securing an unpaid research position at the University of Maryland, she worked with scientists of Merck & Company to develop the substance that was marketed as vitamin B12.         In 1949 she was made a research professor at the university, a post she held until she retired in 1972.         Dr. Shorb, a native of Wahpeton, N.D., held a bachelor's degree from the College of Idaho and a doctorate in immunology from Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, where she was a researcher from 1929 to 1932.         After taking time off to raise a family, she returned to research in 1942 with the Agriculture Department's Bureau of Human Nutrition and later with the Dairy Industry Bureau.

        Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the Mayor of Princeton and a member of one of the nation's best-known political families, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 51 years old.         Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the Mayor of Princeton and a member of one of the nation's best-known political families, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 51 years old.         Mrs. Sigmund first learned that she had cancer in 1982, when a melanoma was found behind her left eye. The eye was removed and she continued with her political career.         But last year, after Mrs. Sigmund unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey, doctors found that the cancer had spread. Mrs. Sigmund had finished second in the primary to Representative Jim Florio, who went on to win the general election.         Born in New Orleans         Politics and public service were a way of life for Barbara Boggs Sigmund. She was born on May 27, 1939, in New Orleans about the time that her father, Hale Boggs, was beginning his first term as a Democratic Congressman.         In 1972, the plane carrying her father, then the House majority leader, was lost over Alaska, and her mother, Corinne Lindy Claiborne Boggs, succeeded him in Congress.         Mrs. Sigmund's mother's family, the Claibornes, traced its roots to colonial Jamestown in Virginia and is said to have included more members of Congress than any other American family.         Politics 'All Around Us'         ''Nobody speechified about it,'' Mrs. Sigmund once said about the family's deep interest in politics. ''It was all around us.''         Her brother, Thomas Hale Boggs, is a prominent lawyer in Washington, and her sister, Cokie Roberts of Bethesda, Md., is a correspondent for National Public Radio and for ABC News on television and radio.         Mrs. Sigmund was a graduate of Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y. She married Paul E. Sigmund, a professor of political science at Princeton, in 1964. She became a Latin teacher at the Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart in Princeton. After the birth of the couple's three sons, she returned to the school to teach religion and government.         In 1974, she left Stuart to join the staff of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University.         After serving as a member of the Princeton Borough Council, she was elected in 1976 to the Mercer County Board of Freeholders. She was president of the board in 1979 and 1980.         In 1982, she decided to run for Congress, hoping she could join her mother on Capitol Hill. But at the last minute she changed her mind and ran instead for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, finishing fourth in a field of 10 candidates. It was during the 1982 campaign that she lost her eye to cancer and surprised everyone by showing up at a fund-raising event hours after checking out of the hospital. She was wearing an eye patch covered with the words ''Vote Sigmund.''         'Subject to the Fates'         After her defeat in the Senate primary, she was elected mayor of Princeton in 1983. ''There's no way to plan a political life,'' she said at the time. ''It's all subject to the fates. I enjoy practicing the craft of government and I think it can be done from the local level up, as well as the other way.''         She brought a ready wit and seemingly boundless energy to the job of Mayor and attacked the problems of providing affordable housing and managing development. She loved to point out that Princeton's image as a wealthy town was misleading. ''It has been a town of mixed-income groups and races for centuries,'' she said.         Once, she complained wryly that most of the town's newer residents were executives in the high-tech industries that were moving to Princeton and surrounding areas. ''We want a certain amount,'' she said, ''but not so much as to destroy the town.''         Writing Poetry         After Mrs. Sigmund was found to have a recurrence of cancer last year, she began chemotherapy treatments but continued to devote as much energy as she could to the duties of her office and her favorite hobby, writing poetry.         Her mother announced in July that she would not run for re-election to Congress. She did not say so at the time, but close associates said she wanted more time to spend with her daughter.         Besides her husband, her mother, her brother and her sister, Mrs. Sigmund is survived by three sons, Paul Jr., of Ann Arbor, Mich., David, of Detroit, and Stephen, of New Orleans.         A funeral service will be held on Saturday at 5:30 P.M. in the Princeton University Chapel.

The accident occurred while Ms. Brown, who in recent years was known for her use of imagery from ancient cultures, was installing her work in a reflecting pool at the new Heritage Museum, still under construction at Proddatura. Colleagues at the University of California said a concrete turret from a balcony collapsed and fell on her.         Starting out in the mid-1960's as a figurative painter in the thickly pigmented style of the so-called second-generation Bay Area artists, Ms. Brown gradually lightened her mode of painting and concentrated on imagery drawn from her personal life. A long-distance swimmer who regarded the sport as a means of meditation, she at this time used many images of swimmers in her art. Student of World Cultures         In the early 1970's she began traveling, informally studying world cultures. She drew inspiration for her work from the Egyptian and Hindu religions, and she made obelisks adorned with decorative patterns incorporating symbolic animal and human forms. In recent years, because of political and moral objections to the sale of art, she became involved in public art projects and made an effort to withdraw her work from the market.         Born and brought up in San Francisco, Ms. Brown attended the California School of Fine Arts -- later to become the San Francisco Art Institute -- from 1956 to 1960, and later received a master's degree in fine arts there, in 1962. In 1974 she joined the department of art at Berkeley, where, said Christopher Brown, the chairman of the department, she consistently won the highest rating as a teacher from faculty members and students.         Ms. Brown is survived by her husband, Michael Hebel, and a son, Noel Neri.
