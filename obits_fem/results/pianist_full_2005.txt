         Consuelo Velázquez, the songwriter who in 1941 created ''Bésame Mucho,'' a Latin hit that took on a life of its own worldwide, died on Jan. 22 in Mexico City. She was believed to have been 88.         The cause was respiratory problems, her family told The Associated Press.         ''Bésame Mucho'' is not so much an enduring standard as a global phenomenon. Translated into dozens of languages and performed by hundreds of artists, the song has been an emblem of Latin identity, an anthem of lovers separated by World War II and perennial grist for lounge singers everywhere.         Recorded by artists both serious (the Beatles) and saccharine (Mantovani), ''Bésame Mucho'' has had more than two million performances on radio and television, according to BMI, the music publishing organization.         The English version, written by Sunny Skylar in 1944, was a hit that year for the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra, with vocals by Kitty Kallen and Bob Eberly.         Ms. Velázquez was born in Ciudad Guzmán, Mexico, in 1916. (She sometimes gave the date as 1920.) Trained as a concert pianist, she wrote the original Spanish lyrics for ''Bésame Mucho'' when she was 25 and, as she liked to say, had never been kissed.         The song's haunting melody, which Ms. Velázquez also wrote, is based on the aria ''Quejas, o la Maja y el Ruiseñor'' (''Plaints, or the Maiden and the Nightingale''), from the 1916 opera ''Goyescas,'' by the Spanish composer Enrique Granados.         Ms. Velázquez's lyrics have a simple dramatic urgency: Bésame, bésame mucho,/Como si fuera esta noche la última vez (''Kiss me, kiss me a lot,/as if tonight were the last time'').         The English lyrics (Bésame, bésame mucho,/Each time I cling to your kiss, I hear music divine) add a generous dollop of schmaltz.         Among the strange bedfellows who have recorded the song are: Danny Aiello, Josephine Baker, Dave Brubeck, Vikki Carr, José Carreras, Charo, the Coasters, Nat King Cole, Xavier Cugat, Plácido Domingo, Bill Evans, the Flamingos, Connie Francis, Dexter Gordon, Chris Isaak, Harry James, Spike Jones, Diana Krall, Frankie Laine, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, Julie London, Trini Lopez, Dean Martin, Carmen McRae, Nana Mouskouri, Les Paul, Art Pepper, the Platters, Tito Puente, Artie Shaw and the 101 Strings Orchestra.         Ms. Velázquez's other songs, none of which rivaled the success of ''Bésame Mucho,'' include ''Amar y Vivir'' (''To Love and to Live'') and ''Verdad Amarga'' (''Bitter Truth'').       
         Trude Rittmann, a choral and dance-music arranger for Broadway favorites from ''Carousel'' in 1945 to a ''Sound of Music'' revival half a century later, died on Feb. 22 in Lexington, Mass. She was 96 and had been living in Waltham, Mass., in retirement.         The death was announced by the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization in Manhattan.A pianist and composer, Ms. Rittmann was first hired by Lincoln Kirstein in 1937, played piano for George Balanchine's American Ballet Caravan -- a forerunner of the New York City Ballet -- and was a concert pianist for the choreographer Agnes de Mille. Ms. de Mille then took her on as dance arranger in 1943 when she choreographed the Kurt Weill musical ''One Touch of Venus.''         Ms. Rittmann's was an unsung art, performed mostly behind the scenes, with no Tonys and little public notice until fairly recent years. It was her forte to take a composer's theme or melody and mold it into ballet or the incidental music woven in for dramatic effect.         Among the other luminaries who entrusted their work to her were Lerner and Loewe, Irving Berlin and Jerome Robbins. In her years with the City Ballet, she adapted and shaped compositions by Aaron Copland, Elliott Carter, Virgil Thomson, Marc Blitzstein and Leonard Bernstein.         On Broadway, in 1954, she provided incidental music for Tinker Bell and Captain Hook's crew of pirates in ''Peter Pan,'' for which she had already been musical arranger and coordinator in a 1950 production. She arranged the dances for ''Finian's Rainbow'' (1947), and assisted Miss de Mille in ''Brigadoon'' (1947), and Richard Rodgers in ''South Pacific'' (1949), which ran for 1,925 performances.         She was the ballet or dance arranger, or otherwise musically engaged, for other long-running productions, like ''The King and I'' (1951), ''Wish You Were Here'' (1952), ''Fanny'' (1954), ''My Fair Lady'' (1956) and its 1976 revival, the original ''Sound of Music'' (1959), ''Camelot'' (1960), ''Gigi'' (1973) and ''Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' (1989), a revue to which she contributed as a dance arranger.         Trude Rittmann was born in Mannheim, Germany. She started piano lessons at 6, graduated from the Conservatory in Cologne and had made a name for herself as anavant-garde composer by the time she arrived in New York in 1937. She continued to compose music for ballet and television while making her career on Broadway.         She left no immediate survivors.         Correction:  March 11, 2005, Friday  An obituary headline yesterday about a choral and dance-music arranger who worked on popular Broadway musicals misspelled her surname. She was Trude Rittmann, not Rittman.       
         Moura Lympany, the colorful and elegant British concert pianist whose career lasted more than 65 years, died on March 28 in Menton, France. She was 88.         Her death was confirmed by her former French managers, Bureau de Concerts de Valmalete.         Ms. Lympany avoided specialization, yet she is often associated with Russian music, particularly Rachmaninoff (she was the first to record his complete Preludes) and Khachaturian. She gave Khachaturian's piano concerto its first performances outside the Soviet Union, touring with it in 1940.         She also championed British composers, like Alan Rawsthorne (whose piano concerto she played in Paris immediately after the liberation in World War II), Cyril Scott, Benjamin Dale and others.         Ms. Lympany was born Mary Gertrude Johnstone on Aug. 18, 1916, in Saltash, Cornwall, England. Her mother, who had been a governess in St. Petersburg, Russia, before marrying an army officer, was her first piano teacher, and sent her to school in a convent in Liège, Belgium, when she was 6, setting the tone for a nomadic and international life.         After a few years in Belgium, Ms. Lympany returned to London, where she heard a child prodigy play a concerto with the conductor Basil Cameron and asked her mother if she could do the same. She made her concerto debut under Cameron when she was 12, playing the Mendelssohn G-minor Concerto. It was Cameron who advised her to spice up her name a bit, so she replaced her first name with Moura, a Russian diminutive, and Lympany, a variant of her mother's maiden name.         She studied in Vienna with Paul Weingarten, then in London with Mathilde Verne and Tobias Matthay, who remained an important influence. In the first Liszt competition in Budapest in 1933, she took second place to Annie Fischer; in the 1938 Queen Elisabeth International Competition of Belgium she came in second to Emil Gilels. During World War II she became popular in Britain by performing in the National Gallery lunchtime concerts organized by Dame Myra Hess.         After the war she embarked on a major international career. She made her New York debut in 1948 at Town Hall; Noel Straus in The New York Times described her playing as having ''a refreshing and irresistible wholesomeness, a freedom from exaggerations, an impeccable taste, a sanity, and at the same time a definite individuality.''         In 1944 she married Colin Defries, a colonel, engineer and amateur pianist; they were divorced in 1950. In 1951 she married Bennet Korn, an American radio-advertising executive. She had two miscarriages before giving birth to a premature baby who lived less than two days. The second marriage ended in 1961. Ms. Lympany later had a double mastectomy and a difficult period in her career, but had a minor renaissance in the 1970's.         She lived in London, Monte Carlo and the French village Rasiguères in the Languedoc, where in 1981 she founded a festival ''of music and wine'' that ran through 1992. A passionate gardener, she also owned a vineyard. She wrote her autobiography in 1991.         She became somewhat infamous in Britain for her appearance on the popular radio program ''Desert Island Discs.'' When asked to choose which records she would take with her to a desert island, she selected her own recordings.         ''My records are damned good,'' she said.       
         Ruth Laredo, a pianist equally at home in chamber music and solo works who was known for landmark recordings of Scriabin and Rachmaninoff, died on Wednesday at her apartment in New York. She was 67.         Ms. Laredo, who played her last concert on May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had cancer and died in her sleep, said her manager, James Murtha.         The concert was one of a series she had given for 17 years at the Met called ''Concerts With Commentary,'' in which Ms. Laredo played and spoke engagingly about music. The series had become an important part of the New York concert scene, where she was a frequent presence.         Just two days after the attack on the World Trade Center, Ms. Laredo celebrated the 25th anniversary of her Alice Tully Hall debut with a recital there. It was the opening concert of the 2001 Lincoln Center season, and Ms. Laredo addressed the audience beforehand, saying: ''It was important for me to play. Great music gives us spiritual sustenance and gives us hope. It is in that spirit that I play tonight.''         Ms. Laredo was a pianist in the Romantic mold, a dynamic performer concerned with texture and color. In recent years, Mr. Murtha said, her career as a soloist with orchestras had waned, but she was comfortable with a mix of recitals, chamber concerts and accompanying duties.         When she was first on the rise, in the 1970's, Ms. Laredo was a relative rarity as a female piano soloist, particularly in the technically demanding and muscular works of Rachmaninoff. There were only a few others -- Gina Bachauer, Myra Hess and later Alicia de Larrocha, for example.         ''Every time we did interviews in those early days, she was asked how does it feel to be a woman pianist,'' Mr. Murtha said. ''She wanted to be a pianist, period.''         Ruth Meckler was born in Detroit on Nov. 20, 1937. She attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she studied with Rudolf Serkin. She graduated in 1960 and that same year married the violinist Jaime Laredo, with whom she collaborated musically. They later divorced. Ms. Laredo is survived by their daughter, Jennifer Laredo, who lives in London with her husband, the cellist Paul Watkins, and by a granddaughter.         Ms. Laredo made her debut with an orchestra in 1962, in a program led by Leopold Stokowski conducting the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Pierre Boulez, 12 years later. Her Carnegie Hall solo recital debut came only in 1981.         At Curtis, Serkin schooled her in the basics of Mozart and Beethoven, turning a disapproving eye on her youthful love for Rachmaninoff. But it was with his music, as well as that of his fellow Russian Scriabin, that she made her mark.         In the 1970's she recorded two pioneering and acclaimed sets: the entire Scriabin piano sonatas, for the now-defunct Connoisseur label, and the complete solo repertory of Rachmaninoff, on seven LP's for CBS Masterworks.         When Ms. Laredo went to Serkin to ask if he thought she could handle the Rachmaninoff, he gave his blessing. '''You must do it' was the answer he gave me,'' Ms. Laredo said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times.         But preparing for the recordings was a fearsome and wearing task. ''I had to learn the many, many Rachmaninoff pieces that no one plays, and I found out why no one does,'' she said. ''It's because they're so hard.'' She later channeled her love for Rachmaninoff into scholarship, preparing a new edition of his piano preludes for the C.F. Peters music publisher.         The Scriabin LP's came when little of his music was available on record, and they helped spark a surge of his popularity in the United States. Ms. Laredo said that she first heard his music at a concert of Vladimir Horowitz and was dazzled.         Bernard Holland, a Times music critic, wrote of her playing of Scriabin's music: ''Ms. Laredo's sensuous, beautifully controlled playing caught its mad and slightly evil quality.''         Correction:  June 17, 2005, Friday  An obituary of the classical pianist Ruth Laredo on May 27 referred imprecisely to the label that issued her recordings of the Scriabin piano sonatas in 1970. It is Connoisseur Society, not Connoisseur, and it remains in business.       
         Grete Sultan, a pianist and teacher who was both a performer of Bach and Schubert and a mentor to John Cage and his contemporaries, died in her sleep at St. Vincent's Hospital last Sunday morning. She was 99.         ''Basically, her heart gave out,'' said Robert Jurgrau, a former student and close friend. She had been hospitalized for about a week with pneumonia.         Ms. Sultan was a matter-of-fact proponent of the avant-garde. Her calling cards included Bach's Goldberg Variations, which she performed with all the repeats in downtown New York and, later, in uptown concert halls -- which, in the 1940's, before Glenn Gould's 1955 recording helped make the piece familiar fare, was practically outré.         But Ms. Sultan was open to all kinds of music. She met Cage in 1945; his ''Études Australes'' from the mid-1970's, based on notes derived from star charts, were written for her. Other contemporary composers whose works she performed included Earle Brown, Stefan Wolpe, Alan Hovhaness, Ben Weber and Christian Wolff, one of her students.         She said in a 1996 interview: ''Music is music. That's all.''         Johanna Margarete Sultan was born on June 21, 1906, in Berlin. Her family was musical -- two of her aunts had studied with Clara Schumann -- and Richard Strauss, Artur Schnabel, and Ferruccio Busoni were regular visitors to her childhood home. So was the American pianist Richard Buhlig, who introduced her to the composer Henry Cowell and the music of other contemporary composers. At the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin, she completed a course of study in only three years, working with Leonid Kreutzer. But a more important mentor was the pianist and conductor Edwin Fischer, teacher of Alfred Brendel, Paul Badura-Skoda and Daniel Barenboim, with whom she began private lessons after graduation.         Her burgeoning concert career was, however, abruptly curtailed by Hitler's rise to power, after which Jewish pianists could no longer play German music, although Arturo Toscanini set up some recitals for her in Italy. In 1941, Buhlig helped her escape to the United States, where she arrived with a suitcase and the clothes on her back. (Her mother was able to join her in 1946; a sister also managed to escape.)         Ms. Sultan began teaching at Vassar College and at the 92nd Street Y in New York before taking a post at the Masters' School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., in 1952, which she held until 1971. It was Buhlig who introduced her to his former student Cage; Ms. Sultan, in turn, introduced Cage to her student Mr. Wolff, who gave Cage his first copy of the I Ching. In addition to Mr. Wolff, her students included the composer Lucia Dlugoszewskiwho moved to New York to study Bach with her in 1948 and ended up meeting the choreographer Erick Hawkins, who had a studio next door.         Ms. Sultan also continued to perform in concert throughout her life, winning praise for her natural, unflashy manner and musical integrity, and doggedly following her own musical tastes through the years, performing now Schubert, now Schoenberg, now Stravinsky, now Cage or Feldman without proselytizing and with equal aplomb. In 1996, shortly after her 90th birthday, she played the Goldberg Variations at Merkin Hall. The same year brought the release of the first of two retrospective CD sets that give a flavor of her performances and the breadth of her repertory.         ''She clearly strives for something higher from music than emotion or adventure,'' wrote Mark Swed, the Los Angeles Times music critic, after that 1996 concert. ''Her Bach has the modernist's attention paid to the smallest detail of sound and structure. The feeling here is that the spirit will soar much higher if it isn't pushed.''         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Frances Langford, a mellow contralto who ventured into combat zones with Bob Hope's troupe during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars to serenade tens of thousands of servicemen with ballads that reminded them of the girls they left behind, died yesterday at her home in Jensen Beach, Fla. She was 92.         Her death was announced by her lawyer, Evans Crary Jr., The Associated Press reported.         Although she regarded herself as more of a singer than an actress, she appeared in roughly 30 films and was half of the successful radio comedy duo ''The Bickersons,'' in which she and Don Ameche played a mismatched, querulous couple. He was devoted to ignoring her and concentrating on sleeping, the only time in the day, he said, when he felt alive; she was an insomniac who needed him as a refuge because she couldn't get to sleep. The show became so popular that it received a Sunday night spot of its own.         But among radio listeners, moviegoers and later a vast audience of G.I.'s, Miss Langford was known for songs like ''I'm in the Mood for Love,'' ''You Are My Lucky Star'' and ''Hooray for Hollywood.''         Mr. Hope thought of her as one of his three gypsies -- entertainers who were willing, like him, to travel all over the globe to entertain the troops. The other two were Jerry Colonna, a bulgy-eyed comic who liked to sing ''On the Road to Mandalay,'' and Tony Romano, a guitarist who sang, arranged and accompanied other talent.         Mr. Hope recalled her with characteristic snip: ''She knows just how much sex to pour and still be dignified.'' The troops frequently asked Miss Langford to sing ''I'm in the Mood for Love,'' a ballad by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh, her hit record from an otherwise forgettable 1935 movie, ''Every Night at Eight,'' which was mostly a vehicle for George Raft and Alice Faye.         ''The greatest thing in my life was entertaining the troops,'' Miss Langford told The Palm Beach Post years later. She said she was fascinated as well as frightened by being in or close to combat zones. On one occasion, near Bizerte in North Africa, she saw six planes shot down. On two occasions she was in planes that developed engine trouble; one of them crash-landed in New South Wales, Australia, on a flight from Guadalcanal. The other plane landed safely, but not before Miss Langford volunteered to don a parachute and jump.         Frances Langford was born April 6, 1913, in Lakeland, Fla., the daughter of Vasco Langford, a carpenter, and his wife, Anna, who was an accomplished pianist. She attended music college briefly but dropped out and began to work in vaudeville. Her first big break came after her mother drove her to Miami and convinced Rudy Vallee, then a popular star of stage and screen, to listen to her. He liked what he heard, asked her to sing on his radio show and even helped her get a start in New York. A small part in a Broadway musical led to radio appearances and a string of movie musicals.         In 1941, Miss Langford made her first appearance on Mr. Hope's radio show, and the visits to the troops started shortly thereafter. She also wrote a column for Hearst newspapers, recounting some of her experiences as an entertainer in wartime.         After the war, she was featured on a radio variety show and returned to nightclub work. She was married three times, first to the actor Jon Hall, from whom she was later divorced, and then to Ralph Evinrude, the manufacturer of outboard motors. They settled in Florida and started a marina, restaurant and gift shop near her 400-acre estate at Jensen Beach. She became more interested in sailing and fishing than singing, but on occasion she would sing at the restaurant.         Mr. Evinrude died in 1986. In 1994, she married Harold Stuart, an assistant secretary of the Air Force in the Truman administration, who survives her.       
         Joyce Wein, a former vice president of the company that produced the Newport Jazz and Folk Festivals and numerous other events, died on Monday at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital on the Upper East Side. She was 76 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The cause was cancer, said a spokeswoman for the company, Festival Productions, which was founded by her husband, George Wein         Mrs. Wein was a biochemist but became professionally involved in music through her marriage in 1959 to Mr. Wein, the founder of the Newport festivals and the chief executive of Festival Productions. Mrs. Wein was a vice president of the company from shortly after it was established in the early 1960's to the late 1990's, and remained involved in its operations until her death.         Besides the Newport events, Festival Productions presents the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the JVC Jazz Festival in New York and many other events worldwide. Mrs. Wein had a hand in all of them but had especially close ties with the folk festival, which her husband founded in 1959. For several years beginning in 1963, the festival was run by the nonprofit Newport Folk Foundation, which Mr. and Mrs. Wein established with the folk singer Pete Seeger and his wife, Toshi.         Joyce Alexander was born in Boston on Oct. 21, 1928, and majored in chemistry at Simmons College there. She was the jazz columnist for the Simmons student newspaper and Mr. Wein was an aspiring jazz pianist when they met at a jazz concert in Boston in 1947.         Mrs. Wein was a founder of the New York Coalition of 100 Black Women, a charitable organization, and established the Joyce and George Wein Professorship Fund in African-American Studies at Boston University and the Alexander Family Endowed Scholarship Fund at Simmons.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Eugenia Manning of San Francisco and Theodora McLaurin of Hingham, Mass.         Correction:  August 19, 2005, Friday  An obituary yesterday about Joyce Wein, who worked on music festivals and charities with her husband, George, misstated the name of one of her projects. It is the George and Joyce Wein Chair in African-American Studies at Boston University, not the George and Joyce Wein Professorship Fund.       
         Shirley Horn, a jazz singer and pianist who drew audiences close with a powerfully confidential, vibratoless delivery, died yesterday at a nursing home in Cheverly, Md. She was 71. Her death was announced by Regina Joskow, vice president of publicity at the Verve Music Group, Ms. Horn's label.         Ms. Horn was a unique singer, with one of the slowest deliveries in jazz and a very unusual way of phrasing, putting stress on certain words and letting others slip away. She cherished her repertory, making audiences feel that she was cutting through to the stark truths of songs like ''Here's to Life'' and ''You Won't Forget Me.'' She wanted things just so: she stuck with her drummer, Steve Williams, for 23 years, and her bassist, Charles Ables -- who died in 2002 -- for 33.         She lived all her life in and around Washington, often performing close to home to be near her family. But over the last two decades she enjoyed a quietly expanding revival of the concert and club career she had begun in the 1950's, and she became a star in the jazz world.         When she was 4, her mother had her start piano lessons. In her teens she won a scholarship to Juilliard, but it was decided that living in New York would cost the family too much money; she studied classical music at Howard University in Washington instead.         She recalled that at 17, while she was playing classical music at a restaurant in Washington, a man appeared in front of her with a four-foot-tall turquoise teddy bear. ''If you sing 'Melancholy Baby,''' he said, ''I'll give you this bear.'' She did, and he did.         At the time Ms. Horn was shy and largely focused on classical music, but she often cited this as the moment when it dawned on her that if she overcame her reluctance to sing and to play jazz in public, she might be able to make a living at it. About her transition from classical to jazz, she liked to say: ''I loved Rachmaninoff, but then Oscar Peterson became my Rachmaninoff. And Ahmad Jamal became my Debussy.''         From 1954, she led her own jazz trio in Washington. In 1960 she recorded her first album, ''Embers and Ashes,'' for a small label called Stere-o-Craft. It was not widely heard, but Miles Davis heard it, and a year later he tracked down her telephone number in Washington and invited her to open for him at the Village Vanguard in New York. That exposure, plus the help of the jazz agent and manager John Levy, helped get her a contract with Mercury Records.         Mercury signed Ms. Horn as a singer, not a singer-pianist. Although some of the great piano-playing accompanists, including Hank Jones and Jimmy Jones, were hired to play on her records, and although ''Loads of Love,'' from 1962, showcased her voice well -- she could sound like a quieter, subtler version of Dinah Washington -- the situation made her uncomfortable.         By the mid-1960's she had stopped touring and decided to restrict her performing to the Washington and Baltimore areas so she could spend more time at home raising her daughter, Rainy. From 1963 to 1978 she made only two records -- ''Travelin' Light'' for ABC-Paramount and ''Where Are You Going?'' for Perception. From 1978 to 1984, she recorded for the Danish label Steeplechase and slowly came back into the awareness of jazz fans.         In 1982, she played her first New York performance in more than 15 years, at Michael's Pub, and in 1986 she was signed by Verve. The company built up her career all over again over the course of 11 albums, including ''You Won't Forget Me'' (1990), which featured guest appearances by Miles Davis and Wynton Marsalis; ''I Remember Miles'' (1998), which won a Grammy Award; and a few that featured string sections.         Ms. Horn's survivors include her husband, Sheppard Deering, of Upper Marlboro, Md.; her daughter, Rainy Smith, of Maryland; and several grandchildren.         Ms. Horn had been fighting breast cancer for some time when complications of diabetes led to the amputation of her right foot in 2002. For a few years she performed sitting in a chair and facing the audience directly, away from the piano, which was played by George Mesterhazy. But in her final performances in New York, a two-week stretch at Le Jazz Au Bar that started last Dec. 30, she was back at the piano again, with the help of a prosthetic device that helped her to use the instrument's sustain pedal.         Three of those performances will be released in October on a Verve anthology of her work, ''But Beautiful: The Best of Shirley Horn.''       
         Constance Keene, a pianist and teacher whose recordings of the Romantic keyboard repertory were highly regarded, died on Dec. 24 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 84, and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was announced by Debra Kinzler, the spokeswoman for the Manhattan School of Music, where Ms. Keene has taught since 1969. She also joined the school's board of trustees in 1997.         Ms. Keene maintained a fairly low-key performing career in recent years, but her influence as a teacher and occasional writer on keyboard topics for Clavier magazine was considerable. She was a juror at several major competitions, and in addition to her work at the Manhattan School, she gave master classes in Europe, Asia and South Africa.         Early in Ms. Keene's career, her playing was praised by Artur Rubinstein, who said that her recording of the Rachmaninoff Preludes left him ''completely flabbergasted by the fantastic sweep, color, tone and last but not least, by the incredible technique.'' When Rubinstein decided that his children were old enough to take piano lessons, he hired Ms. Keene as their teacher.         Ms. Keene was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 9, 1921, and began to play the piano when she was 4. She completed high school when she was 15 and never attended college or a conservatory. But in 1934, when she was 13, she became a student of Abram Chasins, the pianist, composer, writer and broadcaster. She and Chasins married in 1949, and performed and recorded together as a duo-piano team. Chasins died in 1987. Ms. Keene later married Milton Kean, who survives her.         In addition to her duet performances with Chasins, Ms. Keene pursued a solo career that was given a boost by her victory at the Naumburg Competition in 1943. She then spent the remaining years of World War II touring Army installations for the U.S.O. At one camp, in Mississippi, she played eight concerts in three days for 65,000 soldiers.         She undertook her first professional tour in 1945, and made headlines in 1946 when she substituted for Vladimir Horowitz at a recital for an audience of 4,000. In the several years that followed, she performed with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra, and toured with Benny Goodman, as the soloist in Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue.''         Her recordings included works of Bach, Handel, Griffes, MacDowell, Schumann, Beethoven, Rachmaninoff and Chasins, as well as widely praised recent discs devoted to the complete sontatas of Hummel and Weber.
