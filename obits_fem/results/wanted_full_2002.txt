         Eileen Heckart, the actress with a smoky voice and toothsome smile who won an Oscar for ''Butterflies Are Free,'' three Emmys and a special lifetime achievement Tony, died on Monday at her home in Norwalk, Conn. She was 82.         The cause was cancer, her son Mark said.         One of those ubiquitous actresses who always seemed to be working, Ms. Heckart was perhaps most widely known for her television appearances as Mary Richards's Aunt Flo on the Mary Tyler Moore show, for example, or more recently for her recurring role of the mother of the lawyer James Wyler in the ABC drama ''Murder One.''         Her best-remembered film roles include the mother of Rocky Graziano in ''Somebody Up There Likes Me'' (1956) Marilyn Monroe's waitress friend in ''Bus Stop'' (also 1956) and the overbearing mother of the blind boy in ''Butterflies Are Free,'' for which she won the Academy Award as best supporting actress in 1972.         But the actress often said in interviews that her heart belonged to the stage and that was where she performed the bulk of her work.         She played her share of drinkers --  like the spinster teacher in ''Picnic'' in 1953 and the alcoholic mother whose son drowns in ''The Bad Seed'' in 1955, both on Broadway.         Most recently, in 2000, she played Gladys Green, the lead in ''The Waverly Gallery,'' Kenneth Lonergan's empathetic study of an elderly woman with Alzheimer's disease.         Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley called her performance ''uncanny'' and praised her  ''beautifully coherent and intelligent portrayal of a woman sliding into incoherence.''         The actress was born Anna Eileen Heckart in Columbus, Ohio, on March 29, 1919.         Her parents separated when she was 2. Her father, Leo Herbert Heckart, took her younger brother to live with him, she said, but she remained with her mother, Esther, who was married five times.         Ms. Heckart graduated in 1942 from Ohio State University in Columbus, where she she caught whooping cough, which resulted in the deepening of her voice.         After graduation, she married her college sweetheart, John Harrison Yankee Jr., who became an insurance broker. The couple had three sons, Mark, of Norwalk; Philip, of Stratford, Conn.; and Luke, of Los Angeles, all of whom survive her, along with two half-sisters and Mark's two daughters.         Ms. Heckart began her career in summer stock, came to New York and cut her teeth in live television -- -- ''The Alcoa Hour,'' ''The Philco Television Playhouse,'' ''Goodyear Television Playhouse'' and ''Playhouse 90.''         Her first break onstage came in William Inge's ''Picnic,'' when she was 33. She played a schoolteacher with, as Brooks Atkinson put it in The New York Times, ''a hunger for life and a knack for getting it.''         She made her Broadway debut in 1943 as understudy and assistant stage manager for ''The Voice of the Turtle.''         After ''Picnic'' came ''The Bad Seed.'' Then ''Butterflies are Free'' on Broadway with Keir Dullea and Blythe Danner, in which she played Mr. Dullea's mother.         In 1965, she created the role of the disapproving mother in the Broadway production of ''Barefoot in the Park,'' while also appearing in episodes of television series like ''Gunsmoke'' and ''The FBI.''         The PBS productions ''Save Me a Place at Forest Lawn'' and ''The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds,'' both in 1966, won Ms. Heckart a host of television awards.         Among her other plays were ''The Dark at the Top of the Stairs,'' ''Our Town,'' ''They Knew What They Wanted,'' ''A View From the Bridge,'' ''Mother Courage'' and ''Time of the Cuckoo.''         During a decade of absence from the New York stage, she toured in national companies of Broadway hits, acted in movies and won roles in four separate television series that were picked up and then dropped. The last of these was ''Annie McGuire,'' in 1988, in which Ms. Heckart played Mary Tyler Moore's mother.         When she returned to the theater in the 1989 production of Lee Blessing's play, ''Eleemosynary,'' the Times theater critic Frank Rich welcomed her back.         ''There are some absent friends you don't realize how much you've been missing until they suddenly pop up again,'' he wrote.         ''Ms. Heckart is what one might describe as a long actress,'' Mr. Rich continued, ''long of face, of torso, of tongue. There is mischief in her big glistening eyes. And when she speaks, it is in the low, crystalline, merry rasp of a wise aunt who has seen and understood everything (perhaps with cigarette in hand), relished most of it and can't wait for the next adventure.''         Ms. Heckart smoked up until her death and blamed her friend Bette Davis for her addiction. ''I went to a hypnotist and managed to stop smoking for six months,'' Ms. Heckart recalled in a 1989 interview with The Times. ''Then I appeared in 'Burnt Offerings' with Bette. Well, she smoked all day, and then she asked me to dinner. Pretty soon, I asked her for just one cigarette. Then I had another. And then I was a smoker again.''         In 1997, Ms. Heckart's husband died suddenly on his morning walk. ''I looked out the window and he was gone,'' she told The Times in April 2000. ''It was the worst year of my life.'' The two had been married for 53 years.         She was awarded a special Tony in 2000 for her lifetime of theater work.         In another Times interview Ms. Heckart said her current role in ''The Waverly Gallery'' was her best, except perhaps for her part in ''Mother Courage.''         She also said it would be her last. ''This is my swan song, my last performance in a play,'' she said. ''It just takes too much energy.''         Speaking of her role, she added,  ''You get such a good one, you may as well go out on a wave.''         Correction:  January 4, 2002, Friday  An obituary of the actress Eileen Heckart on Wednesday referred incorrectly to her Broadway appearance as the mother (Mrs. Banks) in ''Barefoot in the Park.'' She did not create the role; she succeeded Mildred Natwick. The article also misstated the number of Emmy Awards she received. It was two, not three.       
         Charity Adams Earley, the commander of the only all-black Women's Army Corps unit to serve overseas during World War II, died on Jan. 13 in Dayton, Ohio, long her hometown. She was 83.         At a time when a segregated military provided few opportunities for blacks, Charity Adams was one of only two to hold a wartime rank in the Wacs as high as major. A subsequent promotion made her a lieutenant colonel briefly before she left military service in 1946.         The Army first permitted black members of the Wacs to serve overseas in the winter of 1945, when it created the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, an all-black unit,  and assigned some 850 African-American women to it. The unit, based in Birmingham, England, and later in Rouen, France, and Paris,  routed mail -- much of it backed up at English warehouses in the chaos that followed the Battle of the Bulge -- to millions of members of the armed forces in Europe.         The assignment of Major Adams as the battalion commander seemed a natural choice. Having grown up in Columbia, S.C. -- her father a minister in the A.M.E. Church, her mother  a teacher -- she had graduated from Wilberforce University in Ohio and was studying for a master's degree at Ohio State when she joined the  Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, the forerunner of the Wacs, in 1942. She was among 39 black women in the corps's first training class, at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, and became one of its first black officers. She then held administrative and command positions at Fort Des Moines for two and a half years.         From her first day in the corps, though, she had to bear the humiliations of a segregated military. Though she had forged a quick camaraderie with white officer candidates who had ridden with her by train to Fort Des Moines, the bond did not survive once they reached their destination.         ''The Army soon shattered whatever closeness we had felt,'' she recalled in her memoir, ''One Woman's Army'' (Texas A&M Press, 1989). ''When we left the mess hall we were marched two-by-two's to the reception center. A young, red-haired second lieutenant said, 'Will all the colored girls move over on this side.' He pointed to an isolated group of seats.         ''There was a moment of stunned silence, for even in the United States of the 40's it did not occur to us that this could happen. The integration of our trip did not prepare us for this. What made things worse was that even after the 'colored girls' had been pushed to the side, all the rest of the women were called by name to join a group to be led to their quarters. Why could not the 'colored girls' be called by name to go to their quarters rather than be isolated by race?''         The members of the 6888th postal unit were the first black women many Britons in Birmingham had ever seen, and they shattered stereotypes.         ''These Wacs are very different from the colored women portrayed on the films, where they are usually either domestics or the outspoken old-retainer type or sloe-eyed sirens given to gaudiness of costume and eccentricity in dress,'' The Birmingham Sunday Mercury said. ''The  Wacs have dignity and proper reserve.''         That dignity was tested by both the Army and the Red Cross.         Major Adams recalled in her memoir that when a general inspecting her battalion was told that not all the women would be present, since some were working and others sleeping after a night shift, he responded, ''I'm going to send a white first lieutenant down here to show you how to run this unit.''         Major Adams replied, ''Over my dead body, sir.''         The general threatened to court-martial Major Adams for that remark, and she, in turn, prepared to file charges against him for disobeying a directive from Allied headquarters to refrain from language stressing racial segregation. The matter was dropped by both sides, and the general later told Major Adams he had come to respect her.         While in England, Major Adams refused equipment from the Red Cross for a segregated recreational center -- the battalion had been permitted use of the same recreational area used by whites -- and persuaded members of the unit not to stay at a segregated Red Cross hotel in London while on leave.         After her military service, she received a master's degree in vocational psychology from Ohio State, then became a dean at Tennessee A&I  College and Georgia State College. The Smithsonian Institution has included her in its listing of the historically most important black women.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Stanley Earley Jr., a physician whom she wed after the war; a son,  Stanley III; a daughter, Judith Earley; two brothers, Senior Bishop John Adams of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and E. Avery Adams; and a sister, Dr. Lucy Rose Adams.         In 1996, Mrs. Earley was honored at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum for her wartime service.  Before leaving Dayton for the ceremony in Washington, she said: ''When I talk to students, they say, 'How did it feel to know you were making history?' But you don't know you're making history when it's happening. I just wanted to do my job.''       
         Peggy Lee, whose sultry singing style set standards for pop jazz sophistication for more than half a century, died on Monday night at her home in Los Angeles. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Nicki Lee Foster. Ms. Lee had surmounted many medical problems to continue performing until the last few years.         She was billed throughout most of her career as Miss Peggy Lee (and, in fact, she insisted on it). In the golden age of big bands she was a singer of renown with Benny Goodman's orchestra and she went on to become a top nightclub singer, a prolific recording artist, a successful songwriter and an actress skillful enough to be nominated for an Oscar.         Duke Ellington called her ''the Queen.'' She was a weaver of moods and colors, her misty voice conveying impeccable rhythmic subtlety and smoldering sexuality. In a world of belters, she was a minimalist who eliminated any hint of the extraneous in both her voice and gestures, and she could stir audiences with an understated phrase more than most singers could by shouting and stomping.         Stephen Holden, a movie and cabaret critic for The New York Times, described her image as ''Billie Holiday meets Mae West.''         Miss Lee made more than 700 recordings and more than 60 albums. Her own favorite album, ''The Man I Love,'' was recorded in 1957 with arrangements by Nelson Riddle and an orchestra conducted by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra was so intimately involved with the album that he obtained some menthol to make Miss Lee's eyes look properly misty for the cover photograph.         She is credited with having a hand in writing more than 200 songs, in most cases as a lyricist. Among the hits she wrote were ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me).'' Her name is indelibly linked with a number of songs, including ''Golden Earrings,'' ''Fever,'' ''Lover,'' ''Big Spender,'' ''You're My Thrill,'' ''I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' ''Them There Eyes'' and the haunting Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller tune that became her signature in later years, ''Is That All There Is?''         ''She makes her listeners feel cherished,'' Whitney Balliett wrote of her in The New Yorker. ''Her singing lulls you, and it is easy to forget how daring it is. Many singers confuse shouting with emotion. Peggy Lee sends her feelings down the quiet center of her notes.''         ''She is a subtle and brilliant showman,'' he added. ''She can slink, arch an eyebrow, pull out a hip and rest a hand on it, half smile, wave wandlike arms, bump, tilt her head and slouch -- all to dazzling, precise effect.''         Miss Lee was named Norma Deloris Egstrom at her birth on May 27, 1920, in Jamestown, N.D. She was the sixth of seven children of Marvin and Selma Egstrom. Her father was a railroad station agent who drank too much. His job kept the family moving from town to town in lonely parts of North Dakota. Her mother died when she was 4 and her father remarried. Five-year-old Norma was brutally abused by her stepmother, who would hit her over the head with an iron skillet, beat her with a razor strap and drag her around by her hair. By the age of 7, she was keeping house, baking, cooking, cleaning and milking cows.         There was never any doubt in her mind that she would become a singer. ''I had always sung -- I sang before I could talk,'' she reminisced in her 1989 autobiography, ''Miss Peggy Lee'' (Donald I. Fine). She was 14 when she made her professional debut at a local radio station in Jamestown and was still a teenager when a program director at a radio station in Fargo gave her a job and her stage name. The job paid $1.50 for each noonday show. To make ends meet, she worked a 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift in a bakery, slicing and wrapping bread for 35 cents an hour.         A friend who had gone to California suggested she join her. She sold the watch her father had given her at her high school graduation for $30, bought a train ticket and arrived in Hollywood with $18. She got a brief singing engagement in a supper club but mostly worked as a waitress before returning to North Dakota. She found work singing for a radio station in Fargo, then as a singer in Minneapolis with Will Osborne's band.         Miss Lee was discovered in Chicago in 1941 by Benny Goodman, who was looking for a replacement for his vocalist, Helen Forrest, who was leaving to join Artie Shaw's band. He heard her sing ''These Foolish Things'' at the Ambassador West Hotel and called the next day, offering her the job. She had a cold the first night she appeared, the critics were unkind, and she wanted to quit. Goodman refused to let her go and she stayed on, at $75 a week.         Later that year, the band played the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, and Miss Lee recalled in her autobiography how awed she had been to see Franchot Tone dancing by with Joan Crawford, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne chatting at their table with Katharine Cornell, and Gary Cooper joking with Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.         It was Miss Lee's sulky rendition of ''Why Don't You Do Right?'' with the Goodman band in 1942 that made her a star. She sang the Joe McCoy song in a voice that demonstrated she could sing of hard times as well as anybody; her version became one of the the biggest selling records in the country:         You had plenty money nineteen twen'y-two         You let other women make a fool of you         Why don't you do right         Like some other men do?         Get out of here and get me some money, too.         Peggy Lee's tour with the Goodman band lasted less than two years but the collaboration made her one of the most famous female vocalists of the time and put her on the road to fame.         In 1943, Miss Lee left Goodman to marry Dave Barbour, the band's guitarist, with whom she collaborated on a number of hits, including ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana,'' a 1948 blockbuster that sold more than two million records and began her long association with Latin-flavored music.         Her swirling 1952 version of the Richard Rodgers waltz ''Lover'' and her 1958 interpretation of ''Fever'' in six-eight time solidified her reputation as one of the most rhythmically inventive and versatile vocalists in pop.         She made her film debut in 1950, playing a minor role in ''Mr. Music,'' and went on, in 1953, to play a featured role opposite Danny Thomas in a remake of ''The Jazz Singer.'' Her performance as an alcoholic blues singer in ''Pete Kelly's Blues'' (1955) won her an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress.         In 1959 she wrote the lyrics for a Duke Ellington song, ''I'm Gonna Go Fishing,'' for the film ''Anatomy of a Murder.''         She also wrote theme music for the movies ''Johnny Guitar'' and ''About Mrs. Leslie,'' and supplied voices for several characters and sang three songs in the 1952 Walt Disney animated film ''Lady and the Tramp.'' She was paid $3,500 by Disney and no royalties. When Disney marketed a videocassette without her consent, she sued the company. In 1992, after a four-year court battle, she was awarded $2.3 million.         Another lawsuit over royalties neared an end last week in Los Angeles, when a superior court judge gave preliminary approval for a $4.75-million settlement between Universal Music Group and several hundred recording artists whose lead plaintiff was Miss Lee. Universal acquired Miss Lee's contract and many others through a series of record company mergers over the years. The suit asserted that Universal had cheated artists by underreporting sales figures and overcharging for services. The company has admitted no wrongdoing, and language in the settlement bars both sides from commenting.         Peggy Lee was a perfectionist who planned every aspect of her performances right down to her hairdos, her costly gowns, her lighting, her entrances and exits, even the movement of her hands. She always appeared with first-rate musicians, including the drummer Grady Tate. For decades, because of respiratory problems that began with a bout of viral pneumonia in 1958, she kept oxygen in her dressing room, and she used it between sets.         Miss Lee's performances at Basin Street East in Manhattan beginning in 1959 were credited by Newsweek with ''single-handedly reviving the supper club business.'' Count Basie, Tallulah Bankhead, Cary Grant, Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald were some of the notables who crowded in every night. With more than 600 people in a space meant for 450, a club representative recalled later, ''we had to hire only skinny waiters.''         Her appearances at the Ballroom, a club in Chelsea, were also treated as events.         Miss Lee was married five times, but her great love, she acknowledged, was her first husband and collaborator, Mr. Barbour. He was the father of her only child, Nicki Lee Foster, of Sun Valley, Idaho. In addition to Ms. Foster, she is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Miss Lee described Mr. Barbour in her autobiography as a self-destructive alcoholic. They were married in 1943 and she said in a 1982 interview that he asked her for a divorce in 1951, ''because he didn't want his daughter to see him with his problem.'' In 1965, after Mr. Barbour had been sober for many years, they decided to remarry, but a few days later he died.         Her second marriage, in 1955, to Brad Dexter, an actor, lasted less than a year, and her third, in 1956, to Dewey Martin, also an actor, ended in divorce in 1959. A fourth marriage, in 1964, to Jack Del Rio, a bandleader, also lasted less than a year.         Besides chronic respiratory problems, Miss Lee encountered a number of serious illnesses and accidents over the years.         Late in the 1970's, she returned to San Francisco from a European tour so ill she was immediately hospitalized. Doctors informed her she had a bad heart, diabetes and a disorder of the inner ear; she also went blind temporarily. She was told to retire but went to Australia on tour instead.         She had double-bypass heart surgery in 1985. Two years later she fell onstage at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and fractured her pelvis. When she recovered, she fell again in the marble bathroom of her home in Bel Air section of Los Angeles, injuring the vertebrae in her lower spine.         Still she performed.         ''Peg,'' her musical autobiography, had a hard time on Broadway in 1983, and closed after 13 previews and five performances. It was a rare failure.         She usually appeared in slinky satin or form-fitting glittering gowns, drop-dead dangling earrings and large round tinted glasses. Later, a shoulder length white-blond wig covered her champagne-blond hair. Still later, she used a jeweled cane and often performed sitting down like Mabel Mercer. She had more heart problems in the early 1990's, her daughter said, and suffered a stroke in 1998 that left her bedridden. In 1992, Mr. Holden reviewed a Peggy Lee performance in New York for The Times and wrote that ''her will power, musicality and professionalism enable her to project a fair degree of the old magic.''         In 1990, she received the Pied Piper Award of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers,  Ascap's highest accolade, given for lifetime achievement.         During her last decade, she tried to retire several times. She painted (one of her paintings hung on the wall of Les Célébrités, a former restaurant in the Essex House in Manhattan), grew roses, watched nature programs on television, was active in the Science of Mind spiritual group,  and listened to Ray Charles, Sinatra, Debussy and Chopin. But it wasn't enough. So she would reappear periodically in smaller settings, basking in the warmth of her audiences.         Obituary       
         Hildegard Knef, the actress whose career emerged from the dark realism of German filmmaking that followed Hitler's defeat and then grew to encompass Broadway, recordings and a best-selling memoir, died yesterday in Berlin. She was 76.         Ms. Knef, whose name was often anglicized as Neff in cast lists for films and plays, died of a lung infection, The Associated Press reported. A heavy smoker for most of her life, she had suffered from emphysema and, earlier, from breast cancer.         In her heyday, Ms. Knef was often described by entertainment columnists as the ''willowy blonde'' with the ''dusky voice'' and the ''generous mouth.'' She made at least 30 films in the United States and Europe, but had a singular triumph in New York in 1954 as Don Ameche's co-star in the Cole Porter hit ''Silk Stockings.'' She portrayed the stolid Soviet commissar Ninotchka (one of Greta Garbo's major film roles), who yields to romance on a spree in Paris. She won raves. Brooks Atkinson, the drama critic for The New York Times, called the show one of Porter's best and described Ms. Knef's stage transformation as the corrupted commissar ''an immensely skillful performance.''         Her success also made her more acceptable to an initially chilly Hollywood film community, which had held her suspect for wartime adventures, later described in her searing memoir, ''The Gift Horse'' (McGraw-Hill, 1971).         Hildegard Frieda Albertina Knef was born on Dec. 28, 1925, in Ulm, Germany, the daughter of Hans Theodor and Friede Auguste Knef. He was a decorated World War I veteran who died six months after her birth. Her mother moved to Berlin to take up factory work. ''As a child I was extraordinarily shy, not at all talkative,'' she recalled in her memoir.         At 17 she left school to become an apprentice animator with U.F.A. (Universum Film Company). After a successful screen test, she transferred to the State Film School at Babelsberg, a Berlin suburb, to study acting, ballet and elocution. Her first stage part was one line in the Deutsches Theater. Josef Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, sent word that he wanted to meet her, but her friends kept her away from him.         Ms. Knef was bombed out of the family's apartment on New Year's Eve 1943. She was later wounded in an incendiary attack. In the last days of the war, Ewald von Demandowsky, a Nazi film director with whom she was in love, led her out of Berlin. On April 18, 1945, she wrote in her memoir, she donned a Wehrmacht uniform and the couple, armed with a submachine gun, pistol and hand grenades, tried to pass through Red Army lines to reach Allied territory. Captured and beaten, she was not discovered to be a woman until she was a prisoner of war in a camp in southeastern Germany among 40,000 German men.  Fellow prisoners helped her escape and make her way back to Berlin.         Before he was killed by his captors, Von Demandowsky directed Ms. Knef to go for protection to Viktor de Kowa, a well-known character actor, in Berlin. With permission from Soviet occupation authorities, de Kowa opened a theater with her as mistress of ceremonies. Soon she got a part in Marcel Pagnol's ''Marius,'' directed by Boleslaw Barlog, one of Germany's theater greats. He also directed her in plays by Shakespeare, Pagnol and George Abbott.         In 1946 Ms. Knef starred in Germany's first postwar movie, ''Murderers Are Among Us,'' in which she played a former concentration camp inmate returning home.         After a few years in Hollywood, she returned to Germany in 1950 to film ''Sinner,'' the story of a prostitute who falls in love with a painter who is going blind. The film caused a scandal when, in a scene of just a few seconds, Ms. Knef appeared nude. In a postwar Germany convulsed by guilt and shame, church leaders called for boycotts and thousands demonstrated against it.         ''A country that had Auschwitz and caused so much horror and then, a few years later, behaves in this manner because I was visible naked on the screen is utterly absurd,'' she wrote later. ''I had the scandal, the producers got the money.''         Among her other films were Anatole Litvak's ''Decision Before Dawn,'' a highly praised 1951 Hollywood film with Richard Basehart and Oskar Werner, about the last days of the war in Germany.         In ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro,'' (1952) she sang three Cole Porter songs. The composer saw the film and engaged her for ''Silk Stockings.'' She had had a bit of voice-  coaching as a teenager, but never considered herself a singer. Her delivery was described variously as ''mellow'' and ''rough and smoky.''         She began writing lyrics in the 1960's during a pause in her acting work and soon developed a successful concert and recording career.         Ms. Knef was married three times and divorced twice. Her first husband, Kurt Hirsch, was an American Army officer who took her to Hollywood in 1947. She later married David Anthony Palastranga, an actor and director, with whom she had a daughter, Christina. She is survived by her daughter and her third husband, Paul von Schell, according to The Associated Press.         Ms. Knef's later years were devoted to singing and writing. Returning to Europe after years in America she remarked, ''Everything when I arrived was under occupation by memories.''       
         Suzanne Bloch, a musician and teacher who spurred interest in early music through her performances on the lute and other instruments, and who promoted the music of her father, Ernest Bloch, died on Jan. 29 in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 94.         In frequent concerts beginning in the late 1930's, Ms. Bloch spread news of the lute, the delicate ancestor of the guitar that was common in Europe into the 18th century but by the 20th had become obscure. She also played the recorder and the virginal, a tiny cousin of the harpsichord, and lectured on Renaissance music at her concerts and in her classes at the Juilliard School, where she taught from 1942 to 1985.         Her concerts were intimate affairs, attempting to recreate the music in its original, private environments. She often dressed in Renaissance costumes, which she made, and never let microphones alter the quiet, ghostly sound of the old instruments, even when she played in a place as large as Town Hall in Manhattan.         The music she played and sang included many works that she unearthed during her frequent research missions through European libraries and conservatories.         Ms. Bloch was born in Geneva in 1907 and moved with her family to New York in 1916, when her father began a series of conducting and teaching posts in American cities. She moved to Paris in 1925 to study music with Nadia Boulanger, and it was at an early-music concert there that she first heard the lute. ''I saw lutes being played,'' she recalled in 1987, ''but they were so soft I couldn't hear them.'' She was entranced.         During the next decade she studied music in Paris and Berlin, and in England in 1933 she met a lute expert, Arnold Dolmetsch, who sold her an instrument from 1600 that he had restored. In 1935 she performed at the Hazelmere Festival in England, and soon moved to New York and began her concert career.         She was largely self-taught in ancient instruments, and she pursued the field with a determination that was partly due to a rivalry with her father, said her son Anthony Smith. ''She wanted to be a composer, but her father put her down,'' he said. ''She wanted a career where her father couldn't criticize her.''         In 1935 she married Paul Smith, a mathematics student at Harvard who had an interest in recorders and early music. He became the chairman of the mathematics department at Columbia, and in New York and Princeton, N.J., Ms. Bloch often played chamber music with prominent scientists. One participant was Albert Einstein, who sometimes irritated the other musicians by not coming in on the beat. ''He couldn't count,'' Ms. Bloch once said.         She was the leading authority on  her father's music, and promoted it  worldwide. She would often write the program notes to concerts of his music, collected voluminous clippings about him and began, but never finished, a biography. She also founded the Ernest Bloch Society in 1967, which has held the Bay Music Festival devoted to his music every summer since 1990, in Newport, Ore. (Ernest Bloch lived on the Oregon shore from 1941 until his death in 1959.)         In addition to Anthony, of Oakland, Calif., Ms. Bloch is survived by another son, Matthew, of Manhattan,  and a grandson, Strider, of San Francisco.       
         Princess Margaret, the younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II, whose troubled private life aroused both worldwide sympathy and widespread reprobation, died yesterday morning in London. She was 71.         She suffered a stroke on Friday afternoon, the latest in a series that had left her partly paralyzed in recent months, and developed heart problems overnight, Buckingham Palace said.         The queen announced the death ''with great sadness,'' according to a statement from the palace.         Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is touring West Africa, said he was ''deeply saddened.''         Attractive and fun-loving, Princess Margaret earned a reputation in her youth as a free spirit. But her 20's were clouded by an unlucky romance with Group Capt. Peter Townsend of the Royal Air Force, a Battle of Britain hero with whom she fell in love when he served as an equerry to her father, King George VI.         A Daunting Hurdle: Divorce         In many ways, the group captain  might have made an ideal husband. But the fact that he was divorced raised strong objections from the very establishment the royal family represented. As queen, Margaret's sister, Elizabeth, was the supreme governor of the Church of England, which forbade divorce. Moreover, in the early 1950's, the political storm surrounding Edward VIII's abdication in December 1936 to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis Warfield Simpson, was a not-so-distant memory.         News media scrutiny was relentless and the pressure intense on Princess Margaret, then third in line to the throne, to break off the relationship. Bowing to the demands of a moral code that a decade later would seem quaint to many people, she chose not to marry him.         In May 1960 she married Anthony Armstrong-Jones, a photographer who was himself the child of divorced parents. Their tempestuous marriage produced two children, but ended in divorce in 1978. The princess did not remarry, but her friendships with men, from prominent people like the actor Peter Sellers to less exalted ones like Roderic Llewellyn, an upper-class drifter 17 years her junior whose main accomplishment appeared to be a talent for gardening, hurt her reputation.         So did the fact that she was often less than gracious when faced with the drudgery of public appearances -- the ribbon-cuttings, diplomatic functions and endless other official occasions by which Britain's royals justify their position and the public money that finances it. Easily bored and often petulant, the princess was known for indulging her moods, which could swing, as Charles Hussey, a British journalist wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1965, from ''a gaiety that was sometimes febrile'' to ''Hanoverian gloom.''         Her extravagant style also prompted outrage. Her wedding cost the British government £25,000 -- then the equivalent of $65,000 -- and her six-week honeymoon on the royal yacht Britannia cost £40,000, or about $115,000. In later years she was criticized for demanding motorcycle escorts and government helicopters to travel around Britain.         Yet admirers spoke warmly of her personal generosity, loyalty to the queen and to her friends, and her irreverent sense of of fun. Louis Armstrong, whose music she loved, once referred to her as ''one hip chick,'' and John Lennon playfully nicknamed her ''Priceless Margarine.''         To many people, Princess Margaret was the black sheep of her generation of royals. But that reputation did not necessarily trouble her. According to a biographer, Theo Aronson, she once told the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, ''Disobedience is my joy.''         Princess Margaret Rose was born on Aug. 21, 1930, at Glamis, Scotland, the second daughter of the Duke and Duchess of York, six years before her father became King George VI with the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII.         The Family Braved the Blitz         She was educated at home with her sister, the future Queen Elizabeth II.  During World War II, when the king and queen tried to present an image of both stoicism and good cheer to a battered nation, they rejected the suggestion that their two daughters be sent to Canada to be safe from the danger of the blitz. Instead, the two girls remained with their parents, very much in the public eye.         But with Elizabeth clearly being groomed as the next queen, Princess Margaret was often relegated to the background. According to some courtiers, her parents tried to make up for it by indulging her. ''When my sister and I were growing up, she was made out to be the goody-goody one,'' Princess Margaret told Andrew Duncan, author of ''The Reality of Monarchy'' (1970). ''That was boring so the press tried to make out that I was wicked as hell.''         But in threadbare postwar Britain, the press often portrayed her as a glamorous, high-spirited young woman who delighted in trips to Paris and dancing through the night in fashionable London clubs.         After Elizabeth married Prince Philip of Greece in November 1947, Princess Margaret became one of the most eligible single women in the world, and her name was coupled with various fashionable young men.         She first met Group Captain Townsend during the war, when he joined King George's entourage. The group captain's heroism -- he shot down 11 German planes -- was coupled with a low-key style that appealed to the king. Indeed, King George was godfather to one of his two sons by his wife, Rosemary Pawle, whom he married in 1941 and divorced in 1952 on the ground of adultery.         His relationship with the princess grew closer after the king's death in February 1952, but it did not become public until the coronation of Elizabeth II on June 2, 1953, when Margaret, in a gesture of affection that was captured by news photographers, brushed some lint from his uniform.         Princess Margaret was then 22 and Group Captain Townsend 38. He later wrote that their love ''took no heed of wealth and rank and all the other worldly, conventional barriers which separated us.''         But under the Royal Marriages Act, passed in the reign of George III, Princess Margaret could not marry without the sovereign's permission. Under intense media scrutiny, the affair became as politicized as the one involving King Edward and Mrs. Simpson 16 years before. Both Winston Churchill and the queen's private secretary, Sir Alan Lascelles, advised against allowing the marriage. Pressing Group Captain Townsend to end the romance, the British government posted him to the British Embassy in Brussels as air attaché in June 1953. Princess Margaret learned of his posting while she was on a tour of Rhodesia.  After her return, the lovers kept in touch by telephone and managed to see each other secretly.         But the government continued to oppose a marriage, and though Princess Margaret turned 25 in 1955 and was thus free to marry without the queen's consent, it was made plain to her that if she chose to marry Group Captain Townsend she would lose her royal rights and income. In October of that year, the couple met in Britain, discussed their situation, and came to a decision.         ''I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Capt. Peter Townsend,'' Princess Margaret announced in a statement. ''Mindful of the church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.''         Sympathetic observers later said that if the couple had been permitted to marry, the princess would have settled down to a more conventional life, like her sister. But in his 1978 autobiography, ''Time and Chance,''  Group Captain Townsend wrote, ''I simply hadn't the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost.''         In 1959 the group captain married Marie Luce Jamagne, a 20-year-old Belgian. The next year, on May 6, 1960, Princess Margaret married Mr. Armstrong-Jones, also a commoner, who was given the title Earl of Snowdon.         A photographer who made a successful career out of photographing the rich and famous, Mr. Armstrong-Jones also enjoyed the the Bohemian side of London life. He and the princess helped liven the staid image of the royal family with a touch of the Swinging Sixties.         Garland Was Not Amused         But Princess Margaret's love of fun and informality coexisted with a  sterner side. She insisted that she be addressed as ''Ma'am,'' except for her closest friends, who were permitted to call her ''Ma'am darling.'' As a houseguest she was notoriously demanding. At parties she often objected if other guests ignored royal protocol and left before her. Even her children were expected to refer to her as ''Princess Margaret'' in front of visitors. So did her husband,  though he was said to have called her Ducky in private.         The haughty manner alienated many friends. Mr. Aronson relates in ''Princess Margaret'' (1977) how at a party in Beverly Hills she once told Judy Garland through an intermediary that she would like to hear her sing. Angered by the form of the request, Miss Garland replied, ''Tell her I'll sing if she christens a ship first.''         Although the princess and her husband appeared to have a happy family life, by the late 1960's there were nasty public quarrels. This, coupled with an often ill-concealed irritability at official functions and a love of reveling, brought growing public ridicule.         Increasingly resentful of life in the public eye, Lord Snowdon began to spend more time away from the princess, working abroad on photographic projects, sometimes in the company of attractive young women. Princess Margaret also went her own way. She was linked romantically with Anthony Barton, a friend of her husband, and then had a relationship with Robin Douglas-Home, an aristocrat and former army officer who was the nephew of a former prime minister and played the piano in nightclubs.         In February 1967, when the British press began reporting that the royal couple were about to break up, Lord Snowdon, who was working overseas, and Princess Margaret arranged to meet in New York and fly on to the Bahamas, trying to give the impression that nothing was amiss. Shortly afterward, Princess Margaret wrote to Mr. Douglas-Home breaking off the affair. Eighteen months later he committed suicide.         Although the royal couple had made a show of togetherness and were often photographed with their children -- David Albert Charles Armstrong-Jones (Viscount Linley) and Sarah Frances Elizabeth Armstrong-Jones (Lady Sarah Chatto) -- their relations continued to deteriorate.         At Home on a Caribbean Isle         Princess Margaret was often seen in the company of famous men, including Mr. Sellers. She also began to spend more time on the Caribbean island of Mustique, where a friend, Colin Tenant, had given her land as a wedding present and where she built a vacation home known as Les Jolies-Eaux.         In September 1973, at a luncheon in Edinburgh, she met the 25-year-old  Roderic Llewellyn, who soon became a favorite companion. The son of minor nobility, Mr. Llewellyn had worked briefly at a mine in southern Africa and as an apprentice brewer in England. Five months after meeting Princess Margaret he spent three weeks as her guest in Mustique. Although their relationship was soon an open secret in royal circles. the queen, according to Mr. Aronson, was said to have disapproved of Mr. Llewellyn and what she called ''my sister's guttersnipe life.'' But the liaison remained unknown to the public.         Then in February 1976 a news photographer's picture of the couple together on the island caused a scandal. In March the royal family announced that Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret were separating.         Meanwhile, the relationship between the princess and Mr. Llewellyn set off a storm in Parliament. When Mr. Llewellyn was hospitalized with stomach problems during a trip to the Caribbean in March 1978, reports that the princess went to his bedside prompted critics to demand that her royal allowance -- then more than $100,000 a year -- be cut. The battle was played out in the newspapers, with some calling for her to end her relationship with Mr. Llewellyn and take her work more seriously, and others writing in her defense.         Although she was patron of more than 80 charities and organizations, colonel in chief of the Highland Fusiliers of Canada and president of the Royal Ballet, there was increasing resentment of her approach to her duties. Critics complained that the number of her public appearances, which had once averaged 150 a year, had dwindled to well below 100. Some Labor members of Parliament called her an embarrassment to the monarchy.         Then in May, while she was hospitalized with hepatitis, Kensington Palace, where she lived, issued a statement announcing her divorce, an action that ended a 400-year-old taboo on divorce in the royal family.         In the fall, Princess Margaret, on an official visit to Tuvalu in the South Pacific, became ill and had to be flown to Sydney, Australia, for treatment. That December, a month after her return to Britain, Lord Snowdon married Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, who had been married to a film director.         Princess Margaret's traumatic private life had long taken a toll on her health. She smoked heavily and her enthusiasm for Scotch sometimes shocked her companions. In 1974, according to Mr. Aronson, she suffered a nervous breakdown.         The princess herself remained reticent about her private life. ''I have no intention of telling people what I have for breakfast,'' she once said.         Sometimes, however, she had a penchant for saying the wrong thing. In October 1979, six weeks after Earl Mountbatten was killed by Irish Republican Army terrorists, she angered many Irish-Americans while on a visit to Chicago, reportedly declaring in the presence of Mayor Jane Byrne that the Irish were ''pigs.''         But she could also be quite gracious. In 1980, when Mr. Llewellyn told her that he was breaking off their relationship to marry Tatiania Soskin, a fashion designer, she assured the younger couple she would be happy to attend their wedding, and she remained friends with both.         Lunch With an Old Lover         As the 1980's progressed, public interest turned to the romantic travails of the next generation of royals. Two of the queen's three sons -- Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Andrew, the Duke of York -- married and divorced under the glare of relentless publicity. Anne, the princess royal and the queen's only daughter, was permitted to divorce her husband, Capt. Mark Philips, and in 1992 married a royal equerry.         Through the years the princess  had corresponded with Peter Townsend and in 1992, while he was on a rare visit to Britain, she invited him to lunch at Kensington Palace attended by several other people. The 77-year-old group captain and the 61-year-old princess sat and ''chatted like the old friends they were.'' Group Captain Townsend died in Paris in 1995.         It was often speculated how different her life might have been had the two been allowed to marry.         ''In my opinion, this was the turning point to disaster for the royal family,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, at the time of Group Captain  Townsend's death. ''After Princess Margaret was denied marriage, it backfired and more or less ruined Margaret's life. The queen decided that from then on, anyone someone in her family wanted to marry would be more or less acceptable. The royal family and the public now feel that they've gone too far in the other direction.''         Princess Margaret is survived by her son, Lord Linley, her daughter, Lady Sarah, and three grandchildren.         As she grew older, the princess  lived less in the public eye. ''They leave me alone these days,'' Mr. Aronson quoted her as saying. ''Today they have other fish to fry.''         Correction:  February 15, 2002, Friday  Because of an editing error, a television review on Feb. 4 about ''Bertie and Elizabeth,'' a ''Masterpiece Theater'' presentation on the life of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, misstated the policy of the Church of England on divorce, a factor in the abdication of her brother-in-law King Edward VIII, who became the Duke of Windsor. An obituary of her daughter Princess Margaret on Sunday also included the error. The church does not forbid divorce. It revokes the right to marry in a parish church while a former spouse is living. But even then, depending on circumstances, a priest can allow a church wedding.       
         Pauline Trigère, the Paris-born designer who was not only her own best model but also an elegant and chic symbol of the American fashion industry for more than half a century, died at her home on the East Side of Manhattan last night, said her daughter-in-law Melanie Radley. She was 93.         ''Fashion is what people tell you to wear,'' she often said. ''Style is what comes from your own inner thing.'' She herself was an exemplar of style, and was described by her peers as ''a truly intellectual designer'' and ''a creator of timeless fashion'' in ready-to-wear clothes.         Her 50th anniversary in fashion, a milestone reached by no other designer in this country, was celebrated in 1992 at a benefit fashion show and dinner at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan. It was attended by 600 of the most influential names in design, manufacturing and retailing, as well as by scores of social and theater personalities who were both clients and friends. The following year, at a ceremony at Lincoln Center, Miss Trigère received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.         She was noted not only for her designing skills, but also for her tailoring and such touches as constructing dresses with no obvious seams.         She did not sketch her designs: in the tradition of Lanvin and Chanel, she cut and draped from bolts of fabric. Her clothes were worn by such women as Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Beverly Sills, Evelyn Lauder, Rita Gam and Dina Merrill.         Miss Trigère wore only her own designs, and she generally punctuated them with several of her trademark turtle pins. She was known both for her meticulous grooming and for a charm that surmounted her blunt, sometimes impolitic comments, spoken in a Gallic accent she never lost.         On occasion a prima donna, a description she never challenged (she once told an assistant ''There is room for only one prima donna around here, and that's me''), she was often impatient. But her displays of temper were brief. She admitted that she was outspoken to a fault, but seemed to revel in that image. A woman meeting her at a social event once gushed, ''Oh, Miss Trigère, I have a dress of yours that I've worn for 25 years.'' The designer fixed her with an icy glance and said, ''Just what am I to do with that piece of information?''         Once, when she was approached by two retailers while dining in a restaurant after one of her shows, she asked them, ''Did you come to copy or to buy?''         She was also a woman of strong beliefs. In 1961, she became the first name designer to use an African- American model. She rarely hesitated to offer an opinion and had no reservations about discussing her life and background -- with one exception. She steadfastly refused to reveal her age and sloughed off questions on the subject with ''I'm past 75, I still walk, and I don't dye my hair blond and I don't touch it up.'' For years, a silver streak intersected her simple hair style, but gradually she allowed the streak to evolve into a blend of salt sprinkled with pepper.         She finally revealed her age in 1998 when she held a 90th-birthday party for herself with 200 guests at La Grenouille restaurant in Manhattan. (During the festivities she announced that her age on the invitation had been printed upside down).         Unlike almost all other name designers, who stage their shows without commentary and emerge only at the finale to the sound of applause, Miss Trigère usually stood on the stage during her presentations, eyes partly obscured by tinted glasses, and talked about each design as it appeared. She interspersed information about fabric and style with somewhat Rabelaisian humor. Typical of her remarks was one she made at the appearance of a dress with a particularly revealing décolletage. ''You can see the boobs better,'' she said. During a personal appearance, she was asked what she really wanted to be. ''A courtesan,'' she replied.         Miss Trigère was born in 1908 in the Pigalle district of Paris to Russian-Jewish parents. Her mother was a dressmaker and her father a tailor who had made military uniforms for Russian aristocrats. She grew up behind the shop in Paris and picked up pins for a few centimes a week. She remembered designing her first dress in her early teens, although, she said, she never particularly wanted or intended to be in the fashion business. As a young woman, she preferred taking part in amateur theatrical productions and even thought of becoming a surgeon, an ambition nipped by her father before it was even a bud.         She married Lazar Radley, a Russian immigrant and a tailor, because, she said, ''I was young, my mother worried about me, he wanted to marry me and so I did.'' She had two sons before her husband, increasingly concerned about the rise of Hitler, decided to leave France. The Radleys left Paris in 1937 and were bound for Chile with what was to be a brief stopover in New York. But, she recalled, ''New York captured my heart,'' and the family settled in Manhattan.         Within a short time, the Radleys opened a small tailoring business with Miss Trigère's brother, Robert.         Five years later, in 1942, Mr. Radley walked out on the marriage, leaving his wife to bring up the two children. Some years later, he wrote to ask for a divorce. Miss Trigère signed the papers and never heard from him again. She did not remarry, but she had several of what she termed ''longstanding friendships.''         ''Don't say 'beaux' -- I hate the word 'beau,' '' she always exclaimed when the subject came up.         She is survived by her two sons, Jean-Pierre Radley and Philippe Radley and a granddaughter, Karen, all of Manhattan.         Although the original business ended when Mr. Radley left, the following year, Miss Trigère and her brother were back with a collection of 11 styles. Within three years, her name was a recognized one in fashion. In the ensuing decades, she received, in addition to three Coty Awards and inclusion in the Coty Hall of Fame, major fashion awards from Neiman Marcus and Filene's, the National Cotton Award and both the silver and the vermeil medals of the City of Paris.         In addition to creating women's fashions, at various times Miss Trigère also designed scarves, jewelry and men's ties. She also developed her own perfume, called Trigère.         Although new and younger designers gradually replaced her at the top of the fashion hierarchy, and a number of stores that had been important customers went out of business, Miss Trigère continued to design collections and to take part in fashion press weeks until 1994. She closed her ready-to-wear business at that time, partly because several of her principal accounts went into bankruptcy, owing her money. She moved out of her prestigious Seventh Avenue showrooms and took a small space elsewhere in the fashion district, forming a company called P. T. Concepts to market her scarves and jewelry. It was during this period that she underwent several eye and throat operations. She gave up even her smaller space in 2000.         Despite her sophistication, she never lost a sense of delight and wonder at the friendships she enjoyed with many of the illustrious names in the fashion, arts, business and political worlds. She entertained frequently, both in her Manhattan apartment and at her country house, called La Tortue (the Turtle), in South Salem, N.Y. She was known as an excellent cook, and in both homes the atmosphere was informal but carefully orchestrated. She was one of the first hostesses to set a formal table but to have guests follow her into the kitchen to pick up their second courses buffet style.         Once she bought her country house, she spent several years tripling its size. ''I'm engaged, married and completely devoted to this house,'' she once said. She was equally passionate about the grounds, and was a dedicated and knowledgeable gardener.         She was dedicated, also, to her adopted country.         ''People always say to me, 'Aren't you French?' and I say, 'No, I am American,' '' she said. ''I found in this country everything I wanted. This country made me Pauline Trigère.''         Shortly after her 90th birthday, she told friends that she had left instructions that she wanted to be cremated wearing her trademark bright red lipstick. ''What does it matter?'' one friend asked. ''Who will know whether or not you have lipstick on?''         ''I'll know,'' she said.         Miss Trigère's family said there would be a viewing tonight at the Riverside Memorial Chapel on the Upper West Side.

Within three years, her name was a recognized one in fashion. In the ensuing decades, she received, in addition to three Coty Awards and inclusion in the Coty Hall of Fame, major fashion awards from Neiman Marcus and Filene's, the National Cotton Award and both the silver and the vermeil medals of the City of Paris. She was awarded the French Legion of Honor in December in New York.         In addition to creating women's fashions, at various times Miss Trigère also designed scarves, jewelry and men's ties.         Although new and younger designers gradually replaced her at the top of the fashion hierarchy, and a number of stores that had been important customers went out of business, Miss Trigère continued to design collections and to take part in fashion press weeks until 1994. She closed her ready-to-wear business at that time, partly because several of her principal accounts went into bankruptcy, owing her money. She moved out of her prestigious Seventh Avenue showrooms and took a small space elsewhere in the fashion district, forming a company called P. T. Concepts to market her scarves and jewelry. It was during this period that she underwent several eye and throat operations. She gave up even her smaller space in 2000.         Despite her sophistication, she never lost a sense of delight and wonder at the friendships she enjoyed with many of the illustrious names in the fashion, arts, business and political worlds. She entertained frequently, both in her Manhattan apartment and at her country house, called La Tortue (the Turtle), in South Salem, N.Y. She was known as an excellent cook, and in both homes the atmosphere was informal but carefully orchestrated.         Once she bought her country house, she spent several years tripling its size. ''I'm engaged, married and completely devoted to this house,'' she once said. She was equally passionate about the grounds, and was a dedicated and knowledgeable gardener.         She was dedicated, also, to her adopted country. ''People always say to me, 'Aren't you French?' and I say, 'No, I am American,' '' she said. ''I found in this country everything I wanted. This country made me Pauline Trigère.''         Shortly after her 90th birthday, she told friends that she had left instructions that she wanted to be cremated wearing her trademark bright red lipstick. ''What does it matter?'' one friend asked. ''Who will know whether or not you have lipstick on?''         ''I'll know,'' she said.       
         Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, who emerged as a popular, prolific writer of keenly observed nonfiction with a 1978 book about the dozen years she spent as a Jehovah's Witness, died on Wednesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 67 and lived in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn.         The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said her daughter, Anna Harrison. She once wrote that for years she smoked six packs of cigarettes a day.         The turning point in her life and career was her decision, at 22, to leave the Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade a college education. What followed was a successful self-education and a blossoming into a multifaceted writer of literate travel books, many essays and reviews, and a novel.         With ''Visions of Glory: A History and a Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Simon & Schuster), she became nationally known; her later work, mostly nonfiction, usually received excellent reviews.         In The New York Times Book Review, Vivian Gornick said ''Visions of Glory'' was ''quite well written, contains a mass of absorbing information, and the personality of its author is extremely appealing.''         Ms. Harrison was converted to the Jehovah's Witnesses faith by her mother when she was 9; she went door to door carrying its message. At 19, she went to live and work at its world headquarters, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society in Brooklyn Heights.         After three years there, she renounced the faith and left.         ''Visions of Glory'' mixes her autobiography with detailed historical research. She portrays the religion as racist, sexist and totalitarian, but also details members' kindness to one another, their care for the elderly and their courage in the face of persecution.         Barbara Grizzuti was born in Jamaica, Queens, on Sept. 14, 1934. She grew up in various Brooklyn neighborhoods, mainly Bensonhurst. Her father, a printer, and her brother, Richard, did not become Jehovah's Witnesses, creating a deep fault line in the household. She wrote of an extremely disorganized family, and of a father who sexually abused her and once tried to kill her.         As a young teenager, Barbara already knew she wanted to be a writer. When asked in an interview in ''Contemporary Authors'' how she could reconcile this ambition with the tenets of the Jehovah's Witnesses, she suggested that the religion's images of the watery creation of the world and its imminent bloody destruction stimulated her imagination.         ''I think the two things were going on simultaneously: the religion encouraged something it was bound to squash,'' she said.         In her autobiography, ''An Accidental Autobiography'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1996), she wrote, ''I read Sartre in my late teens and made the mistake of taking him seriously.''         After leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses, she moved to the East Village and worked as a secretary at a publishing house and at the American Committee on Africa. There she met W. Dale Harrison, whom she married. He took a job with CARE, and they lived in Libya, India and Guatemala.         They returned to Brooklyn with their two children, and she wrote that she thought of herself as ''one of those furtive, silly housewives with a novel under her apron.''         Her first book, ''Unlearning the Lie: Sexism in School'' (Liveright, 1969), grew out of the children's experiences with efforts to quell sexism at what was then the Woodward Park School in Brooklyn.         The Harrisons divorced in 1968 after eight years of marriage.         Ms. Harrison was an early writer for Ms. Magazine. Often described as a gifted interviewer, she contributed to many other national magazines and newspapers. She was noted for her humor and her strong opinions; she once called the highly regarded novelist Joan Didion a ''neurasthenic Cher.''         Her other books included ''Italian Days'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1989), an impressionistic and literary travel book about Italy that won the American Book Award, and a novel, ''Foreign Bodies'' (Doubleday, 1984).         Ms. Harrison is survived by her daughter, who lives in Bethlehem, Conn., and her son, Josh Harrison of Manhattan.         Her daughter said her mother returned to the religion of her early childhood, Roman Catholicism, in her 40's, partly as a result of interviewing Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement and partly because she hoped to meet in heaven the high school English teacher who had first appreciated her writing.       
         Ruth Handler, creator of the Barbie doll, one of the world's best-selling toys and one that became an icon of American popular culture, an artistic muse and a lightning rod of feminist politics, died on Saturday at a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 85.         Mrs. Handler experienced complications after having colon surgery several months ago, said her husband, Elliot.         In 1959 when she invented Barbie, a busty figure with platinum-blond hair and piercing blue eyes, Mrs. Handler created the country's first mass-marketed adult-looking doll for girls -- and an image that would later be attacked by feminists as a symbol of objectification and repression. Critics said the doll gave girls misguided goals, whether for their careers or for their own physical development.         Mrs. Handler, though, seemed unmoved, her husband said. ''It really didn't bother her,'' he said. ''She thought they were wrong.''         Mrs. Handler named the doll after her daughter. Barbie's male counterpart, Ken, named after Mrs. Handler's son, soon followed. More than one billion Barbies have been sold in 150 countries.         Barbie was a particularly pioneering creation because in 1959 innocent, cherubic baby dolls dominated the toy market. And Barbie's fly-off-the-shelf popularity transformed the sleepy company that sold the doll, Mattel Inc., into a postwar success story.         Mrs. Handler was a founder of Mattel and helped run the company for 30 years, until she and her husband, then co-chairmen, resigned in 1975 amid a scandal.         ''Every little girl needed a doll through which to project herself into her dream of her future,'' Mrs. Handler said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. ''If she was going to do role playing of what she would be like when she was 16 or 17, it was a little stupid to play with a doll that had a flat chest. So I gave it beautiful breasts.''         Barbie was conceived as a teenage fashion model, and her first outfits were named for her various activities, according to M. G. Lord, author of ''Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll.'' Early outfits included ''Friday Night Date'' and ''Sorority Meeting.''         And Barbie kept pace with the times. During Camelot, she sported a Jacqueline Kennedy hairdo. During the civil rights movement, Mattel created Barbie's first black friend, ''Colored Francie.''         But not until the 1970's, as the criticism from feminists materialized, did her career choices -- and her outfits -- begin to change to include a doctor, astronaut and veterinarian, among others.         A chief objection of feminists, including the National Organization for Women, was that Barbie's figure created unrealistic expectations for young girls that could lead to low self-esteem. People often joked that Barbie's measurements were not humanly possible. But in fact it was determined that if the 11 1/2-inch doll were 5-foot-6, her measurements would be 39-21-33. One academic expert calculated that a woman's chances of having Barbie's figure were less than 1 in 100,000.         In her 1994 autobiography, ''Dream Doll: The Ruth Handler Story,'' Mrs. Handler wrote: ''My whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little girl could be anything she wanted to be. Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices.''         In 1978 Mrs. Handler and several other former officers of Mattel were indicted on charges of fraud and false reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. She pleaded no contest to the charges, which investigators said resulted from attempts to influence stock prices, and was fined and sentenced to community service.         Mrs. Handler, though, had already embarked on a second career, starting a company that made prosthetic breasts for cancer survivors. In talking about her two careers, Mrs. Handler was known to say, ''I've lived my life from breast to breast.''         She was found to have breast cancer in 1970 and had her left breast removed. She said it was impossible to find an acceptable replacement breast. ''Until now,'' she said in 1977, ''every breast that was sold was used interchangeably for the right or the left side. There has never been a shoemaker who made one shoe and forced you to put both your right and your left foot in it.''         After developing a line of artificial breasts made of foam and silicon that she called ''Nearly Me,'' she became a well-traveled advocate for early detection of breast cancer, at a time when there was little public discussion of the disease. Mrs. Handler, who once described herself as a ''marketing genius,'' was often known during those years to open her blouse at interviews and ask a reporter or photographer to feel her breasts to determine which was real.         She ran the breast prosthesis company, Ruthton Corporation, for 15 years, fitting women, including Betty Ford, for the artificial breasts herself, before selling it to a division of Kimberly-Clark, her husband said. But she never made much of a profit.         ''She was working on that from the heart,'' Mr. Handler said.         The youngest of 10 children of Polish immigrants, Ruth Mosko was the daughter of a blacksmith who had settled in Denver. She left Denver for Hollywood at 19 and stayed, marrying her high school boyfriend, Mr. Handler, who became a specialist in designing plastic products.         The two, along with a short-term partner, founded Mattel in 1945. Inspired by her daughter's fascination with paper dolls that looked like teenagers or adults and came with multiple outfits and accessories, Mrs. Handler decided to produce a doll that she described as looking more or less like a real teenager.         The doll she created resembled a sex toy called Lilli, which Mrs. Handler had seen on a trip to Germany. After she battled years of prudish resistance to the Barbie concept among the male executives at Mattel, the doll was finally cleared for production. And in 1959, wearing a zebra-striped maillot and tall stiletto heels, Barbie made her debut at the American Toy Fair in New York.         Long After Mrs. Handler left Mattel and turned away from toys, Barbie remained wildly popular, not only as a toy, but as a touchstone of American culture. Barbie, sometimes wearing outfits and hairdos that might send shudders up Mrs. Handler's spine, has been the subject of art exhibitions, an Andy Warhol painting, a television documentary, books and Web sites, including Barbie.com and AdiosBarbie.com, a site dedicated to improving women's body images.         Mrs. Handler's son, Ken, died of a brain tumor in 1994. She is survived by her husband of 63 years; a daughter, Barbara Segal of Los Angeles; a brother, Aaron Mosko of Denver; five grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.       
         Laura Johnson, a flamboyant New York social figure who reveled in personal publicity but refused to have her many philanthropies made public, died May 12 at her home in Manhattan. She was believed to be in her late 80's, but although she celebrated her birth date, July 17, her birth year remained a mystery even to those closest to her.         Mrs. Johnson and her husband, Raymond Johnson, a Saks Fifth Avenue executive who died in 1965, were prominent members of cafe society, constantly seen and photographed at El Morocco, the Stork Club and other fashionable nightclubs of the era, and at numerous charity benefits.         She was never lost in a crowd. She delighted in being the center of attention and worked at it. On occasion, though, she was not above shooing away people who might share a photograph with her.         She subscribed to the more-is-better school of fashion and was well aware of the swiveling heads and incredulous stares as she strolled the Upper East Side, or anywhere else. Just when it seemed she could go no further with her extraordinary hats, she appeared in a confection fashioned like a rooster sitting in a nest of feathers, the whole thing perched rakishly on her explosion of red hair.         A friend who encountered her on Madison Avenue swathed from head to knees in blue fox, complete with tails, made a mild remark about the generous amount of fur.         ''No one outfoxes Laura Johnson,'' she said.         Bill Cunningham, who over four decades photographed her on numerous occasions, said: ''She liked clothes and people with spirit. She could give you a snow job, and when you called her on it, she'd back down and laugh at herself.''         At benefits she paraded in bejeweled exuberance, her designer gowns notable for a décolletage that verged on the reckless.         Other than her age, the only thing she refused to discuss or make public was her philanthropy. In one typical gesture several years before the World Trade Center terrorist attack, she gave the Police Department $1 million.         ''She came into my office with Howard Safir, then the police commissioner,'' the former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Thursday at her memorial service. ''She wouldn't let us have a press conference or publicize her contribution other than within the department.''         After Sept. 11, she gave another $1 million to the families of police officers and firefighters, he said.         She was also a generous contributor to Literacy Partners, the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of the City of New York. She also raised funds for what was then the American Symphony Orchestra and the charities that benefited from the April in Paris Ball.         Mrs. Johnson, then Laura Safir, met her future husband in 1956, three years after arriving in Manhattan from Europe. They were married two years later, and shortly after Igor Cassini, who wrote the Cholly Knickerbocker gossip column, described her as the city's ''bird of paradise.''         She was born near Bucharest, Romania, one of 11 children, and received her primary education there. She spent the years after 1948, as pieced together from family and friends, at the Sorbonne in Paris, where, she said, she received doctorates in law and philosophy, but apparently never practiced or taught in either discipline.         After her arrival in New York in 1953, she took courses in English at Hunter College, but her speech always retained a decided European inflection.         Her survivors include a brother, Adorel Safir, who lives in Israel, and a stepson, Patrick Johnson of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass.         Before her death she had a farewell message that was illustrated with her favorite flower, a rose, printed for the friends who attended her memorial. ''I love you and I will watch over all of you with love,'' it read in part, and she signed each one individually.         ''She was a caricature but a lovable one,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''Her life was a banquet, and she wanted her friends to share it.''       
         Zypora Spaisman, who did everything to keep Yiddish theater alive, from producing plays to selling tickets to sweeping floors to her great love, acting (including not a few Jewish-mother roles), died on May 18 in Manhattan. She was 86.         The Yiddish stage was the center of Mrs. Spaisman's life, from her girlhood in Poland to a Soviet labor camp to Paris and Montreal and finally to New York, where she became a principal force in maintaining the nation's only surviving Yiddish theater, the Folksbiene (People's Stage). She seems never to have made a penny for her efforts.         ''Nearly single-handedly, she led the pack in the fight to keep Yiddish theater going,'' said Eleanor Reissa, the artistic director of the Folksbiene, for which Mrs. Spaisman was once in charge of productions.         In 1914 there were 14 Yiddish theaters in New York, and avant-garde movements like naturalism, expressionism and Stanislavsky's Method often found their first expression there. But the combined effects of the Holocaust, the diffusion and assimilation of American Jews and the aging of the immigrant population gnawed away at audience numbers.         A bitter, often-quoted joke in Yiddish circles is that each time one of the Yiddish theater's remaining audience members dies, a seat is removed so it will not look empty. But dwindling numbers only heightened Mrs. Spaisman's determination.         ''My whole life has been about preserving the Yiddish language,'' she said in an interview. ''Hitler didn't kill it. Neither did Stalin.''         Zypora Tanenbaum was born in Lublin, Poland, on Jan. 2, 1916. By the time she was 10, she was participating in town and school dramatic presentations in both Polish and Yiddish, a language that mingles Old High German and Hebrew, with Slavic and Romance elements.         She graduated from nursing school, became a midwife in 1933, and married Joseph Spaisman in 1938. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, she saw her sister shot. The Spaismans fled to the Russian part of Poland, and from there were taken to a labor camp in the Urals.         Mrs. Spaisman delivered more than 1,000 babies while in the camp. Each Sunday, she would organize a Yiddish theatrical presentation in a different barracks, said her son, Ben-Ami, who survives her, along with his two children.         When Mrs. Spaisman returned to Poland after the war, she learned that all the members of her family were dead, as were most of the country's Jews. She acted in the Yiddish theater in Lodz, working with the great Yiddish comedians Shimen Dzigan and Yisroel Shumakher. In Paris and Montreal, where she waited with her husband and son for permission to enter the United States, she also worked in the theater.         The Spaismans came to New York in 1955, and she sought stage work at the Hebrew Actors Union, but was rebuffed. So she went to the Folksbiene, which she had heard about from a Polish director.         The company, which opened in 1915, is now the oldest continually performing Yiddish theater in the world. Although Mrs. Spaisman never worked with the renowned actress Molly Picon, she appeared with many of the other luminaries of the Yiddish stage.         She often created characters that combined surface humor with inner wisdom. The publication Back Stage called her ''the grande dame,'' and The Jewish Week referred to her as ''a national treasure.'' Reviewing ''The Land of Dreams'' in The New York Times in 1989, Richard F. Shepard called her ''the mistress of the glumly comic look and acerbic tongue.''         Mrs. Spaisman's fans seemed to respond to her performances as if the characters she played were real. Once when she portrayed a shabbily dressed town gossip, two women met her outside the theater with new stockings and blouses.         ''You make us laugh, you make us cry,'' they told Mrs. Spaisman, according to The Jerusalem Post. ''You're so poorly dressed, we brought you these things.''         In 1989, Mrs. Spaisman appeared in the movie ''Enemies: A Love Story,'' directed by Paul Mazursky and starring Anjelica Huston and Ron Silver. During her acting career, she won an Obie Award, a Drama Desk Award and a New York City People's Choice Award.         Mrs. Spaisman, who lived in Manhattan, supported herself by working as a recreation director at the Jewish Institute for Geriatric Care, first in Manhattan and then in New Hyde Park, N.Y. On a typical day, she left for work at 7 and returned at 5 to cook dinner for her husband and son. Then she went to rehearsal. Performances were on weekends.         Mr. Spaisman died in 1997. In 1998, Mrs. Spaisman was shocked when the Folksbiene board eliminated her position -- executive producer -- to hire younger producers attuned to younger audiences. She refused to retire gracefully.         ''They wanted to give me a nice party,'' she said in an interview in The Times in 2000, ''to get money in my name and give it to the Folksbiene. And I should step down. I have to be such an idiot?''         Ms. Reissa said she wanted Mrs. Spaisman to remain as a valuable consultant; Mrs. Spaisman refused. With her death, the three people who long steered the Folksbiene are now gone: Benjamin Schechter, managing director, died in 1994, and Morris Adler, president, died in December at 107.         After what Mrs. Spaisman insisted on viewing as her dismissal, she took the Folksbiene's mailing list with her and started a new Yiddish theater company, the Yiddish Public Theater.         She cast herself in a starring role in November 2000 in its first and so far only production: ''Grine Felder'' (''Green Fields''). A review in Back Stage said that in her role as a mother, she ''proves that passing time cannot deter a real trouper.''       
         Barbara Anne Castle, a onetime Labor cabinet minister and determined socialist whose radical, ill-timed attempt to tame Britain's mighty trade unions doomed her political career, died yesterday. She was 91.         She died peacefully in her sleep at her home in Buckinghamshire, her family said in a statement. In a tribute, Prime Minister Tony Blair described her as a ''radical independent spirit.''         Baroness Castle of Blackburn, as she became in 1990, served in Harold Wilson's first two Labor cabinets, from 1964 to 1970, and in his third, from 1974 to 1976. After Mr. Wilson's surprise resignation in 1976, she might well have become party leader and the first woman to serve as prime minister. But the unions, aroused by her efforts to curb their power, cut short her rise.         In 1969, as secretary of state for employment and productivity and with the prime minister's enthusiastic support, Ms. Castle had published a plan called ''In Place of Strife,'' which sought to inject some discipline into Britain's chaotic industrial relations by making trade unions subject to legal sanctions.         The proposal proved popular with the public at large but split the Labor cabinet and provoked so furious a backlash from the unions, on whom the party relied for votes and money, that it had to be withdrawn.         The home secretary, James Callaghan, had led the opposition to her plan within the cabinet, and when he succeeded Mr. Wilson as prime minister in 1976 his first act was to dismiss her. He told her she was too old for ministerial office.         Three years later, despite a lifetime's opposition to British membership of the European Common Market, as it was then called, Ms. Castle left the House of Commons and embarked on a second political career as a member of the European Parliament, where she spent the next 10 years fighting European federalism but supporting efforts to establish Europe-wide social standards.         Considered one of the most left-wing members of Mr. Wilson's three cabinets, Ms. Castle was an intensely ideological politician, a stranger to compromise and pragmatism whose misfortune was to serve at a time when Britain's perilous economic condition required both skills.         As Britain's first minister of overseas development, she pulled together a disparate array of aid programs run by different departments and subjected them all to a single test: the promotion of development in backward countries.         In 1965 she took over the transport ministry, where she confronted the railway unions with a recommendation to close 2,000 stations and 3,000 miles of track -- a task proposed by the preceding Conservative government.         She also introduced breathalyzer testing in a crackdown on drunken driving that cut road deaths by 1,200 in the first year and ordered safety belts fitted to new cars.         As secretary for employment and productivity, she legislated equal pay for men and women. And after a spell in opposition, she overhauled Britain's social security system as secretary for social services, linking state pensions to average earnings and introducing new child allowances paid directly to the mother rather than through a husband's pay check.         But she always served in governments buffeted by industrial unrest and unending currency crises, which forced them into deflationary policies she could never accept. She also served under party leaders anxious to maintain good relations with Washington during the Vietnam War, which she strongly opposed. She differed with the leaders also over their resolve to retain Britain's nuclear deterrent, which she wanted to abandon, and their determination to keep Britain in the European Common Market, which she had never wished to join.         Barbara Anne Betts was born on Oct. 10, 1910, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the daughter of a socialist tax inspector who taught himself ancient Greek and a strongly socialist mother, both of Quaker background.         From Bradford Girls Grammar School she won a scholarship to St. Hugh's College, Oxford, where, excluded from the student debating society, known as the Union, because it did not admit women, she threw herself into Labor Party politics to the neglect of everything else, graduating with a disappointing third-class degree.         After Oxford she entered local politics in London and helped found a left-wing weekly, Tribune, which was edited by her lover, William Mellor, who died before they could marry. Soon afterward she met Ted Castle, a political journalist, and married him in 1944. He died in 1979. They had no children.         She was sent to Parliament for Blackburn in Lancashire in 1945 as part of the postwar Labor landslide. The election brought Clement Attlee to power and led to the creation of the National Health Service and the nationalization of large swaths of British industry.         Ms. Castle's personal popularity with the party's rank and file was confirmed in 1950 when she was elected to its national executive committee, a post she held until 1979. But in her autobiography she acknowledged that the split between the party's extreme left wing (led by the Welsh firebrand Aneurin Bevan) and Labor's leadership ''helped keep the party out of office for 13 years.''         In 1952, Mr. Bevan published a personal political testament called ''In Place of Fear'' that greatly influenced Ms. Castle's thinking and largely explains how a self-proclaimed leftist like herself could set out to discipline Britain's powerful unions.         She borrowed shamelessly from its title when she called her reform blueprint ''In Place of Strife,'' thus seeking to place it in the middle of radical Labor Party thinking. What inspired those reforms, she wrote in her autobiography, was Bevan's plea for politicians to be more flexible and his belief that their ''Holy Grail'' should be ''the living truth, knowing that the truth being alive must change.''         This lead Ms. Castle to conclude, as she put it, that ''the trade unions, being an expression of the living truth, must learn to change their role'' and become more responsive to the needs of society as a whole.         Although ''In Place of Strife'' was stillborn, the task she had set herself would be accomplished a decade later by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, in every way her antithesis and a woman she disliked.       
         Shirley Hayes, who waged a long battle -- called quixotic by some, psychotic by others -- that eventually succeeded in banning cars from Washington Square Park in Manhattan, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 89.         She marshaled children in strollers, including her own four sons, to press the case that Greenwich Village's only significant park had no business being a bus turnaround, much less being cut in half by a four-lane road.         She collected 16,000 signatures and the endorsements of politicians, newspapers, 12 parent-teacher associations and the Lions Club. When others sought some middle ground, say a smaller road, Mrs. Hayes spurned deal making.         ''When Shirley refused to compromise, I told her she was turning into a crackpot,'' said Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York, in an interview with McCall's magazine in 1967. At the time he was a lawyer living in the Village.         ''I thought it was unreasonable to expect the city to cut a major artery and detour traffic through narrow streets,'' Mr. Koch said, ''but she proved her goal was not unrealistic.''         The long-running drama included some legendary New Yorkers: Robert Moses, the powerful official who demanded the biggest road possible, was her arch enemy. Eleanor Roosevelt, the former first lady who had once lived on Washington Square, was her illustrious supporter. Carmine DeSapio, the leader of Tammany Hall, was the éminence grise who at the final moment gave the quiet nod to her position.         ''This was where the tide turned against the indiscriminate taking of parkland for automotive purposes,'' said Henry J. Stern, the former city parks commissioner, who last year put up a sign in Washington Square honoring the event.         Mrs. Hayes was born Shirley Zak on June 15, 1912, in Chicago. She attended the University of Wisconsin and studied painting at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and acting at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She moved to New York in 1932 to pursue a career in acting. In 1936, she appeared in Leslie Howard's ''Hamlet,'' which was making Broadway history by competing with Sir John Gielgud's ''Hamlet.'' She played a lady in waiting and met her husband, James, during the production; he played a pallbearer.         They had four sons: Christopher, who lives in Manhattan and Los Angeles, and his twin, Kerry, who lives in Toronto, Timothy, of Manhattan and East Hampton, and Dennis, of Rio de Janeiro and Manhattan. In addition to her sons, she is survived by four grandchildren.         Mrs. Hayes, who was often busy entertaining clients for her husband, who had gone into advertising, also became involved in other neighborhood causes, like fighting the large apartment houses that Robert Moses eventually built south of Washington Square. Because she frequently took her sons to Washington Square Park, she leapt into the fight in 1952, when Mr. Moses proposed building a 48-foot roadway through it. The road -- which would have linked Fifth Avenue on the north side of the park to West Broadway on the south -- would have wiped out some playgrounds. ''A few women got together to say no, no, no,'' Mrs. Hayes said in an interview with The Villager, a neighborhood paper, last fall.         The debate took many turns; one big struggle was over what to do with the buses that already used the park as a turnaround. Eventually politicians came up with the idea of using a smaller road as a compromise. The original proposal for a below-the-ground road was changed to ground level. But Mrs. Hayes had decided she would accept nothing less than no road through the park, and no vehicles of any kind in it, including the buses.         ''She took the extreme position,'' said Anthony Dapolito, owner of Vesuvio Bakery and long a leader in Greenwich Village politics. ''She and the mothers kept insisting and wouldn't give up.''         On April 9, 1959, the city's Board of Estimate, the body that then governed the city's spending and land use, voted to oust cars entirely, shortly after Mr. DeSapio, always attuned to opinion in the Village, had passed the word that he wanted them out.         In her 1961 book, ''The Life and Death of Great American Cities,'' Jane Jacobs noted the courage of the position taken by Mrs. Hayes and her allies: ''They advocated eliminating the existing road, that is, closing the park to all automobile traffic -- but at the same time, not widening the perimeter roads either. In short, they proposed closing off a roadbed without compensating for it.''         Ms. Jacobs wrote that traffic did not become unmanageable, and that more of the low-scale profile of Greenwich Village was preserved. Others suggested that the defeat of the road represented the first nail in the coffin of Mr. Moses's plan for a Lower Manhattan expressway. The park road would have fed into the Moses freeway, which he planned to link the bridges and tunnels to Brooklyn and New Jersey.         Mrs. Hayes was divorced in 1965 and went to work as a classical radio disc jockey on WNYC's ''While the City Sleeps'' and other programs. She also worked with Mayor John V. Lindsay, for whom she campaigned, on making the city friendlier to movie companies. She was a charter member of the National Organization for Women.         Correction:  May 15, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary on Saturday about Shirley Hayes, who successfully fought a road through Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, reversed two words in the title of a book by the urban planning critic Jane Jacobs, which praised her. It is ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' not ''Life and Death.''       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early Sunday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for the dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote of the events in Warsaw. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism there and all over the European Continent.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink and outsmoke it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published and syndicated by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and later became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent as well.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Affairs. She was also given honorary doctorates by the University of California at Los Angeles, Columbia, Princeton, Mount Holyoke, Bucknell, Muhlenberg and Manhattan Marymount.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles. She earned a bachelor of arts degree three years later, in 1941, graduating summa cum laude and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board of directors, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancée jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a 1992 book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead, Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union. ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, ''It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         June Jordan, who came of age as a poet when the voices of black female writers were just beginning to be heard, died on June 14 at her home in Berkeley, Calif.         She was 65. The cause was breast cancer, which she fought for a decade, said Adrienne Torff, a friend.         Like the careers of Audre Lord and Alice Walker, Ms. Jordan's was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. Her poetry was imbued with advocacy for the poor, for women and the disenfranchised.         In an interview yesterday, Ms. Walker, a close friend, called the small, elegant but tough Ms. Jordan, ''unwillingly nonviolent.'' In ''Poem About Police Violence,'' she wrote about the so-called accidental death of a black man in police custody: ''Tell me something/ what you think would happen if/ everytime they kill a black boy/ then we kill a cop/ everytime they kill a black man/ then we kill a cop/ you think the accident rate would lower/ subsequently?''         Still, Ms. Jordan could be a poet of great delicacy, as in ''On a New Year's Eve,'' in which she describes watching a lover sleep: ''and/ as I watch your arm/ your/ brown arm/ just/ before it moves/ I know/ all things are dear/ that disappear/ all things are dear/ that disappear.''         She was the author or editor of 28 books, essays and novels for children and the libretto for the 1995 opera by John Adams ''I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.''         She was also a teacher. At the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a professor of African-American Studies, she founded Poetry for the People, which trains undergraduates to take poetry to community groups as a form of political empowerment.         Ms. Jordan was born in Harlem, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Granville Ivanhoe Jordan, a postal clerk, and Mildred, a nurse. Ms. Jordan's mother was deeply depressed and eventually committed suicide.         Her father had wanted a boy and referred to her as ''he.'' In ''Soldier: A Poet's Childhood'' (Basic Civitas Books, 1999) she described being brutally beaten by him: ''Like a growling beast, the roll-away mahogany doors rumble open, and the light snaps on and a fist smashes into the side of my head and I am screaming awake: 'Daddy! What did I do?!' '' Yet her father helped forge her identity as a writer, she said, giving her books by Paul Lawrence Dunbar and forcing her to memorize Shakespeare.         In a radio interview two years ago, Ms. Jordan appeared to have come to terms with her father. She said: ''He didn't know what to do to try to provide against the failure of his only child in this new land. I think that probably contributed to the violence of his frustration. But that he loved me and thought me capable of anything and everything there was never any doubt.''         After the family moved to Brooklyn, Ms. Jordan became the only black student at Midwood High School. Later, she won a scholarship to the Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts, now the coeducational Northfield-Mount Hermon School.         After Northfield she attended Barnard College in New York City where she met Michael Meyer, a white student. The couple married and had a son, Christopher, who lives in Montana.         In her book of essays, ''Civil Wars'' (Scribner's, 1996), Ms. Jordan wrote of the difficulties of an interracial marriage. In 1966 the couple divorced. She raised her son largely on her own, struggling to eke out a living as a freelance journalist. She was a researcher and writer for Mobilization for Youth in New York, and in 1967 she got a teaching job at City College. Two years later she published a children's book, ''Who Look at Me?''         To the end, she remained involved in politics. In September Basic Civitas books is scheduled to publish ''Some of Us Did Not Die,'' which contains essays on Israel, Islam and O. J. Simpson. The book's title is from a poem she read last year in a speech at Barnard. She spoke of her battle with breast cancer and about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which she said proved the need for a secular democracy that protects the rights of ''male/ female/Jew/ Gentile/ Muslim.''         She read from a poem in which she imagined her dying body and a predatory hawk gliding overhead: ''He makes that dive/ to savage/ me/ and inches/ from the blood flood lusty/ beak/ I roll away/ I speak/ I laugh out loud/ Not yet/ big bird of prey/ not yet.''         Correction:  June 20, 2002, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about the poet June Jordan misspelled the middle name of an author whose books she credited with having helped forge her identity as a writer. He was Paul Laurence Dunbar, not Lawrence.         Correction:  June 27, 2002, Thursday  An obituary of the poet June Jordan on June 18 misspelled the surname of a poet whose career, like Ms. Jordan's, was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. She was Audre Lorde, not Lord.       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''         She advised millions of readers on problems ranging from acne to alcoholism to AIDS, often in spirited competition with her identical twin sister, who wrote the advice column Dear Abby.         At the time of Mrs. Lederer's death, her column was carried in more than 1,200 newspapers around the world, with a readership of 90 million, according to Creators Syndicate, her distributor. A 1978 World Almanac survey named her the most influential woman in the United States.         ''I would rather have my column on a thousand refrigerator doors than win a Pulitzer,'' she once said.         A petite, elegant woman who favored high heels and silk, Mrs. Lederer had delicate features and a voice of pure ground glass.         An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail. The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers. Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancé's father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.         But even then, Mrs. Lederer discussed more controversial issues. During her first year she responded to a letter about homosexuality, taboo advice-column fare in the 1950's. The paper in St. Joseph, Mich., refused to print the column; the publisher told her he planned to run an announcement on Page 1 that the column would not be appearing that day because the subject matter was unfit for a family newspaper.         ''I called the publisher up and said, 'This is a human problem, and that is what I do,' '' she told The New Yorker in a 1995 interview. The publisher held firm.         ''I said: 'Fine. Then everyone in St. Joe is going to buy The Detroit Free Press to see what you won't print.' I called The Free Press and told them to get ready for a lot of extra sales.         ''From then on, boy,'' she added, ''that St. Joe paper printed every damn word I wrote.''         Early in her newfound career, Mrs. Lederer often phoned her twin sister, Pauline Phillips, for help with her replies. Mrs. Phillips, who lived in California, proved so good at coming up with pithy one-liners that within a few months she began writing her own advice column in The San Francisco Chronicle under the name Abigail Van Buren. As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m.         She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of goodwill to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         Fans and Powerful Enemies         After the column on her divorce, she received more than 35,000 letters of encouragement from readers, had the linings removed from her fur coats, and kept on going.         ''A divorce,'' she once said, ''is nothing compared with the problems I see in my everyday mail.''         Although those problems would progress from Saturday-night dating woes to late-20th-century ills like domestic violence and crack, Mrs. Lederer was sometimes astonished to discover the everyday things that could inflame the passions of her readers.         She once threw her column open to a discussion of whether toilet paper should be hung with the free end coming over or under the roll; 15,000 letters later, Mrs. Lederer (herself in the ''under'' camp) had to call a moratorium on further debate.         Occasionally Mrs. Lederer's work was the source of public embarrassment. In 1982, she admitted to having recycled 15-year-old letters for use in a number of current columns. In 1993 she was discovered to have embellished a letter about fraudulent charities by adding condemnatory remarks of her own.         And a 1995 interview with The New Yorker in which she called Pope John Paul II ''a Polack'' drew widespread criticism.         She apologized for the incidents in print, resolving to do her customary penance, ''40 lashes with a wet noodle.''         And while her column made Mrs. Lederer powerful friends, from prominent educators and executives to presidents, it also brought her bitter enemies.         Among her detractors were the National Rifle Association, which opposed her advocacy of gun control; groups opposing abortion, which deplored her abortion-rights position; and animal-rights organizations, angered by her support for the use of animals in medical research.         ''Those three groups really despise me, and I'm very proud of it,'' she said in 1993.         All in all, she said, being Ann Landers proved far more involving -- and more gratifying -- than she could ever have anticipated when she brought home her first stack of letters in 1955.         ''I cannot imagine a career that could be more rewarding,'' Mrs. Lederer said in a 1990 interview. ''There is enormous satisfaction in knowing that I've been able to touch the lives of millions of people. Where does anybody get a job like this?''         Mrs. Lederer, who owned the rights to the Ann Landers name, often said she did not expect anyone to replace her after her death. There would be no newspaper contest, no tales of disputed walnuts. ''There will never be another Ann Landers,'' she told The New Yorker. ''When I go, the column goes with me.''       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''         She advised millions of readers on problems as varied as acne, alcoholism and AIDS, often in spirited competition with her identical twin sister, who wrote the advice column Dear Abby.         At the time of Mrs. Lederer's death, her column was carried in more than 1,200 newspapers around the world, with a readership of 90 million, according to Creators Syndicate, her distributor. A 1978 World Almanac survey named her the most influential woman in the United States.         ''I would rather have my column on a thousand refrigerator doors than win a Pulitzer,'' she once said.         A petite, elegant woman who favored high heels and silk, Mrs. Lederer had delicate features and a voice of pure ground glass.         An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail.         The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers.         Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancé's father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.         But even then, Mrs. Lederer discussed more controversial issues. During her first year she responded to a letter about homosexuality, taboo advice-column fare in the 1950's. The paper in St. Joseph, Mich., refused to print the column; the publisher told her he planned to run an announcement on Page 1 that the column would not be appearing that day because the subject matter was unfit for a family newspaper.         ''I called the publisher up and said, 'This is a human problem, and that is what I do,' '' she told The New Yorker in a 1995 interview. The publisher held firm.         ''I said: 'Fine. Then everyone in St. Joe is going to buy The Detroit Free Press to see what you won't print.' I called The Free Press and told them to get ready for a lot of extra sales.         ''From then on, boy,'' she added, ''that St. Joe paper printed every damn word I wrote.''         Early in her newfound career, Mrs. Lederer often phoned her twin sister, Pauline Phillips, for help with her replies. Mrs. Phillips, who lived in California, proved so good at coming up with pithy one-liners that within a few months she began writing her own advice column in The San Francisco Chronicle under the name Abigail Van Buren. As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m. She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of good will to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early yesterday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for her dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy, in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism all over Europe.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and also became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Affairs.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles, where she earned a bachelor of arts summa cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancée jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House, 1992).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union.         ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, 'It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died last night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Tormé seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike.         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and concert stages singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. ''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano,'' and ''This Old House.'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window,'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.         She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy, which she witnessed first hand; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family.         And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         In 1946, Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys all around the country speculated was was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947, she was gaining notice. In 1948, Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band, but Rosemary stayed with him another year before she left as well, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs For Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it but He insisted. The recording became a runaway best seller and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano'' that also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She married Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and made more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         But in the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle, and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This For Remembrance.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968, she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, She was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         In the 1990's, she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her children: the actor Miguel Ferrer; Maria, a designer; Gabriel, a painter married to Debby Boone; Monsita Teresa; Rafael, a voice-over actor, and her husband, Dante DiPaolo, a dancer. Other survivors include a nephew, George Clooney, the actor.       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died Saturday night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Tormé seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike. In the words of the director Mike Nichols, ''She sings like Spencer Tracy acts.''         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and on concert stages, largely with small groups, singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. Rather than acting out the romantic dramas of well-known song lyrics, she projects an understanding that is almost maternal in its blend of wisdom and empathy.''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' which became a huge hit record, and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano'' and ''This Old House,'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear long after she was pursuing a less-flamboyant repertory.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page, never to Rosemary Clooney. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said about her earlier recording career.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded pensive ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.         She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy, which she witnessed first hand; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family.         And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         She was nominated for an Emmy award for an appearance on ''E.R.,'' the series that featured her nephew George Clooney, and this year she was given a lifetime achievement Grammy award a month after she was hospitalized for lung cancer surgery.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness. One of the Clooney children, Andy, drowned as a boy swimming in the Ohio River. But the others survived and remained close. They included Betty, who sang professionally for a while with Rosemary; and Nick, who became a television performer. Another sibling, Gail, did not venture into show business.         When Rosemary was 10 and in the fourth grade, she made her acting debut in a school production of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' in which she played the witch. That same year her paternal grandmother died, sending her father into an intensified period of drinking. Rosemary and her siblings were sent to live with her mother's family, the Guilfoyles. After Rosemary completed the sixth grade her grandmother took her to Ironton, Ohio, east of Maysville. Two years later, they moved to Cincinnati.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them, and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         Grandmother Guilfoyle , who sewed as well as she could cook, made them dresses, and one of their uncles, George Guilfoyle, accompanied them on the band bus to make certain that they were not led astray by any of Mr. Pastor's musicians.         In 1946 Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys speculated was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947 she was gaining notice. Downbeat magazine said she had ''an extraordinarily good voice, perhaps the nearest thing to Ella Fitzgerald we've ever heard.'' In 1948 Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band. Rosemary stayed another year before she left, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording, no matter how many copies it sold.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs for Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television, including the Ed Sullivan show.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' The song was based on something old and Armenian, updated by the novelist William Saroyan and Ross Bagdasarian, who later changed his name to David Seville and created the Chipmunks. From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it, but he insisted, hinting broadly that if she refused, her career at Columbia might come to an end. The recording became a runaway best seller, and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano,'' which also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton,'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She fell in love with Dante DiPaolo, a dancer at Paramount studios, but jilted him to marry Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and to make more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         In the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle that went nowhere (he was married and the father of six children) and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic, and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This for Remembrance.'' ''The records I did then sound like they were made underwater. I misbehaved with everyone, onstage and off.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968 she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles by Sirhan Sirhan. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, she was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         Unexpectedly she ran into Mr. DiPaolo, who moved in with her and became her road manager, and in 1996 she married him in the church in Maysville where she had been baptized.         In the 1990's she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label, and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her husband, Mr. DiPaolo; three sons, the actor Miguel Ferrer; Gabriel Ferrer, a painter and Episcopal priest married to Debby Boone; and the voice-over actor Rafael Ferrer; two daughters, Maria Murdoch, a designer; and Monsita Teresa Botwick; 10 grandchildren, her brother, Nick Clooney, and her sister, Gail Clooney Darley.         When she was in her 60's, Ms. Clooney said, ''If you hang around long enough, you get a lot of good stuff.'' Most of the time, she added, her life was pretty good.       
         Annie Snyder, a leader of efforts to prevent the development of land near the site of the Civil War battles of Bull Run in northern Virginia, died on July 19 in Manassas, Va. She was 80. She and her husband had a farm near the battlefield.         The cause was pneumonia, The Associated Press reported.         By 1988 Mrs. Snyder had been involved, by her count, in six efforts in 30 years to prevent developers from encroaching on what she called the ''hallowed ground'' of the battlefield. She said then that she had lost only one confrontation, when a power company strung lines near the field.         In an interview in The New York Times in 1988, she said, ''When we first moved here it was easy to imagine at night that you heard the creaking of leather saddles as General Longstreet's advanced guards arrived to help Stonewall Jackson as he held on to that railroad embankment over there.''         At the time, she was leading conservationists and Civil War enthusiasts in opposing developers who wanted to build a giant shopping mall next to the battlefield. She also generated backing for her side of the issue in Congress, where legislation was passed to buy and protect the land where the mall was to have been built. The confrontation over the plan for a shopping mall has been called the Third Battle of Bull Run.         Earlier, she had prevailed against federal officials who wanted to rearrange roads near the battlefield. Other victories included helping to thwart plans to build a Great America theme park near the historic site.         In the 1950's she championed civil rights in Virginia and was active in the Republican Party.         Born in Pittsburgh, Anne Delp Snyder attended the University of Pittsburgh's law school. In World War II she was one of the first female officers in the Marine Corps, serving in the United States as a recruiter and a quartermaster.         Her survivors include her husband, Waldon Peter Snyder, known as Pete, a former Marine Corps aviator; six children; six grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.       
         Lorna J. Marshall, a college English instructor turned homemaker who in her 50's began a new life as an anthropologist studying the Bushmen of Africa, died on July 8 at her home in Peterborough, N.H. She was 103.         She had lived with her daughter, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, since 1996, Ms. Thomas said. She previously lived in the same house in Cambridge, Mass., since the late 1920's.         Mrs. Marshall's anthropological career began when her husband, Laurence K. Marshall, a founder and president of the Raytheon Corporation, retired in 1950 with the thought that it was time to get reacquainted with his family.         ''Where is the remotest place we can go and be a family again?'' Mr. Marshall asked, said Irven DeVore, the More research professor of anthropology at Harvard.         The Kalahari Desert was the answer he found. He decided he would take his family to live among the legendary Bushmen.         ''They became a sort of Swiss Family Robinson of the Kalahari,'' Dr. DeVore said.         The family's accomplishments made it more than that. Mr. Marshall helped the Bushmen start a fine-wool industry. The Marshalls' son, John, began his career as a leading maker of ethnographic documentary films. Ms. Thomas, who would go on to write best sellers like ''The Hidden Life of Dogs,'' wrote a well-received book on the Bushmen, ''The Harmless People'' (Knopf, 1958).         Meanwhile, Mrs. Marshall began the painstaking process of documenting the culture and behavior of the Bushmen, sometimes called !Kung. (The ''!'' represents a clicking sound in their language). She was the first of dozens of scholars who have made the Bushmen one of the world's most studied populations of traditional hunter-gatherers.         ''To say she started it is not a mistake,'' Dr. DeVore said. ''By standards of ethnography, she did as well or better than any monograph I know, and she was there early.''         Over the next two decades, the Marshall family made eight trips to the Kalahari, a desert the size of Spain in what is now Namibia, Botswana and the Republic of South Africa, staying for as long as a year and a half at a time. Then the family would return to Cambridge, where Mrs. Marshall would employ the best graduate students to organize her voluminous notes, which resulted in two books and many articles.         An honor she particularly valued was having a !Kung baby girl named after her. The child was called Norna, because the Bushmen, for all their ability to make unusual vocal sounds, cannot pronounce the letter L.         Lorna Jean McLean was born in Morenci, a mining town in the Arizona Territory, on Sept. 14, 1898. Her father, Gordon McLean, a mining engineer, died when she was 7. Her mother, the former Bessie Holmes, remarried and moved with her daughter to Riverside, Calif., and then Los Angeles.         Miss McLean graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in English. She then gave up the beginning of a career in ballet to travel around the world with her mother, who had been widowed again. They traveled throughout the Middle East and Asia. In China, they met an instructor at Mount Holyoke College who offered Miss McLean a job teaching English.         She accepted, but soon met Mr. Marshall in Nova Scotia, where both had relatives. They married and moved to Cambridge.         At the Cambridge Community Center, she organized women to salvage tungsten wire from radio tubes that Raytheon could re-use in making electronic devices. The salvage operation employed black and white women, unusual at the time, and permitted women to work flexible hours, which was also unusual.         Mr. Marshall said he wanted to do something with his family when he retired, and its members were interested in anthropology. So he asked his wife to take some courses at Harvard, which she did from time to time among trips to Africa.         The family was at first apprehensive about tales of poison darts and trance dances, but found the Bushmen polite and kind. The Marshall family lived in tents, even as temperatures ranged from freezing to 125 degrees.         Mrs. Marshall published her first book, ''!Kung of Nyae Nyae,'' in 1975 (Harvard University Press), and her second, ''Nyae Nyae !Kung Belief and Rites,'' three years ago (Peabody Museum Press).         She is survived by her daughter, her son, who lives in Belmont, Mass., three grandchildren and three great-granddaughters.         She is remembered by others. A year or so after her 100th birthday party, the child of a Bushman she had known as a child came to visit her.       
         Doris Wishman, a prolific independent director of truly tasteless movies -- from nudist camp romps to the cult classic ''Bad Girls Go to Hell'' -- died on Aug. 10 in Miami. She lived in Coral Gables, Fla.         She never revealed her age, but her passport carried a date of birth of April 23, 1920, making her 82, said Michael Bowen, who is writing her biography. He said family members believe she was around 90.         Miss Wishman has been called the female Ed Wood, the legendary director of ''B'' movies. She wrote, produced, cast, directed and edited around 30 films, including several she made under pseudonyms. She rarely spent more than $70,000 on a picture, usually beginning by begging her sister Pearl Kushner, who also lives in Coral Gables and is her only immediate survivor, for startup money.         Joe Bob Briggs, the drive-in movie critic, called her ''the greatest female exploitation director in history.''         She often said she did not like her movies, but she clearly enjoyed making them. The title of Mr. Bowen's biography is ''It's Better Than Sex,'' a phrase she often applied to filmmaking. Her work, which had faded from view in the 1980's, made a resurgence after being featured at the Harvard University Film Archive in 1994.         She was born in Manhattan, and her mother died when she was a young child. Her father, who sold hay and grain, and his six children then moved to Westchester County. Miss Wishman took some courses at Hunter College and studied acting.         She took a job as a secretary and movie booker in a relative's film distribution business. She married an advertising executive, Jack Abrahms, and moved to Florida; he died a few years later.         In her grief she wanted work that would occupy all of her waking time. She decided she could produce independent films as well as distribute them, and hit upon the idea of making films about nudist camps. Recent court rulings had removed them from censorship.         She made a total of eight, including ''Blaze Starr Goes Nudist,'' the only feature film starring the burlesque queen (as herself).         ''Nude on the Moon,'' in which astronauts are greeted by naked women with pipe-cleaner antennas poking out of their bouffant hairdos, was banned in New York State. The censor board at the time allowed only films about nudist colonies, turning aside her argument that it was about a nudist camp on the moon.         In her next phase, she made sexual melodramas in which women were depicted as tragic heroines being exploited by men. There was nudity and plenty of violence against women but no explicit sex. In the grainy black-and-white pictures, which included titles like ''A Taste of Flesh,'' she defined a quirky personal style: bizarre cutaways to ashtrays, lamps and squirrels; suggestive lesbian subplots and gratuitous nudity and violence.         By the early 1970's, court decisions allowed and audiences demanded more explicit pornographic films. She made several, but left the room when sex scenes were being shot.         ''She was actually rather sexually naïve,'' Mr. Bowen said. ''She personally thought someone's hand caressing your face was more erotic than sex itself.''         Her big successes in the 1970's were two films starring Chesty Morgan, named for her commanding physical endowments. The movies had scant sex and very little nudity.         Miss Wishman wanted to make ''slasher'' films like ''Friday the 13th,'' but she lacked the money and technical skills. But in 1989, ''A Night to Dismember'' was finally released.         She had moved back to New York after the death of her husband and married again in 1966, a man she referred to only as Lou in interviews. The marriage ended in divorce in the mid-1970's.         She moved back to Florida in the late 1980's and was working in a lingerie store when interest in her work, which was readily available on video, began its resurgence. Her last movie, ''Each Time I Kill,'' will probably be released later this year, Mr. Bowen said.         He said that despite the raciness of her films she herself claimed little sexual experience.         ''I've had two husbands and a lover, and that's my quota,'' she said.       
         Kim Gallagher, a slim but strong runner who overcame endless illnesses to win a silver medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and a bronze in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, died Monday in a Philadelphia hospital. She was 38 and lived in Oreland, Pa.         The cause of death was a stroke, her husband, John Corcoran, said. She learned she had colon cancer after the 1988 Olympics and stomach cancer in 1995. In remission from colon cancer, she resumed running and last competed in the 1992 United States Olympic trials.         Both Olympic medals came at 800 meters, and Gallagher was the only American woman or man to win an individual track medal in Seoul at a distance longer than 400 meters. Her 1988 Olympic time of 1 minute 56.91 seconds still ranks as the third fastest by an American woman at 800 meters, behind Jearl Miles-Clark (1:56.40) and Mary Decker Slaney (1:56.90).         Her athletic success was remarkable considering her health. Six months before the 1984 Olympics, she had surgery for multiple cysts on her ovaries caused by an estrogen imbalance. The condition reappeared until it was finally relieved by hormone treatment.         Years later, when colon cancer was diagnosed, Gallagher rejected her doctor's recommendation of surgery and chemotherapy, treating it with vitamins, diet and rest. The cancer went into remission, then reappeared in 1994.         A year later, she said: ''I'm fine, I'm healthy, I'm strong. But I really can't work a full day. I get tired.''         In 1996, she used a wheelchair, but she refused to see doctors and improved enough to walk with a cane.         Kimberly Ann Gallagher was born June 11, 1964, in Fort Washington, Pa., near Philadelphia. Her track career started at age 7 when she followed her 9-year-old brother, Bart, to his track club.         ''He told me I couldn't join the club and not to hang around him,'' she once said. ''I remember I was wearing clogs, and I knew that I was ready to do track, whatever that was.         ''When I won my first trophy and it was as big as me, I knew I wanted to someday make the Olympic team.''         At 8, she ran a 5:37 mile, the fastest by a girl that age. At 16, she finished eighth in the 800 meters in the Olympic trials.         Gallagher attended the University of Arizona for a semester and a half, training with the men's cross-country team. She left college, she said, because ''world-class training and competing for a college don't go hand in hand.''         Until college, she had been coached by her brother, Bart, who died in 2000. When she left college, he looked for an experienced coach for her and chose Chuck DeBus in California. DeBus coached her from 1983 to 1988, but he said her health prevented her from completing half her workouts. ''Who knows how fast she could have run if she could have trained like a normal person?'' he told The Los Angeles Times.         DeBus was later barred for two years by The Athletics Congress, then the sport's national governing body, for supplying anabolic steroids to his athletes.         After Gallagher started training with DeBus, her 5-foot-5 body became muscular, although her weight seldom exceeded 108 pounds. She said she never took steroids.         ''I never wanted to look like all those pumped-up, big-looking, talking-weird women,'' she said. ''I liked my looks too much.''         Gallagher insisted she never loved the sport. She liked what it brought, especially a Mercedes-Benz and a Malibu home after her 1984 Olympic success.         She is survived by her husband; her 13-year-old daughter, Jessica Smith; her mother, Barbara of Philadelphia; and her father, John of Benson, Ariz.         She summed up her career by saying: ''I needed to run for all the wrong reasons. I needed to run to keep my shoe contract. I needed to run to pay my bills. I learned a huge lesson. When I ran in the 1984 Olympics, I was going to be a star. I was going to make so much money, and I did.         ''But it doesn't last if you're not devoted to what you're doing. I was not devoted to my running, and it showed. I don't get a great joy from running or training or going out and doing all the work. Running is not something I love, but I like excelling at things that I am good at.''       
         Lynda Van Devanter, whose pained account of her life as an Army nurse in Vietnam focused attention on the burdens of American servicewomen in the war, died on Nov. 15 at her home in Herndon, Va. She was 55.         At the Vietnam Veterans of America, where Ms. Van Devanter founded and administered a project dealing with the concerns and complaints of the 7,465 women who had served in Vietnam, a spokesman said she had long been ill with a vascular disease that she attributed to wartime exposure to chemical agents.         ''She had an Agent Orange claim that we will continue to pursue for her daughter, Molly,'' said the spokesman, Rick Weidman.         Ms. Van Devanter's memoir was ''Home Before Morning'' (Beaufort Books, 1983), which helped inspire the television series ''China Beach.'' In it, she wrote of her transformation in 1969 from ''an all-American girl'' and idealistic supporter of the war into an overworked, confused nurse at the 71st Evacuation Hospital in Pleiku, where the gore and horrors of war were constantly before her.         She wrote of surgeons' sometimes working drunk on alcohol or high on drugs; of overburdened nurses and medics who sought release not only in liquor but also in marijuana and desperate if casual relationships; of the way her early pro-war enthusiasm waned amid the blood and casualties. Her experience was so alarming to her that the most pleasurable work she could later recall was her assignment to help a leper colony of Vietnamese.         And then, after a year, it was over.         Her tour of duty in Vietnam completed, Lieutenant Van Devanter returned to the United States to continue her service, only to discover another kind of pain.         ''Somewhere between 1945 and 1970, words like bravery, sacrifice and valor had gone out of vogue,'' she wrote. ''When I returned to my country I began to learn a very bitter lesson. In the eyes of most Americans, the military services had no more heroes, merely baby-killers, misfits and fools.''         After her discharge she worked as a nurse in several civilian hospitals, but failed to free herself of the traumas inflicted by Vietnam. She later described her work record as spotty and her relationships as tormented and unfulfilling. She drank heavily, she said, and cried continually.         ''I was on unemployment and food stamps and in therapy,'' Ms. Van Devanter said in an interview in 1981. ''But I never told my therapist I was in Vietnam. That's how deeply I buried it.''         Then one night in 1979, while visiting friends on eastern Long Island, she was awakened by a siren from a nearby volunteer firehouse. It made the same sound as the alert that had signaled rocket and mortar attacks on Pleiku, and Ms. Van Devanter found herself compulsively crawling out of the house.         That led her to enlist in a counseling program known as ''walking through Vietnam,'' which in turn led her to write her memoir and to focus attention on the concerns of female veterans.         At the outset of the book, which she wrote with Christopher Morgan, she said she had initially tried ''to exorcise the Vietnam War from my mind and heart.'' In the process, she said, she learned that she wanted not to obliterate her memories but rather to show ''that the war doesn't have to own me, I can own it.''         She dedicated her book in part to ''all of the unknown women who served forgotten in their wars.'' When it appeared in 1983, it provoked a sharp dispute between Vietnam War nurses who claimed that the accounts of partying, drinking and drug use were exaggerated and those who insisted that the descriptions were accurate.         The critics, who called themselves Nurses Against Misrepresentation, or Nam, complained that Ms. Van Devanter's account could leave relatives of dead soldiers believing that their kin had not received the best possible treatment.         But others jumped to the author's defense. One, Winnie Smith, has written that she was close to suicide when she recognized the demons of her own traumatic stress after reading ''Home Before Morning.'' That experience led her to write her own book in 1992, ''American Daughter Gone to War.''         Ms. Van Devanter established the Women's Project at the Vietnam Veterans of America, overseeing studies that underscored her view that though Vietnam veterans in general were ''a forgotten minority,'' the women who had served as nurses were ''the most forgotten.''         She cited complaints she gathered that no women had been included in studies on the effects of the defoliant Agent Orange and that veterans' hospitals provided no gynecological or obstetrics clinics.         Ms. Van Devanter, a native of Arlington, Va., is survived by her husband, Tom Buckley, and their daughter, Molly; a stepdaughter, Brigid Buckley of Raleigh, N.C.; and Ms. Van Devanter's mother, Helen Van Devanter of Sterling, Va.       
         Florence Stephenson Mahoney, an unwavering advocate for national health research and programs, died on Nov. 29 at her home in Washington. She was 103.         Working with the philanthropist Mary Woodard Lasker, Mrs. Mahoney was instrumental in the growth of the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services through which the federal government finances medical research.         Starting as the one-room Laboratory of Hygiene on Staten Island in 1887, the agency, now comprising 27 institutes and centers for specific topics, is housed on a 300-acre campus in Bethesda, Md. Its budget for 2002 is $23.4 billion.         After World War II, Mrs. Mahoney and Mrs. Lasker lobbied to enlarge the agency, then a single institute. ''It is hard to realize today that government-subsidized research in the 1940's, when Florence Mahoney started her efforts, actually was controversial,'' said Judith Robinson, author of ''Noble Conspirator: Florence S. Mahoney and the Rise of the National Institutes of Health'' (The Francis Press, 2001).         With charm and persistence, Mrs. Mahoney and Mrs. Lasker pressed powerful politicians to support research on health issues.         ''When I wanted to get things done, I started at the top,'' Mrs. Mahoney told Ms. Robinson.         And the top often meant the president, whether it was Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson or Jimmy Carter.         Jack Valenti, a friend of Mrs. Mahoney, was a special assistant to the president in the Johnson administration.         ''When I would tell him that Mary Lasker and Florence Mahoney wanted to see him, the president would groan,'' Mr. Valenti said. ''He'd say, 'Oh, my God, these two women are going to bankrupt this country.' And they usually got what they wanted out of him.''         Eventually, the women focused on specific areas, with Mrs. Mahoney taking a special interest in aging and mental health.         In the 1960's Mrs. Mahoney began urging lawmakers to create an Institute on Aging at the N.I.H. She said the institute should concentrate on improving the quality of the lives of older Americans, not just their longevity.         In 1972, Mrs. Mahoney persuaded Senator Thomas F. Eagleton and Representative Paul G. Rogers to sponsor a bill creating such an institute. It passed, but President Richard M. Nixon would not sign it.         The next year, the bill was reintroduced, and Mr. Nixon, embroiled in the Watergate scandal, again would not sign the measure. But Mrs. Mahoney kept up her efforts.         In the spring of 1974, the bill was passed a third time, and on May 31, 1974, Mr. Nixon signed it, just months before he resigned under the threat of impeachment.         ''There would not be an Institute on Aging without Florence Mahoney,'' Mr. Eagleton said. ''She was the creator and instigator of it. I was simply her messenger.''         Florence Amelia Sheets was born on a farm near Muncie, Ind., on April 20, 1899, the eldest of three daughters born to Abraham L. and Julia T. Stephenson Sheets. She later adopted her mother's maiden name as part of hers.         Ms. Robinson wrote that Mrs. Mahoney remembered feeling a sense of social responsibility for the first time at age 10 when she was riding in a friend's pony cart.         ''There was an orphans' home nearby, which we passed once,'' Ms. Robinson quoted Mrs. Mahoney as saying. ''We didn't know what it was, so one time we thought we'd stop and find out. We went in, and I'll never forget it; I can still see it. Everything was gray. Even the children were all gray. It was all so depressing. That was my first feeling of social conscience.''         After graduating from Muncie High School in 1917, she enrolled in the Battle Creek Normal School of Physical Education in Michigan, where she studied anatomy and kinesiology. She taught physical education in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and studied dance in New York with an Italian ballet master whose students included Fred Astaire. She also took medical courses.         On Oct. 13, 1926, she married Daniel J. Mahoney, a Cox newspaper executive who became publisher of The Miami Daily News. They had two sons and divorced in 1950.         Mrs. Mahoney moved to Washington, turning her Georgetown house into a sort of salon, where politicians and scientists discussed issues over dinner.         Dr. Robert N. Butler, the first director of the National Institute on Aging, said that the dining room table was on the small side and that he believed it was by design, to encourage robust discussion.         Mrs. Mahoney's house had another claim to fame. Mr. Valenti, now the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said ''The Exorcist'' was filmed there.         Mrs. Mahoney is survived by a son, J. Michael Mahoney of Larkspur, Calif., and grandchildren.
