         Dixy Lee Ray, former chairwoman of the Atomic Energy Commission and Governor of Washington, died yesterday at her home on Fox Island, near Tacoma. She was 79.         She had suffered for some months from a severe bronchial condition, said a friend, Lou Guzzo, who is a television commentator.         Dr. Ray, a marine biologist who championed the nuclear industry, was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to the atomic commission in 1972, and served as chairwoman from 1973 to 1975. During her tenure, she raised eyebrows in the nation's capital by living in a mobile home and taking her dogs to the office.         In 1974, she underscored the finding of an Atomic Energy Commission study of nuclear power plant safety: that the chance of mass destruction from a reactor accident was as unlikely as that of a meteor striking an urban area. "There is no question that the nuclear industry comes off very well," she said.         She issued her latest no-nonsense commentary on nuclear issues on Thursday, when she dismissed reports about cold-war-era Federal radiation experiments as alarmist.         "Everybody is exposed to radiation," Dr. Ray was quoted by The Associated Press as saying, adding, "A little bit more or a little bit less is of no consequence." Criticizing Kissinger         The Atomic Energy Commission was eventually abolished and its duties were transferred to the new Energy Research and Development Administration. Dr. Ray was appointed by President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 as Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans, International Environment and Scientific Affairs.         She resigned from the post later that year, contending that Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger had ignored her office on policy matters.         It was as a Democrat that Dr. Ray was elected in 1976 to one term as the only female Governor her state has had, becoming the nation's second woman to be elected Governor without succeeding her husband. Ella T. Grasso, a Democrat, had been elected Governor of Connecticut two years before.         Dr. Ray, after her surprise victory, said that she supported the Equal Rights Amendment but that women should "stop brooding about being a woman." She told women, "If you want to do something, then train yourself and you've got to be willing to work."         Governor Ray a conservative in fiscal matters and was praised by a lobbyist in the aircraft industry as "the best friend business ever had."         She also angered environmentalists with her support of nuclear power, unhampered growth and oil supertankers.         But she could also be stern in the environmental sphere. In 1979, she ordered the low-level nuclear waste dump at a Federal reservation in Hanford, Wash., one of only three in the nation, closed temporarily after inspectors had found that some radioactive material was being hauled in unsafe trucks.         In 1980, Dr. Ray herself faced a environmental problem when Mount St. Helens repeatedly erupted, ravaging parts of the state with volcanic mud flows, flooding and ash.         While Dr. Ray was Governor, the power of her intellect and her skill as a speaker gave her an aura of great competence. But she was sharp-tongued, highly unconventional for a politician in high office, and became entangled in disputes with reporters and with other public officials.         Dr. Ray was also burdened by disaffection in her own party going into the 1980 Democratic primary and suffered a startling defeat at the hands of State Senator Jim McDermott, who offered himself as "a Governor who listens."         She was christened Margaret at her birth in 1914 in Tacoma, but she later chose the name Dixy Lee. She climbed Mount Rainier, her state's tallest peak, at age 12 -- becoming the youngest girl to do so -- and went on to graduate in 1937 from Mills College, where she also earned a master's degree. She received a doctorate in zoology from Stanford in 1945.         She taught at schools in Oakland, Calif., from 1938 to 1942 and was an associate professor of zoology at the University of Washington from 1945 to 1976.         With Mr. Guzzo she wrote two books: "Trashing the Planet: How Science Can Help Us Deal With Acid Rain, Depletion of the Ozone, and Nuclear Waste (Among Other Things)," published in 1990, and "Environmental Overkill," published this year.         She is survived by her sisters, Marion Reid of Fox Island, Dr. Jean Ray of Long Beach, Calif., Julianna Strong of Salem, Ore., and Elvista Steele of Klatskanie, Ore.       
         Dr. Jeanne Shirley Mintz, an authority on Indonesia and an Asian affairs specialist in the Defense Department, died on Tuesday at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Hospital. She was 71 and lived in Washington.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her Pentagon office said.         At the time of her death, Dr. Mintz was assistant deputy for Asia, Middle East and Southern Hemisphere affairs in the department's Economic Security Directorate. She had worked at the Pentagon for 20 years and was appointed to her current post in 1986. Spokeswoman for Indonesia         Dr. Mintz was born in Queens and graduated from Brooklyn College in 1943. She earned her master's degree and Ph.D. at Harvard University. Harvard announced that it was establishing a fellowship in her name in its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.         During World War II, Dr. Mintz worked in New York as a political and economic analyst for the government-in-exile of the Dutch East Indies. When Indonesia gained its independence, she became spokeswoman for its delegation at the United Nations, serving until 1951.         She also held senior positions at M.I.T.'s Center for International Studies, the Asia Society in New York, the Special Operations Research office in Washington and the Center for Naval Analyses in Arlington, Va.         She wrote extensively for professional journals and was the author of several books, including "Indonesia: A Profile" (1961), and "Mohammed, Marx and Marhaen, the Roots of Indonesian Socialism" (1965). She was a past president of Executive Women in Government.         Dr. Mintz is survived by two sisters, Cynthia Puritz of Schenevus, N.Y., and Claire Cutler of Manhattan.       
         Rosemary Glyde, a violist who performed frequently as a recitalist and was a founder and president of the New York Viola Society, died on Tuesday at the Northern Westchester Medical Center in Mount Kisco. She was 46 and lived in Golden's Bridge, N.Y.         The cause was cancer, said Joan Ryan, her publicity agent.         Ms. Glyde was born in Auburn, Ala., and studied with Lillian Fuchs and Dorothy Delay at the Juilliard School, where she received a doctorate. She made her New York debut in 1973, after winning first prize in the Juilliard Viola Competition.         Ms. Glyde devoted considerable energy to expanding the comparatively small repertory for solo viola. She transcribed the Bach Cello Suites and the Rachmaninoff Cello Sonata for her instrument, and she composed several works, including a Fantasia for Solo Viola and a Suite for Four Violas. Her repertory also included many contemporary works, and she gave the premieres of works composed for her by Richard Lane, Bernard Hoffer and Judith Shatin.         She is survived by her husband, William Salchow, and a daughter, Allison Shumsky, both of Golden's Bridge, and two sisters, Rosemary Glyde of Boulder, Colo., and Wendy Klopfenstein of Mobile, Ala.         Correction:  January 22, 1994, Saturday         An obituary on Thursday about Rosemary Glyde, a violist and composer, misstated the given name of a surviving sister. She is Judith Glyde.       
         Nancy Carnegie Rockefeller, a community leader and active volunteer in Greenwich, Conn., died at her home there yesterday. She was 93.         Family members said she died of natural causes.         An early champion of birth control, she helped establish the Greenwich Maternal Health Center in 1935. In recent years she had been concerned with the housing and care of the elderly in Greenwich and was a founder of the Merry-Go-Round, a center for the elderly, and the Mews, a residential hotel for older people.         She also was a president of the Hortulus Garden Club and a chairwoman of the Red Cross Gray Ladies. She received many awards, including Nutmegger of the Decade and a distinguished alumna award from the Foxcroft School.         Mrs. Rockefeller was the grandniece of Andrew Carnegie. Her husband, James Stillman Rockefeller, is a former president and chairman of Citibank and is a grandnephew of John D. Rockefeller.         She is also survived by two sons, James S. Jr. of Camden, Me., and Andrew C. of Greenwich; two daughters, Nancy Coop of Germantown, Tenn., and Georgia Rose of Manhattan; 14 grandchildren, and 24 great-grandchildren.       
         Jarmila Novotna, a Czech-born lyric soprano who sang major roles at the Metropolitan Opera from 1940 to 1956, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         She died of natural causes, said her daughter, Jarmila Packard.         Miss Novotna was widely considered one of the finest singing actresses of her time. Her interpretations of such roles as Donna Elvira, Euridice, Manon, Melisande, Antonia and Marenka were praised for their intelligence and lyrical grace. She also excelled in trouser roles, particularly Orlofsky in "Die Fledermaus," Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Octavian in "Der Rosenkavalier." On hearing her American debut in San Francisco in "Madama Butterfly" in 1939, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times: "There is grace, warmth, communicative feeling in all that she does."  'Charming Simplicity'         She made her Metropolitan debut in "La Boheme" in 1940, singing with Jussi Bjoerling. The Times review noted her "charming simplicity, feeling and high artistic intelligence." That year Downes also praised her "great" Violetta at the Met: "She conceived the music, from first note to last, dramatically, and portrayed the character with an aristocratic sensibility and simplicity.         "The word and the tone were indissoluble; the phrasing was that of the finest musician."         In her years at the Metropolitan Opera, Miss Novotna sang 193 performances -- 142 in the opera house, the rest on tour -- and won consistent praise for her expressiveness and musicianship.         Her acting abilities and regal appearance also led to other offers: the director Max Reinhardt urged her to devote herself to the theater; the studio head Louis B. Mayer asked her to become a film star. During the course of her career, she appeared in Hollywood films ("The Great Caruso," "The Search"), on Broadway (as an unscrupulous concert singer in the 1953 drama "Sherlock Holmes") and on television (as Kim Stanley's mother in a postwar drama set in France). But she resisted all attempts to steer her away from singing, which was her first love.  Art as Beauty         "Of course there are many important things in life besides music," she said in a 1989 interview in Opera News, "but that doesn't make music unimportant. If you love music, what would life be without it -- can you imagine? Art is what brings beauty into life."         Miss Novotna studied with Emmy Destinn and made her debut at the age of 17 with the Prague National Opera. She continued her studies in Milan and became a member of the Vienna State Opera from 1933 to 1938, eventually singing opera and concerts in most of the major houses of Europe. The Met invited her to sing in 1928, but she did not want to be separated from her future husband, the Baron George Daubek, whom she married in 1931.         Toscanini brought her to the attention of the Met again after she sang Pamina under his direction in Salzburg in 1937. She came to New York in 1940, arriving, she noted years later, the day Hitler marched into Prague.  A Recording Re-released         During the war years she recorded "Songs of Lidice," in memory of the victims of the Nazi massacre. The recording, recently rereleased on CD by Supraphon, presents folk songs of her native land; the piano accompaniments are by Jan Masaryk, the son of the former president of Czechoslovakia.         Masaryk died in 1948, and the loss of his protection led to the nationalization of the Daubeks' 3,700-acre estate and castle. That same year, Miss Novotna appeared in Fred Zinnemann's film "The Search," as a mother seeking her lost son at the end of World War II.         Miss Novotna moved from Vienna to New York after her husband's death in 1981. She was frequently seen at opera performances and at events celebrating the art of singing.         In addition to her daughter, of New York City, she is survived by a son, George Daubek of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Madelin Thayer Gilpatric, a volunteer for almost five decades for several nonprofit organizations in New York City and California, died last Thursday at New York Hospital. She was in her 80's.         The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage, according to her family.         Mrs. Gilpatric was a founder and past vice president of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center of New York City. She also served on the board of the California Institute of Arts in Valencia for 36 years and of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City for 17 years.         In addition, she worked with the Lighthouse for the Blind, the American Cancer Society, the Institute for Religion and Psychology and the International Press Institute.         Mrs. Gilpatric, a graduate of Syracuse University, was the widow of Arthur Kudner, whose advertising agency bore his name. Her marriage to Roswell Gilpatric, Deputy Secretary of Defense during the Kennedy Administration, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two brothers, Albert Thayer of Baldwin, L.I., and John Thayer of Norfolk, Va.; a son, Arthur Kudner of Grasonville, Md.; a daughter, Karyl McKay of Alanson, Mich., and six grandchildren.       
         Esther Sherman, a theatrical agent and a vice president of the William Morris Agency, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 56.         The cause was cancer, the agency said.         Ms. Sherman was a native of Newark. She joined William Morris in 1964 as a secretary in the Chicago office and was promoted to assistant in the personal appearance department in New York in 1962. She became an agent in 1973.         One of her first clients was Howard Ashman, who went on to write "Little Shop of Horrors" and "The Little Mermaid." She also represented Edward Albee, Athol Fugard, John Patrick Shanley and Charles Fuller, among others.         She is survived by her brother and sister-in-law, Allan and Susan Sherman, of Toms River, N.J.       
         Princess Lucie Jadot Shirazi, a founder of the World Wildlife Fund, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         The cause was cancer, said Roberto Mitrotti, co-executor of her estate.         The princess was president of the Shirazi Wildlife Foundation, which supports sanctuaries in the United States, Belgium and France. She was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and a chairwoman of the Polonaise Ball.       
         Marjorie Keller Sitney, an independent film maker whose works have been shown at museums, festivals and film institutes around the world, died on Thursday in Winter Haven, Fla. She was 43 and lived in Wakefield, R.I.         The cause has not been determined, said her family, whom she was visiting.         Ms. Keller, married to the film scholar P. Adams Sitney but known by her maiden name, began exhibiting films in 1969. Among them are "Misconception" (1977), "Daughters of Chaos" (1980) and "Herein" (1992). She has had one-woman shows at the Museum of Modern Art and Anthology Film Archives in New York City. From 1986 to 1989 she was president of the New York Film Makers' Cooperative.         Ms. Keller was a teacher and lecturer at the University of Rhode Island, the San Francisco Art Institute and other institutions. Her book "The Untutored Eye: Childhood in the Films of Jean Cocteau, Joseph Cornell and Stan Brakhage," was published in 1985.         In addition to her husband and her parents, Clarence and Nellie Keller, she is survived by twin daughters, Augusta Nell and Miranda Hope; a stepson, Blake; a stepdaughter, Skye; four sisters, Jacquelyn Gilbert and Barbara Wilkens, both of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.; Patricia Button of Peeksill, N.Y., and Sarah Ann Filippini of Reston, Va., and two brothers, Clarence Christian Keller Jr. of Golden, Colo., and Stephen Lee Keller of Newark, Ohio.       
         Mary Woodard Lasker, the philanthropist and champion of medical research and urban beautification, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 93 years old and also had an apartment on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said her nephew, James W. Fordyce. She made her last public appearance at a luncheon at the Pierre Hotel in October.         As a patron and volunteer lobbyist, Mrs. Lasker furthered medical research on cancer, heart and eye diseases and in other fields. She also lent her support to beautification projects in New York and Washington that included planting trees and flowers and providing fountains and lighting. And she was a noted hostess and art collector.         In her later years she reduced her activities, but at her death she was still president of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, honorary president of the American Cancer Society and a trustee and vice chairman of the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Education Foundation.         In a 1958 speech, Robert Moses, then the Parks Commissioner, said Mrs. Lasker possessed "the irresistible combination Madison Avenue dreams of -- the blend of many essences in the beautiful package."         "Intelligence, vision, generosity, charm, kindness -- Mary has them all," Moses continued. Co-Founded Lasker Awards         Mrs. Lasker and her husband Albert Davis Lasker, a pioneer advertising executive who died in 1952, established the Lasker Foundation in 1942. In almost every year since 1944, it has given Albert Lasker Awards, largely for outstanding contributions to clinical and basic medical research.         The foundation has often been quick to recognize significant new research, and its awards have great prestige. Besides supporting medical research and health programs, it has also given its backing to efforts to beautify New York and to activities in the arts.         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served variously as chairman of the board of the American Cancer Society, a trustee of Research to Prevent Blindness and of the Cancer Research Institute and a director of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. She was also active in other similar organizations.         "I am opposed to heart attacks and cancer and strokes," she used to say, "the way I am opposed to sin."         In addition, Mrs. Lasker strove to persuade Federal, state and city officials and legislators to provide more funds for medical research on major killing and crippling diseases. She worked to persuade Congress to increase appropriations for the National Institutes of Health and to set up additional research centers concentrating on specific diseases.         "Without money," she said in 1985, "nothing gets done." To make sure things got done, she used to visit the White House (during Democratic Administrations, she added wryly). She also paid calls on Washington legislators, corresponded with Presidents and arranged for scientists to meet Government leaders. 'I Couldn't Cut Up a Frog'         Despite her successes in furthering medical research, Mrs. Lasker used to contend that she lacked scientific and medical aptitude. "Nobody would have me in their laboratory for five minutes," she once said, also with a smile. "I couldn't cut up a frog, and I certainly couldn't perform surgery. I'm better at making it possible for other people."         Her passionate interest in medicine was fueled partly by illnesses of people around her and by her own health; she repeatedly had ear infections during her Wisconsin childhood. Laskers Lead to Nobels         Over the years, the Lasker Foundation helped shape medical history by recognizing and supporting promising research, and it has repeatedly singled out future winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Fifty-one Lasker winners have become Nobel laureates.         For instance, the foundation's prize jury, whose longtime chairman is the heart surgeon Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chose two winners of 1985 Albert Lasker Medical Research and Public Service awards -- Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas, for their studies of cholesterol chemistry in relation to the clogging of coronary arteries. They were also named Nobel Prize laureates that year.         Commenting on Mrs. Lasker's efforts, Dr. DeBakey said in a 1985 interview: "Mary Lasker is an institution unto herself. Asking what her importance has been is like asking what Harvard has meant to this country."         Throughout their history, Lasker awards have been given in every year except 1960, 1990 and 1992. In early 1990, when it was announced that no awards would be given that year, the foundation had assets of about $2.4 million, down from about $4.5 million in 1980, but an executive of the foundation said that omitting the awards, of $15,000 each, in that year "wasn't really a financial decision." Since then, the awards have been increased to $25,000 each. 'Annie Appleseed'         Like her passion for medical research, Mrs. Lasker's interest in and patronage of urban beautification was long standing. In a 1953 column in The New York Times, Meyer Berger referred to her affectionately as "Annie Appleseed."         Her beautification activities included furnishing funds for tulips, daffodils, begonias, chrysanthemums and other flowers at various locations in New York. Her other urban beautification projects ranged from lighted Christmas trees to 300 Japanese cherry trees donated to the United Nations.         Mrs. Lasker acquired her interest in parks and gardens during her girlhood in Watertown, Wis., where she was born to Frank Elwin Woodard, a banker, and Sara Johnson Woodard, who was a founder of two parks there.         She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1923 and studied briefly at Oxford. Then she went to work for the Reinhardt Galleries, in Manhattan, where her duties were, as she later put it, "arranging benefit loan exhibitions of outstanding old and modern French masters and selling pictures to collectors and museums." An Art Collector         She also went on buying trips abroad and began building an art collection of her own, which included works by Miro and Renoir. She sold most of the collection years later when she changed Manhattan homes, partly, as she said, "because I wanted to be able to give away the money."         In 1940, after leaving the art-gallery world, she married Mr. Lasker, who had achieved wealth and eminence as an advertising executive, having joined the Lord & Thomas advertising agency in 1898 and become its owner in 1908.         Two years later, he retired from active business and the Lasker Foundation was set up. In addition, drawing on his own experience in public affairs, he encouraged Mrs. Lasker to press Washington to provide more funds for research in medicine. In the decades that followed, her efforts in that direction bore many fruits.         One notable success was the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. "The N.I.H. has flowered," Dr. DeBakey recalled in the 1985 interview, "because in many ways she gave birth to it and nursed it. It was in existence, but it was she who got the funding for it."         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served on the boards of trustees or directors of a number of organizations and institutions, including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Museum of Modern Art, the Norton Simon Museum, New York University and Braniff Airways. Won Presidential Medal         She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, a Congressional Gold Medal in 1989, and other honors. A Health Sciences professorship at the Harvard School of Public Health was named for her in 1989, and a new variety of pink tulip was named for her in 1985.         Mrs. Lasker's first marriage, in 1926 to Paul Reinhardt, the owner of the Reinhardt Galleries, ended in divorce in 1934.         Her sister, Alice Fordyce, was the executive vice president of the foundation and director of the Lasker Awards program. She died in 1992.         In addition to her nephew, Mr. Fordyce of Greenwich, who is a trustee of the foundation, Mrs. Lasker is survived by a stepdaughter, Frances Lasker Brody of Los Angeles; a stepson, Edward Lasker of Los Angeles; three great-nephews; five step-grandchildren, one of whom, Christopher W. Brody of Manhattan, is also a trustee of the foundation, and two step great-grandchildren.         Funeral rites and burial are to be private. A memorial service is to be held in the spring.       
         Grace Roosevelt McMillan, a photographer who was the eldest grandchild of President Theodore Roosevelt, died on Tuesday at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. She was 82 and lived in Baltimore.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Born Grace Green Roosevelt in San Francisco, she graduated from the Sorbonne in Paris and became an accomplished freelance photographer. She was a trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. During World War II she managed the large McMillan family farm in Maryland while her husband served in the Navy in the Pacific.         She was the only daughter of Brig. Gen. Theodore Roosevelt Jr., a soldier, author and publisher, who died in the cross-Channel assault on Omaha Beach in 1944. A highly decorated officer and former Governor of Puerto Rico, he received the Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously.         Mrs. McMillan is survived by her husband of 60 years, William, a retired architect; a daughter, Eleanor McMillan of Bethesda, Md.; a son, William Jr., of Baltimore; a brother, Theodore Roosevelt 3d of Mount Desert, Me., and three granddaughters.       
         Ruth Mortimer Lancaster, curator of rare books and assistant librarian at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., died on Monday at her home in Williamsburg, Mass. She was 62.         Her husband, John Lancaster, said she had died of metastatic breast cancer.         Known professionally as Ruth Mortimer, she was a specialist in rare manuscripts and books, especially illustrated books of the Renaissance. Her detailed catalogues of such 16th-century French and Italian books at Harvard University's Houghton Library are standard reference works in the field.         In her honor, a room at Smith's Neilson Library was named the Mortimer Rare Book Room just before her death.         Ms. Mortimer, who was born in Syracuse, became associated with rare books while working as a student assistant in her freshman year at Smith. She graduated summa cum laude and received a certificate at the Shakespeare Institute of the University of Birmingham, England, as well as a master's degree at the Columbia University School of Library Service. Expanded Collections         She spent 18 years at Harvard's Houghton Library before returning to Smith as curator of rare books in 1975. Under her guidance, the Neilson Library added its Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf collections, along with materials ranging from the earliest printed books to contemporary fine-press books.         Ms. Mortimer also lectured in the art department and taught a course on the history of books until a few weeks ago.         She was the first woman to be elected president of the Bibliographical Society of America, serving from 1988 to 1992. In the 1980's she edited, with Mr. Lancaster, the society's quarterly journal. She also wrote many papers and articles for scholarly journals.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Betty Heitman, a Republican Party official who prodded two Presidents to appoint more women to high Government posts, died on Monday at her home in Baton Rouge, La. She was 64.         Her son, Paul, attributed her death to natural causes.         Mrs. Heitman was co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee during the Reagan years. A conservative Republican, she was Ronald Reagan's choice for the committee post in 1980, when he ran for President. She had previously been president of the National Federation of Republican Women. She was re-elected by the national committee three times, serving until 1987.         Mrs. Heitman then directed President George Bush's Committee on Executive Exchange, which promoted close relations between the Government and private business through an exchange of executives. She retired from national politics three years ago and returned to Baton Rouge.         While in Washington, she established her own consulting firm, the Heitman Group, which lobbied for international marketing interests, among others.         She was born in Malvern, Ark. A graduate of Texas Women's University, she became active in Louisiana Republican politics and was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1968 and 1976.         Mrs. Heitman was married to Dr. Henry S. Heitman, who died in 1992. Besides her son Paul, a resident of Baton Rouge, she is survived by a daughter, Donna Jones, also of Baton Rouge; two other sons, Thomas, of Springfield, Va., and Perry, of Baton Rouge, and two grandchildren.       
         Francine Strickler-Greenspan, a former president of the Saxon Textile Corporation in Manhattan's TriBeCa area, died yesterday at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. She was 57 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was a brain tumor, her family said.         A graduate of Brooklyn College, Mrs. Strickler-Greenspan spent over 25 years with Saxon Textile, a firm founded by her parents, and became one of the first women to reach a top-level position in her industry. The company dyes and finishes twills, poplins and nylons for manufacturers. She served as its president from 1980 until her illness.         She is survived by her husband, Julian Greenspan; two daughters, Gail W. Strickler and Debbye Strickler, both of Manhattan, and a son, Dr. Howard Strickler of Washington.       
         Estelle Sommers, the administrator and joint owner of the nationwide Capezio Dance-Theater Shops and an arts patron who advised many important dance groups, died on Monday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Gayle Miller.         Mrs. Sommers was the widow of Ben Sommers, the dance philanthropist and head of Capezio Ballet Makers, the theatrical shoe company. Until his death at the age of 78 in 1985, she often collaborated with him on arts and business projects. In addition to administering the Capezio shops across the country, Mrs. Sommers owned and managed the Capezio Fashion Shop in New York City from 1964 to 1975.  Active in Organizations         Mrs. Sommers was best known in the dance world for the energetic way she championed a wide variety of causes and organizations in the United States and abroad. In 1988, she joined the overseers board of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., which named a studio in honor of her and her husband. Since 1979, she served as the United States chairwoman of the International Committee for the Dance Library of Israel, which presented her with its documents of dance award last year.         She was also on the board of the Dance Notation Bureau (and was the recipient of its annual award in 1991), the America-Israel Cultural Foundation, the Center for Dance Medicine, the International Ballet Competition U.S.A., the International Dance Alliance, the Joffrey School of Ballet, the Harkness Center for Dance Injuries, the Israeli Dance Institute and the Yard, a summer choreographic workshop on Martha's Vineyard.         Mrs. Sommers was a native of Baltimore. She entered the business world in 1947 when she converted a retail store in Cincinnati into a dance-supply business. She moved to New York City in 1962, the year she married Mr. Sommers; a previous marriage ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Miller, who is the president of Capezio Dance-Theater Shops, she is survived by two other daughters, Cathy Rano, vice president of Federated Department Stores, and Debbie J. Palmer; five grandchildren; four step-grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.         Funeral services will be held at noon today at the Central Synagogue, 123 East 55th Street, Manhattan.       
         Claire Nichtern, who produced or helped to produce several dozen Broadway plays and musicals in her theatrical career, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Judith Nichtern.         From 1979 to 1985 Ms. Nichtern was president of Warner Theater Productions, a division of Warner Communications. During that period she produced over 30 plays and musicals for Warner, among them "Crimes of the Heart" by Beth Henley, which won a Pulitzer Prize.         In 1955 Ms. Nichtern took an aptitude test that suggested that theater production would be a good field for her talents. She accepted a job as a receptionist at the Phoenix Theater in Greenwich Village and rose quickly to casting director.         In the early 1960's she helped in the production of two short plays, "The Typist" and "The Tiger" by Murray Schisgal, starring Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, at the Theater de Lys. The production was an immediate success.         In 1965 Ms. Nichtern won the Tony Award as best producer of a drama for her Broadway production of Mr. Schisgal's comedy "Luv," directed by Mike Nichols and starring Mr. Wallach, Ms. Jackson and Alan Arkin. Among her other productions of the 1960's and 1970's were "The Banker's Daughter," "Jimmy Shine," "Cold Storage," "House of Blue Leaves," "Absent Friends" and "I Got a Song."         Ms. Nichtern's two marriages ended in divorce.         She is survived by her daughter and a son, David, both of Manhattan.       
         Margaret Millar, whose psychological mystery novels included "How Like an Angel," "A Stranger in My Grave" and "Beast in View," died on Saturday at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack, said Eleanor Van Cott, a trustee of her estate.         Mrs. Millar earned a reputation as a master of the suspense novel with her carefully constructed, literate mysteries populated by complex, sometimes disturbed characters and rooted in her belief that psychological terror achieved an effectively chilling "violence by implication."  What a Writer Knew         An avid reader of detective magazines as a child, she once told an interviewer: "They tell you always to write about what you know. What I knew was murder."         Mrs. Millar was born in Kitchener, Ontario. Her maiden name was Sturm. She began playing piano at the age of 4, and as a teen-ager performed on local radio programs. She was preparing for a musical career when a classics teacher fired her interest in archeology.         She won a scholarship to University College at the University of Toronto, where she contributed stories to the school's literary magazine. She left college without a degree, and in 1938 married Kenneth Millar, whom she had known since high school.         While recovering from an illness, Mrs. Millar wrote her first mystery, "The Invisible Worm" (1941), about a multiple murder. In short order, she turned out "The Weak-Eyed Bat" (1942), "The Devil Loves Me" (1942) and "Wall of Eyes" (1943). Her success led her husband to try his hand, as well. Under the pen name Ross Macdonald, he achieved a reputation that overshadowed her own. He died in 1983.         Mrs. Millar was prolific. She wrote 21 mystery novels, most of them set in Santa Barbara, notably "A Stranger in My Grave" (1961), "How Like an Angel" (1961), "The Fiend" (1964), "Beyond This Point Are Monsters" (1970) and "Banshee" (1983). "Beast in View" (1955), whose central character finds her personality splitting in two, received the Edgar Allan Poe Award for best mystery novel of the year from the Mystery Writers of America. Branching Out         She also wrote four nonmystery novels and a work of nonfiction, "The Birds and Beasts Were There" (1968).         In 1983, she received the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America. She served as the president of this organization in 1957 and 1958.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Schlagel of Santa Barbara.       
         Dorothy Flagg Leet, who directed the forerunner of the Reid Hall campus of Columbia University in Paris for over 30 years, died on Thursday at Meadow Lakes nursing home in Heightstown, N.J. She was 99.         Under Miss Leet's leadership, Reid Hall became the focal point of interest in French-American cultural cooperation for many young American women students. It drew lecturers and guests in the arts, science, literature and public affairs and was also used as a residence hall for students.         In 1924 Miss Leet became the second director of what was then the American University Women's Club in Paris, an 18th-century house at 4 Rue de Chevreuse in Montparnasse. The name was changed in 1928 to honor its patron, Mrs. Whitelaw Reid, wife of an American minister to France in the 1880's.         Miss Leet left Paris in 1938 to become national secretary to the Foreign Policy Association in New York, returning to Reid Hall in 1946. She retired as president emeritus in 1964 when Reid Hall was turned over to Columbia.         Miss Leet also served from 1953 to 1956 as president of the International Federation of University Women. She was a 1917 alumna of Barnard College. Miss Leet received many awards for her cultural and scholastic activities, and in 1949 the French Government awarded her the rank of officer of the Legion of Honor.       
         Dr. Kathryn Frederick Clarenbach, a founding member and the first chairwoman of the National Organization for Women, died on Friday at her home in Madison, Wis. She was 73.         The cause was complications from emphysema, her family said.         Dr. Clarenbach, known as Kay, was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Wisconsin, where she earned her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in that subject. She taught in Indiana, New York and Michigan before returning to Madison to teach at the University of Wisconsin and Edgewood College. She retired in 1988.         A native of Sparta, Wis., she worked for many years on the university's program of continuing education for women. For 13 years, she headed Wisconsin's Commission on the Status of Women, helping to shape changes in the laws on sexual assault, divorce and marital property.         On the national level, she was an organizer of the National Women's Political Caucus. In 1966, she was a founder of NOW and led it with Betty Friedan, the organization's first president, until 1970.         Dr. Clarenbach is survived by two daughters, Sara Clarenbach of Madison, and Janet Mallon of Oswego, N.Y.; a son, David, of Madison, and one grandson.       
         Betty Furness, who went from doing television commercials for Westinghouse refigerators to pioneering the field of consumer affairs as a television journalist, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in New York City and Hartsdale, N.Y..         She had been treated for cancer for three years, said her husband, Leslie Midgley.         Her career spanned six decades. She began as a Hollywood actress in the 1930's and became a television spokeswoman for Westinghouse appliances in the 1950's. Between 1976 and 1992 she was a regular contributor to the "Today" program on NBC.         In 1967 President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her his special assistant for consumer affairs, though consumer groups feared that because of her association with Westinghouse, she would go easy on American industry.         She became a forceful advocate for American consumers, one who took strong stands on issues like credit regulation and federal meat inspection.         Elizabeth Mary Furness was born Jan. 3, 1916, in New York City. She was the daughter of an executive for Union Carbide. She attended the Brearley School and Bennett Junior College. Modeling and Acting         Her acting career began at age 14 when she got a modeling job with the John Robert Powers agency. Later Mr. Powers arranged for her to take a screen test.         She eventually went to Hollywood, where she appeared in 35 films, most of them low-budget productions, over the next six years.         Ms. Furness also worked in the theater in summer stock and road productions, among them "Doughgirls" and "My Sister Eileen," then moved to television.         In 1949 she had a small part in a CBS "Studio One" drama production that led Westinghouse to offer her the job as their spokeswoman. That lasted for 11 years.         She added the sentence "You can be sure if it's Westinghouse" to popular language in her live spots for refrigerators and vacuum cleaners.         She went on to do the ads in 1952 at the Republican and Democratic national conventions. Recruiter for Head Start         She first worked for President Johnson during the 1964 presidential campaign. Afterward was hired as a recruiter for the Head Start and Vista programs. In 1967 she became assistant to the President for consumer affairs.         She eventually became executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board and then commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs.         She joined WNBC-TV in New York City in 1974 and later made appearances on the network's "Today" show. As a reporter, she went from responding to consumer complaints to extensive investigations of issues like fetal alcohol syndrome, car safety and product liability lawsuits.         She is survived by her husband ; a daughter, Barbara Green; three stepchildren, Leslie Midgley, Andrea Connors and Peter J. Midgley, and two grandchildren.       
         Marie T. Mandry, who over 36 years in the advertising business rose from a secretary to senior vice president of Young & Rubicam in New York, died Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, said her brother, Gerard Mandry.         Miss Mandry joined Young & Rubicam after graduating from Marymount College in Tarrytown. When she retired in 1985 she oversaw the agency's account management department.         She is survived by her brother, of Dobbs Ferry.       
         Irene Satz, who was instrumental in making line-for-line copies of European couture fashions available at the Ohrbach's discount department store at a fraction of the original's prices, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 80.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, Marcia Israel.         The relatively inexpensive reproductions of European styles begun in the late 1940's, after World War II had disrupted the couture operations in Paris, and couturiers were eager to have their styles publicized. The project continued until 1976.  Copies in Original Fabrics         During the 1960's, when other stores followed Ms. Satz's lead and created their own collection of copies, Ms. Satz and her associate, the late Sydney Gittler, went a step further. They had the copies made in the identical fabrics used in Europe. When the copy and the original were paraded down the runway side by side, it was difficult for anyone but an expert to tell the difference. In the beginning, Rose Wells, now a consultant for Gap stores, followed the development in accessory styles.         Ms. Satz and Mr. Gittler used the top American fashion houses to produce their copies. These manufacturers were happy to do so because it enabled them to obtain the original couture styles and learn how they were made. Sometimes they even shared the cost of the originals, which were bought by Ohrbach's.         Leading American fashion producers would not sell to Ohrbach's under their own names because the store was a discount house and their other retail accounts would complain. Originally located on 14th Street, the store moved to 34th Street and Fifth Avenue in 1954 and closed in 1986.         As the line-for-line program grew in acceptance, it included some of the major design names in Europe. Only Christian Dior would not let its name be used, but the fashion world soon discovered the identity behind Dior's pseudonym, Monsieur X.         Yves Saint Laurent, Hubert de Givenchy, Chanel and Balenciaga were some of the designers whose work was shown repeatedly. Valentino was a favorite from Rome. Many women, like Shirlee Fonda, the widow of Henry Fonda, told Ms. Satz that her shows were their introduction to French fashion.  Fashion Show as Event         The presentations themselves, which Ms. Satz produced, were the precursors of the fashion show as a media event. The combination of fashionable clients, visiting Hollywood stars like Claudette Colbert and Anita Louise, and the presence of American designers drew hordes of fashion journalists and photographers.         Ms. Satz joined Ohrbach's as a stock girl when she was 16 years old. She was a vice president when she retired in 1977. Bored with retirement, she joined Judy's, a chain of shops specializing in clothes for young women, in 1982, retiring for a second time in 1992. The chain was run by her sister, Marcia Israel.         A funeral service will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel today at noon.         Ms. Satz is survived by her daughter, Susan Fuhrman, and her son-in-law, Dr. Robert Fuhrman, of Westfield, N.J.; three grandsons, Michael, Jeffrey and Jonathan; three sisters, Ms. Israel of Los Angeles, Frances Satz of New York and Anne Stelzer of Seattle; and two nieces, Judy Israel of Malibu, Calif., and Jane Siegel of San Francisco.       
         Alice Herrington, the founder and longtime president of Friends of Animals, one of the country's best known animal-protection societies, died on Tuesday at DeKalb Medical Center in Decatur, Ga. Ms. Herrington, a former resident of Manhattan and Little Silver, N.J., was 75 and lived in Lithonia, Ga.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         She founded the nonprofit organization in Manhattan in 1957 and retired as its president at the end of 1986. It now has headquarters in Darien, Conn., and counts 150,000 contributing members nationwide.         When she started Friends of Animals, its purpose was to protect cats and dogs. To that end it offered low-cost spaying and neutering services to cut down the number of strays across the country. The organization eventually built its own clinic for this in Neptune, N.J.         Under her leadership the society widened its activities to preserve animals in general, including wildlife, marine mammals and zoo animals. Ms. Herrington pursued her cause in letters to the editor, advertisements, Op-Ed articles, lectures and public testimony. Panel for Humane Legislation         Her targets included the killing of seals and their pups for fur; leg-hold traps for catching raccoons for their coats; hunters who paid thousands of dollars to shoot polar bears from the air; rodeos in which electric rods, bucking straps and steel spurs are used on broncos and bulls, and cruel uses of animals for experiments, research and testing.         She also started and directed a Committee for Humane Legislation to require that animals be rendered unconscious and insensible to pain before slaughter. That campaign in the 1960's aroused controversy because it was aimed at the shackling and hoisting method used by some kosher slaughterers.         Her disapproval of fur coats led to her arrest for disorderly conduct in 1979, when she took part in a protest outside Gracie Mansion. The occasion was a dinner given by Mayor Edward I. Koch for a group of furriers in town for a convention.         "Hunting is all part of the macho world," she once told an interviewer.  "You bring up your boys and suggest that to be a man like their father they should kill everything that moves, right?"         Ms. Herrington, a Wisconsin native, graduated from the University of Wisconsin.         She is survived by a daughter, Jennifer C. Schmid of Lawrenceville, Ga., and a sister, Rachel E. Brodeaux of Harlingen, Tex.       
         Betty Furness, who went from minor acting roles to reknown as a television saleswoman and then became a formidable consumer advocate, died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in New York City and Hartsdale, N.Y.         The cause was stomach cancer, said her husband, Leslie Midgley.         With the cheekbones of a model and the directness of a New England schoolmarm, Miss Furness was one of the true pioneers in television consumer journalism. In her heyday with WNBC-TV in New York, she regularly broadcast the names of errant businesses and shoddy products. She pointed television cameras at stores where New Yorkers had been cheated, and lectured the proprietors. She reported on hamburger that was too fat, on warranties that were too lean, on gadgets that were too temperamental and on business ethics that she saw as seriously flawed. She even scolded Macy's. Park Avenue Upbringing         Miss Furness essentially created a place for consumer advocacy on local television. She also spent a great deal of time off the screen promoting the cause of consumer justice. She was on the board of Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine, from 1969 until she retired for health reasons in 1993, and she worked for Common Cause. She also was President Lyndon B. Johnson's special assistant for consumer affairs and was head of the New York State Consumer Protection Board in 1970 and '71. She was Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs in 1973.         Miss Furness, who had surgery for stomach cancer in 1990, was eased out of the "Today" show on NBC in 1992 after 16 years with the program. "This was their idea, not mine," she said dryly as she departed.         Miss Furness, whose original name was Elizabeth Mary Furness, was born on Jan. 3, 1916, in New York City, the daughter of George Choate Furness, an executive with what was then called Union Carbon and Carbide, and Florence Sturtevant Furness. The Furness family was well off and young Betty was raised on Park Avenue and sent to the Bennett School in Dutchess County, N.Y. In 1932, before graduating, she dropped out to become an actress.         It was the Depression, and her father had advised her to learn "something useful." She got summer jobs with the John Robert Powers Modeling Agency, but to her father's dismay earned only $80 in two summers of work. But she was blonde and trim, and Mr. Powers noticed her. He liked the way she used her voice and her gray-green eyes, and he arranged for her to take a screen test at RKO.         The only acting she had done was in school theatricals, but just a year after she left the Bennett School, RKO was touting her as a bright new talent. She had secondary roles in 35 films in Hollywood and later called them all appalling except "Swing Time," which starred Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and "Magnificent Obsession," both produced in the mid-1930's. She left the screen in 1937 and moved to the stage. With few exceptions -- the stock and road productions of "Golden Boy," "My Sister Eileen" and "Doughgirls" -- the career that had started with promise seemed to be going nowhere. Early TV Participant         In 1948, with commercial television just starting, Miss Furness landed a job with the DuMont Television Network, which signed her to do a 15-minute show called "Fashions, Coming and Becoming."         A year later, somebody at Westinghouse saw her in a "Studio One" drama and offered her a job as the company's representative on television. For more than 11 years Miss Furness was a staple on evening television, frequently standing in front of refrigerators and waxing eloquent about their performance.         In 1952, 1956 and 1960, Miss Furness did the Westinghouse commercials during the Republican and Democratic National Conventions and developed a strong interest in politics. She worked for Abraham Ribicoff in Connecticut when he made his first successful race for the United States Senate in 1962. After meeting Lady Bird Johnson and Muriel Humphrey, she also made recruiting trips for Head Start and Vista, the Volunteers in Service to America. Left Rockefeller Job         In 1962, she was the hostess of a five-minute radio show called "A Woman's World," in which she talked about food, clothes, child rearing, family relationships, teen-agers and the aged. Late in 1962, she worked on an ABC-TV show called "Answering Service." The show was nominated for an Emmy Award, but ABC dropped her all the same.         Miss Furness abruptly quit as Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's consumer affairs adviser in 1971, charging that the New York State Legislature did not take her recommendations seriously enough. She ran New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs in 1973. After that she worked briefly for McCall's magazine as a contributing editor and wrote a column for consumers.         Despite the number and diversity of her activities, she was never able to completely shake off her image as a product saleswoman. "I feel I'm a very serious person who wants to do things," she once said, "but people keep talking about refrigerators. I'm tired of telling the story about the refrigerator door that didn't stick, and I'm bored with the image."         In 1937 Miss Furness married Johnny Green, the composer and conductor, with whom she had a daughter, Barbara. The couple divorced in 1943. In 1945, she married Hugh B. Ernst, a radio announcer, who died in 1950. She married Mr. Midgley, a CBS News producer, in 1967.         In addition to her husband and her daughter, she is survived by three stepchildren, Leslie Midgley, Andrea Connors and Peter J. Midgley, and two grandchildren.       
         Shirley M. Sills, the executive vice president of PTN Publishing Company in Melville, L.I., died yesterday in her home in Manhasset, L.I. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Stanley S. Sills.         Mrs. Sills was an executive for six years at PTN Publishing, which produces 30 financial magazines relating to businesses like photography, chemicals and security services. Before that, for six years, she was the president of the General Medical Book Company in Manhattan.         She was a graduate of the State University of New York at Geneseo and received a master's degree in psychology from Hofstra University.         She is survived by her husband; two sons, Dr. Michael N. Sills of Dallas and David C. Sills of Roslyn, L.I., and three grandchildren. She also leaves a sister-in-law, Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center.       
         Evan Burger Donaldson, president of the board of Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children in New York, a nonprofit adoption service, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. Mrs. Donaldson, who lived in Manhattan, was 60.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said her husband, William H. Donaldson.         Mrs. Donaldson was also involved with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the New York Women's Association and the Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy. She graduated from Vassar College.         She is survived by her husband, who is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, a daughter, Kimberly Donaldson-Plym, and a son, Matthew, all of New York.       
         Gail Dunbar, an executive recruiter, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital, where she was taken last Tuesday after being found unconscious in her Manhattan apartment. She was 35.         The cause was arrhythmia, said her father, Ernest Dunbar, a West Side resident.         Ms. Dunbar was a native of Manhattan. She graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and, in 1980, from Harvard College. She worked as a stockbroker and investment analyst before she joined the executive-recruitment firm of Phillips O'Shea as a vice president in 1990.         Besides her father, Ms. Dunbar is survived by her sister, Dr. Adrienne Dunbar of Coral Springs, Fla., and a brother, Dean, of Montclair, N.J.       
         Julia Andrews Bissell, a patron of the arts and moving force in the restoration of the historic Kenmore mansion and museum in Fredericksburg, Va., died on Sunday at the Medical College of Georgia Hospital in Augusta. She was 87 and had homes in Chadds Ford, Pa., and Aiken, S.C.         She had been ill for a long time, her family said.         Mrs. Bissell, of the duPont family of Wilmington, Del., was also associated with the Winterthur Museum and Gardens near Wilmington. She was a past president and longtime member of the board of the Delaware Art Museum and a trustee of the Friends of American Art at Yale University.         Her patronage of Kenmore, a pre-Revolutionary Georgian mansion and one of the country's foremost house museums, spanned more than half a century. It was the home of Fielding Lewis, whose wife, Betty, was George Washington's only sister.         Kenmore, a rambling mansion, is noted for its interiors and period furnishings that are based on inventories taken in 1782 before the sale of the original contents. Over the years, Mrs. Bissell served as chairman of the collections and garden committees, chairman of the board of regents and, twice, as president of the board.         According to Vernon Edenfield, director of Kenmore, "through her gifts the collections were enriched and through her vast knowledge the museum grew and thrived."         In addition to her support for historic preservation, Mrs. Bissell was a noted horticulturist and expert in camellias, for which she won prizes at gardening competitions. Her winter home in Aiken, S.C. -- built in 1905 by her parents, James N. and Julia Sophie duPont Andrews -- is surrounded by woodland gardens.         Mrs. Bissell's husband, Alfred E., died in 1975. She is survived by three daughters, Julia B. Leisenring of Berwyn, Pa., Antonia B. Laird of Chadds Ford and Susan B. Parker of Smith's Parish, Bermuda; a sister, Anne A. Black of Keswick, Va.; 15 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Sister Ellen Lawlor, president of the Mercycare Corporation, which is operated by the Religious Sisters of Mercy, died on Monday at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. Sister Lawlor, who lived in Albany, was 70.         The cause was cancer, said an announcement by her order.         Sister Lawlor was a member of the Albany Regional Community of the Religious Sisters of Mercy of the Americas for 48 years. She was president of St. Peter's Hospital for 23 years and president of the Mercycare Corporation since its inception in 1985.         She was the hospital's chief executive during the institution's greatest period of growth, which included the addition of an addiction recovery center, a hospice, family health centers and home health care outreach operations. Sister Lawlor was also instrumental in the creation of the Eastern Mercy Health System of 13 hospitals and nursing homes from Maine to Florida.         Before her involvement in health care, Sister Lawlor was a teacher and administrator at Catholic schools in Albany and Troy. She was a graduate of the College of St. Rose and received a master's degree in business administration from Xavier University in Cincinnati.         She is survived by one sibling, Sister Anne Lawlor, who is also a member of the Religious Sisters of Mercy in Albany, and a sister-in-law, Mary Lawlor of Des Plaines, Ill.       
         Marchette Chute, a biographer of Shakespeare, Chaucer and Ben Jonson, died on Friday at the Madison Nursing Home in Montclair, N.J. She was 84 and lived at the nursing home.         She died of pneumonia, said Elizabeth Hauser, her niece.         Her best-known book was "Shakespeare of London" (1950), published by E. P. Dutton, which was a best seller and a Book-of-the-Month Club dual selection.         "Miss Chute has had the happy idea of basing her life-sized portrait entirely on contemporary evidence," wrote Harry Levin in The New York Times. "From the facts as we know them, she has pieced together a readable and credible presentation of the man in his time."  Books for Children         She was born in Wayzata, Minn., the daughter of William Chute, a real estate broker, and Edith Mary Pickburn Chute, who had been a nurse in a London hospital. She was privately educated at home and then attended Central High School in Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota.         After writing a series of books of verse for children, Miss Chute wrote her first biography, "Geoffrey Chaucer of England" (1946), an informal survey of Chaucer's life that was well-enough received to encourage her to write about Shakespeare in London.         Among her other books were "An Introduction to Shakespeare" (1951); "Ben Jonson of Westminster" (1953); "Two Gentlemen: The Lives of George Herbert and Robert Herrick" (1959); "The First Liberty: A History of the Right to Vote in America, 1619-1850," and "PEN American Center: A History of the First 50 Years" (1972).         Miss Chute was a president of the PEN American Center, and was elected to the American Academy of the National Institute of Arts and Letters.         In addition to her niece, she is survived by a sister, Mary Chute Smith of Morris Plains, N.J.       
         Dorothy Bernstein, a trustee and president of the auxiliary of the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn from 1972 to 1990, died yesterday at her home in Bellport, L.I. She was 80.         The cause was complications from a stroke, said her son, Herbert Bernstein.         Mrs. Bernstein was active in community health programs in Brooklyn and in 1982 was given the Mayor's Volunteer Action Award for her work in health education and preventive medicine. She organized symposiums on nutrition, hypertension and nursing.         For more than 40 years she also served as the office manager for her husband, Dr. David Bernstein, a surgeon who practiced medicine in Brooklyn until his death in 1988. Mrs. Bernstein graduated from Brooklyn College in 1935.         She is survived by her son of Bellport; a daughter, Helen Young of Lawrenceville, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Yvonne Istel, a volunteer worker during World Wars I and II on both sides of the Atlantic, died on Saturday in Paris. She was 99.         Mrs. Istel was honored for her service by President Reagan, by Mayor Edward I. Koch and by the Government of France. In World War I, she was active in an organization in France aiding prisoners of war. In the 1940's, as a resident of New York, she played a role in American Aid to France. She also did volunteer work for the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.         Her husband, Andre Istel, an investment banker in Paris and New York, died in 1966 at the age of 78 when the couple lived on the Upper East Side. She is survived by their two sons, Jacques-Andre and Yves-Andre; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Rita Webb Smith, a community advocate whose work to rid a neighborhood of drug trafficking gained her national attention, died last Saturday at her home in Harlem. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A lifelong resident of West 143d Street, Mrs. Smith was a social worker and counselor for many years at Harlem Hospital, the Children's Aid Society and, most recently, the Visiting Nurse Service.         Starting with the organization of a preservation group for her street, she helped the police in her precinct to clear a drug-infested neighborhood. Her preservation group was largely credited with the restoration of a 10-block area in Harlem between 138th and 144th Streets.         Her efforts received the attention of national television shows and she recounted her experiences in a book written with Tony Chapelle, "The Woman Who Took Back Her Street" (New Horizon, 1990). It describes her life and her efforts to keep drug dealers and addicts from dominating her surroundings. Making a Difference         Mrs. Smith founded her own agency, the Family Systems for Living Center, to provide individual counseling, classes, referrals and other social services. She also started M.A.N.A. -- Make A Neighborhood Again -- to keep up the restored area; and Project Living With AIDS, which provides counseling for AIDS patients.         Mrs. Smith graduated from Fordham University College at Lincoln Center and Fordham's Graduate School of Social Service. The university made her an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1984 for showing that "even one citizen can make a difference." Her work also drew praise from Mayor Koch and President Reagan.         She is survived by seven daughters and sons: Judy, David, Gladys, Peter, Abena and Ayana, all of Harlem, and Mark, a resident of Spring Valley, N.Y. Also surviving is a sister, Pearl Edwards, of St. John's, Antigua.       
         Dr. Janet G. Woititz, a best-selling author, lecturer and counselor to the troubled offspring of alcoholics, died last Thursday at her home in Roseland, N.J. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Woititz's "Adult Children of Alcoholics" offered insights into typical patterns in the families of alcoholics, like lack of self-esteem and difficulty relating to people.         The trade paperback turned into something of a publishing phenomenon. Issued by Health Communications Inc. in 1983, the book won a grass-roots following and made best-seller lists around the country in 1986 and stayed on them for about a year.         An expanded edition appeared in 1990. The book was translated into six foreign languages; the English version alone has sold 1.8 million copies.         Another of her books, "Struggle for Intimacy" (1985), also reached best-seller lists, and has sold 900,000 copies. Doctorate from Rutgers         Dr. Woititz was born in Great Neck, L.I., and graduated from Antioch College. She received an M.A. from Montclair State College, where she became an adjunct professor. Her doctorate in education was granted by Rutgers University in 1976. She taught during the summer at the Rutgers Center for Alcoholic Studies.         She was the founder and president of the Institute for Counseling and Training of West Caldwell, N.J. The institute provides therapeutic counseling for people with family problems, overeating habits and other disorders.         Dr. Woititz's other books include "Healthy Parenting: An Empowering Guide for Adult Children" (1992), "Lifeskills for Adult Children Workbook" (1991), "Healing Your Sexual Self" (1989), "The Self-Sabotage Syndrome: Adult Children in the Workplace" (1989), "Home Away From Home" (1987) and "Marriage on the Rocks" (1986), all in print. She also contributed to academic journals and lectured in this country and abroad.         Dr. Woititz is survived by two sons, David, of West Orange, N.J., and Daniel, of Roseland; a daughter, Lisa Taub of Allentown, N.J.; two grandchildren, and her companion, Bernard Zweben.       
         Elizabeth Nitze Paepcke, who played a central role in transforming Aspen, Colo., from a largely abandoned 19th-century mining town into a winter resort, died on Wednesday at her home in Aspen. She was 91.         She died of complications from a head injury she suffered in a fall last weekend, her family said.         Mrs. Paepcke (pronounced PEP-keh) collaborated with -- and often inspired -- her husband, Walter, a Chicago industrialist, in the development of what was nearly a ghost town by the 1940's. Mr. Paepcke bought about half the town, then proceeded to rebuild it.         The Paepckes helped open the International Design Conference in Aspen, the Aspen Music Festival and the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies. Mrs. Paepcke also founded the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies. Goethe Festival in 1949         Modern Aspen was put on the cultural map in 1949 when Mr. Paepcke engaged the Budapest String Quartet for a concert to celebrate his wife's birthday. This led to the Goethe Bicentennial Festival, also in 1949, with Albert Schweitzer, the theologian, musician and medical missionary in Africa, making his only visit to the United States to address the festival at Mrs. Paepcke's suggestion.         "In most ways Aspen is Elizabeth Paepcke," said David McLaughlin, president of the Aspen Institute, which holds seminars for leaders from various fields in the United States and overseas. "She and Walter created the institutions that gave vision and vitality to the community."         Mrs. Paepcke was born in Baltimore and as a young woman worked as an interior designer in Chicago. She first saw Aspen while on a skiing vacation in 1938, when it had no amenities like ski runs or lifts.         Once a rich silver-mining town with a population of 15,000, Aspen was largely dilapidated in the 1930's, but its natural setting and faded charm caused her to return in 1946 with her husband.         Aspen, in west-central Colorado just west of the Sawatch Range of the Rocky Mountains, now has a year-round population of about 5,000. In recent years, Mrs. Paepcke expressed some disenchantment with the direction Aspen's "renaissance" had taken, with its emphasis on wealth and celebrity and its proliferation of boutiques and ski resorts.         Mr. Paepcke, who headed the Container Corporation of America, died in 1960 at the age of 63.         Mrs. Paepcke is survived by three daughters, Anina Hamilton of Sussex, England, Paula Zurcher of Woodside, Calif., and Antonia DuBrul of Manhattan; a brother, Paul H. Nitze of Washington, the longtime United States arms negotiator who is now retired; eight grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters.       
         Frances Corey, a fashion executive whose career of six decades began before the era of the flappers and took in space-age fabrics developed for astronauts, died on Thursday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 91.         She suffered a brief illness, said Keven Bellows of Los Angeles, a family friend.         Ms. Corey's working life began at the age of 19 when she opened a bookstore in the Annex of the Marshall Field department store in Chicago. She subsequently became director of fashion and advertising for Bloomingdale's in New York.         Moving to Los Angeles in 1943, she was named sales-promotion and advertising manager of the May Company. She returned to New York in 1953 to join R. H. Macy & Company as an executive vice president -- the first woman to rise to that executive level at Macy's.         Ms. Corey moved back to California in 1960 to head the West Coast office of Grey Advertising. Over the years, she also served as senior vice president of Catalina, a sportswear company based in Los Angeles, and as a merchandising and marketing consultant for Bullock's department stores.         The space age entered her career when she was engaged as a consultant by a center at the University of Southern California that evaluated products developed for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. She advised the center about the commercial potential of the products and, with her husband, George Corey, founded Environmental Concepts Products to market them.         In the 1970's and 1980's, she was associated with the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, lecturing and meeting weekly with students for career counseling. At a luncheon held in 1982 in a hall named after her, the institute honored her for her contributions.         In 1956, Fortune magazine ranked her among the top businesswomen in the United States, and she won the National Retail Merchants Gold Medal for retailing twice.         Ms. Corey is survived by a daughter, Mary Corey, and a granddaughter, both of Beverly Hills. Her husband died last year.       
         K. T. Stevens, a theater, film and television actress and a theatrical-union official, died on June 13 at her home in Brentwood, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was lung cancer, said Dick Moore, a spokesman for the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.         Ms. Stevens, whose original name was Gloria Wood, was born in Hollywood. Her father was the film director Sam Wood. She began acting in plays and films as a child, using the stage name Katherine Stevens. After starring in the radio soap opera "Mr. Pepper's Family" and taking ingenue roles on the stage, she made her Broadway debut in "The Land Is Bright" in 1941. She also appeared on Broadway in "Nine Girls" (1943) and "Laura" (1947).         In the 1940's and 50's Ms. Stevens played leading roles in such films as "Address Unknown" (1944), "Port of New York," (1949), "Harriet Craig" (1950) and "Vice Squad" (1953). More recently, she appeared in "Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice" (1969) and "Pets" (1974).         Her television credits include appearances on "I Love Lucy," "The Rifleman," "The Patty Duke Show" "Mannix," "Days of Our Lives" and "General Hospital." For more than five years she played Vanessa on "The Young and the Restless."         Ms. Stevens served on local and national boards of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists from 1978 until her death. She was president of the union's Los Angeles local from 1986 to 1989.         Her marriage to the film actor Hugh Marlowe ended in divorce in 1967. She is survived by two sons, Jeffrey and Chris, both of Los Angeles, and a granddaughter.       
         Dr. Margaret Shaughnessy Gordon, who became a prominent economist in an academic discipline long dominated by men, died on Saturday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Gordon was a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, where she had served as associate director of the Institute of Industrial Relations from 1954 until 1969. She produced numerous books and studies on health, welfare, employment and, later, higher education.         One of her books, "Employment Expansion and Population Growth: The California Experience, 1900-1950," published in 1954, was among the first analyses to arrive at the conclusion that California, more than any other state, depended on military spending. Another, "Social Security Policies in Industrial Countries: An International Perspective" (Cambridge University Press, 1989) remains in print.         Other books by Dr. Gordon included "Barrier to World Trade" (1941), "The Economics of Welfare Policies" (1963), "Retraining and Labor Market Adjustment in Western Europe" (1965), and "Youth Education and Unemployment Problems: An International Perspective" (1979). Role in War on Poverty         She drafted more than a dozen reports for the Carnegie Commission and Council on Higher Education while serving consecutively as associate director of both from 1969 to 1979. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the Commission on Income Maintenance Programs to examine all "welfare and related programs" in his War on Poverty.         A native of Wabasha, Minn., she graduated from Bryn Mawr College and received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1935. In World War II she worked in the Federal Government's Office of Price Administration.         Dr. Gordon's husband, Robert A. Gordon, who died in 1978 after the couple had been married 42 years, was also a Harvard-educated ecomonics professor, as were her two sons. In Berkeley she was active in civic affairs and was a committeewoman with the Democratic Party of Alameda County. Her husband was also a professor of economics at Berkeley.         She is survived by her sons, Robert J., of Evanston, Ill., an economics professor at Northwestern University, and David M., of Manhattan, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research. .       
         Josephine Moy Hong, active in Chinese-American affairs and Republican Party politics, died on Sunday in Flushing Hospital. She was 93 and lived in Jamaica Estates, Queens.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Hong was born in Boston but spent much of her childhood in southern China, where her father moved when she was 8 years old to help develop the mining industry.         She returned to the United States in 1917 and studied economics and psychology at the University of Chicago and New York University. In 1923 she married Louis Fong Sui Hong, who was instrumental in expanding operations in Asia for the National City Bank of New York. The family went to live at Shanghai's International Settlement, an enclave of foreigners guarded by Western forces, when the Japan invaded China in 1937. Mrs. Hong tended to the wounded and sick while under bombardments.         Back in the United States in 1939, she organized a group of Chinese volunteers to raise funds for war refugees in New York. After Pearl Harbor, she served as a director of the National Board of the American Women's Voluntary Service and as chairman of its Chinese unit in New York.         In the decades since, she held leading positions in the Chinese Women's Benevolent Association, the Institute of Chinese Culture, the Chinese Cultural Renaissance Society and the Asian American Assembly, among others.         She turned to Republican Party politics in the 1960's and was vice president of the New York State Republican Heritage Groups Council.         She was inducted as a Life Member of the Republican Party in 1979. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan named her to his Peace Corps Advisory Council.         Mrs. Hong is survived by three sons; Alfred of Jamaica Estates, Robert of Syosset, L.I., and Morris of Fresh Meadows, Queens; a daughter, Virginia Wei of Princeton, N.J.; a brother, Herbert Moy of Chicago; a sister, Mae Wu of Berkeley, Calif.; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Catherine Damon Christy, a former president of the Young Women's Christian Association of Brooklyn and a former member of the boards of various charitable organizations, died on Wednesday at her home in Wilton, Conn. She was 96 and formerly lived in Brooklyn Heights.         The cause was cardiac arrest. She had been suffering from arteriosclerotic heart disease, said Joseph Pagliaro of the Hoyt Funeral Home in New Canaan, Conn.         Mrs. Christy did volunteer work for years with the Brooklyn Y.W.C.A. and was its president from 1944 to 1953. She was also a longtime member of its board.         In addition, she was a member of the national Y.W.C.A. board from 1947 to 1967 and was variously a member of its executive committee, its committee on racial inclusiveness and other panels.         Mrs. Christy also served on the boards of the Visiting Nurse Association of Brooklyn and the Brooklyn Bureau of Social Service, and was secretary of the National United Service Organization from 1957 to 1968.         A native of Pulaski, Va., she received a Bachelor of Science degree from Simmons College in Boston in 1920 and was later employed as a librarian.         She married Francis T. Christy, a lawyer, in 1922. He died in 1979.         She is survived by two sons, Arthur H. of Manhattan and Dr. Francis T. Christy of Washington; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         The Rev. Beatrice Blair, associate priest at St. George's Episcopal Church on East 16th Street, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in the East Village.         The cause was a heart attack, her husband, John Robbins, said.         Her ordination in 1978 put her among the first female priests in the Episcopal Church. She had served at St. George's for the last four years, after assignments at the Church of the Heavenly Rest and St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery. Scion of Blair House Family         A native of Boston, Ms. Blair was raised in Washington, a scion of the family that gave Blair House to the United States Government, which turned it into a residence for dignitaries visiting Washington as guests of the White House. She attended Bryn Mawr College but graduated from the Manhattan branch of Empire State College, and trained for the priesthood at the General Theological Seminary, in Manhattan.         Before moving to New York from Rochester, she was a president of the Monroe County League of Planned Parenthood and the founding president of Eleanor's List, a group formed to raise funds for female candidates who support abortion rights. In the early 1970's, she was also executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.         More recently, she was a leader in the New York Metropolitan Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights.         Besides her husband, Ms. Blair is survived by a daughter and three sons from a previous marriage: Elizabeth Hillard of Pleasant Hill, Calif., Harper Sibley Jr. of Portland, Me., Blair Sibley of Miami, and Durbin Sibley of Corpus Christi, Tex.; three sisters, Judy Green of Cincinnati, Betsy Douglas of Missoula, Mont., and Edith Blair of Alexandria, Va., and nine grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Collins, a singing star of the popular 1950's television show "Your Hit Parade" and a Tony nominee for the Broadway show "Follies" in 1971, died on Thursday at her home in Watervliet, N.Y. She was 67.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Melissa Holgate.         As a featured singer on "Your Hit Parade" from 1950 to 1957, Miss Collins was America's singing sweetheart, noted for her trademark high-necked blouses and such standard songs as "Too Young," "Shrimp Boats" and "Harbor Lights." The show was the television version of the long-running radio program "Lucky Strike Hit Parade" and featured the top tunes of the week performed by the show's cast in a variety of costumes and settings. Other members of the cast during Miss Collins's time included Snooky Lanson, Gisele MacKenzie, June Valli and Russell Arms.         Miss Collins, whose original name was Marjorie Chandler, was born on Nov. 18, 1926 in Windsor, Ontario. Her first career thoughts were for secretarial work, but when her parents entered her in a talent show in 1938, she won a wristwatch and a chance to sing on a children's radio program in nearby Detroit. She was such a hit that she stayed with the show for some time. Met Her Mentor at 16         In 1942, she was introduced to the band leader Raymond Scott, who advised her to take voice lessons for a year and then to sing for him again. She subsequently sang with his quintet and performed in jazz spots across the country. In 1949, Mr. Scott left his group to become director of the orchestra for the radio show "Your Hit Parade," and Miss Collins stayed on the road and ran the quintet. That meant doing the introductions as well as singing. Speaking Mr. Scott's lines, she was actually doing her first announcing.         "It was quite a terrifying experience," she said in a 1953 interview, but it took her closer to the earnest commercials that were to contribute to her fame.         She and Mr. Scott were married in 1952.         Early in 1950, the American Tobacco Company, sponsor of "Your Hit Parade" for Lucky Strike cigarettes, was looking for a new type of advertising commercial. Mr. Scott was commissioned to write some jingles, which eventually gained nationwide popularity, and he had Miss Collins sing them. The sponsor liked her voice and personal appearance and when televising "Your Hit Parade" was broached, she was selected for four trial telecasts. Impressed by this cheerful woman who told people to get happy by smoking a particular cigarette, the sponsor signed her to do the commercials and to be a featured singer when the show began its official run in October 1950. Letters From the Clergy         In a 1979 interview, Miss Collins was asked if she liked her girl-next-door image.         "Yes, because that's me, and you can't be what you aren't," she replied. "I was very protected when I was growing up, and there's a lot that I don't know. When I was on 'Hit Parade,' the bulk of my mail was from priests and nuns. They used to do sermons on all the good I was doing for American womanhood."         After "Your Hit Parade" went off the air, she did a stint on "'Candid Camera," from 1961 to 1963. In 1971 she was given a starring role in the Stephen Sondheim musical "Follies," singing one of the show's big songs, "Losing My Mind" and receiving a Tony nomination for her performance. She also had leading roles in stock companies and dinner-theater productions and gave concerts across the country. Plagued with asthma for years, she retired from performing in 1980.         She was also active for many years in the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and became a vice president of the organization in 1988.         Her two marriages, to Mr. Scott and to the singer Ron Holgate, ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Holgate, who lives in Watervliet, she is survived by two other daughters, Elizabeth Adams, also of Watervliet, and Deborah Studebaker of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.       
         Ann McGarry Buchwald, wife of the columnist Art Buchwald and an author and former literary agent, died on Sunday at her home in Washington. She was 74.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         In the 1970's Mrs. Buchwald was a Washington partner of Irving Lazar, one of Hollywood's top literary and talent agents. But in 1974, after Mr. Lazar agreed to try to sell the memoirs of former President Richard M. Nixon, Mrs. Buchwald ended her partnership, citing a conflict of principle because her husband had written many satirical columns about Watergate and Mr. Nixon.         Besides her autobiography, "Seems Like Yesterday," Mrs. Buchwald was the co-author of "White Gloves and Party Manners" (Robert B. Luce, 1965) and "Stand Up, Shake Hands, Say 'How Do You Do' " (Robert B. Luce, 1969).         Mrs. Buchwald, who was born in Warren, Pa., was also a fashion coordinator for Neiman-Marcus in Dallas, and later was a publicity director for Pierre Balmain in Paris. In 1950, while still in Paris, she opened a public relations firm. She met Mr. Buchwald there the same year, and they married in 1952.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Connie Marks of Culpeper, Va., and Jennifer Buchwald of Boston; a son, Joel, of Denver; three grandchildren, five sisters and two brothers.       
         Zelma Watson George, a sociologist, musicologist and performer who broke a color barrier on Broadway in 1950, died on Sunday at University Hospitals in Cleveland. A resident of Cleveland, she was 90.         The cause was heart failure, said Raoul Abdul, a New York writer and longtime friend.         Dr. George was a sought-after lecturer, a trained soprano and a leading researcher of African-American music. Her encounter with Broadway was brought about by the composer Gian Carlo Menotti for the 1950 production of "The Medium," a folk opera, at the Arena stage of the Hotel Edison.         Dr. George had sung the opera's leading role of Madame Flora, a fraudulent spiritualist, at the dedication of the Karamu Lyric Theater in Cleveland the year before. 'Power and Imagination'         That production was a black version of the 1946 Menotti work. Learning of her performance, the composer brought her to New York to sing the part in a white production. She was the first black woman to take a white role on Broadway.         "She has great personal force," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. "She sings with power and imagination."         In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her as the only black member of the United States delegation to the 15th General Assembly of the United Nations. In the late 1960's, she was the executive director of the oldest Job Corps center in the United States, in Cleveland. The State Department once sent her on a six-month lecture tour around the world.         Dr. George was born in Hearne, Tex., and graduated from the University of Chicago. She studied voice at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago and pipe organ at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. She briefly worked as a social worker in Evanston and spent seven years as a probation officer in Chicago.         From 1932 to 1937, she was the dean of women at Tennessee State University in Nashville. She then helped to organize the Avalon Community Center in Los Angeles and served as its executive director until she was named a Rockefeller Foundation research fellow in 1942. Studying Black Music         Starting early in her career, Dr. George lectured on the cultural contributions of blacks. In 1935 she began her research on black music and started a lecture series on human relations.         She returned to school to earn master's and doctoral degrees in sociology at New York University. Her Rockefeller grant enabled her to travel the country and cull data from libraries, private collections, cellars and attics. She spent six months in the Library of Congress alone.         The result was her doctoral thesis, "A Guide to Negro Music: An annotated bibliography of Negro folk music and art music by Negro composers or based on Negro thematic material." It was a compendium of 12,163 titles; she donated the manuscript to Howard University.         Dr. George sat on policy-making boards of the Girl Scouts of America, the American Red Cross, the League of Women Voters and the National Conference of Christians and Jews, among others.         She was married to Clayborne George, a lawyer in Cleveland and a prominent Republican there. He died many years ago.         Dr. George is survived by two sisters, A. Catherine Johnson of Massachusetts, and Vivian Edwards of Los Angeles, and a brother, Samuel E. J. Watson of Bangor, Mich.       
         Jean Fredette Ingrao, one of the first women elected to high office in the A.F.L.-C.I.O., died on Thursday at her home in Falls Church, Va. She was 63.         She died of cancer, said Michael Byrne, a spokesman for the labor federation.         Mrs. Ingrao (pronounced in-GRAY-oh) was elected in 1979 as executive secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Maritime Trades Department, which represents workers in 42 unions in the shipbuilding and seafaring trades and in other fields. She retired in 1993.         Mrs. Ingrao, who was born in Washington and attended schools there, began her career in 1950 as an aide to George Meany, then president of the American Federation of Labor. She later served as administrative assistant to the federation's executive secretary-treasurer.         She is survived by her husband, Leonard; two sons, Michael, of Falls Church, and Mark, of Alexandria, Va.; two sisters, Barbara Leonard of McLean, Va., and Mary Schmeich of Gaithersburg, Md., and two grandchildren.       
         Mary Anna Meyer, who took part in civic affairs and charitable causes for many years, died on Sunday in North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 74 and a Glen Cove resident.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Meyer, a native of Providence, R.I., was a trustee emeritus of Connecticut College in New London, her alma mater. She served Govs. Nelson A. Rockefeller and Malcolm Wilson as a member of the New York State Board of Social Welfare.         Over the years, she was also on the boards of the Nassau County Youth Board; the New York State Association for Community Services; the New York State Communities Aid Association; Center for Parents and Children, and WLIW/Channel 21. She was a past president of the Junior League of Long Island; the Family Service Association of Nassau County; the Health and Welfare Council of Nassau County, and United Way of Long Island.         Mrs. Meyer is survived by her husband, Richard W. Meyer, a retired vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company; a daughter, Charlotte Meyer-Arnold of Los Angeles; two sons, Richard W. Jr. and Douglas C., both of Locust Valley, L.I.; a brother, Richard C. Lemon of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Donna Kay Price, a Westchester County real estate executive and former director of the Lighthouse for the Blind of New York and Westchester, died on Saturday at Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 59 and lived in Waccabuc, N.Y.         Mrs. Price died of head injuries suffered in a fall at her home, her family said.         Mrs. Price, who was blind, was a longtime fund-raiser for the Seeing Eye Inc. in Morristown, N.J., which trains guide dogs for the blind. She was a past member of the board of the Lighthouse Inc. of New York and its Westchester division.         "She was a devoted supporter of services to people with visual impairments in the Hudson Valley," said Judith Millman, the organization's regional director in White Plains. Started in Advertising         Born in Terre Haute, Ind., Mrs. Price was a Phi Beta Kappa history graduate of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. She worked briefly in advertising before making her career in real estate. She was associated for 33 years with Houlihan Lawrence Real Estate of Bronxville, N.Y., most recently as a vice president and manager of the Katonah, N.Y., and Bedford, N.Y., offices.         In an interview three years ago, Mrs. Price said she was a diabetic and lost her sight completely over a period of two years, beginning about 1973.         "In the 1970's, they didn't know what to do with diabetes and eyesight problems," she said. "Now they have a pretty good chance of saving the eyesight with lasers."         She said she turned to the Lighthouse when her sight began to fail and remained associated with them ever since.         Mrs. Price is survived by her husband, Kenneth W., of Waccabuc; a daughter, Darcy Lee Price of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, Timothy of Port Jervis, N.Y.; and a sister, Barbara Lee Crowder of Scarsdale, N.Y.       
         Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, for nearly two decades the dean of New York University's School of Social Work, died yesterday at her home in South Orange, N.J. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said a university spokeswoman.         Dr. Ehrenkranz, who was credited with enhancing the school's national reputation, joined its staff in 1966 and became its dean in 1977. In her more than 17 years as dean, the school became one of the largest schools of social work in the nation, enrolling more than 1,000 students in undergraduate and graduate programs.         Under her leadership, the school also pioneered the holistic approach to clinical social work and became the first institution in the New York metropolitan area to offer a doctorate in clinical social work.         In recognition of her contributions, New York University had announced that the school would be renamed the Shirley M. Ehrenkranz School of Social Work. Jay Oliva, president of the university, said yesterday that there would be a renaming ceremony on Sept. 19. Was a Former Caseworker         Dr. Ehrenkranz received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College, master's degrees in English from Temple University, in social economy and social research from Bryn Mawr College and in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, and a doctorate in social welfare from Columbia University.         Before joining New York University, she served as a field instructor at the Rutgers University Graduate School of Social Work and a research assistant at the Columbia University School of Social Work. She was also a caseworker and case supervisor in agencies for families and children. She was president of the New York State Association of Deans in 1980-81 and 1988-89.         She is survived by her husband, Fred Kasoff; two daughters, Pamela Ehrenkranz of New York City and Jean LeGrand of Chicago; a sister, Babette Cohen of Rosyln Heights, L.I., and 16 grandchildren.         Correction:  August 27, 1994, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, omitted a survivor. He is her son, Dr. Joel Ehrenkranz of New Vernon, N.J.       
         Christine Lynn Potts, a Russian affairs expert on the staff of the National Security Council at the White House, died on Thursday at her home in Arlington, Va. She was 36.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Miss Potts, who was from Zanesville, Ohio, received a bachelor's degree in political science from Smith College and, in 1982, a master's degree in Russian studies from the University of Michigan. She began her career at the Brookings Institution as a research assistant on Soviet energy and economics.         She then spent two years at the Kennan Institute in Washington and went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1987. She joined the staff of the National Security Council in 1992, specializing in Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs. At the security council she was the principal policy assistant on the economies of the republics of the former Soviet Union.         Miss Potts also served as the executive secretary of a commission established by Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia to foster economic and technological cooperation between the two nations. In that capacity, she helped to arrange the panel's first meeting last September.         She is survived by her parents, Robert and Jean Potts of Callawassie Island, S.C.; and two brothers, Mark, of Bozeman, Mont., and Jeff, of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Jessie Sumner, an Illinois Republican who was the first woman elected to a county judgeship in her state and a conservative member of Congress from 1939 to 1947, died on Wednesday in Iroquois Memorial Hospital in Watseka, Ill. She was 96 and lived in nearby Milford.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Donna Rae Mann, Miss Sumner's assistant.         At her death, Miss Sumner was the president of Sumner National Bank, in Sheldon, Ill., which was founded by her father, Aaron Taylor Sumner. She took the post in 1966.         Miss Sumner was born on a farm in Iroquois County, Ill., grew up in that county and graduated from Smith College in 1920. She studied law at the University of Chicago and at Oxford and Columbia Universities. She worked as a lawyer in Chicago, New York and Milford.         In 1937, she became a judge in Iroquois County before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1938. She held the view, shared by many in her district in east-central Illinois, that the United States should not get involved in the war that was brewing in Europe.         After being elected to the House, she became nationally known as a foe of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and of his New Deal program and other policies. "What do I think of President Roosevelt?" she once asked, and then said she had come "to bury Caesar, not to praise him."         After World War II began in Europe in 1939, she found herself in a minority in Congress in voting against expanding the Navy. She was also among more than 100 representatives who voted, only months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, against extending the draft for a year.         After the United States entered the war in 1941, she criticized the country's allies, the conduct of the war, and Roosevelt Administration measures on the home front. She gained attention for her opposition to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which cared for refugees in Europe after the war, saying that if it was humanitarian, "so is keeping a gigolo."         Miss Sumner decided not to run for re-election in 1946. She then resumed practicing law in Milford and helped manage her family's insurance company, grain elevators and farms, in addition to the bank.         Survivors include a nephew, three nieces, six great-nephews and a great-niece.       
         Sheila Campbell Williamson, the founding director of the Community Foundation of New Jersey in Morristown, died on Sunday at her home in Short Hills, N.J. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Williamson, who continued to work until earlier this month, helped set up the foundation in 1980 and became a leader of the community-foundation movement in the United States. Such organizations collect endowed funds from individuals, businesses or private foundations to benefit innovative projects in a specific area.         Mrs. Williamson became the executive director of what began as the Essex County Community Foundation in 1980. Starting with little more than a borrowed desk and a phone, she nurtured the foundation into an organization with assets of about $11.5 million and distributions of more than $6 million.         Its donors include such corporate giants as Johnson & Johnson and the AT&T Corporation, and the Newark Boys Chorus, the New Jersey Symphony, AIDS education, neighborhood initiatives, civic improvements and various social services have been among the beneficiaries. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is a trustee and former president but the foundation operates with little fanfare,         Mrs. Williamson was active in many local organizations, including the United Way of Essex and West Hudson, the Association for Children in New Jersey and the Orange Orphan Society. She was a member of the Planning Board of Millburn and Short Hills.         Mrs. Williamson was a native of Glasgow. She graduated from Wells College in Aurora, N.Y., and received a master's degree in city and regional planning from Rutgers University. In the 1950's, she was a securities analyst for Bear, Stearns, one of the first women to be employed in that capacity on Wall Street.         Mrs. Williamson is survived by her husband, James G., and two daughters, Anne W. Holman of Short Hills and Christina Williamson of Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Buehring Phillips, a lifelong champion of the disabled and the founder and first State Director of the New York Special Olympics, died on Wednesday at Fannie Allen Hospital in Colchester, Vt. She was 83 and lived in Albany until three months ago, when she moved to Williston, Vt.         She suffered a long illness, said a spokesman for the Special Olympics organization.         Mrs. Phillips was president of the board of directors of the New York Special Olympics from its beginning in 1970 until 1982.         In 1969, Mrs. Phillips first became involved in the games by soliciting private donors and recruiting athletes for a New York contingent to the Northeast Regional Special Olympics Games for the Handicapped in Boston in 1969. After that event, she worked to create a permanent New York organization, which now trains and holds competitions for almost 35,000 children and adults statewide. Tribute from Governor Cuomo         Gov. Mario M. Cuomo paid her tribute yesterday for a quest of more than half a century to build bridges for those with mental and physical disabilities to the rest of society.         "She has seen her vision of Special Olympics in New York State grow to become the largest organization of its kind in the country, providing athletes with mental retardation an opportunity to enjoy the benefits of organized athletics," he said.         Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder and honorary chairman of Special Olympics International, said, "As we celebrate 25 years of achievement, I continue to reflect on those early days and say a heartfelt thanks to those pioneers such as Dorothy Buehring Phillips, who helped to make it all possible."         Born in Scottdale, Pa., Mrs. Phillips graduated from Geneseo State College and began to work with the mentally retarded in Hornall, N.Y. She also earned a bachelor's degree in special education and a master's degree in educational and vocational guidance at New York University.         Over the years she taught at the University of Rochester, Syracuse University, and Bar-Ilan University in Israel. She was a member of many state and national boards and the recipient of many honors. She also remained active on the Special Olympics' board and several committees after retiring as its president.         Mrs. Phillips, whose husbands, Donovan Franklin Buehring and William Holgate Phillips, are both dead, is survived by her daughter, Sandra D. Buehring of Williston, and three granddaughters.       
         Edith Sherin Markson, a promoter of regional theater in the United States and the founder of an exchange program for American and Eastern European theater artists, died on Saturday during a visit to Santa Fe, N.M. She was 81 and lived in New York City.         The cause was heart failure after a stroke, said her daughter, Mary Markson Dawe.         In the 1950's Mrs. Markson was among the founders of the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, and she later helped found the American Conservatory Theater in Pittsburgh before the company moved to San Francisco in 1967; until 1980, she was vice president of the theater's board.         Mrs. Markson also created the Theater International Exchange Services Foundation, an organization that arranged for collaborations, both here and abroad, between American theater artists and administrators and their counterparts in Eastern Europe.         In addition to Mrs. Dawe, of Milwaukee, she is survived by a son, Simpson Markson of New Jersey; a brother, the producer and director Edwin Sherin of New York City, and three grandchildren.       
         Barbara Drew Hoffstot, an architectural and community preservationist, died on Sept. 18 at her Pittsburgh home. She was 75 and also had homes in Palm Beach, Fla.; New Waterford, Ohio, and County Galway, Ireland.         She died after a long illness, The Palm Beach, Fla., Post reported.         At her death, Mrs. Hoffstot was a vice president of the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach and vice chairwoman of the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, two groups that she helped found. She had served as co-chairwoman of Palm Beach's first Landmarks Preservation Commission and had drafted landmarks preservation legislation for that city. She was a former trustee of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.         Her writings included the book "Landmark Architecture of Palm Beach," which was published in 1974 and has been twice revised.         Mrs. Hoffstot, whose family has spent winters in Palm Beach for three generations, was born Barbara S. Drew in Pittsburgh, graduated from the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Conn., and attended Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla.         She is survived by her husband of 46 years, Henry Phipps Hoffstot Jr.; a daughter, Thayer of Westlake Village, Calif.; a son, Henry Phipps 3d of Ligonier, Pa., and New York, and four grandchildren.       
         Mildred McAfee Horton, who helped revolutionize the role of women in the military as the first director of the WAVES, died on Friday at the St. Vincent DePaul Nursing Home in Berlin, N.H. She was 94.         Under her stewardship of the WAVES (an acronym for Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service), navy women in World War II worked as flight instructors, weather observers, truck drivers and air traffic controllers. The service paved the way for the expanding role of women in the armed services.         After the war, Mrs. Horton continued to be an outspoken advocate for improving the position of women in the military. In one speech, she criticized the "folly of a national policy of discussing manpower in a national emergency as though it were only male power," adding that such an attitude put women in the "category of a national luxury instead of a national asset."         Mrs. Horton was born in Parkville, Mo., and graduated from Vassar College in 1920. In 1923, she began teaching economics and sociology at Tusculum College in Tennessee, and in 1934 she became dean of women at Oberlin College. Was President of Wellesley         Mrs. Horton became president of Wellesley College in 1936, and in 1942 took a leave of absence to organize the WAVES. By the time she finished her tour of duty, in 1946, she had risen to the rank of captain and had been awarded a Distinguished Service Medal.         She returned to her position at Wellesley, where she remained until 1949.         Mrs. Horton also served as president of the American Association of Colleges and was on the boards of the NBC and RCA. She was also vice president of the National Council of Churches.         In 1945, she married the Rev. Douglas Horton, who became Dean of Harvard Divinity School in 1955. He died in 1968.         She is survived by four stepchildren: Margaret H. Grant of Chicago; Alan W. Horton of Randolph, N.H.; Alice H. Tibbetts of Madison, Wis., and Elizabeth H. Breunig of Appleton, Wis.       
         Joy Ungerleider-Mayerson, a former director of the Jewish Museum in Manhattan and a philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in Larchmont, N.Y. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her son Andrew Ungerleider.         At her death, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was president of the Dorot Foundation, whose interests include biblical archeology and Jewish education. She was also the chairman of the Albright Institute for archeological research in Jerusalem and served on the boards of other cultural and educational institutions. She was the director of the museum, on Fifth Avenue at 92d Street, from 1972 to 1980, after being a curator there from 1967 to 1969.         In 1971, criticized for neglect of its Judaica collection and facing a substantial deficit, the museum's board decided that the institution should devote itself to "a commitment to the Jewish community." The museum was shut during that year, and Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson has been praised as having subsequently rescued it from its doldrums. She shifted the museum's focus from art to Jewish culture, instituting a strong education program and creating popular exhibitions on the subject of Israel and biblical archeology.         As a philanthropist, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was instrumental in providing support, through family foundations, for the New York Public Library. She was the author of one book, "Jewish Folk Art from the Biblical Period to Modern Times" (1986) and the co-author of another, "The Museums of Israel" (Abrams, 1989).         Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson, who was born in Lawrence, L.I., received a B.A. from New York University in 1942 and a master's degree in Hebrew Studies from New York University in 1971. She was married to Samuel Ungerleider in 1945; he died in 1972.         In addition to her sons Andrew, of Los Angeles, and Peter, of Manhattan, she is survived by another son, Dr. Steven Ungerleider of Eugene, Ore.; three daughters, Jeane Ungerleider-Springer of Boston, Miriam Mayerson-Michael of Manhattan and Clare Benac-Mayerson of Paris; two sisters, Celeste G. Bartos of Manhattan and Miriam G. Wallach of Scarsdale, N.Y., and seven grandchildren       
         Sister Parish, the acclaimed and enduring American interior decorator who began her career when she was a young Depression-era mother and later came to redesign rooms of the White House during the Kennedy Administration, died on Thursday at her home in Dark Harbor, Maine. She was 84 and also had a home in New York City.         She had suffered a lengthy illness, said Dorothy B. Gilbert, one of her daughters.         Mrs. Parish's six decades of decorating epitomized the rise of women in her own and other professions in 20th-century America. The one-room business she founded in 1933 in Far Hills, N.J., evolved into the noted decorating firm of Parish-Hadley Associates, based in Manhattan, whose designs consistently exuded quality.         The anxious 23-year-old of 1933 -- whose nursery nickname had replaced her seldom-used given name, Dorothy -- went on to become a force in forming and articulating tastes in interior design. Vogue magazine once said she was "the most famous of all living women interior designers, whose ideas have influenced life styles all over America." 'Patrician Aplomb'         John Richardson, an art historian, wrote in 1989, "No one else in America does a room with such patrician aplomb, such life-enhancing charm, such a lack of gimmickry or trendiness."         With a profile that seemed carved from the Maine coastline, her longtime home and design influence, Mrs. Parish was a strong traditionalist. "What seems important to me is permanence, comfort and a look of continuity in the design and decoration of a house," she once observed. "The happiest times of my life are associated with beautiful, familiar things and family."         She and her firm became known for the low-keyed handsomeness of their work and for their well-heeled and relatively conservative clientele. It included President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy; the philanthropists Brooke Astor and Enid Annenberg Haupt; William S. Paley, the chairman of CBS, and members of the Bronfman, Getty, Mellon, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney clans.         In 1988, one of Queen Elizabeth II's daughters-in-law, the Duchess of York, asked the firm to design the interior of the ducal couple's new house near Windsor Castle. But the assignment was eventually switched to a British designer, and the British press reported that the Queen thought the Americans' plans were too expensive. Still Working in Her 80's         Mrs. Parish stayed on as a partner in the firm into her 80's, proving to be a notably durable member of a pioneer cohort of American women who came to prominence as interior decorators between the two world wars.         Mrs. Parish is widely considered to have originated, in the 1960's, the decorating idiom that became known as American country style: she was an early and influential champion of the humble striped cloth called mattress ticking, which had traditionally covered mattresses, using it for slipcovers and on throw pillows.         She saw no conflict between innovation and traditionalism. As she wrote in HG magazine in 1990, "Years ago, my partner, Albert Hadley, and I were delighted when patchwork quilts, four-poster beds, painted floors, knitted throws, rag rugs and hand-woven bedsteads were first listed among the 'innovations' of our firm."         "The list sounds old-fashioned, and no decorator wants to be that," she continued, "but Albert and I understood that innovation is often the ability to reach into the past and bring back what is good, what is beautiful, what is lasting." Father Collected Antiques         Mrs. Parish's own girlhood was, if not regal, at least baronial. She was born Dorothy May Kinnicutt in July 15, 1910, in Morristown, N.J., the daughter of G. Hermann Kinnicutt and the former May Appleton Tuckerman, who had homes in Manhattan, Maine and Paris, as well as New Jersey.         Mrs. Parish's father was a collector of antiques (as was a cousin, Dorothy Draper, who also became a renowned decorator). Much later she would recall the distaste she felt as a child for the furniture her father collected, "that awful English brown," as she put it.         As a teen-ager, she saw painted French furniture in Paris -- and experienced a revelation.         She went to the Chapin School in Manhattan and to the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., made her debut and was married to Mr. Parish in 1930 in Manhattan with, as The New York Times reported at the time, "a representative gathering of old New York families on hand." Decorating a Farmhouse         After her marriage, she and her husband had a home on East End Avenue in Manhattan -- which had been done by a decorator -- and a farmhouse in Far Hills, N.J., which Mrs. Parish herself decorated, with gusto.         Her handiwork was admired, friends began coming to her for help with decorating, and she later confidently recalled that "it never occurred to me that I wasn't qualified to give it."         It was four years after the Wall Street crash of 1929 that Mrs. Parish, who had never received a high school diploma, opened her first office. Hard times were coming upon her husband and her father, both blue-blooded stockbrokers. She called her business "Mrs. Henry Parish 2d Interiors" and placed it in Far Hills.         The success that followed was fueled by her taste, talent and strength of will. Mr. Hadley, who joined forces with her in 1962, said in 1991 that "Sis always knows when a room is right and a room is not." She was famed for creating a homey "undecorated look."  'Money, Big Money'         In some ways, Mrs. Parish's rise was made easier by her upper-crust roots, and her earliest work was decorating the houses of friends.         Decorating by Mrs. Parish and her firm also acquired a reputation for being expensive. The New York Times columnist Charlotte Curtis wrote in 1985 that Parish-Hadley work "costs money, big money."         But Mrs. Parish also had an economical streak. In the mid-1960's, she acquired a batch of turn-of-the-century golden oak furniture at a bargain basement price, the story goes, then painted it white and used it in decorating a house that she and her husband had bought in Maine.         As the design editor Elaine Greene wrote later in The New York Times, "when shown in the January 1967 issue of House & Garden, the house dazzled decorators the way Christian Dior's 1947 New Look did the fashion world."         The white furniture and other furnishings in the house -- including soft-hued chintz, needlework, hand-crafted cotton rugs and paintings of dogs -- became staples of the style. Decorating for the Kennedys         Mrs. Parish met Jacqueline Kennedy socially in the late 1950's and helped her decorate the house in the Georgetown section of Washington where she and her husband, John F. Kennedy, lived while he was a Senator. After Mr. Kennedy was elected President, his wife made Mrs. Parish a consultant in her redecorating of the White House.         Mrs. Kennedy also named her to a committee that was formed to help furnish the White House with authentic pieces from a century and a half earlier.         Speaking of Mrs. Kennedy's plans for redoing the family quarters in the building, Mrs. Parish said early in 1961 that the nation's new First Lady was a person of "simple tastes who wants to create a home."         The walls of the family quarters were done in pastel tones -- the private drawing room was eventually done in yellow and white.         In the years since, there have been persistent reports that Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Parish -- who could be blunt and acerbic -- had a falling-out over the White House. As Town & Country magazine recounted it in 1988, the First Lady "fired Sister for telling little Caroline to keep her feet off the upholstery. Sister would later describe the experience in explicit, harsh terms."         But Mrs. Parish could go to enormous lengths to please a client. Sally Bedell Smith wrote in her 1990 book "In All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley" that in a single bedroom Mrs. Parish and Mr. Hadley did in the 1960's in Mr. Paley's Fifth Avenue duplex, "a painter worked for five months applying 18 coats of paint -- six different shadings just for the base, plus glazing."         Mr. Parish died in 1977, having spent 34 years with the Wall Street securities firm of Loeb Rhoades & Company.         Mrs. Parish is survived by her daughters, Mrs. Gilbert of Hot Springs, Ark., and May Appleton Bartlett of Boston; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Jessica Tandy, who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have, died yesterday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 85.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the actor Hume Cronyn.         Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film "Driving Miss Daisy." In the years between, she and Mr. Cronyn, played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day.         With the role of Blanche Dubois, Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood's leading ladies, to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage. The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance, which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called "incredibly true." Almost four decades later, another New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of her, "Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should be allowed to write about her."         When she was 80 years old, she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in "Driving Miss Daisy." It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and, at last, an Academy Award. When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one. She vowed to go on working, although she said she hoped she would know when to stop, "before they have to get the hook." The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of "Foxfire," of which her husband was was a co-writer. Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work, completing three films and two television dramas. A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs         When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together, in "The Fourposter" in 1951, audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater. One triumph followed another, culminating in "The Gin Game" in 1977 and "Foxfire" in 1982.         By 1986, when they appeared in "The Petition," Mr. Rich was writing of "their legendary theatrical relationship" and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as "an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again." Mel Gussow, another drama critic for The Times, called them "two actors at their summit." He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together, it was "a matter of hearts, minds and bodies in creative harmony."         One of their last projects together was "To Dance With the White Dog," a television movie that had its premiere last year. At last night'a Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Cronyn was named best actor in a mini-series or special for his performance as a recently widowed man mourning his wife. Miss Tandy was nominated for best actress but did not win. A clip from the movie was shown during the awards ceremony in a brief tribute to her.         When they took "The Gin Game" to Moscow in 1979, they won the accolade that Mr. Cronyn treasures above all others. Oleg N. Yefremov, the director of the renowned Moscow Art Theater, wrote in his review, "It takes a couple of actors from America to remind us what Stanislavsky was talking about."         Miss Tandy was nominated five times for a Tony and won three: in 1948 for her role as Blanche Dubois, for "The Gin Game" in 1978, and for "Foxfire" in 1983. Mr. Cronyn was also nominated for "The Gin Game" but did not win. "I was bitterly disappointed," Miss Tandy said. "His performance is part of mine. I think he's very proud when I win, and vice versa."         In July 1994 they were honored with a special Tony for their life's work in the theater. They had already received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal, in December 1986, and the National Medal of Art, from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature         Miss Tandy acted in more than 100 stage productions during her 67-year career, which began in England and encompassed the West End in London as well as the British provinces, Broadway, and the regional theaters that were once so important to the American stage. She appeared in more than 25 movies and played the leading role in a number of television programs, developing from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft, a star adored by directors for her serenity. There was no temperament; there were no tantrums. Elia Kazan, her director in "Streetcar" said: "She's absolutely sweet-natured. She does her job; she has a sense of humor."         With each performance her reviews got better. "I think I've gotten better," she said when she was 77. "I've gotten more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrusted myself. I'd be in things I felt weren't being done right and I didn't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me."         Miss Tandy, who became an American citizen in 1954, was born in London on June 7, 1909. Her father died when she was 12 and her mother took clerical and teaching jobs at night to supplement her regular income as headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two older brothers were read to a lot, Miss Tandy recalled in 1986: "good stuff, poetry."         "I had an appreciation of the words. We were also taken to theater. I sat in a lot of galleries. It was a magical time, but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never wanted it to end." She also grew to love Shakespeare, one of the few in her class who did. "Almost everyone would say, 'Oh, God, it's Shakespeare this afternoon.' To me it was heaven."         Her brothers would stage family theatricals in their five-room flat in northeast London, but she said she did not show any promise. "I was a graceless lump," she recalled. "My brothers would always say, 'Oh, Mummy, do we really have to have her in it?' "         Nevertheless, her love of the theater led her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where, in 1924, she began three years of dramatic training. She was 18 when she made her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in "The Manderson Girls." The salary was $:2 a week, out of which she somehow had to pay for the five elegant costumes her part required. She managed by sewing them herself.  Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling         She was convinced that she was plain and that there was nothing to be done about it. "I had absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I did," she said. Her self-confidence was not enhanced by her many letters of recommendation. She remembered that each one of them said, "Don't be put off by how she looks." But if she ever was an ugly duckling -- and there are many photographs that suggest she was not -- a swan finally emerged, for in her later years she was a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkling eyes of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically, saying: "In a way it was rather good. I didn't get the part of the young ingenue. I got more interesting parts."         In 1929 she made her West End debut in "The Rumor," by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro, but it was in 1932, in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe's "Children in Uniform," that she became recognized as a gifted actress. It was a role that also afforded her one of her most treasured moments in the theater. "There was one performance when the audience didn't clap at all, they were so moved," she recalled.         During the 1930's she appeared in more than two dozen contemporary plays, but in the English tradition honed her skill on the classics, especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she was Ophelia to John Gielgud's legendary Hamlet. She was Viola in Tyrone Guthrie's 1937 production of "Twelfth Night" at the Old Vic in London, where she twice shared the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940, she returned to the Old Vic as Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear.         The offer of a role in "The Matriarch" brought her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten years later, when the war in Europe had begun and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins was ending, she settled in the United States. There was the lure of Hollywood, and there was the need to support her 6-year-old daughter, Susan. She was allowed to take only $:10 out of the country, and despite her long list of credits, it was such a struggle to make ends meet that she almost abandoned the stage.         In 1940, while she was appearing in A. J. Cronin's "Jupiter Laughs," a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn called on her backstage. Two years later they moved to Hollywood and were married. A son, Chris, was born in 1943 and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. They, her daughter Susan, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive her, in addition to her husband. Maids' Roles Ended, Thanks to Cronyn         In Hollywood, Mr. Cronyn landed some interesting roles in the movies, but Miss Tandy's career languished. At one point she even told friends she was thinking of giving up acting. She appeared with Mr. Cronyn in "The Seventh Cross" (1944) and played bit parts in several other movies, including the role of a ladies' maid in "Forever Amber" (1947), but having to say lines like "Yes, Mum" and 'No, Mum" in yet another movie became very discouraging, she recalled many years later. "I'd had a good start and I was in the doldrums in Hollywood," she said. "It was not a happy position. I began to feel I had no talent and it was all a pipe dream. It was Hume who got me out of it."         He got her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in "Portrait of a Madonna," a play by Tennessee Williams that he was directing in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave reviews brought Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York, where he was casting his new play, "A Streetcar Named Desire." He wrote in his "Memoirs," "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche."         The play, co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter as Blanche's sister, Stella, won rapturous reviews, a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and ran for more than two years on Broadway before going on a national tour. Years later, Mr. Kazan remembered the joy of directing Miss Tandy. "She's perfect," he said. "She never stops working and she's always full of little surprises. She always does things a little better than you think she will."         Mr. Atkinson, writing about Miss Tandy's performance in The New York Times, said, "It does seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, revealing and true."         A contrary view was expressed by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently published autobiography. In "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the actor wrote: "I think Jessica and I were both miscast, and between us we threw the play out of balance. Jessica is a very good actress, but I never thought she was believable as Blanche. I didn't think she had the finesse or cultivated femininity that the part required, nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned."         When "Streetcar" was filmed, the part of Blanche went to Vivien Leigh; it was the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script         She said that in creating a character, "You have to get over 'how' you're doing it and know 'why' you're doing it. Once you forget about the 'how' you get the appearance of reality." She believed the secret to a character was in the script and that it was the actor's duty to "dig it out." She said: "I'm slow about it. I keep going back to the script, the script, the script."         To Miss Tandy, audience reaction was part of a play. She said, "It's not a matter of whether they're laughing or not but whether they're breathing or not." But audiences, like the theater itself, underwent profound changes during Miss Tandy's years on the stage. "The trouble with the theater," she said in 1986, "is that it's no longer a way of life for an audience. It's just a way to kill an evening." One of the theater's problems, she said, was "we are so inundated with entertainment."         "Now you flick a switch," she continued. "It's not the event it used to be."         She said theater people had contributed to the problem by removing the curtain. "People come into the theater and they sit there watching the first scene and talking about what they've bought in Bloomingdale's that day. When you had a curtain, when the footlights went up on the curtain, and then the curtain itself went up, you were part of an experience."         As for the actors, Miss Tandy said she hated to have to grope her way across a dark stage, stumbling into the furniture, "instead of getting on stage and having a moment to think about what you're going to do." Joe Mankiewicz, the film director who was a longtime friend, said that while Lynn Fontanne always had to make an entrance, "to Jessie the way she was when she got there was what was important."  Loved to Play In the Classics         Miss Tandy was always eager to perform in regional theaters and, with Mr. Cronyn, was among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launched his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of stars of their magnitude helped put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who followed was the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie's first season in 1963, for example, Miss Tandy played Gertrude in Hamlet, Olga in "The Three Sisters" and the wife of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman." She also acted in the Shakespeare festivals in Stratford, Conn., and Stratford, Ontario. In 1983 she starred in a revival of an American classic, Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie." Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "You pass up Miss Tandy's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril."         She hated the experience of seeing herself in the movies. "It's a very humbling experience to watch yourself," she said. But while the satisfaction of film never came close to the joy of a live performance, she said she felt it was important to accept roles that were offered to her; it helped pay expenses when she took parts at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She played Mr. Cronyn's wife in four of her most recent films, "Honky Tonk Freeway," (1981) "Cocoon," (1984), "Batteries Not Included" (1987) and "Cocoon: The Return" (1988). In 1991, Miss Tandy, then 82, played an indomitable 82-year-old woman in "Fried Green Tomatoes."         Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 plays on Broadway and dozens of Off Broadway and regional productions during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they went they were asked how they tolerated so much togetherness. "It's hard sometimes," she acknowledged, "but we always manage to give ourselves space. We don't live in each other's pockets. We don't take the play home with us. We do make suggestions to each other, and if we don't agree we respect each other's views." She burst out laughing and recalled Dame Sybil Thorndike's response when asked whether she ever considered divorcing her husband, with whom she had long shared the stage. "Divorce? Never. Murder? Frequently."         In her 70's and even into her 80's, Miss Tandy continued to take on strenuous parts, despite increased difficulty with memorization and stage fright that had got worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that caused her collapse onstage during a performance of "Foxfire" in Los Angeles in 1985 did not slow her down. Nor did major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appeared in the television movies "The Story Lady" (1991) and "To Dance With the White Dog" (1993) and completed three more feature films: "Used People" (1992) and "Camilla" and "Nobody's Fool," which are to be released this fall.         "Jessie adores working," Mr. Cronyn said in 1986. "She's more fully alive when she's working." As she got older she seemed to be in ever greater demand, but over the years she took good parts and she took bad parts. "You are richer for doing things," she said. "If you wait for the perfect part or for what sends you, you will have long waits, and you deteriorate. You can't be an actor without acting." A DEDICATED LIFE IN THE PUBLIC EYE         During a 67-year acting career in Britain and the United States, Jessica Tandy appeared in more than 100 plays, more than 25 movies and numerous television shows. Here is a sampling.

The year was 1989. In some editions the obituary also misstated the year for the film "Fried Green Tomatoes." It was 1991.       
         Merrinelle Sullivan, a past president and longtime officer of the National Council of Women of the United States, died on Sunday in her Manhattan home. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said Robert Sonderskov, a family friend.         At her death, Mrs. Sullivan represented the International Council of Women, an umbrella organization for 78 national councils worldwide, to the United Nations Family Committee.         She had been executive director of the National Council in New York for 18 years before being elected president. As such, she oversaw its activities in New York and Washington in 1988, when both the national and international groups, which lobby for women's causes, observed their 100th anniversaries.         Although her cancer was diagnosed seven years ago, Mrs. Sullivan led an active life, working with women's groups and other organizations. She attended meetings in Indonesia, Cairo and Paris within the last year.         She also continued to work for the Manhattan League, Helen Keller Services for the Blind, Nightingale-Bamford School Volunteers and Mount Sinai Hospital.         Born Merrinelle Rice in Little Rock, Ark., she attended Stephens College in Missouri. Before her marriage in 1961, she managed a hotel in Cape May, N.J., and worked for a New York advertising agency.         She is survived by her husband, Robert A., and two daughters, Amanda, of Manhattan and Susan, a student at the University of Colorado at Boulder.       
         Mary G. Roebling, former chairwoman of the National State Bank, one of New Jersey's largest independent banks, and a former governor of the American Stock Exchange, died on Tuesday at her home in Trenton. She was 89.         The cause was renal failure, The Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Roebling retired in 1984 as chairman of the National State Bank in Elizabeth, N.J., which then had assets of $1.2 billion.         Earlier, she became the first woman to head a major American bank, the Trenton Trust Company. In 1937, at the age of 30, she was named its president. It grew substantially and she was its president or chairman or both until 1972, when Trenton Trust was acquired by National State. She was then elected chairman of the combined institutions.         Mrs. Roebling was also a founder, in 1978, of the Women's Bank N.A. of Denver, the first nationally chartered bank founded by women. She went on to serve as its chairman until 1983. In addition, she was the American Stock Exchange's first woman governor, from 1958 to 1962.         Mrs. Roebling also served as a director of numerous other corporations over the years, was active in many civic, charitable and educational organizations, and was a tireless advocate of a greater role for women in the country's economic affairs.         In a speech in 1965, Mrs. Roebling said: "As a woman who for years has competed in the business world, I would be the first to agree that the American woman has almost unbelievable economic power, but American women, like women of all civilized nations, do not use the influence their economic power gives them."         Mrs. Roebling's own economic power came initially through inheritance, but she increased it vastly once it fell into her hands. She was bequeathed a large block of Trenton Trust stock by her millionaire second husband, Siegfried Roebling, whose family had long been prominent in engineering and cable manufacturing. He was a great-grandson of John A. Roebling, who designed the Brooklyn Bridge, and a grandson of Col. Washington A. Roebling, who completed its construction.         Siegfried Roebling died in 1936, of a heart attack. Mrs. Roebling's father and father-in-law then urged her to try her hand at running the bank. She had preparation for the job: she had worked for a Philadelphia investment house while taking business courses at night and, the two men told her, she had another important qualification, common sense.         The rest was banking history. She took her husband's seat on the bank's board and, on Jan. 21, 1937, was elected president.         "Mary G. Roebling didn't wait for women's lib," Forbes magazine once wrote, "she was ahead of it, way ahead."         By 1970, Mrs. Roebling estimated that 300 other American women had become presidents or chairwomen of banks. But in 1978, when she became chairwoman of the Women's Bank, she argued that there still was a place in the business world for banks that were operated specifically for female customers.         "Women's banks can be better listeners for women and give them more time, advice and direction than an ordinary bank would give," she told an interviewer. "It's a psychological thing, really."         She continued to be active in male-dominated spheres, however: in 1978, after having served as a civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army in several administrations, she became the founding president of the newly formed Army War College Foundation. It was set up to support the college's fund-raising and other activities.         She was born Mary Gindhart in 1907 in West Collingswood, N.J., the daughter of Isaac D. Gindhart Jr., a telephone company executive, and Mary Simon Gindhart, a music teacher. She went to public schools in Haddonfield and Moorestown, N.J., and earned pocket money picking strawberries for a penny a box.         While still a teen-ager, she married a musician, Arthur Herbert, but he died three years later, leaving her with a daughter to support. She went to work in Philadelphia and took evening courses in merchandising and business administration at the University of Pennsylvania.         She left her job when she married Mr. Roebling, becoming a housewife again until his death.         Over the years, Mrs. Roebling was variously a director of the Tattersall Corporation, the Standard Fire Insurance Company and the Colonial Operating Company, in Trenton, among other concerns; an officer of the New York World's Fair Corporation in 1964 and 1965; a member of the National Business Council on Consumer Affairs and of the Boy Scouts of America's national advisory council, and an active participant in other nonprofit organizations. She was awarded numerous honorary degrees and other honors.         She is survived by a daughter, Betty Hobin of Palm Beach, Fla., and Hopewell Township, N.J.; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren, and a sister, Margaret G. Finley of Haddonfield, N.J. A son, Paul Roebling, died in July.       
         Shirley Chernela, a former administrator of Temple Shaaray Tefila in Manhattan and the first woman to be president of the National Association of Temple Administrators, died Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said Janet Chernela Mount, her daughter.         Ms. Chernela became the administrator of Temple Shaaray Tefila in 1972 and held the job for 20 years. She was president of the national administrators' group from 1982 to 1985. In 1991, she was elected an honorary trustee.         She was the first woman to be certified a Fellow in Temple Administration in a program set up by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the National Association of Temple Administrators.         In the early 1950's, her family joined with three others to found a congregation, Temple Emanuel in Great Neck, L.I., of which she served as administrator. She then became director of personnel and building services at the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, where she remained until joining Temple Shaaray Tefila.         In addition to Ms. Chernela Mount, she is survived by another daughter, Susan Chernilo, and a son, Abbey Chernela, both of New York; a sister, Diane Graf of Southbury, Conn., and a brother, Paul Moss of Hewlett, L.I.       
         Virginia E. Montes, a former national secretary and lobbyist for the National Organization for Women, died Thursday at her home in Atlanta. She was 50.         The cause was a stroke, the Atlanta medical examiner's office said.         Ms. Montes, a native of Honduras, had been active in NOW for 13 years and was the first Latin American woman to serve as a national officer of the organization.         She was elected secretary of NOW and of its national political action committee in 1991 and served until last year. In the spring of 1993 she led the organization's defense of Lani Guinier, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was nominated by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division. The President withdrew the nomination after conservatives criticized Ms. Guinier for papers she had written on ways for blacks to increase their influence in elections.         Earlier, Ms. Montes was involved in NOW's lobbying efforts while serving as its government liaison officer. In two terms on the organization's national board she headed the committee for racial diversity.         Ms. Montes, who was known as Ginny, came to the United States when she was 10 years old. She was a delegate to three Democratic national conventions and frequently lobbied for civil rights groups in the halls of Southern state legislatures. One cause she advocated was the redrawing of election districts to strengthen minority representation.         In 1980 she became director of legislative research for the Southern Regional Council, based in Georgia. For a time she directed the Georgia Housing Coalition, but later returned to the council, where she was a senior consultant.         She also conducted leadership training activities for NOW, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Women's Political Caucus and other groups.         Ms. Montes is survived by a daughter, Rebecca Albury of Atlanta; her mother, Greta Hyde Montes of Tampa, Fla.; two sisters, Greta Montes of Wayne, Pa., and Jacqueline Zaborski of West Palm Beach, Fla., and three brothers, Robert, of Clearwater, Fla., and Ronald and Hiram, both of Tampa.       
         Elenore Hangley, a former executive vice president of the Advertising Council, died on Saturday at the Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, in Englewood, N.J. She was 63 and lived in Cliffside, N.J.         The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Charles.         Mrs. Hangley spent her 30-year career with the Advertising Council, which is responsible for the nation's public service advertising campaigns. At the council, she developed and managed advertising campaigns like the one involving McGruff, the dog who promoted anti-crime activities. She was also responsible for the council's overall operations.         Mrs. Hangley, a native of Union City, N.J., and a graduate of Hunter College, began work at the Advertising Council in 1951. In 1965, she left her position as a radio and television services manager to rear her son. She returned as an advertising campaign manager 12 years later and in 1980 was named director of campaign administration.         In 1982, she was appointed vice president of the council. Seven years later, she was named senior vice president of campaign administration and then, in the same year, was named executive vice president of operations. In 1993, she retired.         At the time of her death, she was the president of the board of directors of Child Find America, which tries to find runaways and missing children, and a member of the steering committee of the National Crime Prevention Council, for which the McGruff anti-crime advertisements were designed.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her son, Charles, of Cliffside, N.J., and her sister, Norma Kramer of New York City.       
         Ella Keats Whiting, an administrator and English literature professor at Wellesley College for 33 years and a great-niece of John Keats, died on Thursday at her home in the Carleton Village retirement community in Bedford, Mass.         She was 98 and died of natural causes, a spokeswoman for Wellesley said.         Ms. Whiting joined the Wellesley faculty in 1928 and became a professor in 1942, specializing in medieval English literature. She was the editor of "The Poems of John Audelay," published in 1931.         She served in several administrative posts before becoming Dean of the College in 1954. During World War II, when the president, Mildred McAfee Horton, went on leave to become the first director of the WAVES, Ms. Whiting shared the responsibilities of the office of the president, heading panels on curriculum and instruction and faculty publications. She retired in 1961.         Ms. Whiting, a native of Somerville, Mass., received a bachelor's degree in economics at Vassar College in 1918 and a master's in English literature at Radcliffe College in 1922. She received a doctorate in medieval English literature from Yale University in 1929.       
         Elizabeth (Biddie) Kramer, a philanthropist who spent most of her life raising millions of dollars for the nation of Israel, died on Monday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         In 1949, Mrs. Kramer and her husband, Benjamin Abrams, the founder and chairman of the Emerson Radio Corporation, visited Israel. At a meeting with Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and Finance Minister Eliezer Kaplan , Mr. Abrams suggested issuing bonds to help finance the new nation.         As a result of that conversation, the Israel Bond Campaign was born.  From its inception and for years after Mr. Abrams's death in 1967, Mrs. Kramer remained deeply involved in the campaign, serving at various times as a co-chairwoman, honoree and fund-raiser. Mark Ruben, executive director for Israel Bonds of the Greater Palm Beaches, credited her with raising tens of millions of dollars for Israel.         Mrs. Kramer was also involved in various educational projects, serving as a member of the board of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and as vice president of the American Friends of the Hebrew University, which bestowed on her the Scopus Award and an honorary doctorate of philosophy in 1984.         She was also the first recipient of the Israel Bond Association's Eleanor Roosevelt Centennial Award for her philanthropic efforts.         A member of Long Island University's board, Mrs. Kramer was a founder of the Benjamin and Elizabeth Abrams Communication Center at the university. She also served on the board of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and as chairwoman of the Women's Division of the United Jewish Appeal in New York City and Palm Beach.         Mrs. Kramer, who survived two other husbands, leaves three daughters, Marjorie Hyman, Geraldine Kory and Cynthia Bernstein, all of New York City; six grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.       
         Margaret A. Hickey, a longtime advocate of women's rights, died on Wednesday in a Tucson, Ariz., nursing home, where she had lived for several years. She was 92 and had been a Tucson resident for more than 20 years.         At her death, Miss Hickey held the title of public affairs editor of Ladies' Home Journal, a position she had held since 1946.         A lawyer who became the owner and operator of a business school in St. Louis, Miss Hickey was prominent in World War II as chairwoman of the Women's Advisory Committee of the national War Manpower Commission, from 1942 to 1945.         At acommittee session in August 1944 she declared that the nation's "magnificent war production" was due to the "hidden army" of women working for victory. But near that war's end, she estimated that at least 500,000 women had lost their jobs as a result of cutbacks, and she called for measures to protect women in the workplace.         After the war, she served on a variety of high-level panels concerned with women's rights and other policy spheres. In January 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her chairwoman of the Advisory Council on the Status of Women. The council had been set up in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy "to assure effective and continuing leadership in advancing the status of women." She headed it until 1966.         Miss Hickey was born in Kansas City, Mo., and earned a law degree from the University of Missouri in 1928.         She married Joseph T. Strubinger in 1935. He died in 1973.       
         Mildred Hilson, a grande dame of New York's charity circuit who entertained royalty and heads of state in her suite at the Waldorf Towers, died yesterday morning at home. She was 96.         She had been in poor health for five years, her granddaughter, Wendy Levey, said.         Even in her later years, Mrs. Hilson possessed a certain mischievous charm. "She lived on chocolate-covered marshmallows," Mrs. Levey said. "She had them hidden all over the house. The only ones who knew where they were were she and my 5-year-old daughter, Mariel."         Mrs. Hilson was the widow of Edwin I. Hilson, an investment banker, who died in 1952. She took his seat on the board of the Hospital for Special Surgery after his death, and five years later was named vice president, a title she held until her death.         As perennial chairwoman of the hospital's annual benefit, Mrs. Hilson raised more than $15 million. The plaza of a new hospital residence was dedicated to her in 1989. That year another of her charities, the New York City division of the American Cancer Society, gave her its humanitarian award. She also received the Sarnoff Award for volunteer service from the women's division of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.         An effective fund-raiser for the Republican Party, Mrs. Hilson lent her name to a series of citizens' committees to elect or re-elect Republican candidates to state and national office.         She was a patron of the arts, serving on the board of the Museum of the City of New York and on the New York City Cultural Council. In the late 1960's she was Mayor John V. Lindsay's unsalaried representative on cultural affairs.         "Don't make me sound all good-workish," she once told an interviewer. "I really so enjoy life. I adore to entertain."         The guest lists for her parties were dazzling. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor were among those who dined in her scarlet drawing room, as were the actor Laurence Olivier, numerous United Nations ambassadors and several American presidents.         President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, who occupied a Towers suite when he was chief United States delegate to the United Nations, returned to visit their friend and neighbor after moving to the White House.         President Dwight D. Eisenhower painted a portrait of Mrs. Hilson that hangs in her study. And in 1988, former President Richard M. Nixon played "Happy Birthday" on the piano at her 90th-birthday gala at the St. Regis while 200 guests sang along.         Mrs. Hilson maintained her interest in politics throughout her life. "Only a year ago, when Mayor Giuliani and his wife, Donna, were dining at my apartment," Mrs. Levey said, "she called and asked to speak to the Mayor and gave him half an hour of her advice on running the city."         A stately, elegant woman almost 6 feet tall, Mrs. Hilson was dressed by several of the great couturiers. In 1989, although bedridden, she was still able to have a preview of the spring collection, when Hubert de Givenchy took one of his models to her apartment for a private showing.  Mrs. Hilson's daughter, Mary Wolf, died in 1987, and her son, John S., in 1991. She is survived, in addition to Mrs. Levey, by four grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Lillian Louise Poses, a lawyer who worked on the New Deal and was long active in public life, died on Sunday in her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 86.         The cause was complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Barbara Poses Kafka.         Mrs. Poses was among the first women to graduate from New York University's law school, her daughter said, and joined the New York bar in 1938, soon after it began admitting women, in 1937.         During President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, she did legal work for several New Deal agencies.         In later years, she had a private practice in labor law representing several large corporations, and was active in the Governors Task Force on Unemployment, the Council Against Poverty, Unesco and the International League of Human Rights.         Mrs. Poses and her husband, Jack I. Poses, were active in philanthropic undertakings, especially in the arts and education.         Mrs. Poses was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from Hunter College in 1927. Her husband died in 1982.         In addition to her daughter, Ms. Kafka, of Manhattan, she is survived by two grandchildren and a brother, Abraham Shapiro, of Manhattan.       
         By all appearances, this was a great year for Alix Gres, the French fashion designer. There was a retrospective of her work held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in September, attended by Yuzo Yagi, the chairman of Yagi Tsusho Ltd., the Japanese company that had bought the rights to her name in 1988 and had sponsored the exhibition. In Japan, the company was promoting her name anew.         And she was being heralded by fellow couturiers like Yves Saint Laurent, who marveled at the show in an interview in Women's Wear Daily. Her daughter, Anne Gres (the name is pronounced greh), provided the fashion industry newspaper with a response she said her mother had dictated on Oct. 9. "Coming from an artist and colleague whom I admire," said an excerpt published on Nov. 1, "I'm greatly touched."         So the fashion world was startled to learn yesterday that Mme. Gres, as she is always called by those in her trade, had been dead for more than a year. Born on Nov. 30, 1903, she died on Nov. 24, 1993, in a retirement home in the south of France, a fact that was carefully hidden by her daughter.         In a front-page story in the French newspaper Le Monde, Anne Gres said she had disguised the death of her mother for the last 13 months for two reasons. "First of all, I looked to protect her," she said. "All those who have profited from her would again find the means to draw on her money." The second reason she gave was respect for the older sister of Mme. Gres, who is still alive. She added that she did not yet have the money to buy the sort of tomb that would dignify her mother's memory. "It made me suffer more," she said about hiding the news. "It is like it didn't happen."         No one knew about Mme. Gres's death until the article appeared. Not her closest friends and peers, Pierre Cardin and Hubert de Givenchy. Not Jacques Mouclier, the head of the Chambre Syndicale, the governing body of French fashion, where she held the title of honorary president for life. Not Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute exhibition, and not even Mr. Yagi, the owner of the rights to her name.         Those interviewed in Paris as the news spread expressed confusion at the charade, which was revealed when Le Monde uncovered a document in a district mayor's office in Paris confirming her death. It was verified in interviews with residents of the home in St.-Paul-de-Vence where Mme. Gres had lived.         For the French fashion industry, where designer names are often bought and sold without consulting the founders, it is an eerie illustration of how a design house can continue on without its progenitor.         Mme. Gres was the last survivor of her generation of couturiers, which included Madeleine Vionnet, Jeanne Lanvin, Elsa Schiaparelli and Gabrielle Chanel. Although some have asked whether there could have been a commercial reason for her daughter's actions, it seems unlikely, given the number of houses in Paris that continue after the designer has died, from Balenciaga to Chanel and Christian Dior, where big-name designers took over the workrooms.         "It is very difficult to express oneself on hearing such a frightening piece of news," Mr. de Givenchy said in a fax. "I was very shocked to learn of the passing of such a 'grande dame' like this one a year too late. Mme. Gres was a person who was very discreet and very humble, and maybe this was her decision."         Her clients, often the people closest to designers who work in couture, as Mme. Gres did, were especially shocked at the news. Sao Schlumberger, who donated a dress to the Costume Institute for the exhibition, said: "It is quite strange. Some time ago I talked with the Duchess of Orleans, who was a customer of hers and a close friend, and she said she went to visit her in an old people's home. And the first time she recognized her, but the last time she didn't recognize her at all."         One reason Mme. Gres was able to fade away was that she was no longer active in her house, which she sold in 1984 to the French industrialist Bernard Tapie. She later told Mr. Cardin that the decision was the worst she had ever made, recalled Bernard Danillon, the communications director for Pierre Cardin. Mr. Cardin had tried to stay in touch with Mme. Gres, Mr. Danillon said, but "every time that anyone asks about Mme. Gres to Jacques Mouclier, the answer was given by her daughter, and she said always, 'Mme. Gres wants to be quiet, she doesn't want to be disturbed, she doesn't want to talk to anybody.' "         "After years and years of getting this answer, you don't call again," Mr. Danillon said. "You respect someone's wish."         At the Costume Institute, Mr. Martin said he had made two attempts to contact Mme. Gres, one when the show was in the planning stage, the other when it was ready to open, inviting her to come. "We took the Women's Wear Daily response as being the sure indication that Mme. Gres was aware of the show," Mr. Martin said. "Maybe you wouldn't have told people if you were reclusive, but to create a fiction, a fabrication of her being alive? I don't even understand what the purpose would be."         Everyone who wrote about the exhibition discussed the designer in the present tense. Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times: "A nonagenarian, she is one of the great female designers who dominated haute couture in Paris until after World War II, when the men took over."         Those who admire her work are feeling haunted, having missed a long mourning period.         "It gives me goose bumps," said Susan Gutfreund, a client of Mme.  Gres who also shared a Paris hairdresser with her. She last saw her four years ago. "Her daughter must have had a reason to hide it, but I find it very sad," she said.         One of the reasons for the deception may have been the resentment that Anne Gres indicated to Le Monde over the way the French fashion industry had reacted in 1987, when her mother's couture house was liquidated after rent on her atelier went unpaid for two years. "No one did anything," Anne Gres said, when wooden mannequins, toiles and partly finished dresses were thrown into trash bags.         The house was emptied in a day. "That day there, she had paid in full, because they had stolen her life," she said.         In 1988, the house was bought by Mr. Yagi. Her daughter condemned the fashion professionals yesterday in Le Monde. "Mme. Gres is the Bosnia of couture," she said, always speaking in the present tense. "Except for Pierre Cardin and Hubert de Givenchy, who has tried to help her?"         Mme. Gres's death is remarkable in the way its secrecy mirrors her life. In interviews throughout her career, she refused to reveal her age, her parents' backgrounds (her grandparents were said to be Italian and German) or even her real name. Gres was the name taken by her husband, Serge Czerefkow, a Russian painter she married in the 30's. She was born Germaine Krebs, then changed her name to Alix Barton. The Metropolitan Museum's catalogue told her life story simply: "Mme. Gres is a creation," it said.         Trained as a sculptor, she began designing clothes in 1930 after learning sketching and cutting at the house of Premet. She then worked for a house called, coincidentally, Alix. During World War II, she started her own house, called Gres, one of only 20 that stayed open throughout the war.         By the 1950's, Mme. Gres had fully developed what became her signature. She devoted herself early on to draping, and even her name began to evoke images of Grecian dress. Soon she was dressing the society women who became devoted to her, and wives of heads of state, including Princess Grace, Jacqueline Kennedy and Danielle Mitterrand.         "Mme. Gres is one of the most important 20th-century designers," Mr. Martin said of his decision to hold a retrospective of her work. "Along with Vionnet and Chanel, Mme. Gres was making the most advanced clothing in Paris in the 1930's."         It was not until 1980 that Mme. Gres showed a ready-to-wear line, 10 years after her peers had done so.         In an interview with Women's Wear Daily in 1975, she said: "From the beginning, I didn't want to do what others were doing in any way. I wasn't able to, because I didn't have the knowledge. That was one reason I took the material and worked directly on it. I used the knowledge I had, which was sculpture."       
         Catherine Filene Shouse, the philanthropist and arts patron who was the founder and major benefactor of the Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts in Virginia, died yesterday at her home in Naples, Fla. She was 98 and also had homes in Washington, Easton, Md., and Vienna, Va., where Wolf Trap is situated.         The cause of death was heart failure, said Carol Harford, a longtime friend who is president emeritus of the Wolf Trap Foundation, which presents the park's arts programs under the auspices of the Department of the Interior.         Mrs. Shouse, the heiress to a retailing fortune, was a lifelong champion of the performing arts whose accomplishments and philanthropic ventures earned recognition from the highest quarters. In 1977, President Gerald Ford gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A year earlier, Queen Elizabeth II had made her Dame Commander of the British Empire. This past October, she was among 12 Americans to receive the National Medal of Arts.         Catherine Filene was born in Boston in 1896. Her grandfather, William Filene, was the founder of the Filene's department-store chain, and her father, Lincoln Filene, founded Federated Department Stores. She graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., in 1918, and earned a master's degree in education at Harvard University in 1923.         Over seven decades, Mrs. Shouse held a remarkable variety of public and private posts. In 1919, she became the first woman appointed to the Democratic National Committee, and in the mid-1920's, she served under President Calvin Coolidge as chairwoman of the First Federal Prison for Women, where she instituted a job training and rehabilitation program.         In the 1940's, she became a dog breeder, importing hunting dogs from Germany and Switzerland and starting her own kennel at Wolf Trap Farm, a tract of land across the Potomac River, 15 miles west of Washington, that she had purchased in 1930.         In 1949, she joined the National Symphony Orchestra's board, and she served as its vice president from 1951 through 1968. In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her to the first board of the National Cultural Center, now known as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to which she was reappointed twice by President Richard M. Nixon. As late as 1991, she was invited by the Yale School of Music to serve on its board.         Mrs. Shouse's most lasting legacy, however, is Wolf Trap. In 1966, at the age of 70, she donated 100 acres of the farm in Vienna to the United States Government to create a national park for the performing arts. There, under the auspices of the Department of the Interior, Mrs. Shouse established the Wolf Trap Foundation to manage the park, arrange programming and raise money, a unique partnership among the public and private sectors for managing an arts center. The park opened in 1971 and since then has been home to performances by some of the world's great musicians, dancers, singers and actors.         In 1982, the main amphitheater burned to the ground, but Mrs. Shouse led the drive to resurrect it, and a new theater, the 7,000-seat Filene Center (half the $18 million cost came from a Congressional appropriation), opened in 1984. It is now visited by some 500,000 people annually.         During her last decade, Mrs. Shouse, who was known to her friends as Kay, suffered from arthritis but remained a familiar figure at Wolf Trap, touring the grounds in a golf cart.         She was married twice, in 1921, to Alvin E. Dodd, a businessman from whom she was divorced in 1930. Two years later, she married Jouett Shouse, the chairman of the Democratic National Executive Committee. Shouse, a lawyer and businessman, had been a Congressman from Kansas and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Coolidge. He died in 1967.         Mrs. Shouse is survived by a daughter, Joan Dodd Tolley of Naples, four grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Moton Hubbard, who was deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs from 1964 to 1970, making her the top-ranking black woman in the Johnson Administration at the time, died on Sunday at her home in Chevy Chase, Md. She was 82.         Ms. Hubbard, who retired in 1970 at the onset of Cushing's disease, an adrenal disorder, died of congestive heart failure, said Marc L. Alper of Rockview, Md., a family friend.         In her State Department post, she worked at developing programs intended to eliminate discrimination against black soldiers during the Vietnam War. She also oversaw the department's public services and news offices.         During World War II, she worked for the Federal Security Agency, helping to organize arrangements for war workers and was a race and human relations consultant. She joined the State Department in 1963 as a coordinator of women's activities.         The daughter of a pioneer in the civil rights movement, Dr. Robert Russa Moton, she grew up on the campus of Tuskegee Institute, where her father had succeeded its founder, Booker T. Washington, as president. She was educated at Boston University.         Her husband, Maceo W. Hubbard, a Justice Department official, died in 1991. She is survived by two sisters, Catherine Patterson of Exeter, N.H., and Jennie Moton Taylor of Indianapolis.       
         Frances Prince Schuman, the founding chairwoman of the National Friends of Public Broadcasting and the wife of the composer William Schuman, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         She died after a brief illness, said her son, Anthony.         Mrs. Schuman was the founder and first chairwoman of the Friends of Thirteen and the National Friends of Public Broadcasting, and served for many years on the board of WNET Channel 13. With the director John Houseman she guided the development of the Acting Company, a theater group of drama graduates that her husband established when he was the president of the Juilliard School.         Mrs. Schuman, known as Frankie, was born in New York City in 1913 and graduated from Barnard College. Her early career was in social services, with a focus on people with disabilities. She was a staff member of the New York State Employment Service and a director of the Vocational Advisory Service. She was a founding director of the Cerebral Palsy Association and the Urban League of Westchester County, and at the time of her death was on the boards of the MacDowell Colony and the American Composers Orchestra.         In addition to her son, of Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Andrea, of Newton Highlands, Mass., and a grandson, Joshua Weiss.       
         Jean Ickelheimer Stralem, a New York philanthropist and art collector, died on Tuesday at her Manhattan home. She was 86 and lived on the Upper East Side.         She suffered a long illness, said Lillian Groueff, her former sister-in-law.         Mrs. Stralem, who was born into the Lehman investment banking family, devoted much of her life to the blind and to children with multiple handicaps. One of her principal beneficiaries was the Lighthouse, with which she had a 56-year relationship.         She became a member in 1938, was elected to the board in 1948 and was made vice president in 1973. She also served as vice chairman and continued as an active board member until her death. In the 1950's, she was instrumental in finding community locations for Lighthouse nursery schools.         She began to press for a comprehensive child-development center as early as 1964, and with expansion and renovations at the Lighthouse in 1994, a Jean Stralem Child Development Center was dedicated on her birthday in October.         She often participated in fund-raising benefits, particulary for the American Theater Wing. She was a former board member and officer of the Theater Wing. Other beneficiaries of her philanthropy included Lenox Hill Hospital.         Her private collection included works by Picasso, Matisse, Degas and Renoir, as well as rare first-edition children's books and miniature furniture. Her grandfather, Philip Lehman, was the original owner of the Lehman Art Collection that is now part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Her husband, Donald Stralem, a New York banker, died in 1976.         Mrs. Stralem is survived by a daughter, Lynn Stralem of Carmel, Calif.; two granddaughters and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 24, 1994, Saturday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Thursday about Jean Ickelheimer Stralem, a New York philanthropist and art collector, misstated her relationship with the American Theater Wing. Mrs. Stralem, who died on Tuesday, was a current and active officer and board member -- not a former one -- at her death.       
         Helen Payne Wilshire Walsh, who for decades worked on behalf of the disabled, died on Monday in Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. A resident of Greenwich, she was 97.         Mrs. Walsh suffered a long illness, said her niece, Helen Payne Clarke, also of Greenwich.         To Fairfield County, Mrs. Walsh was a matriarch of Republican politics and a doyenne of society. But she was known internationally for her work with the disabled, traveling the world to speak, raise funds and visit hospitals and refugee camps.         She was a friend of former President George Bush, at one time a Greenwich resident, who appointed her to a three-year term on the National Council on Disability in 1990 when she was 92. The panel drafts legislation on behalf of the disabled.         "Of all the people who gave of themselves to the political process," Mr. Bush said from his office in Houston, "Helen Walsh ranks right up there with those I admired the most." She was, he said, a "revered friend and an inspiration to me in both my private and public life."         Over the years, Mrs. Walsh worked inside many institutions and organizations, including the Institute of Rehabilitative Medicine of New York University Medical Center. She served as president of Rehabilitation International USA and vice president of Rehabilitation International, a worldwide volunteer agency.         President Richard M. Nixon named her to his National Advisory Council of Vocational Rehabilitation in the early 1970's.         She received the 1972 Howard A. Rusk Award from the Institute for Rehabilitative Medicine.         She was vice chairman of the Republican Town Committee and a member of the party's State Central and Finance Committees.         Helen Payne was born in 1897 in Cincinnati. She came to Greenwich in 1932 with her first husband, Joseph Wilshire, a future chairman of Standard Brands. He died in 1951, and in 1968 she married William Walsh, a political consultant, who died in 1983.         Mrs. Walsh is survived by a stepson, William James Walsh, of Princeton, N.J., and two step-grandsons, Joseph W. Wilshire 4th of Goshen, Conn., and Van H. Wilshire of Greenwich.       
         Rose Wells Bing, a fashion consultant who was instrumental in bringing the ideas and trends of Europe to American consumers, died on Wednesday in Beth Israel Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, said her grandson, Jonathan Bing of Manhattan.         Known for an eye as sharp as her opinions, she was a front-row observer to the major fashion shows in Europe as well as in Manhattan, watching for trends that major retailers could adapt into affordable clothes.         At her death, she was a consultant for the Gap, noted for her regular patrols of its outlets to check on merchandising operations. Until the day before she died, she was reporting to work early in the morning.         She began her career at Ohrbach's, helping to incorporate European designs into the store's high-volume clothing lines. In 1959, she was elected the store's vice president, the first woman to hold that position at Ohrbach's.         She broke another barrier in 1965, when she became the first woman to be named vice president at Federated Department Stores. At Federated, she was an adviser on trends and new ideas in the industry. She joined the Gap in 1974.         Besides her grandson, she is survived by a son, Richard, of Manhattan, and three brothers, Jack Wells of Beverly Hills, Calif., Louis of San Mateo, Calif., and Irving of Long Island.       
         Elizabeth Glaser, who waged a tireless campaign to draw attention to pediatric AIDS after she unknowingly passed the disease on to her daughter and son, died yesterday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said Josh Baran, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Glaser, the wife of Paul Michael Glaser, a director and actor who starred in the "Starsky and Hutch" television series, was one of several public figures to bring AIDS to the forefront of the 1992 Presidential campaign. She had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion in 1981.         Thousands of delegates, dignitaries and guests stood frozen in place at the Democratic National Convention in New York City as she told of the death of her 7-year-old daughter, Ariel, in 1988 from AIDS.         "She taught me to love when all I wanted to do was hate," Mrs. Glaser said. "She taught me to help others when all I wanted to do was help myself."         In a statement yesterday, President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, said they were deeply saddened by her death. "Elizabeth confronted the challenge of AIDS in her own life and lost her beloved daughter to AIDS at a time when our Government and our country were too indifferent to this illness and the people who had it," he said.         Mrs. Glaser, a former teacher, was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus when she was nine months pregnant with Ariel, her first child. She began bleeding and was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she received seven pints of blood in a transfusion.         The baby was delivered successfully but four years later, became seriously ill. Hospital tests found her red blood count low, and she was later tested with the other members of the family for H.I.V.         Mrs. Glaser tested positive, and doctors found she had passed the virus to Ariel through her breast milk. She had also given the virus to her son, Jake, during pregnancy. Mr. Glaser remained uninfected.         Jake, now 10, has shown no signs that he has developed AIDS.         In 1988, drawing on connections made through her husband, Mrs. Glaser helped to found the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with two friends, Susan DeLaurentis and Susan Zeegen.         The foundation, working out of a donated room with 14 desks and 12 employees, has raised more than $30 million for pediatric education and research, much of it for the Ariel Project, which is searching for ways to block transmission of AIDS from a mother to her fetus.         The foundation is also studying why some children infected with H.I.V. live longer than others.         After she and her husband first described the family's fight with the virus in a magazine story in 1989, Mrs. Glaser became a public crusader for more Government involvement in AIDS research and prevention. She appeared on "60 Minutes" and on the cover of People magazine. She also testified before Congress.         In 1991, she wrote an autobiography, "In The Absence of Angels" (G. P. Putnam's Sons), with Laura Palmer, describing her frustration with the dearth of information on children suffering from AIDS. The book, which was called "a handbook on how the connected make waves in America" in a review in The New York Times, also detailed how she was able to mobilize legislators like Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who sponsored a benefit in Washington for Mrs. Glaser's fledgling foundation.         While she used her celebrity status to further her work, she also promoted her cause through sheer force of will. She was chosen to speak at the 1992 convention only after confronting Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, Mickey Kantor, now the United States Trade Representative, at a Los Angeles picnic, and telling him, "I have words inside me that I have to share."         Elizabeth Glaser was born in New York City and raised in Hewlett Harbor, L.I. She was educated at the University of Wisconsin and at Boston University and worked as a teacher and as a director at the Los Angeles Children's Museum.         She is survived by her husband and son; by her parents, Edith and Max Meyer of Sarasota, Fla., and by a brother, Peter, of Worcester, Mass.       
         Elizabeth Glaser, who waged a tireless campaign to draw attention to pediatric AIDS after she unknowingly passed the disease on to her daughter and son, died yesterday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said Josh Baran, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Glaser, the wife of Paul Michael Glaser, a director and actor who starred in the "Starsky and Hutch" television series, was one of several public figures to bring AIDS to the forefront of the 1992 Presidential campaign. She had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion in 1981.         Thousands of delegates, dignitaries and guests stood frozen in place at the Democratic National Convention in New York City as she told of the death of her 7-year-old daughter, Ariel, in 1988 from AIDS.

         Aminda Badeau Wilkins, a retired welfare official and the widow of Roy Wilkins, longtime executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center. She was 89 and lived in Jamaica, Queens.         She suffered a brief illness, said Mildred Roxboro, director of development of the N.A.A.C.P.         Born in St. Louis, Mrs. Wilkins trained at the University of Chicago and started her career with a Chicago settlement house and doing case work in St. Louis. After her marriage to Mr. Wilkins in 1929, she moved to New York City and became a supervisor in the Department of Welfare.         She later carried out special projects for the commissioner and served as director of community relations. President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the National Advisory Council on Extension and Continuing Education, and she served on the Department of Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Armed Forces. She retired in 1971 as an assistant commissioner in the city's Department of Welfare.         Mr. Wilkins died in 1981.
