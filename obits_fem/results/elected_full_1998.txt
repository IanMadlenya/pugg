         Dr. Jean Trepp McKelvey, who hurdled gender barriers in the field of labor-management mediation and opened the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, died on Jan. 5 at the Kirkhaven Nursing Home in her hometown of Rochester. She was 89.         She taught at Sarah Lawrence College for 13 years until 1946, when Cornell formed the new branch on its Ithaca, N.Y., campus and appointed her as its first faculty member. She wrote the curriculum for the school and taught courses in arbitration, labor law and labor practices.         She assumed emeritus status in 1976 but continued to teach and coordinate the school's off-campus graduate credit courses given under extension programs in Albany, Corning, Elmira, Rochester and Syracuse. In a tribute to her and another faculty member, the school, known by its initials, I.L.R., established its first endowed chair in 1994 and named it the Jean McKelvey-Alice Grant Professorship of Labor Management Relations.         Many of her former students went on to fill influential positions as union leaders, arbitrators and jurists. The year after she arrived at Cornell, she became a charter member -- and the sole woman at the time -- in the National Academy of Arbitrators. In 1970, she was the first woman to be elected president of the academy and, mindful of the overwhelming preponderance of men in her metier, came up with an arbitration training program for women.         Outside the classroom, Dr. McKelvey was a sought-after arbitrator for the airline industry as well as other sectors of the economy. Gov. W. Averell Harriman named her to the  State Board of Mediation in 1955, and she served on it for 11 years, helping settle thorny disputes like a wholesale butchers' strike in 1961.         President Richard M. Nixon appointed her to the Federal Services Impasses Panel in 1970, and she remained on it until eight years ago. At her death, she was still a member of the Public Review Board of the United Automobile Workers.         She was the author of many papers and books and edited the proceedings of several annual meetings of the National Academy of Arbitrators. Among her books were ''Cleared for Takeoff: Airline Labor Relations Since Deregulation'' (I.L.R. Press, 1988), ''The Changing Law of Fair Representation'' (I.L.R., 1985), ''New Challenges to Arbitration'' (I.L.R., 1977) and ''A.F.L. Attitudes Toward Production, 1900-1932'' (Greenwood, 1974).         She was born Jean Trepp in St. Louis and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley College in 1929. She received her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Radcliffe College in 1931 and 1933 and joined the Sarah Lawrence faculty in the year between. During World War II, she was a hearing officer and arbitrator for the National War Labor Board.         She is survived by her husband of 63 years, Blake McKelvey, Rochester's city historian emeritus, and a brother, Richard Trepp of Springfield, Mass.       
         Dr. Gertrude Scharff Goldhaber, a physicist who contributed to scientists' understanding of nuclear fission and the structure of atomic nuclei, died on Monday at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in Patchogue, N.Y. She was 86 and lived at Bayport on Long Island.         Dr. Goldhaber was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and retired as a senior scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory.         She was credited with the discovery that spontaneous fission is associated with the emission of neutrons. She made that observation in 1942 when she was a research physicist at the University of Illinois, but it was classified top secret and not announced until after World War II.         Dr. Goldhaber added to the knowledge of the structure of the nucleus when she found regularities in nuclear excited states. She also worked in areas that included long-lived isomers (different versions of elements) and heavy ions (positively and negatively charged atoms or molecules).         In 1948, she and her husband, Dr. Maurice Goldhaber, determined that  beta rays were identical with electrons, which settled an argument among their peers.         She was elected a fellow of the American Physics Society in 1947 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1980, and to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1972.         Born in Mannheim, Germany, she earned a doctoral degree at the University of Munich in 1935 and moved to England to do research at Imperial College in London.         She did research and taught at the University of Illinois from 1939 to 1950, when she became the first woman with a Ph.D. in physics on the Brookhaven faculty.         Dr. Goldhaber founded the Brookhaven Lecture Series in 1960. She was a co-founder of Brookhaven Women in Science, which furthers the advancement of women scientists and began in 1979. She retired from Brookhaven in 1977 but returned in 1985 as a research collaborator, an association she continued until 1990.         Over the years, she was an adjunct professor at Cornell University and the Johns Hopkins University. She also was an adviser and consultant  at the National Research Council, the National Science Foundation and many other scientific bodies.         Besides her husband of 59 years, she is survived by two sons, both theoretical physicists, Dr. Alfred Goldhaber of Setauket, N.Y., and Dr. Michael Goldhaber of Oakland, Calif.; a sister, Liselotte Leoni of Nice, France, and two grandchildren.         In 1984, the Phi Beta Kappa society selected her as a Visiting Scholar, an honor that sent her to eight campuses for the year. In an interview at the time with The New York Times, she said that her path into science had been clear because she fell in love with numbers at the age of 4 and decided to study physics and mathematics as a teen-ager in Munich.         She declined to settle for the future of a high school teacher, as other  girls with similar interests might have, or a lawyer, as her father wanted, she said.         ''I said, 'I'm not interested in the law,' '' she recalled. ''I wanted to understand what the world is made of. That actually turned out to be a good thing because when the Nazis came -- I'm Jewish -- I had to leave the country, and physics was something that could be done anywhere.''       
         Rene  de Epelbaum, a founder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo human rights group and one of its most dynamic members, died on Saturday at age 77.         Her colleagues said she had suffered a heart attack.         In 1977, during its crackdown on leftists, the military dictatorship that ran Argentina at the time abducted her three adult children, Luis, Lila, and Claudio, and presumably killed them. Mrs. Epelbaum offered her home as a meeting place for mothers who had suffered the same plight.         Soon after, in open defiance of the junta, the group of mothers began holding weekly protests in the main Government square, the Plaza de Mayo. Today, the protests at the Plaza de Mayo are still held every Thursday as the elderly mothers don their trademark white head scarfs with the names of missing children scrawled in ink.         A Government commission found in the mid-1980's that at least 9,000 people had been killed or disappeared during the right-wing military Government's crackdown on political opponents. Human rights advocates contend that the number of victims was closer to 30,000.         Mrs. Epelbaum, who once taught literature, was a fearless, outspoken critic of the military Government. Her writings, speeches, and trips abroad helped earn the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo international acclaim. She also is credited with bringing worldwide attention to the atrocities of Argentina's military regime, which reliquinshed power in 1983.         ''I remember the first time she gave a press conference in Canada and spoke against the dictatorship,'' said Laura Bonaparte, another member of her group. ''They told her to be careful because she could be killed when she returned to Argentina. Epelbaum replied: 'What is important to me is what we do today, not what will happen tommorrow.' ''         Mrs. Epelbaum was greatly troubled by President Carlos Saul Menem's decision in 1989 to pardon senior military officers accused of human rights abuses. The democratically elected Government said the move was essential for national reconciliation.         ''It is a true moral aberration that leaves in liberty those who violated human dignity and those who rose up against the constitutional order,'' Mrs. Epelbaum said.         Alfredo Bravo, an opposition Congressman whose party has proposed a bill to rescind the military amnesty, said of Mrs. Epelbaum, who leaves no immediate survivors, ''It hurts me deeply that as a Congressman, I have not been able to repair her pain, at least in part, with the abolition of these amnesty decrees.''       
         Hilda Ginsburg Schwartz, a retired justice of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who was a mentor and role model for many female lawyers, died on March 18 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 90 and lived in Greenwich Village.         She was among the first women to reach the New York bench at any level and was a judge for 24 years after a stint as the city's Director of Finance. She served on the city's Magistrates Court and Civil Court and she retired from the State Supreme Court in 1983 at 76.         A native New Yorker, she graduated from New York University and, in 1929, from its law school. She joined 9 other women in 1934 to found what is now the 2,000-member Women's Bar Association of the State of New York, and served as its president.         Mayor William O'Dwyer appointed her secretary of the New York City Board of Estimate in 1946, and his successor, Vincent R. Impellitteri, put her on the Magistrates Court in 1951. She served until 1958, when Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her city treasurer.         In 1962, she became the city's first Director of Finance. In 1965, Mayor Wagner made her a Civil Court judge and she won election to a 10-year term the next year. She was elected a State Supreme Court justice in 1971.         During her tenure as Director of Finance, she created an important indicator of the city's economic health, the New York City Excise Tax Guide, as a resource for businesses, lawyers and individual taxpayers, as well as for the city administration. It compiled data, regulations, laws and source materials culled from the city's excise taxes.         Her husband of 52 years, Herman N. Schwartz, died in 1982.         She is survived by a son, John M., and a sister, Edith Smolen, both of Manhattan.       
         Baroness Lestor of Eccles, a crusading British politician who spoke out against apartheid in defiance of her Government's policies and who struck a blow on behalf of single mothers when she won the right to adopt two children on her own, died in a hospice in London on Friday. She was 66 and had been suffering from motor neurone disease.         Lady Lestor had two great causes in her life: the fight against racism and the fight for the rights of children, and was never afraid to criticize her party when she disagreed with its policies.         She was briefly chairman of the Labor Party in 1977-78 and served as a junior minister in several Labor Governments in the early 1970's, but was perhaps too uncompromising in her beliefs to rise to a higher office. She was, an admirer once said, ''the heart and soul of the Labor Party.''         Joan Lestor was born on Nov. 13, 1931, in Vancouver, British Columbia, to parents steeped in the international labor movement. Her mother, Esther, had been a machinist in a textile factory in East London who, as a teen-ager, became a shop steward for the garment workers' union; her father, Charles, a journalist and actor, was a leading member of the Canadian Socialist Party and later, when the family returned to England, of the Socialist Party of Great Britain.         Ms. Lestor graduated from London University with a diploma in sociology and went to work as a nursery school teacher, opening a nursery school in her own home six years later. At the same time she pursued a career in politics. Disillusioned by what she considered the extremism of her father's party, she joined Labor at the age of 24, won several local elections and was elected to Parliament in 1966. She remained there, with a four-year break, until 1997.         She immediately threw herself into the issues that consumed her, introducing a bill to tighten regulations on nursery schools and providers of child care; fighting the Government's attempt to stop paying social security benefits to unwed mothers, and working to insure that abandoned wives could obtain financial support from their husbands.         She was passionate about the rights of abused children, saying in a 1989 debate that while it was necessary to ''strike a balance'' between the rights of children and the rest of the family, ''in my book, the rights of the children are paramount.''         Her jobs in the Labor Governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan often became jeopardized by the rigor of her principles. In 1974, when she was appointed a junior minister in the Foreign Office with special responsibility for African affairs, she earned the nickname ''the African Queen'' and repeatedly clashed with her superiors over her strong anti-apartheid views.         Ms. Lestor was then moved to a ministerial job in the Education Department. But she resigned after a year in protest over spending cuts that threatened the jobs of thousands of teachers and forced the postponement of her goal to change the age when students left state-financed secondary schools to 16, from 15.         With the Conservatives in power through the 1980's and into the 1990's, Ms. Lestor worked as the opposition's chief spokeswoman on a number of issues, including children and the family, juvenile crime and race relations. She resigned from her last opposition post, as spokeswoman for overseas development, in 1996, saying that she was too ill to continue.         In 1997 she was made a Baroness and elevated to the House of Lords.         A flamboyant, warmhearted woman who listed her hobbies in Who's Who as ''playing with children and animals,'' Lady Lestor relished adversarial politics and was not shy about telling people what she thought, in the plainest possible language.         When she heard that Rupert Allason, a fellow Member of Parliament and an espionage expert, was about to accuse her publicly of spying for the K.G.B., she confronted him and showered him with invective. ''Perhaps I used words no lady should,'' she conceded later.         She was married briefly as a teen-ager in 1948, but the marriage was dissolved and she never remarried. She wanted children, nonetheless, and fought for the right to adopt them herself, despite being single.         When she won her case, she cried with happiness, and went on to adopt her son, David, in 1967, and her daughter, Susan, in 1969. She loved being a grandmother, and caused roars of laughter in Parliament when she announced, in a wicked nod at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who had grandly used the royal ''we'' in noting the birth of her first grandchild, that ''we too became a grandmother.''         When she received her peerage, she said she celebrated by baking muffins for her grandchildren; having them, she said, was ''even better than being in love.''       
         Joanne Eve Lukomnik, a consultant and lifelong advocate of community health services who was also active in national professional and policy-making health groups, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 51.         The cause was complications from multiple myeloma, her family said.         Over the years, Dr. Lukomnik held teaching, medical and administrative positions at Columbia University's School of Public Health, the United States Public Health Service, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Jersey City Family Health Center, among others.         She was on many committees and boards of the American Public Health Association and was elected chairwoman in 1995. Her other associations included the National Conference on Primary Care, sponsored jointly by the Federal Public Health Service and the Kellogg, Kaiser and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations. She was also a member of the editorial board of The Journal of the American Medical Women's Association.         She was raised in the Bronx, studied sociology and anthropology at Reed College, and graduated with a degree in fine arts from New York University in 1969. She took premedical studies at Columbia and received her M.D. in 1975 from the State University Health Science Center in Stony Brook, N.Y..         She held a master's degree in public health from Columbia, and she studied sociology at the University of Edinburgh and social medicine at the Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem.         Dr. Lukomnik is survived by her husband, Len Rodberg; two children, Simon and Josie Rodberg of Manhattan; her mother, Mary Lukomnik of the Bronx, and her brothers, David and Jon Lukomnik, both of Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Stickney, who created the role of the mother in ''Life with Father'' and also appeared in many other Broadway hits during a career that spanned more than 50 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 101.         ''Life with Father,'' by Howard Lindsay (Miss Stickney's husband) and Russel Crouse, opened at the Empire Theater on Nov. 8, 1939. When it closed after seven years and 3,224 performances, it was -- and it still is today -- the longest running nonmusical show in Broadway history. The Lindsays, who were among the most celebrated acting couples in the United States, played the leading roles of Clarence and Vinnie Day for five years. Based on Clarence Day's reminiscences about his youth in New York in the 1880's, the play told the story of a large family, led by a frequently exasperated father tempered by his charming wife who put up with all his crotchets.         The play was turned down by Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne and many other stars. Finally it was tried out in summer stock at the Lakewood Theater in Skowhegan, Me., with Mr. Lindsay and Miss Stickney thrust into the leading roles. As Miss Stickney said: ''We weren't at all sure we were good enough for the parts. We had never originally intended to play them ourselves.''         Success in summer stock eventually led to Broadway, and opening night was filled with minor disasters. In the first scene the actress playing the maid accidentally dropped a tray of dishes, and, later, several actors forgot their lines. As Miss Stickney remembered, she and her husband went home and cried: ''Little did we realize that the play would last through World War II.''         Mr. Lindsay attributed the phenomenal success to the fact that the play was not just a comedy but also had a tender, familial side: ''People who see 'Life with Father' are emotionally moved as well as amused. They see so much of themselves in the characters on the stage. Booth Tarkington summed it up well when he said the play is in reality 'promptings to memory.' ''         At the heart of the play -- and of its tenderness -- was Miss Stickney's performance as the wise and patient mother, Vinnie, who was understanding without being overly sentimental. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson said her portrait was ''brilliant acting, both sweet and witty, with a supple response to the storminess of her domestic economy.''         The Lindsays returned to their roles in 1947 -- when the play set a record of 3,183 performances -- staying in the cast for several weeks. The following year, they played the Days again, in the sequel, ''Life with Mother,'' and that play ran for a year. When the original Empire Theater (where both plays first opened) was demolished in 1953, the couple salvaged two red plush orchestra seats and placed them in their elegant East Side town house.         Miss Stickney was born in Dickinson, N.D. Her father, Victor Hugo Stickney, a doctor who made calls on horseback, was one of the first 10 members elected to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. Stage-struck from an early age, she studied at the North Western Dramatic School in Minneapolis, sang and danced as one of the four ''Southern Belles'' in vaudeville and acted with various stock companies. When she came to New York in the 1920's, she was turned down for so many roles that she wrote a poem about the experience. The poem, called ''You're Not the Type,'' was published in Liberty magazine and was the beginning of her sideline literary career.         For two summers she was the featured ingenue in summer stock at the Lakewood Theater, then returned to New York to look for work. In New York, she met Mr. Lindsay, who was writing vaudeville sketches. When he was hired to direct the next summer at Lakewood, he was told he could choose his own company, except for the ingenue, a role reserved for the popular Miss Stickney. They were married in 1927.         After making her Broadway debut in 1926 in a small role in ''The Squall,'' she soon became known for playing eccentric characters and was in one hit after another. She was  Liz, a mad scrub woman, in ''Chicago,'' the first Broadway show directed by George Abbott. In ''The Front Page,'' she created the role of Mollie Molloy, the woman who jumps out an open courthouse window. That was followed by George Kelly's ''Philip Goes Forth,'' Rose Franken's ''Another Language'' (her first important role), Paul Osborn's ''On Borrowed Time'' and many other plays. She was a character actress who had become a star.         At the same time, as playwright and director, her husband was himself enjoying halcyon days. He and Mr. Crouse had collaborated on the book for ''Anything Goes'' and other musicals, before they began writing their adaptation of the Clarence Day stories.         After ''Life with Father,'' Miss Stickney was in, among other plays, ''The Small Hours,'' ''To Be Continued,'' ''Kind Sir'' and ''The Honeys.'' Her films included ''The Little Minister'' and ''I Never Sang for My Father.'' On television she played a bootlegger in the first episode of ''The Waltons.''         As an admirer of Edna St. Vincent Millay, she wrote ''A Lovely Light,'' a one-woman play based on Millay's poetry and letters. As with ''Life with Father,'' she tried it out in summer stock before bringing it to Broadway in 1960, in a production directed by her husband. The actress toured the show at colleges and universities and later brought it back to Broadway. In 1967, she did a revival of ''Life with Father'' at City Center, with Leon Ames as co-star.         Her husband died in 1968. No immediate family members survive.         In 1973, Miss Stickney returned to the stage and made her Broadway musical debut in ''Pippin,'' taking over the role of Berthe after the death of Irene Ryan. She sang one song, ''No Time at All.'' Previously, she had been in several musicals on television. She and her husband played the king and queen in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella'' in 1957, and in 1968 she appeared in Stephen Sondheim's ''Evening Primrose.''         In her 1979 memoir, ''Openings and Closings,'' Miss Stickney, who seemed to be the most quietly confident actress onstage, wrote about her lifelong battle with stage fright. She said she had learned one lesson: ''When panic overtook me and I felt absolutely unable to go on, I would tell myself, 'You don't have to do the whole play -- you don't even have to play the next scene -- all you have to do is say the next line.' '' Although she never fully conquered that fear, she was always able to say the next line and the next line, and in so doing found a lifetime of accomplishment in the theater.       
         Beatrice Snyder, a co-founder and former executive of Biocraft Laboratories, a maker of generic pharmaceuticals, died June 21 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Cliffside Park, N.J.         The cause of death was complications from emphysema, said Harold Snyder, her husband.         The Snyders started Biocraft Laboratories, which specialized in generic antibiotics, in Fair Lawn, N.J., in 1964. Ms. Snyder, who headed the financial operations of the company and was responsible for developing the inventory system, held the titles of senior vice president and secretary. Mr. Snyder was chairman and chief executive. Eventually, all three of the couple's children worked in the company.         Biocraft, which Mr. Snyder said became the first generic pharmaceutical company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1985, had annual sales of $150 million when it was bought by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1996. Ms. Snyder was elected to the Teva board.         Ms. Snyder graduated from Hunter College in 1945 with a bachelor's degree in statistics.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Beryl Snyder Trost, and two sons, Brian and Jay, all of New York, and five grandchildren.       
         Pauline Julien, who sang songs of passion and of tender love, died on Wednesday in Montreal. The chanteuse, who was 70, was most strongly identified with the songs she sang in the cause of a separate and independent Quebec.         Ms. Julien took her own life at her home after leaving a note saying she did not want to be revived, said her sister, Fabienne Julien. She said the singer suffered from aphasia, a condition that severely limits the power to use or understand words, and had grown despondent as the disease progressed.         In a singing career that spanned more than 35 years and two continents, Ms. Julien became a beloved figure to French-speaking audiences who were touched by her stirring performances and forceful style. She recorded 22 albums containing more than 200 songs, including about 30 that she composed.         She popularized homespun Quebecois music in France and helped revive the popularity of sophisticated French music in Quebec. She interpreted the music of Kurt Weill and the Quebec composer Gilles Vigneault. One of her most popular songs was called ''Tonight I Feel Tender,'' a ballad that became a theme that she performed at many performances.         But from the time she first returned to Quebec from Paris in the late 1950's she formed part of the inspirational soul of the separatist movement in Quebec. She fell in love with the Quebecois poet and journalist Gerald Godin, a staunch separatist, and fought with him for Quebec separatism.         During a crisis in Quebec in 1970 when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau sent the Canadian Army into the streets of Montreal in response to separatist violence, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were among a number of Quebecers who were swept off the streets and briefly jailed.         After Mr. Godin was elected to the province's assembly in 1976, the year the separatist party won control of the provincial government, she appeared regularly at major separatist rallies, leading huge crowds in song and fiery speeches.         She played a major role in fighting for women's rights and in obtaining the right to abortion in predominately Catholic Quebec.         ''Madame Julien lived intensely,'' said Lucien Bouchard, premier of Quebec. ''Her voice, the words of her songs -- above all on the question of love, friendship and her country -- her charisma and her passionate character are deeply etched in our collective memory.''         Ms. Julien was born in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, in 1928. She studied drama in Paris in the 1950's and  began singing there in bistros and bohemian clubs.         Jean Paul Goay, Ms. Julien's brother-in-law, said that on the night before she died she insisted on being taken to a show in Montreal where an old friend, the French comedian Raymond Davos, was performing. ''She told him then that they would never see each other again, but he didn't understand exactly what it signified,'' Mr. Goay said.         In the early 1990's, after 30 years of a common-law marriage, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were formally married. He died of a brain tumor in 1994.         In her later years Ms. Julien retired from active performing and traveled to Africa to work with the poor in Burkina Faso and other French-speaking countries.         She is survived by two children, Pascale and Nicolas, both of Montreal, from her first marriage to Jacques Galipeau, which ended in divorce.       
         Mildred Baker, an arts administrator and trustee emeritus of the Newark Museum, died on Dec. 9 at the Florence Nightingale Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 93 and was a longtime resident of the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan.         Born into a musical family in Brooklyn and named Mildred Sophia Weiss, Mrs. Baker became deeply involved with museums and art galleries after marrying an artist, Emil Holzhauer, in 1925. In 1935 she went to work for the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, later becoming its assistant director. She traveled the country selecting artists' works for more than 500 shows that circulated among more than 100 regional centers.         Soon after the W.P.A. closed its doors in 1943, Mrs. Baker joined the staff of the Newark Museum, where she organized a pioneering show called ''Black Artists'' in 1944.         She became the museum's assistant director in 1949 and its associate director in charge of exhibitions, membership and special events in 1953. Besides being responsible for many additions to the permanent collection, Mrs. Baker founded and was the first editor of ''News Notes,'' the museum's monthly bulletin. After her retirement in 1971, she was elected to the museum's board of trustees.         In the 1960's, she was vice chairman of the Commission to Study the Arts in New Jersey, which led to the creation of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, on which she served until 1975.         Mrs. Baker and Mr. Holzhauer were divorced in 1940, and seven years later she married Jacob Baker, a business executive, and they moved into the Chelsea Hotel. After Mr. Baker's death in 1967 she became a close friend of fellow hotel residents, including the composer Virgil Thomson. The two dined together every Saturday night in the Chelsea Hotel apartment of their friends, Gerald Busby, a composer, and Sam Byers, an advertising executive.         Mrs. Baker, who was a member of the board of the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, the Friends Committee of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and the Cosmopolitan Club, remained at the Chelsea until she suffered a stroke last month.         No immediate family members survive.
