         Susan Lehman Cullman, a New York philanthropist who served as a Navy cryptographer in World War II, died on Sunday at her home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. She was 79 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Cullman graduated from Horace Mann School in 1932, then attended Vassar College for two years and graduated from New York University in 1962. During the war, she worked in the office of Adm. Thomas A. Hart as a decoder of Japanese messages. For many years, she edited the Cipher Exchange for Cryptogram Magazine.         Mrs. Cullman was the grandniece of the late Herbert H. Lehman, former New York State Governor and Senator, and a grandniece of Irving Lehman, former Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals. She was the granddaughter of Sigmund Lehman, the eldest of the founders of Lehman Brothers Investment Bankers early in the century. Her parents were Harold and Cecile Seligman Lehman. Her father was a partner in Lehman Brothers. Her stepfather was Dr. Edgar Meyer.         Mrs. Cullman is survived by her daughter, Dorothy Cullman Treisman of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a sister, Betty Asiel of White Plains, and two grandsons. Her former husband is Joseph F. Cullman 3d of Manhattan.         A memorial service is scheduled for Jan. 22 at 11 A.M. at the Ethical Culture Society, 2 West 64th Street at Central Park West.       
         Mary Moorman, a noted biographer of the English poet William Wordsworth, died on Jan. 21, The Times of London reported. She was 88 and lived in Durham, England.         Mrs. Moorman's biography of Wordsworth, an early leader of Romanticism who lived from 1770 to 1850, appeared in two volumes, published in 1957 and 1965. "William Wordsworth: A Biography" came to be considered the standard account of the poet's life. It has won praise from critics as solid, shapely, durable, extremely thorough and warmed by its author's affection for the poet's countryside.         Mrs. Moorman was also the editor of "The Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth" -- the poet's eloquent sister -- which first appeared in 1971 and is still in print in the United States from Oxford University Press. Her other works include a 1980 memoir about her father and "William III and the Defense of Holland, 1672-73 (1930).         Mrs. Moorman was the daughter of the historian George Macaulay Trevelyan, who died in 1962. She was educated at Berkhamsted School and at Somerville College at Oxford University.         Her husband, the Right Reverend J. R. H. Moorman, an ecclesiastical historian who retired in 1975 as the Anglican Bishop of Ripon, died in 1989 after 59 years of marriage.       
         Maria St. Just, an actress and longtime friend of Tennessee Williams, died on Tuesday at her home in London. She was in her late 60's or early 70's, her family said.         The cause was heart failure brought on by severe rheumatoid arthritis, said her daughter Natasha Grenfell.         Lady St. Just was born in Petrograd but was taken by her mother to London when she was an infant. Her father, a doctor, remained in the Soviet Union and was later executed. She studied ballet as a young girl, but a leg operation when she was 14 put an end to her plans for a dancing career.         She won a scholarship to study at the Old Vic, after which she joined John Gielgud's company.         In 1948, before the company embarked on a foreign tour, she attended a party given by Mr. Gielgud in honor of Williams. A lifelong friendship with the playwright ensued. Lady St. Just was a co-executor of Williams's estate, and in 1990 she published "Five O'Clock Angel: Letters of Tennessee Williams to Maria St. Just, 1948-1982" (Alfred A. Knopf).         She appeared in the film "Room With a View" (1985) and in "Maurice" (1987), which was filmed at her estate near Salisbury.         In 1956 she married Peter Grenfell, the son of a British partner of J. P. Morgan. In 1973 Grenfell became a peer. He died in 1984.         In addition to her daughter Natasha, of London, she is survived by another daughter, Pulcheria, of Orleans, France, and two granddaughters.       
         Sally Belfrage, who wrote nonfiction books about life in an Indian ashram and about the civil rights movement in Mississippi in 1964, died yesterday at Middlesex Hospital in London. She was 57 and lived in London.         The cause was cancer, said her literary agent, Irene Skolnick.         Ms. Belfrage (pronounced BELL-fridge) spent a month studying under an Indian spiritual leader to gather material for "Flowers of Emptiness: Reflections on an Ashram" (1981). The book won her praise as an intelligent and humorous journalist and critic who ardently searched for the truth.         Her Mississippi memoir, "Freedom Summer" (1965), based on her experience as a civil rights volunteer, was lauded for freshness and forcefulness.         Her other books are "A Room in Moscow" (1959), about a sojourn in the Soviet Union and "Living With War: A Belfast Year" (1987). "Un-American Activities," a memoir of her adolescence, is to be published in June by HarperCollins. Youth in Hollywood and London         Ms. Belfrage was born in Hollywood, the daughter of Cedric Belfrage and Molly Castle, Britons who were then correspondents for London newspapers. In "Un-American Activities" she wrote, "My mother was a mere English eccentric, but my father was a Red and so in trouble all the time."         After her family moved east, she attended Bronx High School of Science, Hunter College and, after moving to London when she was 18, the London School of Economics. In 1957, she worked for the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow.         Her 1965 marriage to Bernard Pomerance, who wrote the play "The Elephant Man," ended in divorce in 1976.         She is survived by a daughter, Eve Pomerance of London; a son, Moby Pomerance of Manhattan; a brother, Nicholas, of London, and a sister, Anne Zribi of Paris.       
         Dr. Celia Yeack-Scranton, a physical sciences researcher for the International Business Machines Corporation in San Jose, Calif., died on Monday at the Mission Oaks Hospital in Los Gatos, Calif. She was 42.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Robert Scranton.         Dr. Yeack-Scranton, who lived in San Jose, conducted research into magnetic recording technology, in which she held several patents. Earlier this year she was named an I.B.M. Fellow for her work. She held a doctorate in applied physics from Stanford University.         Besides her husband she is survived by a son, Peter, and a daughter, Karen, both of San Jose, and her father, William R. Yeack of Gainesville, Fla.       
         Nancy K. Robinson, an author of children's books and narrations for documentary films, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 51.         The cause was cancer, said her father, Norris Konheim.         During her career Mrs. Robinson wrote more than 20 books for children between the ages of 7 and 12. She also wrote stories for children published by Scholastic Inc. She was a 1964 graduate of Vassar College.         She is survived by a son, Kenneth, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Alice Robinson of Manhattan; her parents, Norris and Natalie Konheim of Longboat Key, Fla., and a sister, Patty Goldenberg of Waban, Mass.       
         Helen Wolff, an American editor and publisher whose taste and talents led to the acquisition and publication of major works of literature, died yesterday at her home in Hanover, N.H. She was 88.         The cause was apparently a heart attack, said her son, Christian.         Mrs. Wolff, who was regarded by her colleagues in the international book world as the grande dame of letters, published greatly acclaimed and successful works under the imprint "A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book," which she established with her husband at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1961. The Wolffs were particularly respected for bringing out translations of distinguished European authors.         After her husband's death in a traffic accident in West Germany in 1963, she remained as the imprint's sole publisher at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich without losing any authors to other publishing houses. Mrs. Wolff retired in 1986, but was regularly consulted about acquisitions and translations. The Wolff imprint has continued to flourish at Harcourt Brace. The Merits of Literature         "The joy of publishing is to see good works become generally recognized," Mrs. Wolff once said. "Literature can do surprisingly well."         Among the authors with whom she worked closely were Gunter Grass, Umberto Eco, Max Frisch, Georges Simenon, Stanislaw Lem and Amos Oz. She also published Anne Morrow Lindbergh's best-selling "Gift From the Sea."         "I don't plan to write my memoirs, and I will tell you why," Mrs. Wolff said in 1982 when she was the subject of a profile in The New Yorker. "If one writes oneself, one closes out the writing of others. I've never been able to understand editors who could also write. You have to keep yourself open for the creative efforts of authors; you must be totally receptive. It's like being a priest, and I don't think priests should be married. Nor do I think editors should write. Kurt and I found our creativity and our life in editing and publishing."         The Wolffs brought to publishing a European sensibility that went beyond the demands and vagaries of the marketplace. Early in this century, Kurt Wolff was Franz Kafka's first publisher, at Kurt Wolff Verlag in Germany. The couple left Germany in the 1930's and lived in Italy and France before immigrating to the United States in 1941 to escape the Nazis. A Founder of Pantheon Books         The Wolffs founded Pantheon Books in New York in 1942 and went on to publish works that included Boris Pasternak's "Doctor Zhivago." They nurtured that company and remained with it until 1961, when they resigned and moved to Europe. Shortly thereafter, Pantheon was acquired by Random House. The couple's next venture, the Helen and Kurt Wolff imprint, began at the invitation of the publisher William Jovanovich.         Mrs. Wolff was a step ahead of rival American publishers in acquiring important foreign books because of her fluency in several languages. At the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, for example, she could read a manuscript in its original German, French or Italian and make a decision about it overnight.         Mrs. Wolff, whose name was originally Helen Mosel, was born in 1906 in Macedonia. Her father was German and her mother was of Hungarian and Austrian parentage. At home, Helen, her sister and her parents spoke German, Turkish and Serbian. Arriving Poor in New York         After World War I, she attended boarding schools in Vienna and discovered that she had a gift for languages, including English. In 1927, she went to Munich as a trainee at Kurt Wolff Verlag, where she became a full-time employee in charge of art books. She and Mr. Wolff, who was 20 years her senior and divorced, were married in London in 1933. Their son was born the next year.         When the Wolffs arrived in New York, they were nearly penniless. In 1942, they persuaded three investors to contribute a total of $7,500, which enabled the creation of Pantheon Books. Mrs. Wolff recalled that her personal budget at that time was a dollar a day. The next year, they were joined by Jacques Schiffrin, who had founded Editions Pleiade in Paris and who brought many fine books to Pantheon.         The Wolffs' first success in the United States was a new edition of the Grimm fairy tales, in 1944. Under their own imprint, they published a number of important works, both fiction and nonfiction. After her husband's death, Mrs. Wolff was responsible for such notable novels as Italo Calvino's "Invisible Cities," a retranslated edition of Giorgio Bassani's "Garden of the Finzi-Continis," Mr. Grass's "Flounder," Mr. Oz's "My Michael" and Mr. Eco's "Name of the Rose."         In 1981, for her contributions to international publishing, Mrs. Wolff was awarded the Inter Nationes Award for Literature and the Arts by the West German Government. In 1985, she was given the Goethe Medal by Goethe House, the German cultural institute in New York City.         In addition to her son, a professor of music and classics at Dartmouth College, she is survived by a stepson, Nikolaus Wolff of Norwich, Vt.; a stepdaughter, Maria Stadelmayer of Hamburg, Germany; a brother, George Mosel of Santiago, Chile; a sister, Elizabeth Steinbeis of Brannenburg, Germany, and 10 grandchildren.       
         Shirley Ann Dungan Kheel, a lawyer and civic worker, died yesterday at her Manhattan home. She was 49.         Mrs. Kheel died of cancer, said her husband, Robert.         Her son David was the first child to be born in New York after conception by laboratory methods.         Mrs. Kheel was active in the Trinity and Collegiate schools in Manhattan, the Urban League and the Howard and Georgeanna Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine. She was a graduate of the University of Rochester and received a law degree from Yeshiva University.         She is survived by her husband and sons, Daniel and David, all of Manhattan; her father, James O. Dungan of Rochester; two sisters, Laura Dungan of Pompano Beach, Fla., and Dr. Bonnie Dungan of Philadelphia, and two brothers, James Dungan of Binghamton, N.Y., and Kelly Dungan of Rochester. Her father-in-law is Theodore Kheel, the labor mediator and lawyer, of Manhattan.       
         Alice Herrington, the founder and longtime president of Friends of Animals, one of the country's best known animal-protection societies, died on Tuesday at DeKalb Medical Center in Decatur, Ga. Ms. Herrington, a former resident of Manhattan and Little Silver, N.J., was 75 and lived in Lithonia, Ga.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         She founded the nonprofit organization in Manhattan in 1957 and retired as its president at the end of 1986. It now has headquarters in Darien, Conn., and counts 150,000 contributing members nationwide.         When she started Friends of Animals, its purpose was to protect cats and dogs. To that end it offered low-cost spaying and neutering services to cut down the number of strays across the country. The organization eventually built its own clinic for this in Neptune, N.J.         Under her leadership the society widened its activities to preserve animals in general, including wildlife, marine mammals and zoo animals. Ms. Herrington pursued her cause in letters to the editor, advertisements, Op-Ed articles, lectures and public testimony. Panel for Humane Legislation         Her targets included the killing of seals and their pups for fur; leg-hold traps for catching raccoons for their coats; hunters who paid thousands of dollars to shoot polar bears from the air; rodeos in which electric rods, bucking straps and steel spurs are used on broncos and bulls, and cruel uses of animals for experiments, research and testing.         She also started and directed a Committee for Humane Legislation to require that animals be rendered unconscious and insensible to pain before slaughter. That campaign in the 1960's aroused controversy because it was aimed at the shackling and hoisting method used by some kosher slaughterers.         Her disapproval of fur coats led to her arrest for disorderly conduct in 1979, when she took part in a protest outside Gracie Mansion. The occasion was a dinner given by Mayor Edward I. Koch for a group of furriers in town for a convention.         "Hunting is all part of the macho world," she once told an interviewer.  "You bring up your boys and suggest that to be a man like their father they should kill everything that moves, right?"         Ms. Herrington, a Wisconsin native, graduated from the University of Wisconsin.         She is survived by a daughter, Jennifer C. Schmid of Lawrenceville, Ga., and a sister, Rachel E. Brodeaux of Harlingen, Tex.       
         Elissa Ichiyasu, a graphic designer, died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on April 13. She was 41 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, her family said.         A native of Chicago, Ms. Ichiyasu was a graduate of Columbia University and studied design at Pratt Institute. At her death she was a book designer for Harry N. Abrams Inc., an art-book publisher. She joined the company in January 1987 after working as an art director for Random House.         A show of her work is scheduled for the fall at the American Institute of Graphic Arts on Fifth Avenue.         Ms. Ichiyasu is survived by her husband, Michael Clancey; her father, Harry T. Ichiyasu, and a brother, Alan, both of Chicago.       
         Betty Furness, who went from minor acting roles to reknown as a television saleswoman and then became a formidable consumer advocate, died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in New York City and Hartsdale, N.Y.         The cause was stomach cancer, said her husband, Leslie Midgley.         With the cheekbones of a model and the directness of a New England schoolmarm, Miss Furness was one of the true pioneers in television consumer journalism. In her heyday with WNBC-TV in New York, she regularly broadcast the names of errant businesses and shoddy products. She pointed television cameras at stores where New Yorkers had been cheated, and lectured the proprietors. She reported on hamburger that was too fat, on warranties that were too lean, on gadgets that were too temperamental and on business ethics that she saw as seriously flawed. She even scolded Macy's. Park Avenue Upbringing         Miss Furness essentially created a place for consumer advocacy on local television. She also spent a great deal of time off the screen promoting the cause of consumer justice. She was on the board of Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine, from 1969 until she retired for health reasons in 1993, and she worked for Common Cause. She also was President Lyndon B. Johnson's special assistant for consumer affairs and was head of the New York State Consumer Protection Board in 1970 and '71. She was Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs in 1973.         Miss Furness, who had surgery for stomach cancer in 1990, was eased out of the "Today" show on NBC in 1992 after 16 years with the program. "This was their idea, not mine," she said dryly as she departed.         Miss Furness, whose original name was Elizabeth Mary Furness, was born on Jan. 3, 1916, in New York City, the daughter of George Choate Furness, an executive with what was then called Union Carbon and Carbide, and Florence Sturtevant Furness. The Furness family was well off and young Betty was raised on Park Avenue and sent to the Bennett School in Dutchess County, N.Y. In 1932, before graduating, she dropped out to become an actress.         It was the Depression, and her father had advised her to learn "something useful." She got summer jobs with the John Robert Powers Modeling Agency, but to her father's dismay earned only $80 in two summers of work. But she was blonde and trim, and Mr. Powers noticed her. He liked the way she used her voice and her gray-green eyes, and he arranged for her to take a screen test at RKO.         The only acting she had done was in school theatricals, but just a year after she left the Bennett School, RKO was touting her as a bright new talent. She had secondary roles in 35 films in Hollywood and later called them all appalling except "Swing Time," which starred Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and "Magnificent Obsession," both produced in the mid-1930's. She left the screen in 1937 and moved to the stage. With few exceptions -- the stock and road productions of "Golden Boy," "My Sister Eileen" and "Doughgirls" -- the career that had started with promise seemed to be going nowhere. Early TV Participant         In 1948, with commercial television just starting, Miss Furness landed a job with the DuMont Television Network, which signed her to do a 15-minute show called "Fashions, Coming and Becoming."         A year later, somebody at Westinghouse saw her in a "Studio One" drama and offered her a job as the company's representative on television. For more than 11 years Miss Furness was a staple on evening television, frequently standing in front of refrigerators and waxing eloquent about their performance.         In 1952, 1956 and 1960, Miss Furness did the Westinghouse commercials during the Republican and Democratic National Conventions and developed a strong interest in politics. She worked for Abraham Ribicoff in Connecticut when he made his first successful race for the United States Senate in 1962. After meeting Lady Bird Johnson and Muriel Humphrey, she also made recruiting trips for Head Start and Vista, the Volunteers in Service to America. Left Rockefeller Job         In 1962, she was the hostess of a five-minute radio show called "A Woman's World," in which she talked about food, clothes, child rearing, family relationships, teen-agers and the aged. Late in 1962, she worked on an ABC-TV show called "Answering Service." The show was nominated for an Emmy Award, but ABC dropped her all the same.         Miss Furness abruptly quit as Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's consumer affairs adviser in 1971, charging that the New York State Legislature did not take her recommendations seriously enough. She ran New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs in 1973. After that she worked briefly for McCall's magazine as a contributing editor and wrote a column for consumers.         Despite the number and diversity of her activities, she was never able to completely shake off her image as a product saleswoman. "I feel I'm a very serious person who wants to do things," she once said, "but people keep talking about refrigerators. I'm tired of telling the story about the refrigerator door that didn't stick, and I'm bored with the image."         In 1937 Miss Furness married Johnny Green, the composer and conductor, with whom she had a daughter, Barbara. The couple divorced in 1943. In 1945, she married Hugh B. Ernst, a radio announcer, who died in 1950. She married Mr. Midgley, a CBS News producer, in 1967.         In addition to her husband and her daughter, she is survived by three stepchildren, Leslie Midgley, Andrea Connors and Peter J. Midgley, and two grandchildren.       
         Luba Potamkin, a broadcasting spokeswoman in the 1970's for her family's Cadillac auto dealerships on the East Coast, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 73.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said her husband, Victor Potamkin.         Three years after her husband founded Potamkin Cadillac in 1972, Mrs. Potamkin and other members of her family appeared in television commercials that featured the line: "If this nameplate isn't on the back of your car, you probably paid too much."         The ebullient commercials, which were also broadcast by Potamkin dealerships on television stations in Pennsylvania and Florida, were noticed. Mr. Potamkin said his forceful merchandising in New York helped his sales.         Mrs. Potamkin, the former Luba Chalken, was born in Philadelphia. She was married to Victor for 52 years and for a large part of that time was content to be a wife and mother to her two sons.  Fighting Against Alzheimer's         She said of her career as a Cadillac spokeswoman on television, which she amplified to include health and fashion tips, that she never studied a script in advance. She told an interviewer in 1977, "To me, it's easy because it's my business and I'm thrilled to say, 'Buy a Cadillac.' "         Her son Alan recalled yesterday that the ad campaign was hatched by his father, who convinced his wife, who was at first reluctant, to do it.         The Potamkin family relinquished the dealership in 1987, selling the assets and leasing the company's Manhattan real estate to General Motors.  For several years the dealership fell into decline under new operators with a more muted television campaign.         Two years ago the Potamkin family resumed operations under the name Potamkin Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet.         Mrs. Potamkin then became a symbol of the fight against Alzheimer's disease, which she was diagnosed as having in the late 1970's. She and her husband made major donations to research into the disease, and in 1987 the Potamkin family created the Potamkin Prize for Alzheimer Research, an annual award of $100,000. They were also active in sponsoring fund-raising events for medical research.         In addition to her husband, who maintains homes in New York, Philadelphia and Miami, she is survived by two sons, Robert, of Philadelphia and Alan, of Miami; a sister, Florence Jans of Miami; a brother, Marvin Chaiken of Tucson, Ariz., and three grandchildren.       
         Sonia Raiziss, a New York literary figure for many years, died on March 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 85 and also had a home in Bucks County, Pa.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said Alfredo de Palchi, her collaborator and former husband.         A poet, translator and critic, Ms. Raiziss was an editor of Chelsea, a semi-annual avant-garde literary magazine featuring poems and prose by promising new writers. She became an editor of the magazine in 1960, two years after its founding.         Chelsea published early work by such authors as Sylvia Plath, Umberto Eco, Raymond Carver and Grace Paley. Many of its back numbers are collectors' items. Published as High School Student         A native of Germany, Ms. Raiziss was brought to this country as a child and grew up in Philadelphia. Her earliest poems were published while she was in high school, and her subsequent work appeared widely in literary magazines.         She earned undergraduate and doctoral degrees at the University of Philadelphia, where her father, the biochemist Dr. George W. Raiziss, was a professor. She also studied at Columbia University and published her first collection of poems, "Through a Glass Darkly," as a student at the Sorbonne.         Her first book of criticism, "Metaphysical Passion: Seven Modern American Poets and the 17th-Century Tradition," was published in 1952 by the University of Philadelphia and reissued by Greenwood Press in 1970. "Bucks County Blues," a volume of her poetry that appeared in 1977, also remains in print.         Most recently, she was the translator of "The Scorpion's Dark Dance" (1993), a volume of Italian poetry by Mr. de Palchi.         She is survived by a son, Peter St. Mu Raiziss of Sacramento, Calif.       
         Jean Brown, a collector of Dada, Surrealism and Fluxus, died on Sunday at the Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 82 and lived in Tyringham, Mass.         She died of natural causes, said her son, Jonathan, of Princeton, N.J.         Sometimes called the den mother of Fluxus, Mrs. Brown possessed a natural openness to new art and counted among her friends such avant-gardists as Marcel Duchamp, John Cage and George Maciunas, the leader of the Fluxus movement.  Going to Museums         Mrs. Brown, whose maiden name was Levy, was born in 1911 in Brooklyn. Her father was a rare-book dealer who enjoyed taking his daughter to museums. She briefly attended Columbia University. In 1936, she married Leonard Brown, an insurance agent. They settled in Springfield, Mass., where Mrs. Brown worked as a librarian.         In the late 1950's, after collecting Abstract Expressionist paintings, the Browns began to acquire Dadaist and Surrealist art, manifestoes and periodicals. They soon moved on to Fluxus, a new, irreverent art movement that stressed multiples, printed ephemera, posters, newspapers and mail art.         After Mr. Brown's death in 1971, Mrs. Brown moved to Tyringham, and expanded into areas adjacent to Fluxus, including artists' books, concrete poetry, happenings and performance art. Her home, originally a Shaker seed house, became an important center for both Fluxus artists and scholars, with Mrs. Brown alternately cooking meals and showing her guests her collection. Activities centered on a large attic archive built by Mr. Maciunas.  A 20th-Century Collection         In 1985, as the Jean Brown Archive approached 6,000 items, it was bought by the J. Paul Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities in Santa Monica, Calif. This was among the first collections of 20th-century material acquired by the center.         In addition to her son, an art historian at the Institute of Fine Arts in Manhattan, Mrs. Brown is survived by another son, Robert, of Manhattan, a partner in the Reinhold Brown Gallery.       
         Gail Dunbar, an executive recruiter, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital, where she was taken last Tuesday after being found unconscious in her Manhattan apartment. She was 35.         The cause was arrhythmia, said her father, Ernest Dunbar, a West Side resident.         Ms. Dunbar was a native of Manhattan. She graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and, in 1980, from Harvard College. She worked as a stockbroker and investment analyst before she joined the executive-recruitment firm of Phillips O'Shea as a vice president in 1990.         Besides her father, Ms. Dunbar is survived by her sister, Dr. Adrienne Dunbar of Coral Springs, Fla., and a brother, Dean, of Montclair, N.J.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         K. T. Stevens, a theater, film and television actress and a theatrical-union official, died on June 13 at her home in Brentwood, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was lung cancer, said Dick Moore, a spokesman for the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.         Ms. Stevens, whose original name was Gloria Wood, was born in Hollywood. Her father was the film director Sam Wood. She began acting in plays and films as a child, using the stage name Katherine Stevens. After starring in the radio soap opera "Mr. Pepper's Family" and taking ingenue roles on the stage, she made her Broadway debut in "The Land Is Bright" in 1941. She also appeared on Broadway in "Nine Girls" (1943) and "Laura" (1947).         In the 1940's and 50's Ms. Stevens played leading roles in such films as "Address Unknown" (1944), "Port of New York," (1949), "Harriet Craig" (1950) and "Vice Squad" (1953). More recently, she appeared in "Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice" (1969) and "Pets" (1974).         Her television credits include appearances on "I Love Lucy," "The Rifleman," "The Patty Duke Show" "Mannix," "Days of Our Lives" and "General Hospital." For more than five years she played Vanessa on "The Young and the Restless."         Ms. Stevens served on local and national boards of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists from 1978 until her death. She was president of the union's Los Angeles local from 1986 to 1989.         Her marriage to the film actor Hugh Marlowe ended in divorce in 1967. She is survived by two sons, Jeffrey and Chris, both of Los Angeles, and a granddaughter.       
         Josephine Moy Hong, active in Chinese-American affairs and Republican Party politics, died on Sunday in Flushing Hospital. She was 93 and lived in Jamaica Estates, Queens.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Hong was born in Boston but spent much of her childhood in southern China, where her father moved when she was 8 years old to help develop the mining industry.         She returned to the United States in 1917 and studied economics and psychology at the University of Chicago and New York University. In 1923 she married Louis Fong Sui Hong, who was instrumental in expanding operations in Asia for the National City Bank of New York. The family went to live at Shanghai's International Settlement, an enclave of foreigners guarded by Western forces, when the Japan invaded China in 1937. Mrs. Hong tended to the wounded and sick while under bombardments.         Back in the United States in 1939, she organized a group of Chinese volunteers to raise funds for war refugees in New York. After Pearl Harbor, she served as a director of the National Board of the American Women's Voluntary Service and as chairman of its Chinese unit in New York.         In the decades since, she held leading positions in the Chinese Women's Benevolent Association, the Institute of Chinese Culture, the Chinese Cultural Renaissance Society and the Asian American Assembly, among others.         She turned to Republican Party politics in the 1960's and was vice president of the New York State Republican Heritage Groups Council.         She was inducted as a Life Member of the Republican Party in 1979. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan named her to his Peace Corps Advisory Council.         Mrs. Hong is survived by three sons; Alfred of Jamaica Estates, Robert of Syosset, L.I., and Morris of Fresh Meadows, Queens; a daughter, Virginia Wei of Princeton, N.J.; a brother, Herbert Moy of Chicago; a sister, Mae Wu of Berkeley, Calif.; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Jane Elizabeth Richmond, a writer with a special interest in films and television, died on Monday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 57 and had homes in Pawcatuck, Conn., and Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Richmond, a native of Westerly, R.I., was a graduate of Barnard College and worked in advertising before turning to editing and writing. As an editor for Partisan Review, she was associated with the Beat writers. She also served as a literary assistant to Mary McCarthy.         Her fiction and nonfiction appeared in Partisan Review, The New Yorker and other publications. She also wrote for television and adapted several short plays from the repertory of the Grand Guignol Theater of Paris for presentation in the United States.         Ms. Richmond is survived by her father, Richard, and a brother, Barry, both of Stonington, Conn.       
         Irma Shorell, a skin-care specialist and retired cosmetics executive, died on Monday in her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A native of Manhattan, Ms. Shorell got her start in the industry by working for Estee Lauder when Ms. Lauder was still a small entrepreneur. She also modeled and acted.         When Ms. Shorell entered her 30's and began to notice signs of aging in her own complexion, her father, Dr. I. David Shorell, who was a well-known surgeon, prescribed a special postoperative skin formula of his own invention.         In 1961 Ms. Shorell formed a business with a $1,500 investment and Dr. Shorell's cream -- marketed under the name Contour/35 -- as its first product. The company, Irma Shorell Inc., eventually added a cleanser, sun blocks and other skin-care items in a full line of products for women and men. She sold the company in 1985 to Alfin Fragrances Inc. of New York.         A column bearing Ms. Shorell's byline was published weekly as an advertisement in Women's Wear Daily until the 1980's.       
         Christy Henrich, a former gymnast of near-Olympic caliber who had eating disorders, died on Tuesday in Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo., near her hometown, Independence, Mo. She was 22.         The cause of death was multiple organ system failure, the hospital said. A spokeswoman, Clara Scott, said that "basically, everything shut down." Ms. Henrich had long suffered from two eating disorders, anorexia nervosa and bulimia.         After narrowly failing to make the 1988 United States Olympic gymnastics team, Ms. Henrich, a hard-driving competitor who was only 4 feet 10 inches tall, placed fourth in the unequal parallel bars event in the 1989 world championships. Forced to Retire         At that time, she weighed 93 pounds, but then she grew frailer and thinner. Weakness forced her to retire from her sport in 1991, and in mid-1993 she was down to 60 pounds.         Ms. Henrich's death came after a week in the medical center following 10 days in critical condition in a hospital in Independence, Mo.         Anorexia nervosa is an illness of deliberate self-starvation, found chiefly in young women. Bulimia is marked by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by self-induced-vomiting. An Intense Athlete         Ms. Henrich, whose father, Paul, was a bowler in past years, was intense about exercise and fitness from an early age. As a teen-ager, she said of competing in the Olympics: "It's what I want to do. I want it so bad."         She attended Fort Osage High School in Independence and turned down college scholarship offers while training in hopes of making the 1992 Olympics. But she did not, and in 1993 she was hospitalized for a time at a Kansas City clinic, also because of her eating problems.         At the time, her mother said: "I would say 99 percent of what has happened to Christy is because of the sport.         Besides her parents, Ms. Henrich's survivors include a brother, Paul.       
         Dorothy Hodgkin, a British scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1964, died on Friday in her home at Shipston-on-Stour, in Warwickshire in central England. She was 84.         She died after suffering a stroke, her family said.         Professor Hodgkin was the chancellor of Bristol University from 1970 until her retirement in 1988, and also taught at Oxford.         She was the third woman to win the Nobel chemistry award. The first two were Marie Curie, in 1911, and her daughter Irene Joliot-Curie, in 1935.         Professor Hodgkin had used X-rays to probe into the inner architecture of key biochemical compounds, elucidating their structures and providing essential aid for those seeking to understand how and why these compounds work in living organisms.         Over the years, she was the author of a variety of scientific writings on the X-ray crystallographic analysis of structures of molecules, including penicillin, vitamin B12 and insulin.         The Times of London, in looking back over her career, observed on Saturday, "She will always be remembered for her discovery of the structure of penicillin, of the antipernicious anemia factor vitamin B12 and of the diabetic hormone, insulin."         The Swedish Academy of Science, in announcing Professor Hodgkin's prize, praised her "exceptional skill, in which chemical knowledge, intuition, imagination and perseverance have been conspicuous."         In 1965, Queen Elizabeth II made Professor Hodgkin the first woman since Florence Nightingale (1820-1910), the founder of modern nursing, to become a member of the Order of Merit, Britain's most respected royal order. It is limited at any time to 24 members, who have excelled in science, art, letters or the armed services. Years before, in 1947, Professor Hodgkin was elected a fellow of the Royal Society for her analysis of penicillin.         In 1960 she became Royal Society Wolfson Research Professor at Oxford, and she retired from that chair in 1977. She held other titles at Oxford in earlier decades, and was a fellow of that university's Somerville College from 1936 to 1977. Among her undergraduate students at Oxford was Margaret Thatcher, who went into politics, not chemistry, to become a long-serving Prime Minister.         In addition, Professor Hodgkin was a member or fellow of numerous learned bodies in Britain, the United States and other countries. And she was a founding member of Pugwash, the international organization of scientists who tried to improve communication between scientists on the Iron Curtain's two sides during the cold war. Pugwash was established in 1957, in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, to study problems linked to the development of weapons of mass destruction.         Professor Hodgkin was born Dorothy Mary Crowfoot in Cairo, where her father worked for the Egyptian Government. She went on to a school in England -- the Sir John Leman School in Beccles, in Suffolk -- and to study chemistry at Oxford and then at Cambridge, in an era when few British women pursued university-level studies in science.         She married Thomas Lionel Hodgkin, an eminent Africanist and Arabist, in 1937; he died in 1982.         Her survivors include two sons and a daughter.       
         Joan Harrison, a producer and screenwriter who helped write the scripts for "Rebecca," "Foreign Correspondent" and other films directed by Alfred Hitchcock, died on Aug. 14 in London. She was 83.         Miss Harrison was born in Guildford, Surrey, England, where her father published two local newspapers. After attending boarding school in Kent, she received an honor's degree in philosophy, politics and economics at St. Hugh's College, Oxford, where she occasionally reviewed films for the student newspaper. She later studied at the Sorbonne.         In 1933, she was hired as a secretary by Hitchcock, who was at work on "The Man Who Knew Too Much." A poor secretary by her own description, she soon graduated to reading books and scripts, writing synopses and contributing to scripts. She received her first writing credit on Hitchcock's "Jamaica Inn." From Hitchcock to Hollywood         In 1939, Miss Harrison accompanied Hitchcock to Hollywood, working as his assistant and as a writer on "Rebecca," "Suspicion," "Saboteur" and "Shadow of a Doubt."         In 1941, Miss Harrison went out on her own and was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to write the script for "The Sun Is My Undoing." In 1943, she was hired as a producer at Universal, where her first film was "Phantom Lady," a melodrama starring Franchot Tone. In 1944, she produced and shared the screenwriting credit for "Dark Waters," a thriller starring Merle Oberon.         In the 1940's and 50's, she produced the mystery thrillers "Third Eye," "Uncle Harry," "Nocturne," "Ride the Pink Horse," "Once More, My Darling," "Eye Witness" and "Circle of Danger."         From 1955 to 1962, she produced the television series "Alfred Hitchcock Presents." With Norman Lloyd, she was responsible for selecting stories, hiring writers and directors, casting and supervising the production of each episode. She also produced the television series "Journey Into the Unknown."         She is survived by her husband, the mystery writer Eric Ambler.       
         Valerie Worth Bahlke, a poet and novelist for young readers, died on Sunday at her home in Clinton, N.Y. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Bahlke, who wrote under her maiden name, Valerie Worth, had many interests, from astronomy to gardening to meditation, which became the subject matter she wove into her poetry. She sought to present ordinary things in a fresh way.         She was most widely known for her "small poems" for children, composed in simple free verse. The poet and teacher Myra Cohn Livingston wrote of Ms. Worth's work in The New York Times Book Review in 1988, "The treasures Ms. Worth offers do not lie in some distant, golden land but in the everyday world." For example, of a safety pin, Ms. Worth wrote:         Closed, it sleeps         On its side         Quietly,         The silver         Image         Of some         Small fish;         Opened, it snaps         Its tail out         Like a thin         Shrimp, and looks         At the sharp         Point with a         Surprised eye.         In 1991, the National Council of Teachers of English honored her with its Poetry Award for Excellence in Poetry for Children, given for a body of work.         It was only one of many such citations she garnered over the years. Since the 1950's, her poems have been included in numerous anthologies. She also wrote fiction for adults and young people. 'Small Poems' by the Volume         She was born in Philadelphia and lived in Swarthmore, Pa., Tampa, Fla., and Bangalore, India, when her father, a biologist at Swarthmore College, was asked to go to India to study malaria. She graduated from Swarthmore in 1955.         After settling in Clinton, she joined an informal writing group at Kirkland College and met Natalie Babbitt, an author and illustrator who then furnished the black-and-white drawings for her work, starting with "Small Poems" in 1972. Three more volumes followed, in 1976, 1978 and 1985, and all four appeared in a single paperback in 1987.         Her other books included "The Crone's Book of Words" (1971) and "The Crone's Book of Wisdom" (1988); "Curlicues: The Fortunes of Two Pug Dogs" (1980), and two novels for young adults, "Gypsy Gold" (1983) and "Fox Hill" (1986).         Another book of her verses for children, "At Christmastime," was published two years ago. Much of her work remains in print, and at her death she had completed two more such collections of all-new poems. They are scheduled for publication by HarperCollins in 1995 and 1996.         She is survived by her husband, George W. Bahlke; a son, Conrad D., of Hoboken, N.J.; two daughters, Catherine B. Hornstein of Brooklyn and Margaret B. Diskin of West Chester, Pa.; two brothers, Michael Worth of Swarthmore and Douglas Worth of Newton, Mass., and a granddaughter.       
         Rildia Bee O'Bryan Cliburn, the mother of Van Cliburn and his only piano teacher until he was 17, died yesterday at All Saints Episcopal Hospital in Fort Worth. She was 97 and lived in Fort Worth.         The cause was a stroke that occurred last Thursday, said Mary Lou Falcone, Mr. Cliburn's spokeswoman.         Mrs. Cliburn's mother was an actress and her father was a judge and adviser to state officials. She studied music from an early age in Texas, then at the Cincinnati Conservatory and at the New York School of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard School.         She returned to Texas in the 1920's to marry Harvey Levan Cliburn, an oil-company executive. She gave piano lessons, and discovered her son's ability when at the age of 3 he went to the piano after one of her students left and played by ear the piece that had just been taught.         Mrs. Cliburn served as her son's adviser, manager and inspiration throughout his career. She was also active in the arts, and established a foundation to help young performers.         Her husband died in 1974. She is survived by her son, of Fort Worth.       
         Jessie Sumner, an Illinois Republican who was the first woman elected to a county judgeship in her state and a conservative member of Congress from 1939 to 1947, died on Wednesday in Iroquois Memorial Hospital in Watseka, Ill. She was 96 and lived in nearby Milford.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Donna Rae Mann, Miss Sumner's assistant.         At her death, Miss Sumner was the president of Sumner National Bank, in Sheldon, Ill., which was founded by her father, Aaron Taylor Sumner. She took the post in 1966.         Miss Sumner was born on a farm in Iroquois County, Ill., grew up in that county and graduated from Smith College in 1920. She studied law at the University of Chicago and at Oxford and Columbia Universities. She worked as a lawyer in Chicago, New York and Milford.         In 1937, she became a judge in Iroquois County before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1938. She held the view, shared by many in her district in east-central Illinois, that the United States should not get involved in the war that was brewing in Europe.         After being elected to the House, she became nationally known as a foe of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and of his New Deal program and other policies. "What do I think of President Roosevelt?" she once asked, and then said she had come "to bury Caesar, not to praise him."         After World War II began in Europe in 1939, she found herself in a minority in Congress in voting against expanding the Navy. She was also among more than 100 representatives who voted, only months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, against extending the draft for a year.         After the United States entered the war in 1941, she criticized the country's allies, the conduct of the war, and Roosevelt Administration measures on the home front. She gained attention for her opposition to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which cared for refugees in Europe after the war, saying that if it was humanitarian, "so is keeping a gigolo."         Miss Sumner decided not to run for re-election in 1946. She then resumed practicing law in Milford and helped manage her family's insurance company, grain elevators and farms, in addition to the bank.         Survivors include a nephew, three nieces, six great-nephews and a great-niece.       
         Dolly Haas, a petite and vivacious actress on stage and screen, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 84.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the Broadway artist Al Hirschfeld. For many decades the two were an elegant couple on the aisle at all Broadway opening nights, watching the actors and actresses whom Mr. Hirschfeld would sketch for The New York Times.         Before their marriage in 1943, Miss Haas was a celebrated movie star in Germany and had a brief Hollywood career. She also played leading roles in plays on and Off Broadway. When Miss Haas made her New York stage debut in 1941 in Erwin Piscator's production of the Chinese fantasy "The Circle of Chalk," Brooks Atkinson, the drama critic of The Times, wrote that she was "an exquisitely beautiful actress, with the limpid grace of a Chinese poem or print."         She was born in Hamburg, Germany, the daughter of a German mother and an English father. As a child, she studied ballet and, before she was 20, was acting in cabaret and musical comedy. She easily made the transition to films, in 1929 in "One Summer of Happiness," playing a department store doll that came to life. In this and other romantic movies, written or directed by Billy Wilder, Anatol Litvak and Fritz Kortner, among others, she often portrayed figures of innocence.         With the rise of Hitler, she left her native country and her growing career and went to London, playing the Lillian Gish role in the sound movie version of D. W. Griffith's "Broken Blossoms." The film was directed by Hans Brahm, who became Miss Haas's first husband. Whisked off to Hollywood, she languished for a time as producers looked for suitable roles and tried to persuade her to change her name to Lilli Marlowe. Soon she left for New York and a life on the stage.         After "The Circle of Chalk," she was in Piscator's version of "War and Peace" and in 1946 replaced Mary Martin opposite Yul Brynner in the musical "Lute Song," which she and Mr. Brynner later took on tour to London. In 1947 she acted with John Gielgud and Miss Gish in "Crime and Punishment" on Broadway. She was also in the Off Broadway productions of "The Threepenny Opera" and "Brecht on Brecht." In 1953 she returned to the movies, appearing notably in Alfred Hitchcock's "I Confess."         Miss Haas and Mr. Hirschfeld met when the artist was on assignment to draw a sketch of a summer theater company for The Times. On occasion, Miss Haas's portrait appeared in the background in her husband's drawings. In 1975, she returned to Germany, where she was honored with a retrospective of her films at the 25th annual Berlin International Film Festival.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Nina, and two grandchildren.         Services will be at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Maddison Avenue, at 81st Street, Manhattan, at 4 P.M. on Sunday.       
         Sandra Fisher, a figurative painter and printmaker who was also the wife of the painter R. B. Kitaj, died on Monday at the National Hospital for Nervous Disorders in London. She was 47 and lived in London.         The cause has not been determined, Marilyn McCully, a family friend, said yesterday.         Ms. Fisher, who was born in New York City and brought up in Florida and California, studied art at the Chouinard Institute in Los Angeles. She met Mr. Kitaj in 1970 while working for the Los Angeles art-print publisher Gemini G.E.L. She and Mr. Kitaj were married in 1983.         Although Ms. Fisher's work tended to be small, she was beginning to enjoy success for her public commissions. At the time of her death, two posters she designed for the London Transport's Art on the Underground series had brought her wide attention in London and she was at work on a series of paintings for the reconstruction of the Globe Theater.         Ms. Fisher's most recent show was at the Lefevre Gallery in London in 1993.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by their son, Max; a stepson, Lem Dobbs of Los Angeles; a stepdaughter, Dominie Kitaj of London; her father, Gene, of Tucson, Ariz.; her mother, Ethel, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a sister, Margaret, of Emeryville, Calif., and a stepgrandson, Joe Kitaj of Los Angeles.       
         Margaret Brown Klapthor, an expert on White House history and a former department chairman at the Smithsonian Institution, died on Monday at her home in Washington. She was 72.         The cause was stomach cancer, said a son, Paul Edward Klapthor of Sumter, S.C.         Mrs. Klapthor retired from the Smithsonian in 1983. She first went to work there as a scientific aide in 1943, and rose through the curatorial ranks in its divisions of civil and political history, becoming curator of the Smithsonian's First Ladies collection and chairman of the institution's department of national and military history.         Among her writings is the historical text in "The First Ladies Cook Book: Favorite Recipes of All the Presidents of the United States," an illustrated volume of historical lore and recipes. It was published for Parents' Magazine Press in 1965, and went through several editions.         The book was praised by Craig Claiborne, then the food critic for The New York Times, who called it "perhaps the most comprehensive and detailed volume ever written" about "what American Presidents and their wives have dined on."         It reported, for example, that Ulysses S. Grant personally selected the wines to be served at formal dinners, "though his own glass was usually turned down"; that Chester A. Arthur was an epicure who savored fine wines, and that William McKinley's taste ran to fried potatoes, bacon and eggs, johnnycakes and cherry pie.         Mrs. Klapthor also wrote "First Ladies" (sixth edition 1990, White House Historical Society) and was a co-author, with her father, Paul D. Brown, of "The History of Charles County, Maryland," in 1958.         She gave lectures on White House history that detailed the occupants' idiosyncrasies, like Dolley Madison's conversational icebreaker of reading a passage from whatever book she was carrying at the time.         In the 1950's, when Mrs. Klapthor was in charge of the gowns of White House hostesses, she discovered Dolley Madison's inauguration gown, which had been kept by heirs. She traced it to the William Rockwell Nelson Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and the gallery then sent it to the Smithsonian on indefinite loan.         As associate curator in the division of political history, Mrs. Klapthor assembled a Smithsonian collection of White House china in connection with her creation of First Ladies Hall, a modernized setting for the Smithsonian's First Ladies costume collection.         Sometimes she talked about more recent First Ladies. In 1988, commenting on reports of summit talk tiffs between Nancy Reagan and Raisa M. Gorbachev, the wife of the Soviet leader, Mrs. Klapthor said in an interview in The Times, "It struck me as something that had been manufactured by the press."         Mrs. Klapthor was born in Henderson, Ky., reared in Charles County and graduated from the University of Maryland.         In the last 21 years she suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, and was confined to a wheelchair for the last two years. Her husband, Frank Edward Klapthor, died earlier this year.         Besides her son Paul, she is survived by another son, Carlson Brown Klapthor of Washington; a daughter, Frances Andrews of Baltimore; a sister, Mary Berry Moore of Port Tobacco, Md., and four grandchildren.       
         Sister Parish, the acclaimed and enduring American interior decorator who began her career when she was a young Depression-era mother and later came to redesign rooms of the White House during the Kennedy Administration, died on Thursday at her home in Dark Harbor, Maine. She was 84 and also had a home in New York City.         She had suffered a lengthy illness, said Dorothy B. Gilbert, one of her daughters.         Mrs. Parish's six decades of decorating epitomized the rise of women in her own and other professions in 20th-century America. The one-room business she founded in 1933 in Far Hills, N.J., evolved into the noted decorating firm of Parish-Hadley Associates, based in Manhattan, whose designs consistently exuded quality.         The anxious 23-year-old of 1933 -- whose nursery nickname had replaced her seldom-used given name, Dorothy -- went on to become a force in forming and articulating tastes in interior design. Vogue magazine once said she was "the most famous of all living women interior designers, whose ideas have influenced life styles all over America." 'Patrician Aplomb'         John Richardson, an art historian, wrote in 1989, "No one else in America does a room with such patrician aplomb, such life-enhancing charm, such a lack of gimmickry or trendiness."         With a profile that seemed carved from the Maine coastline, her longtime home and design influence, Mrs. Parish was a strong traditionalist. "What seems important to me is permanence, comfort and a look of continuity in the design and decoration of a house," she once observed. "The happiest times of my life are associated with beautiful, familiar things and family."         She and her firm became known for the low-keyed handsomeness of their work and for their well-heeled and relatively conservative clientele. It included President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy; the philanthropists Brooke Astor and Enid Annenberg Haupt; William S. Paley, the chairman of CBS, and members of the Bronfman, Getty, Mellon, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney clans.         In 1988, one of Queen Elizabeth II's daughters-in-law, the Duchess of York, asked the firm to design the interior of the ducal couple's new house near Windsor Castle. But the assignment was eventually switched to a British designer, and the British press reported that the Queen thought the Americans' plans were too expensive. Still Working in Her 80's         Mrs. Parish stayed on as a partner in the firm into her 80's, proving to be a notably durable member of a pioneer cohort of American women who came to prominence as interior decorators between the two world wars.         Mrs. Parish is widely considered to have originated, in the 1960's, the decorating idiom that became known as American country style: she was an early and influential champion of the humble striped cloth called mattress ticking, which had traditionally covered mattresses, using it for slipcovers and on throw pillows.         She saw no conflict between innovation and traditionalism. As she wrote in HG magazine in 1990, "Years ago, my partner, Albert Hadley, and I were delighted when patchwork quilts, four-poster beds, painted floors, knitted throws, rag rugs and hand-woven bedsteads were first listed among the 'innovations' of our firm."         "The list sounds old-fashioned, and no decorator wants to be that," she continued, "but Albert and I understood that innovation is often the ability to reach into the past and bring back what is good, what is beautiful, what is lasting." Father Collected Antiques         Mrs. Parish's own girlhood was, if not regal, at least baronial. She was born Dorothy May Kinnicutt in July 15, 1910, in Morristown, N.J., the daughter of G. Hermann Kinnicutt and the former May Appleton Tuckerman, who had homes in Manhattan, Maine and Paris, as well as New Jersey.         Mrs. Parish's father was a collector of antiques (as was a cousin, Dorothy Draper, who also became a renowned decorator). Much later she would recall the distaste she felt as a child for the furniture her father collected, "that awful English brown," as she put it.         As a teen-ager, she saw painted French furniture in Paris -- and experienced a revelation.         She went to the Chapin School in Manhattan and to the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., made her debut and was married to Mr. Parish in 1930 in Manhattan with, as The New York Times reported at the time, "a representative gathering of old New York families on hand." Decorating a Farmhouse         After her marriage, she and her husband had a home on East End Avenue in Manhattan -- which had been done by a decorator -- and a farmhouse in Far Hills, N.J., which Mrs. Parish herself decorated, with gusto.         Her handiwork was admired, friends began coming to her for help with decorating, and she later confidently recalled that "it never occurred to me that I wasn't qualified to give it."         It was four years after the Wall Street crash of 1929 that Mrs. Parish, who had never received a high school diploma, opened her first office. Hard times were coming upon her husband and her father, both blue-blooded stockbrokers. She called her business "Mrs. Henry Parish 2d Interiors" and placed it in Far Hills.         The success that followed was fueled by her taste, talent and strength of will. Mr. Hadley, who joined forces with her in 1962, said in 1991 that "Sis always knows when a room is right and a room is not." She was famed for creating a homey "undecorated look."  'Money, Big Money'         In some ways, Mrs. Parish's rise was made easier by her upper-crust roots, and her earliest work was decorating the houses of friends.         Decorating by Mrs. Parish and her firm also acquired a reputation for being expensive. The New York Times columnist Charlotte Curtis wrote in 1985 that Parish-Hadley work "costs money, big money."         But Mrs. Parish also had an economical streak. In the mid-1960's, she acquired a batch of turn-of-the-century golden oak furniture at a bargain basement price, the story goes, then painted it white and used it in decorating a house that she and her husband had bought in Maine.         As the design editor Elaine Greene wrote later in The New York Times, "when shown in the January 1967 issue of House & Garden, the house dazzled decorators the way Christian Dior's 1947 New Look did the fashion world."         The white furniture and other furnishings in the house -- including soft-hued chintz, needlework, hand-crafted cotton rugs and paintings of dogs -- became staples of the style. Decorating for the Kennedys         Mrs. Parish met Jacqueline Kennedy socially in the late 1950's and helped her decorate the house in the Georgetown section of Washington where she and her husband, John F. Kennedy, lived while he was a Senator. After Mr. Kennedy was elected President, his wife made Mrs. Parish a consultant in her redecorating of the White House.         Mrs. Kennedy also named her to a committee that was formed to help furnish the White House with authentic pieces from a century and a half earlier.         Speaking of Mrs. Kennedy's plans for redoing the family quarters in the building, Mrs. Parish said early in 1961 that the nation's new First Lady was a person of "simple tastes who wants to create a home."         The walls of the family quarters were done in pastel tones -- the private drawing room was eventually done in yellow and white.         In the years since, there have been persistent reports that Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Parish -- who could be blunt and acerbic -- had a falling-out over the White House. As Town & Country magazine recounted it in 1988, the First Lady "fired Sister for telling little Caroline to keep her feet off the upholstery. Sister would later describe the experience in explicit, harsh terms."         But Mrs. Parish could go to enormous lengths to please a client. Sally Bedell Smith wrote in her 1990 book "In All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley" that in a single bedroom Mrs. Parish and Mr. Hadley did in the 1960's in Mr. Paley's Fifth Avenue duplex, "a painter worked for five months applying 18 coats of paint -- six different shadings just for the base, plus glazing."         Mr. Parish died in 1977, having spent 34 years with the Wall Street securities firm of Loeb Rhoades & Company.         Mrs. Parish is survived by her daughters, Mrs. Gilbert of Hot Springs, Ark., and May Appleton Bartlett of Boston; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Jessica Tandy, who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have, died yesterday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 85.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the actor Hume Cronyn.         Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film "Driving Miss Daisy." In the years between, she and Mr. Cronyn, played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day.         With the role of Blanche Dubois, Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood's leading ladies, to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage. The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance, which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called "incredibly true." Almost four decades later, another New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of her, "Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should be allowed to write about her."         When she was 80 years old, she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in "Driving Miss Daisy." It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and, at last, an Academy Award. When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one. She vowed to go on working, although she said she hoped she would know when to stop, "before they have to get the hook." The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of "Foxfire," of which her husband was was a co-writer. Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work, completing three films and two television dramas. A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs         When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together, in "The Fourposter" in 1951, audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater. One triumph followed another, culminating in "The Gin Game" in 1977 and "Foxfire" in 1982.         By 1986, when they appeared in "The Petition," Mr. Rich was writing of "their legendary theatrical relationship" and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as "an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again." Mel Gussow, another drama critic for The Times, called them "two actors at their summit." He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together, it was "a matter of hearts, minds and bodies in creative harmony."         One of their last projects together was "To Dance With the White Dog," a television movie that had its premiere last year. At last night'a Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Cronyn was named best actor in a mini-series or special for his performance as a recently widowed man mourning his wife. Miss Tandy was nominated for best actress but did not win. A clip from the movie was shown during the awards ceremony in a brief tribute to her.         When they took "The Gin Game" to Moscow in 1979, they won the accolade that Mr. Cronyn treasures above all others. Oleg N. Yefremov, the director of the renowned Moscow Art Theater, wrote in his review, "It takes a couple of actors from America to remind us what Stanislavsky was talking about."         Miss Tandy was nominated five times for a Tony and won three: in 1948 for her role as Blanche Dubois, for "The Gin Game" in 1978, and for "Foxfire" in 1983. Mr. Cronyn was also nominated for "The Gin Game" but did not win. "I was bitterly disappointed," Miss Tandy said. "His performance is part of mine. I think he's very proud when I win, and vice versa."         In July 1994 they were honored with a special Tony for their life's work in the theater. They had already received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal, in December 1986, and the National Medal of Art, from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature         Miss Tandy acted in more than 100 stage productions during her 67-year career, which began in England and encompassed the West End in London as well as the British provinces, Broadway, and the regional theaters that were once so important to the American stage. She appeared in more than 25 movies and played the leading role in a number of television programs, developing from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft, a star adored by directors for her serenity. There was no temperament; there were no tantrums. Elia Kazan, her director in "Streetcar" said: "She's absolutely sweet-natured. She does her job; she has a sense of humor."         With each performance her reviews got better. "I think I've gotten better," she said when she was 77. "I've gotten more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrusted myself. I'd be in things I felt weren't being done right and I didn't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me."         Miss Tandy, who became an American citizen in 1954, was born in London on June 7, 1909. Her father died when she was 12 and her mother took clerical and teaching jobs at night to supplement her regular income as headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two older brothers were read to a lot, Miss Tandy recalled in 1986: "good stuff, poetry."         "I had an appreciation of the words. We were also taken to theater. I sat in a lot of galleries. It was a magical time, but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never wanted it to end." She also grew to love Shakespeare, one of the few in her class who did. "Almost everyone would say, 'Oh, God, it's Shakespeare this afternoon.' To me it was heaven."         Her brothers would stage family theatricals in their five-room flat in northeast London, but she said she did not show any promise. "I was a graceless lump," she recalled. "My brothers would always say, 'Oh, Mummy, do we really have to have her in it?' "         Nevertheless, her love of the theater led her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where, in 1924, she began three years of dramatic training. She was 18 when she made her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in "The Manderson Girls." The salary was $:2 a week, out of which she somehow had to pay for the five elegant costumes her part required. She managed by sewing them herself.  Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling         She was convinced that she was plain and that there was nothing to be done about it. "I had absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I did," she said. Her self-confidence was not enhanced by her many letters of recommendation. She remembered that each one of them said, "Don't be put off by how she looks." But if she ever was an ugly duckling -- and there are many photographs that suggest she was not -- a swan finally emerged, for in her later years she was a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkling eyes of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically, saying: "In a way it was rather good. I didn't get the part of the young ingenue. I got more interesting parts."         In 1929 she made her West End debut in "The Rumor," by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro, but it was in 1932, in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe's "Children in Uniform," that she became recognized as a gifted actress. It was a role that also afforded her one of her most treasured moments in the theater. "There was one performance when the audience didn't clap at all, they were so moved," she recalled.         During the 1930's she appeared in more than two dozen contemporary plays, but in the English tradition honed her skill on the classics, especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she was Ophelia to John Gielgud's legendary Hamlet. She was Viola in Tyrone Guthrie's 1937 production of "Twelfth Night" at the Old Vic in London, where she twice shared the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940, she returned to the Old Vic as Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear.         The offer of a role in "The Matriarch" brought her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten years later, when the war in Europe had begun and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins was ending, she settled in the United States. There was the lure of Hollywood, and there was the need to support her 6-year-old daughter, Susan. She was allowed to take only $:10 out of the country, and despite her long list of credits, it was such a struggle to make ends meet that she almost abandoned the stage.         In 1940, while she was appearing in A. J. Cronin's "Jupiter Laughs," a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn called on her backstage. Two years later they moved to Hollywood and were married. A son, Chris, was born in 1943 and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. They, her daughter Susan, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive her, in addition to her husband. Maids' Roles Ended, Thanks to Cronyn         In Hollywood, Mr. Cronyn landed some interesting roles in the movies, but Miss Tandy's career languished. At one point she even told friends she was thinking of giving up acting. She appeared with Mr. Cronyn in "The Seventh Cross" (1944) and played bit parts in several other movies, including the role of a ladies' maid in "Forever Amber" (1947), but having to say lines like "Yes, Mum" and 'No, Mum" in yet another movie became very discouraging, she recalled many years later. "I'd had a good start and I was in the doldrums in Hollywood," she said. "It was not a happy position. I began to feel I had no talent and it was all a pipe dream. It was Hume who got me out of it."         He got her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in "Portrait of a Madonna," a play by Tennessee Williams that he was directing in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave reviews brought Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York, where he was casting his new play, "A Streetcar Named Desire." He wrote in his "Memoirs," "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche."         The play, co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter as Blanche's sister, Stella, won rapturous reviews, a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and ran for more than two years on Broadway before going on a national tour. Years later, Mr. Kazan remembered the joy of directing Miss Tandy. "She's perfect," he said. "She never stops working and she's always full of little surprises. She always does things a little better than you think she will."         Mr. Atkinson, writing about Miss Tandy's performance in The New York Times, said, "It does seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, revealing and true."         A contrary view was expressed by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently published autobiography. In "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the actor wrote: "I think Jessica and I were both miscast, and between us we threw the play out of balance. Jessica is a very good actress, but I never thought she was believable as Blanche. I didn't think she had the finesse or cultivated femininity that the part required, nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned."         When "Streetcar" was filmed, the part of Blanche went to Vivien Leigh; it was the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script         She said that in creating a character, "You have to get over 'how' you're doing it and know 'why' you're doing it. Once you forget about the 'how' you get the appearance of reality." She believed the secret to a character was in the script and that it was the actor's duty to "dig it out." She said: "I'm slow about it. I keep going back to the script, the script, the script."         To Miss Tandy, audience reaction was part of a play. She said, "It's not a matter of whether they're laughing or not but whether they're breathing or not." But audiences, like the theater itself, underwent profound changes during Miss Tandy's years on the stage. "The trouble with the theater," she said in 1986, "is that it's no longer a way of life for an audience. It's just a way to kill an evening." One of the theater's problems, she said, was "we are so inundated with entertainment."         "Now you flick a switch," she continued. "It's not the event it used to be."         She said theater people had contributed to the problem by removing the curtain. "People come into the theater and they sit there watching the first scene and talking about what they've bought in Bloomingdale's that day. When you had a curtain, when the footlights went up on the curtain, and then the curtain itself went up, you were part of an experience."         As for the actors, Miss Tandy said she hated to have to grope her way across a dark stage, stumbling into the furniture, "instead of getting on stage and having a moment to think about what you're going to do." Joe Mankiewicz, the film director who was a longtime friend, said that while Lynn Fontanne always had to make an entrance, "to Jessie the way she was when she got there was what was important."  Loved to Play In the Classics         Miss Tandy was always eager to perform in regional theaters and, with Mr. Cronyn, was among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launched his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of stars of their magnitude helped put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who followed was the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie's first season in 1963, for example, Miss Tandy played Gertrude in Hamlet, Olga in "The Three Sisters" and the wife of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman." She also acted in the Shakespeare festivals in Stratford, Conn., and Stratford, Ontario. In 1983 she starred in a revival of an American classic, Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie." Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "You pass up Miss Tandy's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril."         She hated the experience of seeing herself in the movies. "It's a very humbling experience to watch yourself," she said. But while the satisfaction of film never came close to the joy of a live performance, she said she felt it was important to accept roles that were offered to her; it helped pay expenses when she took parts at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She played Mr. Cronyn's wife in four of her most recent films, "Honky Tonk Freeway," (1981) "Cocoon," (1984), "Batteries Not Included" (1987) and "Cocoon: The Return" (1988). In 1991, Miss Tandy, then 82, played an indomitable 82-year-old woman in "Fried Green Tomatoes."         Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 plays on Broadway and dozens of Off Broadway and regional productions during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they went they were asked how they tolerated so much togetherness. "It's hard sometimes," she acknowledged, "but we always manage to give ourselves space. We don't live in each other's pockets. We don't take the play home with us. We do make suggestions to each other, and if we don't agree we respect each other's views." She burst out laughing and recalled Dame Sybil Thorndike's response when asked whether she ever considered divorcing her husband, with whom she had long shared the stage. "Divorce? Never. Murder? Frequently."         In her 70's and even into her 80's, Miss Tandy continued to take on strenuous parts, despite increased difficulty with memorization and stage fright that had got worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that caused her collapse onstage during a performance of "Foxfire" in Los Angeles in 1985 did not slow her down. Nor did major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appeared in the television movies "The Story Lady" (1991) and "To Dance With the White Dog" (1993) and completed three more feature films: "Used People" (1992) and "Camilla" and "Nobody's Fool," which are to be released this fall.         "Jessie adores working," Mr. Cronyn said in 1986. "She's more fully alive when she's working." As she got older she seemed to be in ever greater demand, but over the years she took good parts and she took bad parts. "You are richer for doing things," she said. "If you wait for the perfect part or for what sends you, you will have long waits, and you deteriorate. You can't be an actor without acting." A DEDICATED LIFE IN THE PUBLIC EYE         During a 67-year acting career in Britain and the United States, Jessica Tandy appeared in more than 100 plays, more than 25 movies and numerous television shows. Here is a sampling.

The year was 1989. In some editions the obituary also misstated the year for the film "Fried Green Tomatoes." It was 1991.       
         Martha Raye, the big-mouthed, big-hearted entertainer whose career spanned the decades from vaudeville to videos, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         In recent years, she had suffered a serious of ailments, including a stroke and circulatory difficulties. Ron Wise, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai, said, "Her death was an aggregate of that and other problems."         Miss Raye sang, she danced, she acted on Broadway, in Hollywood and on television, but the knockabout comic won perhaps her greatest renown as an indefatigable trouper who traveled thousands of miles through three wars to lift the morale of America's fighting forces.         "They ask so little and give so much," she said during the Vietnam War. "The least we can do back home here is give them the love, the respect and the dignity that they, our flag and our country deserve."         Her real name was Margie Yvonne Reed. She was born on Aug. 27, 1916, into a show-business family in the charity ward of a hospital in Butte, Mont. Her father and mother, Pete Reed and the former Peggy Hooper, were Irish immigrants whose song-and-dance routine, under the name Reed and Hooper, took them to carnivals and vaudeville houses around the United States.         "I didn't work until I was 3," Miss Raye was to say years later. "But after that, I never stopped."         Her mother taught her to read and write while the family, which also included her sister and brother, crisscrossed the country. From time to time, she attended schools in Montana, Chicago and New York.         "Our home was in an old, broken down Pierce Arrow auto which my father drove," Miss Raye remembered. "We put the scenery in the back seat and that was where we slept at night. We cooked on Sterno. And we went from town to town, looking for bookings."         She played burlesque houses, nightclubs and saloons, where she said she worked for tips only. "On a good night, I made a dollar," she said. "On a bad one, 25 cents."         At 15, she was singing, dancing and clowning in a children's act. She picked the name Martha Raye from a phone book and piled up the credits. She was a member of the Benny Davis Revue and the Ben Blue Company, a trouper on the Loew's vaudeville circuit, a member of the Will Morrisey act and a feature performer in "Earl Carroll's Sketchbook" and "Calling All Stars."         Eventually she made her way to Hollywood. And on one of the Sunday nights when stars gathered and entertained one another at the Trocadero nightclub, she got a couple of her friends to play straightmen to her comedy. Their names were Jimmy Durante and Joe E. Lewis. The producer Norman Taurog saw her perform, and the next day she was working with Bing Crosby on the 1936 film "Rhythm on the Range." She did a slapstick drunk scene and sang a song called "Mr. Paganini," and became a star overnight.         Miss Raye appeared in films like "Waikiki Wedding," "College Holiday," "Give Me a Sailor," "Keep 'em Flying" and "Hellzapoppin." In 1940, she starred on Broadway opposite Al Jolson in the revue "Hold Onto Your Hats." She appeared on his radio show and the programs of Eddie Cantor and Bob Hope.         During World War II, she began entertaining troops, and the 1944 film "Four Jills in a Jeep" was based on a U.S.O. tour of bases in England and Africa she made in the company of Kay Francis, Carole Landis and Mitzi Mayfair.         In 1969, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Miss Raye the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her wartime efforts, and she was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993.         She was not happy about her Hollywood career, except for "Monsieur Verdoux," Charlie Chaplin's controversial 1947 black comedy about a Parisian Bluebeard who marries and kills for money. "I must have made 35 or 40 movies and most of them were mindless," Miss Raye said. "But in those days actors didn't fight the system; then we thought we were lucky to be under contract."         Her performance in "Verdoux," in which she portrayed Annabella Bonheur, a raucous, indestructible wife of the killer, was praised as brilliant by Bosley Crowther of The New York Times. "Do you know," she recalled in 1972, "that when Chaplin called to offer me the part, I hung up on him; I thought it was a joke."         She blamed her decline in Hollywood on executives who focused on her shapely legs and ability to fill out a sweater. "They tried to make a glamour girl out of me," the brown-haired, blue-eyed actress complained. "Let's face it, I'm not a glamour girl. I'm a clown."         Despite her setbacks in Hollywood, she was far from finished. Milton Berle gave her a start in television, and by 1954, she was the medium's reigning female comedian. Ahead of her was more success in nightclubs, cabaret and theater.         Offstage, life was darker. "As an entertainer, she's a genius," one of her colleagues once said. "Socially, she's completely unsure of herself."         She married again and again. Among her husbands were the makeup artist Buddy Westmore, the composer David Rose, the businessman Neal Lang, the dancers Nick Condos and Edward Begley and the policeman Robert O'Shea. Her last marriage was in 1991, to 42-year-old Mark Harris, her manager.         She had a daughter, Melody, by Mr. Condos. After Miss Raye suffered a stroke in 1991, she and Melody battled in court over control of the actress's money. In July 1992, Miss Raye filed a lawsuit alleging that the 1991 Bette Midler-James Caan film "For the Boys" wrongfully appropriated her life story. A judge dismissed the $5 million complaint earlier this year.         In her later years, many people knew Miss Raye as the star of Polident commercials.         She is survived by her husband and her daughter.       
         Mary G. Roebling, former chairwoman of the National State Bank, one of New Jersey's largest independent banks, and a former governor of the American Stock Exchange, died on Tuesday at her home in Trenton. She was 89.         The cause was renal failure, The Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Roebling retired in 1984 as chairman of the National State Bank in Elizabeth, N.J., which then had assets of $1.2 billion.         Earlier, she became the first woman to head a major American bank, the Trenton Trust Company. In 1937, at the age of 30, she was named its president. It grew substantially and she was its president or chairman or both until 1972, when Trenton Trust was acquired by National State. She was then elected chairman of the combined institutions.         Mrs. Roebling was also a founder, in 1978, of the Women's Bank N.A. of Denver, the first nationally chartered bank founded by women. She went on to serve as its chairman until 1983. In addition, she was the American Stock Exchange's first woman governor, from 1958 to 1962.         Mrs. Roebling also served as a director of numerous other corporations over the years, was active in many civic, charitable and educational organizations, and was a tireless advocate of a greater role for women in the country's economic affairs.         In a speech in 1965, Mrs. Roebling said: "As a woman who for years has competed in the business world, I would be the first to agree that the American woman has almost unbelievable economic power, but American women, like women of all civilized nations, do not use the influence their economic power gives them."         Mrs. Roebling's own economic power came initially through inheritance, but she increased it vastly once it fell into her hands. She was bequeathed a large block of Trenton Trust stock by her millionaire second husband, Siegfried Roebling, whose family had long been prominent in engineering and cable manufacturing. He was a great-grandson of John A. Roebling, who designed the Brooklyn Bridge, and a grandson of Col. Washington A. Roebling, who completed its construction.         Siegfried Roebling died in 1936, of a heart attack. Mrs. Roebling's father and father-in-law then urged her to try her hand at running the bank. She had preparation for the job: she had worked for a Philadelphia investment house while taking business courses at night and, the two men told her, she had another important qualification, common sense.         The rest was banking history. She took her husband's seat on the bank's board and, on Jan. 21, 1937, was elected president.         "Mary G. Roebling didn't wait for women's lib," Forbes magazine once wrote, "she was ahead of it, way ahead."         By 1970, Mrs. Roebling estimated that 300 other American women had become presidents or chairwomen of banks. But in 1978, when she became chairwoman of the Women's Bank, she argued that there still was a place in the business world for banks that were operated specifically for female customers.         "Women's banks can be better listeners for women and give them more time, advice and direction than an ordinary bank would give," she told an interviewer. "It's a psychological thing, really."         She continued to be active in male-dominated spheres, however: in 1978, after having served as a civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army in several administrations, she became the founding president of the newly formed Army War College Foundation. It was set up to support the college's fund-raising and other activities.         She was born Mary Gindhart in 1907 in West Collingswood, N.J., the daughter of Isaac D. Gindhart Jr., a telephone company executive, and Mary Simon Gindhart, a music teacher. She went to public schools in Haddonfield and Moorestown, N.J., and earned pocket money picking strawberries for a penny a box.         While still a teen-ager, she married a musician, Arthur Herbert, but he died three years later, leaving her with a daughter to support. She went to work in Philadelphia and took evening courses in merchandising and business administration at the University of Pennsylvania.         She left her job when she married Mr. Roebling, becoming a housewife again until his death.         Over the years, Mrs. Roebling was variously a director of the Tattersall Corporation, the Standard Fire Insurance Company and the Colonial Operating Company, in Trenton, among other concerns; an officer of the New York World's Fair Corporation in 1964 and 1965; a member of the National Business Council on Consumer Affairs and of the Boy Scouts of America's national advisory council, and an active participant in other nonprofit organizations. She was awarded numerous honorary degrees and other honors.         She is survived by a daughter, Betty Hobin of Palm Beach, Fla., and Hopewell Township, N.J.; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren, and a sister, Margaret G. Finley of Haddonfield, N.J. A son, Paul Roebling, died in July.       
         Wilma Rudolph, who grew from a sickly child unable to walk into a statuesque athlete of 20 who won three gold medals as a sprinter in the 1960 Olympics in Rome, died yesterday at her home in Brentwood, Tenn., near Nashville. She was 54.         Her sister, Charlene Rudolph, said Rudolph learned in July that she had a malignant brain tumor.         Rudolph was a handsome, regal woman, 6 feet tall, charming, graceful and gracious. Over seven days, she became the first woman to win three gold medals in track and field in one Olympics. She also became America's greatest female sports hero since Babe Didrikson Zaharias a generation earlier.         She competed in an era in which Olympic sports such as track and field were completely amateur, and for years later, as a frequent spokeswoman for Olympic-family organizations and causes, she preached the idealism of that bygone era.         "I love what the Olympics stand for," she said. "They'll always be a part of me."         As Barbara Heilman wrote in Sports Illustrated, "She can command a look of mingled graciousness and hauteur that suggests a duchess, but in a crowd that is one part Skeeter and 5,000 parts people, young men and babies will come to her in 30 seconds."         Skeeter was the nickname bestowed by her high school basketball coach, Clinton Gray, who considered her more mosquito than basketball player. "You're just like a skeeter," he said. "You're little, you're fast and you always get in my way."         Her life story was so dramatic that in 1977 it became a two-hour prime-time television movie. The movie was written, produced and directed by her friend Bud Greenspan, the Olympic historian.         "She was the Jesse Owens of women's track and field, and like Jesse, she changed the sport for all time," he said. "She became the benchmark for little black girls to aspire."         Wilma Glodean Rudolph was born on June 23, 1940, in the St. Bethlehem section of Clarksville, Tenn., 45 miles north of Nashville, and grew up in Clarksville. She was the 20th of 22 children of Ed Rudolph, a railroad porter, from two marriages. Her mother, Blanche, was a domestic.         The child weighed four and a half pounds at birth. At age 4, she contracted double pneumonia and scarlet fever simultaneously and almost died. The illnesses left her left leg paralyzed, and once a week, on her mother's day off, the mother made a 90-mile round trip with her to Nashville for heat and water treatment on the leg.         At 6, she started to hop on one leg. At 8, she started to walk with a leg brace. Later, an orthopedic shoe replaced the brace. One day, when she was 11, her mother found her playing basketball in her bare feet. That was the end of the special shoe and the beginning of a fabled sports career.         "My father pushed me to become competitive," she wrote in a 1978 autobiography, "Wilma." "With so many children, when you did something with one, you always had another along. He felt that sports would help me overcome the problems."         At 13, she went out for the high school basketball team and twice made the all-state team. She would sometimes skip school to run on a track across the street. Her talent intrigued Ed Temple, the renowned coach at Tennessee State University in Nashville, and at his invitation she attended his summer track camps.         In 1956, a 16-year-old stringbean of 89 pounds, she ran in the Melbourne Olympics. To her dismay, she was eliminated in the 200-meter heats. She did win a bronze medal in the 400-meter relay.         Then she returned to high school. When she graduated, Temple gave her an athletic scholarship at Tennessee State. Bulked up to 130 pounds, she made the 1960 Olympic team. Temple was the women's coach.         The day before the 100 meters in the Rome Olympics, she stepped into a hole in the infield of the practice track and twisted an ankle. It became swollen and discolored. The next day, the ankle held up, and with her fluid running style she won her semifinal in 11.3 seconds, equaling the world record. She won the final easily in 11.0 seconds, but the following wind of 6.15 miles an hour (the allowable limit is 4.47) precluded recognition as a world record.         In the 200 meters, she set an Olympic record of 23.2 seconds in the heats and won the final easily in 24.0 seconds into a stiff wind. In the 400-meter relay, with college teammates running the first three legs, she helped set a world record of 44.4 seconds in a heat. In the final, after a bad baton pass to her, she turned a two-yard deficit into a three-yard victory in 44.5 seconds.         "After the playing of 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' " she wrote in her autobiography, "I came away from the victory stand and I was mobbed. People were jumping all over me, putting microphones into my face, pounding my back, and I couldn't believe it."         She returned to college and earned a degree in education in 1961. She was voted the 1961 Sullivan Award as America's outstanding amateur athlete, male or female.         But there was no money for amateurs then and no professional track, so she set out to make a living. She taught second grade and coached high school basketball and track in Tennessee, all for $400 a month. Then she ran a community center in Indiana for $600 a month.         She last raced in 1962. She quit, she said, because "I couldn't top what I did, so I'll be remembered for when I was at my best."         In time, she became a spokeswoman for a movie studio, a baking company and other businesses. At DePauw University in Indiana, she coached briefly and recruited minority-group students. She established the Wilma Rudolph Foundation, working with youngsters and sending tutors to schools with books on American heros.         "If I have anything to leave," she said, "the foundation is my legacy."         She was voted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, the Helms Hall of Fame, the Women's Sports Foundation Hall of Fame and the Black Athletes Hall of Fame. In 1988, Tennessee State named an indoor track in her honor. In 1990, she became the first woman to receive the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Silver Anniversary Award, even though she competed before the N.C.A.A. sponsored women's championships in any sport.         Once, when she was asked how certain other runners compared with her, she declined to answer.  "I'm selfish," she said. "I think I was in a class all by myself."         She married William Ward in 1961 and was divorced the next year. In 1963, she married Robert Eldridge, whom she had known since second grade. They were divorced in 1976.         Her father died in 1961 and her mother died in May. She is survived by her four children with Mr. Eldridge -- daughters Yolanda Jones and Djuana Bowers and sons Robert and Xurry -- five sisters and two brothers, and seven grandchildren.         Correction:  November 25, 1994, Friday         An obituary of Wilma Rudolph on Nov. 13, as well as a Sports of The Times column that day, misstated her accomplishment in winning three gold medals in track and field at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. She was the first American woman to win three or more medals in one Olympics, not the first woman; Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands won four gold medals at the 1948 Games in London.       
         Catherine Filene Shouse, the philanthropist and arts patron who was the founder and major benefactor of the Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts in Virginia, died yesterday at her home in Naples, Fla. She was 98 and also had homes in Washington, Easton, Md., and Vienna, Va., where Wolf Trap is situated.         The cause of death was heart failure, said Carol Harford, a longtime friend who is president emeritus of the Wolf Trap Foundation, which presents the park's arts programs under the auspices of the Department of the Interior.         Mrs. Shouse, the heiress to a retailing fortune, was a lifelong champion of the performing arts whose accomplishments and philanthropic ventures earned recognition from the highest quarters. In 1977, President Gerald Ford gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A year earlier, Queen Elizabeth II had made her Dame Commander of the British Empire. This past October, she was among 12 Americans to receive the National Medal of Arts.         Catherine Filene was born in Boston in 1896. Her grandfather, William Filene, was the founder of the Filene's department-store chain, and her father, Lincoln Filene, founded Federated Department Stores. She graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., in 1918, and earned a master's degree in education at Harvard University in 1923.         Over seven decades, Mrs. Shouse held a remarkable variety of public and private posts. In 1919, she became the first woman appointed to the Democratic National Committee, and in the mid-1920's, she served under President Calvin Coolidge as chairwoman of the First Federal Prison for Women, where she instituted a job training and rehabilitation program.         In the 1940's, she became a dog breeder, importing hunting dogs from Germany and Switzerland and starting her own kennel at Wolf Trap Farm, a tract of land across the Potomac River, 15 miles west of Washington, that she had purchased in 1930.         In 1949, she joined the National Symphony Orchestra's board, and she served as its vice president from 1951 through 1968. In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her to the first board of the National Cultural Center, now known as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to which she was reappointed twice by President Richard M. Nixon. As late as 1991, she was invited by the Yale School of Music to serve on its board.         Mrs. Shouse's most lasting legacy, however, is Wolf Trap. In 1966, at the age of 70, she donated 100 acres of the farm in Vienna to the United States Government to create a national park for the performing arts. There, under the auspices of the Department of the Interior, Mrs. Shouse established the Wolf Trap Foundation to manage the park, arrange programming and raise money, a unique partnership among the public and private sectors for managing an arts center. The park opened in 1971 and since then has been home to performances by some of the world's great musicians, dancers, singers and actors.         In 1982, the main amphitheater burned to the ground, but Mrs. Shouse led the drive to resurrect it, and a new theater, the 7,000-seat Filene Center (half the $18 million cost came from a Congressional appropriation), opened in 1984. It is now visited by some 500,000 people annually.         During her last decade, Mrs. Shouse, who was known to her friends as Kay, suffered from arthritis but remained a familiar figure at Wolf Trap, touring the grounds in a golf cart.         She was married twice, in 1921, to Alvin E. Dodd, a businessman from whom she was divorced in 1930. Two years later, she married Jouett Shouse, the chairman of the Democratic National Executive Committee. Shouse, a lawyer and businessman, had been a Congressman from Kansas and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Coolidge. He died in 1967.         Mrs. Shouse is survived by a daughter, Joan Dodd Tolley of Naples, four grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Moton Hubbard, who was deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs from 1964 to 1970, making her the top-ranking black woman in the Johnson Administration at the time, died on Sunday at her home in Chevy Chase, Md. She was 82.         Ms. Hubbard, who retired in 1970 at the onset of Cushing's disease, an adrenal disorder, died of congestive heart failure, said Marc L. Alper of Rockview, Md., a family friend.         In her State Department post, she worked at developing programs intended to eliminate discrimination against black soldiers during the Vietnam War. She also oversaw the department's public services and news offices.         During World War II, she worked for the Federal Security Agency, helping to organize arrangements for war workers and was a race and human relations consultant. She joined the State Department in 1963 as a coordinator of women's activities.         The daughter of a pioneer in the civil rights movement, Dr. Robert Russa Moton, she grew up on the campus of Tuskegee Institute, where her father had succeeded its founder, Booker T. Washington, as president. She was educated at Boston University.         Her husband, Maceo W. Hubbard, a Justice Department official, died in 1991. She is survived by two sisters, Catherine Patterson of Exeter, N.H., and Jennie Moton Taylor of Indianapolis.       
         Kathleen P. Mahon, a lawyer who represented Federal law-enforcement officers, died yesterday at her home in Syosset, L.I. She was 49.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         She graduated from Hofstra University and its law school, and was a partner in the firm of Mahon & Berger in Garden City, L.I. For the last 12 years she was general counsel to the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a volunteer organization.         With her partner, Lawrence Berger, she provided legal defense for thousands of law-enforcement officers and investigators facing criminal, civil or administrative charges.         She and her firm helped establish standards to protect officers from harassment, and to shield women, black and Hispanic officers from discrimination within their agencies. She also helped to shape policies on promotion and the dismissal and disciplining of Federal officers.         Ms. Mahon is survived by two daughters, Rebecca and Shana, and two sons, Joshua and Michael, all of Syosset; her father, John Mahon of Amityville, L.I.; and her brothers, Kerry Mahon of Selden, L.I., and Jack Mahon of Naples, Fla.
