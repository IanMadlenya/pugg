         Edna Morris, prominent in thoroughbred racing and social circles for more than 50 years and a major fund-raiser for the Girl Scouts of Greater New York, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         A son, Alfred (Chappy) Morris, said she had been in failing health for several years.         Mrs. Morris was a familiar figure at race tracks, often accompanied by her friend, Jean MacArthur, the widow of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. The all-scarlet racing colors carried by Morris horses, the oldest continuous silks in the country, were originated by the family before the Civil War. The first running of the Belmont Stakes in 1867 was won by the filly Ruthless, who raced for Francis Morris, the great-grandfather of Mrs. Morris's husband, John A. Morris.         Mr. Morris, a Wall Street stockbroker and a former president of the Thoroughbred Racing Association, died in 1985 at 93.         Mrs. Morris was active in several organizations, particularly in fund raising, but her principal activity was with the Girl Scouts, for whom she organized and presided over a number of benefits.         ''I'm trying to do my little bit for women,'' she said at a benefit in 1968. ''Scouting is an informal lesson in growing up, in learning resourcefulness, how to evaluate and how to cope -- and men today want women who can cope.''         She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 13, 1908, the daughter of Howard and Edna (Dolma) Brokaw. Her father, an accomplished polo player, was co-owner of Brokaw Brothers Clothing, a retail store on Fifth Avenue near the New York Public Library. She was a graduate of Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.         In addition to her son Alfred, of Manhattan, she is survived by another son, Dr. John Morris Jr. of Nashville.       
         Marie Collins McGuire Thompson, who worked to improve the design of public housing for the elderly and low-income people as the Public Housing Administrator in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, died last Monday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. Mrs. Thompson was 92 and lived in Kensington, Md.         Marie McGuire, as she was known, came to public housing with an aversion to ''bare, stark shelter'' that, she said, ''has brought no happiness to us.'' Instead, she espoused programs to create homes of which their occupants could be proud. Her advocacy drew criticism from legislators and defenders of traditional approaches, but architectural organizations backed her. Housing projects begun under her leadership won unaccustomed design awards.         She came to national attention as executive director of the San Antonio Housing Authority, where she championed amenities like balconies for every apartment. Studying the special needs of the elderly with limited means, she insisted on features like weatherproof ramps, handrails in all rooms and corridors and emergency bells in the bathrooms.         Her crowning achievement was the Golden Age Center, with 185 low-rent apartments designed for the elderly, that opened in 1960 in San Antonio. The next year, President John F. Kennedy recruited her as the first woman to become Public Housing Administrator. She held the post until 1966, when her office was merged into the new Department of Housing and Urban Development. There she became special assistant to the Secretary, working on housing and problems that affect the disabled and the elderly.         She left the Government in 1972. Until 1982, she was the housing specialist at the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, now the Center for Social Gerontology in Ann Arbor, Mich.         Mrs. Thompson was born in the Georgetown area of Washington. She studied journalism at George Washington University and, years later, studied architecture and real estate management at the University of Houston.         She wrote four books, ''Housing for the Elderly'' (1957), ''Housing and the Disabled'' (1976), ''Housing for the Handicapped'' (1977) and ''Housing for Rural Elderly'' (1982).         Her first marriage, to John McGuire, a Government geologist, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Thomas B. Thompson of San Antonio, an architect, died in 1983. She is survived by a sister, Margaret C. Schweinhaut, also of Kensington.       
         Louise Roberts, who directed the Clark Center for the Performing Arts in Manhattan, died on Jan. 17 at Bellevue Hospital. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         In her nearly three decades of presenting dance, Ms. Roberts helped shape the careers of many fledgling avant-garde and black choreographers who later became major modern dance artists, among them Kei Takei, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and Bill T. Jones. A small, rotund woman with an earthy sense of humor, Ms. Roberts also served as a patient yet eminently practical ''great mother figure,'' as Alvin Ailey put it, to several generations of modern dancers.         A central tenet of her career as a dance producer was that no one should be excluded from dance because of imperfect bodies or the color of their skin. She also believed that dance ought to be available to everyone, whether through the low-cost classes at Clark Center or affordable concerts. She wanted, she said in a 1986 interview, to ''offer people the opportunity to take chances.''         Born in Boston, Ms. Roberts attended Hunter College in Manhattan, graduating in 1931 with a degree in political science. It was during her college years that Ms. Roberts began to study dance seriously, performing  with Blanche Evan. When her husband, Paul Ziporkis, died in 1953, Ms. Roberts was left with a daughter to bring up alone. She worked as a magazine caption writer, an administrator at the Downtown Community School and as the director of the June Taylor School before moving on to Clark Center in 1970.         A friendship with Donald McKayle, a young choreographer, led to her first experience producing dance when Mr. McKayle asked her for help in putting on a concert at the 92d Street Y. Ms. Roberts continued to present dance regularly at Clark Center, where Alvin Ailey had started his company in the 1960's. The center is also where Wendy Wasserstein had the first staged reading of one of her plays.         From 1975 to 1978, Ms. Roberts produced a summer dance festival in the mall at the City College Graduate Center on West 42d Street. Her dreams of moving Clark Center from small, dingy studios on Eighth Avenue to a new theater and studio complex on the West 42d Street Theater Row in the mid-80's were dashed after the city reneged on promised support. Ms. Roberts rebounded with an ambitious eight-week series at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on Theater Row in 1986, the year she resigned from Clark Center. ''We're going to be dancing on 42d Street,'' she told a reporter. ''I may cry a lot, but that's what we're going to do.'' The Clark Center closed in 1988.         Ms. Roberts was a Capezio Award honoree in 1991 and won a Bessie Award in 1986.         She is survived by a daughter, Karen deFrancis of Brooklyn, and a stepsister, Grace Herman of Manhattan.       
         Katharine Winthrop McKean, an outstanding amateur tennis player of the 1930's and 1940's, died on Feb. 12 at her home in Hamilton, Mass. She was 82.         Mrs. McKean won four national junior girls' tennis titles, playing out of Boston, and five national women's titles, in indoors singles and doubles. She was named to the New England Tennis Hall of Fame in 1990.         She was a doubles partner of Alice Marble at Wimbledon in 1936 and toured South America in the years before World War II with Sarah Palfrey, Jack Kramer and Bobby Riggs.         Mrs. McKean was also active in horse racing and golf. She and her husband, Quincy Adams Shaw McKean, who died in 1971, owned thoroughbred horses.         A native of Ipswich, Mass., she was a descendant of John Winthrop, the first Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.         She is survived by four sons, John, of Beverly, Mass., and Pinehurst, N.C.; Thomas, of Concord, Mass.; Robert, of Dedham, Mass., and David, of Washington; two stepsons, Shaw, of Rumson, N.J., and Harry, of Vero Beach, Fla.; a stepdaughter, Margaret Vernon, of Hamilton, Mass., and seven grandchildren.       
         Carole Cohan, a senior vice president at McCann-Erickson Worldwide, the advertising agency, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. Ms. Cohan, a resident of Manhattan and Wainscott, L.I., was 54.         The cause of death was ovarian cancer, a spokeswoman for McCann-Erickson said.         Ms. Cohan, who was the broadcast creative director at the agency, had ultimate responsibility for the production of its television and radio commercials, working with the creative director and creative team. Clients of McCann, which is a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, include the AT&T Corporation, the Coca-Cola Company, the General Motors Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, L'Oreal S.A., the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation and Smith Barney Inc., a unit of the Travelers Group.         Ms. Cohan worked for McCann-Erickson for seven years starting in 1967. She rejoined the agency in 1986 as the director of broadcast production and was promoted to broadcast creative director in 1993.         Among the campaigns she worked on during her two employment periods at the agency were the General Motors car commercials with the theme ''Wouldn't you really rather own a Buick?'' the ''Because I'm worth it'' campaign for L'Oreal hair products, with the actress Cybill Shepherd, and the ''square inch'' advertisements for Triscuits, the cracker made by Nabisco.         Ms. Cohan also worked on the Taster's Choice brand coffee commercials involving a running romance between two neighbors that began in 1990. The campaign, which is still on the air, has won several industry awards, including the 1994 Best Global Campaign from the International Advertising Association.         After graduating from Emerson College in Boston with a bachelor's degree in speech in 1965, Ms. Cohan went to work for Sammy Davis Jr. Enterprises, a television production company. She began her advertising career two years later at McCann-Erickson, where she was hired as vice president, executive producer. In 1974 she moved to Grey Advertising as vice president, production group head, and she joined Saatchi & Saatchi Compton nine years later as executive vice president, director of broadcast production, before returning to McCann-Erickson.         Mr. Cohan is survived by her daughter, Leslie Cohan of New York; a sister, Felice Hurwitz; a brother-in-law, Brian Hurwitz, and a nephew, Jesse Hurwitz, all of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and her former husband, Ronald Cohan of New York.       
         Marie M. Lambert, who campaigned for Manhattan Surrogate promising to ''clean up the citadel of patronage'' but who retired from the powerful judgeship 12 years later best known as a patronage queen, died on Tuesday at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan, where she practiced law.         The cause was kidney failure, said her son, Gregory L. Lambert. Her health had deteriorated after heart surgery last fall, he said.         As one of two elected judges of the Surrogate's Court in Manhattan, which Fiorello La Guardia described  as ''the most expensive undertaking establishment in the world,'' Surrogate Lambert heard disputes pertaining to wills and estates, and formalized adoptions. She directed the flow of millions of dollars a year by appointing guardians for those too young or too feeble to handle their accounts, designating lawyers to manage wills that had no assigned executor, and awarding legal fees.         From 1977, when she was elected, to 1990, when she retired at the mandatory age of 70, Surrogate Lambert, feared for her quick temper and ability to keep lawyers working in her court till the early morning hours, drew fire.         Democratic Party leaders would not endorse her in the primary campaign, saying she lacked judicial temperament and knowledge of trust and estates law. A judicial conduct commission investigated allegations that she was the most hands-on of fund-raisers for the primary, in which she sent out 300,000 pieces of literature and saturated the city with Lambert paraphernalia. The United States Attorney's office would periodically announce that it was looking at how she gave lucrative work to a cadre of lawyers.         But while shadows remained attached to her name, Surrogate Lambert, a gregarious, street-smart personal injury lawyer who was also the first woman president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, eluded her accusers. Despite the absence of party backing and the disdain of the city's editorial pages, she ran a raw and raucous campaign -- and won. Although investigators recommended she be censured for her unabashed fund-raising, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct declined to take action. And though two lawyers would be prosecuted for activities connected to her, she never faced any charges.         In 1990, an appellate court scolded her as it overturned legal fees she awarded to two lawyers, saying the fees were excessive and that the Surrogate had failed to disclose her friendship with them.         As Surrogate, she ruled over the dying wishes of the very rich and the very famous, a role she relished. Marilyn Monroe's estate marched before her, as did those of Lotte Lenya, Yul Brynner, Lillian Hellman and Joan Crawford. ''Relax,'' she told the actor Al Pacino, when he appeared on a matter. ''Nobody is going to bite you, not if I can help it.''         She was regarded as a judge who could compel rancorous cases to settle by sheer dint of her will. ''If she wanted that result, she would get that result -- legal niceties didn't bother her,'' George DeSipio, a former chairman of the city bar's trust and estates committee, recalled. ''She could be quite nasty if you crossed her the wrong way.''         But Mr. DeSipio, who remained on friendly terms with Surrogate Lambert, said that above all, she was passionate about her job. ''She was a happy judge,'' he said.         In her capacity as Surrogate, she used her authority to help gay partners clarify their inheritance rights. Since homosexuals were not permitted to marry, Surrogate Lambert permitted one partner to adopt the other as a means of guaranteeing inheritance benefits.         But her most infamous task was settling the war over the half-billion dollar estate of J. Seward Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. For four months in 1986, Surrogate Lambert presided over the trial pitting Barbara Piasecka Johnson, his one-time maid and third wife, to whom he had left his estate, and his six children by two former wives.         According to David Margolick, a former reporter for The New York Times who chronicled the case in his book ''Undue Influence,'' Surrogate Lambert badgered and belittled Mrs. Johnson and her lawyers, provoking her to settle the case before it went to a jury.         In another case that raised eyebrows and grabbed headlines, Surrogate Lambert, an Italian immigrant who aggressively sought the support of Jewish voters by vowing not to direct funds to banks that joined in the Arab boycott of Israel, opened an investigation into the Palestine Liberation Organization. A journalist had left 10 percent of his $300,000 estate to the P.L.O. Surrogate Lambert said she could authorize payment to a terrorist group. After hearings in 1982, she ordered the money to be administered through the International Red Cross, to address Palestinian living conditions.         Giusippina Giovanna Maria Macri was born in a small town in the Calabria region of Italy in 1920. Her family settled in Brooklyn nine months later, where her father found work as a barber and her mother as a seamstress. She is survived by her sister, Gloria Diemer, and her brother, Charles Courtright.         She showed intellectual promise and ambition at an early age: Embedded in the family lore is the tale of how the young Marie, told by her grammar school that she could not be valedictorian although she had the academic credentials, hopped the subway, went to City Hall, and had an audience with an Italian compatriot, Mayor La Guardia, who immediately ordered the wrong rectified.         After graduating from Brooklyn College, she attended New York University Law School, where she graduated at the top of her class. In 1946 she married Grady Lambert, a salesman at Abercrombie & Fitch, who died in 1975.         She tried Wall Street law firms, but left because she was told to specialize in trust and estates law, which she considered ''women's work.'' Instead, she made her mark in the male-dominated world of personal injury law. Hungry and bright, she would take negligence cases that no one else would touch and turn them into winners. Her courtroom manner was disarming: She would shuffle in, legal papers spilling out of shopping bags. Juries considered her one of them.         From the outset of her legal career, she understood the importance of networking: In her later years, she would boast of her friendship with Roy Cohn, who escorted her to President Ronald Reagan's first inaugural ball.         In 1974, the New York State Trial Lawyers elected her president. ''She started her career and ended it on behalf of widows and orphans,'' said Aaron J. Broder, a personal injury lawyer.         In 1990, she reached 70, the mandatory retirement age for judges, and returned to private practice reluctantly. There is a Lambert legend  widely repeated in legal circles, which her son could not confirm but said could well be true. In an effort to extend her term on the bench, it is said, Surrogate Lambert traveled to Italy to check her village church records, to see if her birth date was perhaps incorrect.         Correction:  March 30, 1997, Sunday         An obituary in some editions yesterday about Marie M. Lambert, a Surrogate Court judge in Manhattan, omitted a word and thus misstated her position in a case involving a bequest to the Palestine Liberation Organization. She ordered hearings into the purpose of the organization because she said she could not authorize estate payments to terrorists. (The obituary is reprinted today on page 25.)

         Helene Hanff, whose wittily acerbic 20-year correspondence with a London bookseller she never met won her a passionate following after it was published as the epistolary memoir ''84, Charing Cross Road,'' died on Wednesday at the De Witt Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 80.         Up to the book's publication in 1970, Ms. Hanff was a relatively unheralded freelance writer whose work centered mainly on television screenplays and children's books. But the letters she addressed to the antiquarian bookshop Marks & Co. from 1949 to 1969, with their shared confidences and affectionate needling along with orders for Jane Austen and Izaak Walton, brought her a small if unanticipated literary celebrity.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Thomas Lask wrote: ''Here is a charmer: a 19th-century book in a 20th-century world. It will beguile an hour of your time and put you in tune with mankind.''         From the beginning of her correspondence, Ms. Hanff ignored the niceties of business letter writing. ''WHAT KIND OF A PEPYS' DIARY DO YOU CALL THIS?,'' she bellowed in an eccentrically capitalized letter of Oct. 15, 1951, after receiving a Marks & Co. shipment. ''this is not pepys' diary, this is some busybody editor's miserable collection of EXCERPTS from pepys' diary may he rot. i could just spit. where is jan. 12, 1668, where his wife chased him out of bed and round the bedroom with a red-hot poker?''         In his replies, Frank Doel, the shop's chief buyer and Ms. Hanff's principal correspondent, strove at first to maintain what she called his ''proper British reserve.'' But little by little, Ms. Hanff wore him down, as she did the other members of the shop's staff. They sent her recipes for Yorkshire pudding. She sent them food parcels and nylon stockings in a one-woman crusade to ameliorate Britain's postwar shortages. And Ms. Hanff often tempered her trans-Atlantic crankiness with rhapsodic soliloquies over the orders that Marks & Co. managed to get right.         ''The Newman arrived almost a week ago and I'm just beginning to recover,'' she wrote in 1950 after buying a first edition of John Henry Newman's ''Idea of a University'' (1852) for $6. ''I feel vaguely guilty about owning it. All that gleaming leather and gold stamping and beautiful type belongs in the pine-paneled library of an English country home; it wants to be read by the fire in a gentleman's leather easy chair -- not on a secondhand studio couch in a one-room hovel in a broken-down brownstone front.''         Despite her origins south of the Battery -- she was a native of Philadelphia -- Ms. Hanff was the Platonic New Yorker to her enchanted London correspondents. Her letters are a window on days spent picnicking in Central Park, rooting ardently for the Dodgers (and later the Mets) and wading into the fray of local politics (she was the first woman to serve as president of the Lenox Hill Democratic Club).         A constant undercurrent in Ms. Hanff's letters was the hand-to-mouth writing life she led, working at home in ''moth-eaten sweaters'' with an overflowing ashtray at her elbow and the gin bottle never far from reach. Despite repeated pleas from Marks & Company staff members to visit them in England (by the 1950's Frank Doel was offering her the use of his grown daughter's bedroom), Ms. Hanff's precarious finances never allowed her to make the trip until 1969, after Mr. Doel's sudden death from peritonitis.         Helene (pronounced heh-LAYNE) Hanff was born on April 15, 1916, in Philadelphia, the daughter of Arthur and Miriam Levy Hanff. She grew up in a theater-mad household (during the Depression, her father, a shirt salesman, took the family to the theater every week by slipping shirts to the box-office men in exchange for tickets), and all she ever wanted to be was a playwright.         Her career began auspiciously in 1938, when she won a fellowship from the Bureau of New Plays as a result of a nationwide competition. Soon afterward, she moved to Manhattan, where she became a protegee of Theresa Helburn, a co-producer of the Theater Guild. But although Ms. Hanff wrote 20 plays through the 1940's, none were ever produced. Her repeated attempts to succeed in New York theater are chronicled in her 1961 memoir, ''Underfoot in Show Business.''         ''I wrote great dialogue, but I couldn't invent a story to save my neck,'' she told The New York Times in 1982. In the 1950's, Ms. Hanff supported herself by writing screenplays for television programs including ''Playhouse 90,'' ''The Adventures of Ellery Queen'' and ''Hallmark Hall of Fame.''         A child of the Depression, Ms. Hanff could afford only a year of college, and throughout her life was an impassioned autodidact, educating herself by reading the great books, which she preferred to procure from London rather than dip into ''Barnes & Noble's grimy, marked-up schoolboy copies.'' One wall of her studio apartment on East 72d Street in Manhattan was filled from floor to ceiling with her Marks & Co. treasures, with their rich leather bindings and gleaming gold stamping. In front of the bookshelves hung the Marks & Co. sign, stolen for her by a devoted ''84'' reader from the shop after it closed, not long after Mr. Doel's death.         When Ms. Hanff decided to publish her correspondence with the shop as a memorial to Mr. Doel, the result brought her undreamed-of attention. ''84, Charing Cross Road'' was hugely popular in Britain, where it was adapted for the London stage by James Roose-Evans. (The play was less well-received on Broadway, where it ran in 1982 with Ellen Burstyn as Ms. Hanff and Joseph Maher as Mr. Doel.) In 1987 the book was made into a feature film starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins.         The book's success finally gave Ms. Hanff the wherewithal to travel to England, where she visited the boarded-up bookshop and met Mr. Doel's widow, Nora, a journey documented in ''The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street'' (1973). Ms. Hanff's other books include ''Q's Legacy'' (1986), ''Apple of My Eye'' (1977) and the children's titles ''Movers and Shakers'' (1969) and ''Terrible Thomas'' (1964).         ''It's unreal to me, what the last 10 years have been like,'' Ms. Hanff said in 1982. ''The fans -- people all over the world who regard me as a friend! And in London there is a brass plaque on the wall with my name on it, to mark the spot where the bookshop once stood, because I wrote letters to it. In your own mind you're still an uneducated writer who doesn't have much talent, and yet here you are with a plaque on the wall in London! You don't even dream about things like that.''         But ''84, Charing Cross Road'' could not provide its author with the economic stability she sought throughout her life. ''The one drawback about being a writer is that you never know in any month where the rent is coming from six months from then,'' Ms. Hanff told Publishers Weekly in 1985.         In her last years she was ''broke,'' by her own account, living on royalties and Social Security and accepting a $5,000 grant from the Authors League Fund to help pay her hospital bills.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Dorothy Frooks, who stumped for women's suffrage as a child, recruited thousands of men to World War I service as a teen-ager, and then spent most of the century as a lawyer and political gadfly, died on Sunday at Veterans Hospital in Manhattan. She was about 100 and lived in Manhattan and Peekskill, N.Y.         Among her many achievements were laying the groundwork for aid to dependent children and for small claims courts.         She served as chief yeoman in the Navy in World War I and as a judge advocate in the Army in World War II, taught school in Puerto Rico, ran a flying school, turned out columns for The New York World, wrote half a dozen books, founded The Murray Hills News, represented celebrated murder defendants, ran repeatedly for Congress, corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, feuded with Eleanor Roosevelt, hobnobbed with the King of Greece, turned down marriage proposals from Harry K. Thaw and Fiorello H. La Guardia, and so clouded the issue of her age that even her own family is not sure if she was 99 or 103.         But whether she was ''almost 17,'' in January 1918, as she put it in her her book ''Lady Lawyer,'' or 20, as a contemporaneous newspaper article reported, Miss Frooks, who received a gold medal from President Woodrow Wilson that month, was surely one of the last living Americans to have had a formal audience with Wilson in his White House office (and seen the evangelist Billy Sunday clap him on the back with such gusto that the President's top hat went flying.)         Whatever her age, by then she had a national reputation as ''the infant prodigy,'' ''the baby orator,'' and the girl who had made speeches for women's suffrage from Union Square to Hyde Park before turning her attention to military recruitment and Liberty Bonds.         The daughter of a prosperous businessman and an international society figure, Miss Frooks was born on a 400-acre Hudson Valley farm near Saugerties, N.Y., and grew up there and at the family's winter residence at the Waldorf Hotel.         As the seventh of nine highly articulate children, five of whom became lawyers, Miss Frooks recalled that she was holding her own in animated dinner table conversations on international affairs by the time she was 8 -- two years after she had decided on a legal career.         It was one of her mother's London society friends who spotted her talent for oratory and recruited her for the suffrage movement. Miss Frooks, who recalled making her first street-corner speech when she was 11, cut such a winsome figure in her little girl's bows and frills and spoke with such startling eloquence that she was always the first speaker at curbside rallies. The speakers who followed had learned they were less likely to be stoned or pelted with tomatoes when Miss Frooks led off.         She was even more impressive as an unofficial military recruiter, and after she had talked an estimated 30,000 men into signing up, primarily for the Navy, President Wilson not only presented her with a medal but recruited her for the Navy. As the highest-ranking woman in the service, Miss Frooks continued and expanded her recruitment activities and later organized a women's veterans organization.         Miss Frooks, who received a degree from the old Hamilton Law School in Chicago and then a master's from New York University, was a lawyer at 21, by her account.         By the early 1920's, at least, she was well known in New York as the first full-time lawyer for the Salvation Army. After setting up free legal clinics and discovering that poor people were often frustrated by their inability to collect small debts, she conceived the idea of a small claims court and lobbied hard until the first was signed into law by her old friend and suitor, Mayor La Guardia.         Thaw, the man who had killed the celebrated architect Stanford White 20 years earlier, hired Miss Frooks in 1926 to defend a 16-year-old girl who had killed the man who raped her when she was 12.         Miss Frooks, who eventually won a suspended sentence for her client,  became so incensed that the girl's widowed mother had been forced to neglect her children while struggling to eke out a living that she helped prod the legislature into establishing aid to dependent children.         The case also led to a ''My Day,'' column in The World, which lasted until 1932, when she was told that she was being replaced by Mrs. Roosevelt, a circumstance that may have contributed to her animosity toward the First Lady.         For all her childhood support of women's suffrage and her own legal career, Miss Frooks was no ordinary feminist. She made fiery speeches against the proposed equal rights amendment in 1975. As she had put it in 1922, ''Women should be in the home, have adorable husbands, and be the only wife.''         Miss Frooks, who was married in 1986, is survived by her husband, Jay P. Vanderbilt.       
         Judy Flannery, a late-blooming athlete who became an unlikely triathlon champion, was killed on Wednesday when she was struck by an automobile while on a bicycle-training ride near Poolesville, Md. A resident of Chevy Chase, she was was 57 and had won six American and four world age-group championships in the sport, which combines running, swimming and cycling.         According to the Montgomery County police, Ms. Flannery, who was nearing the midpoint of a 55-mile training ride with two friends, was killed when a car driven by an unlicensed 16-year-old driver swerved across the center line of the country road. The youth and his 38-year-old father, who was in the front passenger seat, received minor injuries. The police said yesterday that the incident was still under investigation and that no charges had been filed.         A native of Wilmington, Del., who graduated from the College of New Rochelle and worked as a biochemist before starting a family, Ms. Flannery grew up with a trim, athletic build in an age when girls were generally not welcome in athletics.         By the time her own four daughters were growing up, things were changing, especially at the Flannery household. Indeed, Ms. Flannery, who also had a son, spent so much time ferrying her brood to and from one athletic field or another that a daughter described her yesterday as ''the original soccer mom.''         Still, it was not until she was about 38, as she later recalled, that Ms. Flannery decided to find out what she had been missing.         ''I ran around the block,'' she said, and, as it happened, more or less kept on going: within a few years she was running marathons.         She might have stuck with distance running if a friend had not taken her to a triathlon one day. Immediately intrigued, Ms. Flannery, who was particularly attracted to the cycling phase, began training for the triathlon.         She was 47, and many of the women in the sport had been competing for decades, but within four years Ms. Flannery had pulled ahead of those in her age group.         She won the first of her six consecutive national championships in 1991, captured the first of her four world titles in 1992 and was so dominant in the United States that when she placed second last weekend in a race in Birmingham, Ala., the 55-year-old woman who beat her was described as stunned. No wonder. It was Ms. Flannery's first loss in a national age-group competition in six years.         Her proficiency as well as her popularity helps explain why the sport's national governing body, USA Triathlon, named her last month as the Master Female Triathlete of the Year.         A powerful runner who held her own in swimming, Ms. Flannery proved especially adept at cycling, so much so that she won five national age-group titles in time trials.         Although triathlons are staged over a varied combination of distances -- a mile swim, a 25-mile bicycle race and a 6.2-mile run in championship events, for example -- Ms. Flannery did not abandon her old sport of marathoning altogether. She competed three times in the grueling Hawaiian Ironman triathlon, which includes a full, 26.2-mile marathon, once placing second in her age group.         As enthusiastic about her sport as she was proficient in it, Ms. Flannery, a bubbly woman with a perpetual smile, was an accomplished recruiter who charmed thousands of women into taking up the sport while serving as chairwoman of the women's commission of USA Triathlon.         She was also an athlete of such uncommon modesty that she was never known to mention her victories. Those she had befriended and brought into the sport were inevitably startled to learn that the woman who had recruited them was a perennial champion.         For all the time she spent training and competing, Ms. Flannery was a regular volunteer at a local soup kitchen, but when it came to charity she preferred something a bit more robust. At the time of her death, for example, she and three cycling teammates were preparing to raise money to combat domestic violence by taking part in this summer's 3,000-mile Ride Across America.         Ms. Flannery is survived by her husband, Dennis; a son, Dennis, of Washington; four daughters, Erin of Santa Monica, Calif., Kelly of Collegeville, Pa., and Shannon and Megan, both of Washington, and a brother, David Sysko, of Wilmington.       
         Thelma Carpenter, whose long roller-coaster career as a singer took her to the heights with the big bands of the 1930's and 40's, out of show business into years as a file clerk and back to the big-time on Broadway in the 60's, was found dead on Thursday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 77.         Detective Thomas A. Frey of the 24th Squad said Ms. Carpenter's death appeared to be the result of natural causes.         ''I'm a singer first, last and always,'' Ms. Carpenter once said.         And indeed she was, from the time she was 7 and asked the manager of a radio ''Kiddies Hour'' for an audition until the end of her life, when she performed at places like Michael's Pub and on ''The Cosby Show.''         At the height of her career, the Brooklyn-born Ms. Carpenter, who combined a bubbling, buoyant personality with a pliant voice and a polished sense of showmanship, sang with such jazz greats as Teddy Wilson, Coleman Hawkins and Count Basie.         On the supper club circuit, she was a soloist at Julius Monk's Ruban Bleu, the Maisonette at the St. Regis and Bon Soir in Greenwich Village.         She made her Broadway debut in 1944 in ''Memphis Bound'' with Bill Robinson, appeared in ''Ankles Away'' with Beatrice Lillie, created the role of Irene Page in ''Bubbling Brown Sugar'' and took on a starring role in ''Dolly!'' in 1968 and 1969, when she became Pearl Bailey's standby and portrayed Dolly Levi more than 100 times.         She performed in such films as ''Hellzapoppin' '' (1941), singing with the Basie orchestra, ''The Wiz'' (1978) and ''The Cotton Club,'' Francis Ford Coppola's 1984 film about gangsters and Harlem nightlife.         On radio and television, Ms. Carpenter appeared with Eddie Cantor and Ed Sullivan, was a co-star of the ABC television series ''Barefoot in the Park'' and made guest appearances in everything from ''The Love boat'' to ''The Cosby Show.''         When ''Barefoot in the Park'' was canceled in 1970 after 13 weeks, as when she was out of show business for several years after her mother died in 1962, Ms. Carpenter, while disappointed, refused to turn bitter.         ''My grandaddy taught me something I've never forgotten,'' she said in a 1970 interview. ''What you need is so much more important to you than what you want. Anyway, I've never aspired to be a superstar. You talk about stardom, well, your nose bleeds up there. I got close enough to know. Suddenly there were people I'd never seen, telling me I owed them something. Listen, I've given my money away, where I thought it would help, but I don't want 'yes' people around me. Basically I'm a loner.''         Ms. Carpenter, who left no immediate family survivors, was an only child and never married. ''Yes, I've never married, though you might say,'' she said in 1970, ''that I've done lots of heavy rooming and light housekeeping in my time. Honey, I like life.''         Ms. Carpenter was still a student at Girls' Commercial High School of Brooklyn in 1939 when she was heard by John Hammond, the jazz enthusiast and recording executive who had started Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman and Count Basie on the way to stardom. Mr. Hammond put her on with Teddy Wilson's band at the Famous Door on 52d Street.         Later that year, Coleman Hawkins, the legendary jazz saxophonist, returned to the United States after five years in Europe, formed a band and looked for a singer. ''They make 'em like you in America?'' he asked when he saw Ms. Carpenter. ''You can have the job.''         Ms. Carpenter's career prospered in the United States and abroad, but when her mother died, she said, ''I just lay down in my bed for a whole year.'' Finally, when she needed money, she went looking for a job, applying at a personnel agency that found work as a file clerk at Duffy-Mott, makers of Mott's Applesauce.         When her friend Martha Raye told her there was going to be an all-black company of ''Hello, Dolly!'' Ms. Carpenter went to see the show when Ginger Rogers was playing the lead. ''Son of a gun, I could do that!'' Ms. Carpenter told herself. Pearl Bailey got the role, but when her original standby left, Ms. Carpenter took over the role.         ''I had to go out there and face an audience that had just been told that Pearl Bailey won't be there,'' Ms. Carpenter said. ''I decided I was either going to be Dolly or I wasn't going to be Dolly. 'You don't have to pay me,' I felt, 'just applaud me.' And when they'd stand up and cheer, I'd won.''         Correction:  May 30, 1997, Friday         An obituary of the singer Thelma Carpenter on May 17 misidentified the Broadway show in which she appeared with Beatrice Lillie. It was ''Inside U.S.A.,'' not ''Ankles Aweigh.''       
         Robbie Tilley Branscum, whose books for young readers bore the stamp of her hardscrabble childhood in rural Arkansas, died on May 24 at her home in San Pablo, Calif. She was 62.         The apparent cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Deborah.         Born in Big Flat, Ark., she was reared in poverty on the patches of farmland in the surrounding hills. She never got past the seventh grade, married at 15, divorced at 25 and worked on dirt farms. But despite her lack of education, she had picked up a reading habit as a youngster. On rainy days, she would devour every library book she could lay her hands on.         Along the way she had also taken to writing. Her church received a  Southern Baptist newsletter, to which she submitted an article, ''Men Who Walked With God.'' To her amazement, she said later, it was published. That small success made her decide on writing as a career.         Ms. Branscum went on to write 20 books for children and teen-agers, the first of which, ''Me and Jim Luke,'' was published in 1971. ''The Murder of Hound Dog Bates: A Novel'' won an Edgar Allan Poe Award in 1983.         Her ''Toby, Granny and George''  received a Friends of American Writers Award in 1977, and ''Johnny May'' was listed among the ''Best of the Best 1966-1978'' by the School Library Journal.         Ms. Branscum's stories told of dirt-poor life in rural America, replete with moonshiners, corn pone humor and sentimentality, as well as the pleasures of berry picking, frying chicken and baking bread. Her pen also testified to the wit needed by farmers in their endless battle for survival.         She published her last two books in 1991, ''Old Blue Tilley'' and ''Never Pa's Girl.'' Over the years, she also spent considerable time speaking to library associations and telling students how she succeeded as a writer despite the handicap of having only a seventh-grade education.         Besides her daughter, of Albany, Calif., she is survived by two stepdaughters, Anna and Renae Brascum of Richmond, Calif.; three brothers, Eugene Tilley of Marshall, Ark., Ovalee Tilley of Springfield, Ore., and Hershel Tilley of Columbus, Ind.; two sisters, Bobbie Spiess of Brentwood, Calif., and Billie Jo Burch of Indianola, Iowa; two stepbrothers, Billy Ray Petty of Chester, Calif., and James Petty of Modesto, Calif., a granddaughter and two stepgrandchildren.       
         Thalassa Cruso, an authority on plants who was known as ''the Julia Child of horticulture'' for her common-sense if often loopy gardening programs on television in the 1960's, died on June 11 at Newton and Wellesley Alzheimer Center in Wellesley, Mass. She was 88 and lived in Marion, Mass.         Ms. Cruso, a witty, acerbic Englishwoman, wrote and starred in the weekly public-television program ''Making Things Grow'' from 1966 to 1969. In brisk, impeccable diction, she indoctrinated viewers into the mysterious world of cyclamen and spathiphyllum, enjoining them to tend their plants with loving kindness, and to throw them in the dustbin without a backward glance if the little ingrates failed to respond.         ''If a plant is unbelievably tatty, dispose of it without the least feeling of guilt,'' she told McCall's in 1971.         Trim and elegant, with dark bangs and a determined chin, Ms. Cruso possessed an uproarious wit, blunt candor and cultivated eccentricity.         ''Ha! There's the little brute,'' she once exclaimed as she flicked an invading slug onto her worktable. Cautioning squeamish viewers to avert their eyes, she raised a flowerpot on high. The pot came crashing down, and the slug was history. WGBH in Boston, which produced the program, was inundated with mail from delighted viewers.         ''Making Things Grow'' was aimed at the novice, and its appeal lay in Ms. Cruso's role as Everygardener, a true amateur who drew her advice from personal experience rather than formal horticultural training. ''I have never studied it, and there is so much I don't know,'' she once said. ''And I'm afraid I'll make some terrible mistake.''         Ms. Cruso did not merely handle plants: she communed with them as if they were sentient creatures, pinching them, patting them, sometimes dumping them unceremoniously onto the counter as dirt flew around the set.         In addition to her broadcasting career, which also included a household-advice program, ''Making Things Work,'' in the early 70's, Ms. Cruso wrote a gardening column for The Boston Globe for 22 years. She was the author of several books, including ''Making Things Grow'' (1969), ''Making Things Grow Outdoors'' (1971) and ''To Everything There Is a Season'' (1973).         She was born Jan. 7, 1909, in London, the daughter of Henry and Mildred Cruso. The name Thalassa, the Greek word for ''sea,'' was a whim of her mother's. According to family legend, a paternal ancestor, John Cruso, was a schoolmate of Daniel Defoe, who would later add an ''e'' to the surname and bestow it on his best-known literary hero. ''My mother's maiden name was Robinson,'' Ms Cruso once said in an interview, ''and I am told that the announcement of that engagement was the last thing that made Queen Victoria smile.''         The Crusos were passionate gardeners, and Thalassa fondly recalled childhood hours spent doing her homework in the greenhouse.         ''When we were given a holiday at school to do a project about our neighborhood, I made a collection of wild plants,'' she said in an interview. ''I bicycled miles to find them. And I found some rare ones.'' She added: ''I didn't win the prize because I presented them sloppily. The girl who won had a collection from her father's garden, neatly pressed. Mine were tied with a boot lace.''         Perhaps craving a way to muck about in the dirt and get paid for it, she went into archeology, receiving her diploma from the London School of Economics in 1931. She served as assistant keeper of the costume collection at the London Museum, and later directed an excavation at Bredon Hill, an Iron Age fort in Worcestershire. There she met the American archeologist Hugh O'Neill Hencken; they married in 1935, and she returned with him to Boston.         Mr. Hencken, who was for many years the curator of European archeology at the Peabody Museum of Harvard University, died in 1981. Ms. Cruso is survived by her daughters, Ala Reid of York Harbor, Me., Sophia Stone of New Orleans and Thalassa Scholl of Boston; seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.         As a wife and mother in Boston, Ms. Cruso was hardly satisfied to confine her days to the garden-club circuit. The inspiration for ''Making Things Grow,'' she recalled, came on a visit to her brother in England: ''We would watch the BBC gardening programs and complain about how bad they were. And I had watched and admired Julia Child on TV, and suddenly I thought, 'I could do that with plants.' ''         She began with brief snippets tacked onto the end of longer programs. ''I used to pop on after the baseball game, or the symphony, or a very serious lecture on birth control,'' she said.         Ms. Cruso's work led to frequent appearances on the ''Tonight'' show, where she taught Johnny Carson how to compost eggshells in a closet. As a result of her celebrity, she became an unofficial custodian of the public horticultural trust. ''People stop me on the street,'' Ms. Cruso once said, ''and ask what to do with their African violets.''       
         Frances Foster, a character actress, a stage director and a founding member of the Negro Ensemble Company, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Fairfax, Va. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and in Far Rockaway, Queens.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said Hattie Winston, a friend, who said Ms. Foster was in Virginia to attend a stepgrandson's high school graduation.         Ms. Foster was at the Negro Ensemble Company from 1967 until 1986, appearing in more than 25 of its productions. She won an Obie Award in 1985 for sustained excellence of performance.         The other honors she received included one of the company's Adolph Caesar awards in 1987 and two of the annual Audelco Awards, which honor achievement in black theater: a best actress award in 1978 for ''Do Lord Remember Me,'' and a best director award for 1983 for ''Hospice.'' Both plays were at the New Federal Theater in Manhattan.         Ms. Foster made her stage debut as Dolly May in ''The Wisteria Trees'' at the City Center Theater in 1955, and her talent proved durable. She won praise for her portrayal of a matriarchal Mississippi grandmother in Leslie Lee's 1990 play ''Ground People.'' Reviewing it when it opened at the American Place Theater, Mel Gussow of The New York Times wrote, ''Just sitting in her kitchen, lining the thin soles of her shoes with paper while telling tales of her midwifery, Ms. Foster is a moving presence, as she has been in many other plays.''         Another critic, reviewing the play ''You Have Come Back,'' set in Algeria, at St. Clement's Church in Manhattan in 1988, wrote, ''Frances Foster gives such a superb performance as the 103-year-old nurse that it is a revelation just to watch her move about the stage, creating an old Algerian woman out of a few lines.''         And Frank Rich of The Times wrote admiringly in 1985 that Ms. Foster was ''a big woman'' with ''a big repertory of comic voices, ranging from a raspy belt to a maternal croon to a ditsy English matron's stiff-upper-register.''         Her work in television included acting in daytime television staples like ''One Life to Live,'' ''Ryan's Hope'' and ''All My Children.'' She also appeared in the Spike Lee movies ''Malcolm X'' (1992) and ''Crooklyn'' (1994) and in other films. She was on the Actors Equity Association council from 1953 to 1967 and an artist in residence at City College of New York from 1973 to 1977.         Ms. Foster, born Frances Brown in Yonkers. where she was brought up,  studied acting at American Theater Wing in Manhattan from 1949 to 1952.         She married Robert Standfield Foster in 1941. He died in 1977.         She is survived by her husband of 14 years, Morton Goldsen; a son, Terrell Foster, of San Francisco; three stepchildren; six stepgrandchildren, and a sister, Beverly Tate of Far Rockaway.       
         Rita Dimitri, a multilingual singer who was the ebullient spirit of the Manhattan supper club La Chansonette for more than 20 years, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 67.         Stanley Brilliant, her husband,  partner and frequent accompanist, said the cause was kidney cancer.         Besides performing at the candle-lighted Chansonette, Miss Dimitri appeared on Broadway and on national tour in the mid-1950's in the Cole Porter musical ''Can-Can,'' playing the singer who owns a boite in Montmarte.         In time, life imitated art, because Mr. Brilliant, who combined his family's interest in real estate with his own passion for music, built La Chansonette for her.         ''It was like a wedding gift,'' he said yesterday.         By January 1962, when they opened the intimate supper club at 890 Second Avenue, between 47th and 48th Streets, Miss Dimitri had long achieved popularity in Europe and had made her mark in the theater in United States and as an attraction at clubs like Le Ruban Bleu in Manhattan, Old New Orleans in Washington, the Black Orchid in Chicago, the Moulin Rouge in Boston and the Ritz Carlton in Montreal. For several years in the 1970's, Miss Dimitri also appeared annually at Alice Tully Hall.         With her upswept red hair, dangling earrings, chunky necklaces and gowns cut to accentuate her figure, the half-French, half-Greek (''makes me Freek'') Miss Dimitri epitomized the Continental chanteuse.         In a 1954 interview, Miss Dimitri recalled how the owner of the Old New Orleans approached her in Paris and asked if she could sing in English. Miss Dimitri raised an eyebrow.         ''I sing,'' she said, ''in English, French, Greek, Italian, Spanish and Turkish.''         In a typical appearance, she would perch beside red roses atop La Chansonette's white piano and cast a roguish eye over an audience that might include Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Leona Helmsley (the club's landlord) or Laurence Rockefeller, who was partial to ''If I Were a Rich Man'' from ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' Miss Dimitri would banter with her husband at the piano and apply her smoky mezzo, her arsenal of languages and her ineradicable Mediterranean accent to songs associated with Edith Piaf, Charles Aznavour, Charles Trenet or Gilbert Becaud. There might be titles like ''L'Accordioniste'' and ''Never on Sunday'' and ''My Man.''         Miss Dimitri, born in Nice, France, to a Greek father and French mother, moved to Greece at an early age and grew up bilingual.         Once she recalled that she was 14 when an older sister took her to a theater-nightclub in Athens, where she was urged to sing in a talent show. ''Too young to be nervous,'' she said. She won the contest and said that soon thereafter she was cast in her first musical, began playing leading roles in Athens theaters and eventually became known as the Judy Garland of Greece.         Miss Dimitri toured with her own troupe in Turkey and Egypt and appeared in London and Paris, which led to the offer to perform in the United States.         Mr. Brilliant, her only survivor, said that in 1984, deciding that it was time for a change and responding to a good offer, they sold La Chansonette, which became a restaurant under another name. The couple took to the road, appearing in other clubs in New York, around the country and in Europe until a few years ago.         ''It was a great era,'' said Mr. Brilliant. ''I'm glad we were part of it.''       
         Joan Daves, a leading literary agent whose client list included six Nobel Prize winners, died on Wednesday at her home in Bedford, N.Y. Ms. Davis, who also had a home in Manhattan, was 77.         Her husband, Joe H. Kirchberger, said the cause was an acute asthmatic attack.         For decades, Ms. Daves was regarded as one of the world's foremost agents for serious and intellectual fiction and nonfiction. Her Nobel Prize-winning clients included Heinrich Boll (1972), Elias Canetti (1981), Herman Hesse (1946), the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1964), Nelly Sachs (1966) and Gabriela Mistral (1945). All but Dr. King, who won the Nobel Peace Prize and took Ms. Daves with him to Stockholm when he received the award, were laureates in literature.         Ms. Daves (pronounced DAY-vis) also represented such renowned authors as Frank O'Connor, Isaac Babel, Vaclav Havel and Rachel Carson, the trailblazing environmentalist who wrote ''Silent Spring'' and ''The Sea Around Us.''         ''She loved these authors, which conjures up another world; it wasn't the fast buck,'' said Jennifer Lyons, who became her associate when Ms. Daves affiliated her one-woman agency in 1987 with a larger Manhattan agency, Writers House, to secure the interests of her authors as she grew older. ''There was a real passion for authors themselves, for artists and for literature that is rare today.''         Robert Weil, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press, recalled that Ms. Daves became familiar with Dr. King in the early 1950's before he achieved national prominence while leading the 1955 boycott of the segregated transit system in Montgomery, Ala.         Mr. Weil said Ms. Daves told a friend that there was an extremely articulate, charismatic and visionary minister from the South she had to meet. ''She could spot very early people's genius and people's talent,'' Mr. Weil said. ''She also sided with the underdog.''         In addition, Mr. Weil said: ''She was literature. She was a brilliant critic, a brilliant reader. She was extremely nurturing. She had a social flair as well. She was a great person to put together people as if she ran a salon in New York which combined the writers of post-World War II European literature with the needs of American publishers.''         In the sale of American rights, the Joan Daves Agency also represented a number of distinguished foreign publishers, like Kinderbuch Verlag of Switzerland, the German concerns Carl Hanser Verlag of Munich and Verlag Kipenheuer und Witsch of Cologne, and the Austrian concern Residenz Verlag of Salzburg.         Ms. Daves, who was later to Americanize her name, was born in Berlin in 1919 and grew up as Liselotte Davidson. She was the middle child and younger daughter of a Jewish banker who was to die in Auschwitz.         In the mid-1930's after the Nazis came to power, her father sent her to Paris, where she became fluent in French. She was forced to return to Berlin when the Nazis imposed currency restrictions on Jews, but she reached Britain in 1938 and followed her sister to the United States in 1940, settling in New York City.         An avid reader who was always interested in books, she worked for a couple of years for Interscience Publishers, publishers of scientific books and books by refugees. In 1942, she went to work as an editor for Harper & Brothers, where she started the Harper's Art Library, which issued books about Durer and Flemish and French master drawings.         In the early 1950's she established the Joan Daves Agency and used her European connections to attract the Continent's foremost writers.         Besides her husband, Ms. Daves is survived by a brother, Peter Davidson of Las Vegas.         In 1992, in ceremonies at the consulate in Manhattan, Ms. Daves was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in recognition of a lifetime of advancement of German culture and literature.       
         Helen Hull Jacobs, who played the sturdy foil to Helen Wills Moody's willowy star turn in the rivalry that captivated women's tennis in the 1930's, died Monday night in Easthampton, N.Y., where she had lived for the past four years. She was 88.         Ralph Smith, her longtime lawyer, said the probable cause of death was heart failure.         Helen Jacobs was a champion in her own right, winning nine major championships, including the United States national title four straight times from 1932-35 and the Wimbledon singles in 1936. She was a mainstay for the United States Wightman Cup team from 1927-39.         But her achievements were always measured against the incomparable brilliance and celebrity of Helen Wills Moody. More gracious than graceful, more indomitable than invincible, always trying but seldom triumphant, Jacobs played Helen the Second to Moody's Helen the First.         That the competitive history between the two northern Californians was called a rivalry, dubbed the Battle of the Helens by a sometimes frothy news media between the two world wars, was a tribute more to  Jacobs's tenacity and cheerful pluck than to her shot-making power or on-court success against Moody. Jacobs scored only 1 victory in 11 matches against Moody, and that victory was tainted by controversy when Moody decided to retire with a back injury while trailing by 8-6, 3-6, 3-0 in the 1933 United States final at Forest Hills, N.Y.         The match mesmerized 8,000 fans at the Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in Queens on Aug. 26, 1933, pitting the forehand chop, aggressive net play and dogged determination of Jacobs against backcourt precision and waning power of Moody. When the seesaw affair came to its anticlimactic conclusion when Moody walked to the net, addressed the umpire, collected her blue sweater and retired from the fray, Jacobs rushed over and pleaded with her to continue. It was an upset of titanic proportions: Moody had not lost on any court since 1926; she had not even lost a set between 1926 and the 1933 Wimbledon semifinals.         While some accounts the next day took Moody to task for depriving Jacobs of the satisfaction of outright victory, Moody was given the last word in a statement handed out following the match: ''The match was long and by defaulting I do not wish to detract from the excellence of Miss Jacobs's play. I feel I have spoiled the finish of the national championship. I still feel I did right in withdrawing because I felt that I was on the verge of a collapse on the court.''         Jacobs was commended by Allison Danzig in The New York Times for receiving Moody's decision ''with sympathy and the finest sportsmanship.'' They were traits that earned Jacobs a dedicated following throughout her career. Even years later when she was asked to recall the incident, Jacobs maintained the high road. In a 1967 article in The Times, while she allowed that Moody ''did not look at me'' when she retired, Jacobs summed up the moment in typically generous fashion: ''So she defaulted. That was it. We never spoke a mean word to each other. We never nursed grudges.''         The two produced another enthralling final in a major championship: the Wimbledon title match in 1935. Again Moody stole the thunder; once again the circumstances were riveting. Jacobs held a match point at 5-3 before 19,000 fans at Center Court. She seemed, at last, to be ready to claim her moment, and thwart Moody, who was returning to competition after a two-year absence. Instead, Jacobs plowed a short Moody lob into the net when a gust of wind misdirected the ball. Moody won the next four games and the match, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, for her seventh Wimbledon title.         Jacobs's contribution to tennis history is as the gracious runner-up, and it is probably fitting that her lasting footnote at Wimbledon is as the first woman to popularize man-tailored shorts as on-court attire. ''It seemed the sensible thing to do,'' she would say later.         In the end, Jacobs's admirable courage and fighting qualities earned her nine Grand Slam titles, and a triple crown of singles, doubles and mixed doubles at the 1934 United States Nationals. She was ranked in the world Top 10 for 12 straight times from 1928, was No. 1 in 1936, and was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1962.         Jacobs was a commander in United States Navy intelligence in World War II, one of five women in the Navy to achieve the rank of commander. She retired from tennis in 1947 and enjoyed a career as a writer of 19 books, a farmer and a designer of sportswear.         Jacobs is survived by her companion, Virginia Gurnee; a sister, Jean Jacobs Gross of Oakland, Calif.; a niece, Wendy Moore, and three great nieces.       
         Rosina Lawrence, whose brief but bright film career still flickers on the home screen in the ''Our Gang,''  ''Little Rascals'' and Laurel and Hardy classics, died on June 23 at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Brooklyn and on Mackinac Island, Mich.         Miss Lawrence, who was known off screen as Rosina Marchisio-McCabe, danced, sang and acted in the 1920's and 30's, appearing in vaudeville and films, from comedic shorts to musical extravaganzas like ''The Great Ziegfeld'' of 1936. She also played the heroine in ''Way Out West'' (1937), which was Laurel and Hardy's favorite of their films. In it Miss Lawrence played Mary Roberts, a scullery maid and unsuspecting heiress whom the duo tracked to a bar in Brushwood Gulch.         Miss Lawrence was hired, at age 20, by Fox Studios to make several films with Alice Faye and Edward Everett Horton, among others. These included ''Ten Dollar Raise,'' ''Your Uncle Dudley,'' ''Music Is Magic'' and ''Charlie Chan's Secret.''         But it was after the merger of Fox and 20th Century that she came into her own. She danced the Marilyn Miller part in ''The Great Ziegfeld'' and was cast as the new teacher, Miss Lawrence, in a series of ''Our Gang'' shorts, the best of which, ''Bored of Education,'' won an Oscar.         She starred as the movie-struck Cecilia Moore, sweet young thing from Iowa, in ''Pick a Star.'' It was another feature with Laurel and Hardy, and in it she matched wits with Patsy Kelly and Jack Haley.         Her last professional appearance was in an Italian film in which she played an American in Italy, ''In Campagna e Caduta una Stella'' (1939). Because of the war, it was not released in the United States until 1950, as ''In the Country Fell a Star.''         Rosina Lawrence was born in Westboro, Ontario, and as a child  moved to Hollywood, where her father was a set builder. His presence assured her entree to the studios, but it took an accident to set her career path, when a bruised knee led to dance classes as therapy.         She danced in Los Angeles theaters during school vacations, and took acting and singing lessons as well. After vaudeville, dance clubs and some stage musicals, she landed her first cinematic dancing role in ''Angel of Broadway'' (1927).         She danced in ''Paramount on Parade'' (1930), featuring Maurice Chevalier, and appeared in ''Connecticut Yankee'' (1931) with Will Rogers, ''Disorderly Conduct'' (1932) with Spencer Tracy and the 1935 MGM hit ''Reckless'' with Jean Harlow.         She ended her career in 1939 and married a Brooklyn lawyer, Juvenal P. Marchisio. He became a New York judge and a leader in the postwar relief efforts for Italy. He died in 1973.         She is survived by her husband,  John C. McCabe, the movie biographer; two daughters, Rosina Mo of Bracciano, Italy, and Margaret Romairone of Manhattan; a son, Juvenal L., of Rockleigh, N.J., and five grandchildren.       
         Mumeo Oku, a pioneer in Japan's consumer movement and an early campaigner for women's rights, died on Monday at her Tokyo home. She was 101.         Mrs. Oku founded the Housewives' Association, one of Japan's first and best-known consumer groups, and remained its leader for decades. She also was one of the first women to serve in Parliament.         ''She opened the way for consumers' movements and consumers' rights in Japan after the war,'' said Teiko Kihara, chairwoman of the Japan League of Women Voters.         The Housewives' Association grew out of a protest over the shoddy quality of matches being rationed by the government in the impoverished days just after World War II. Only one match in 10 would light.         The association went on to protest other poor-quality goods such as clothing that shrank too much and cans labeled beef that were really filled with horse meat or whale. In protest marches, members wore aprons over their kimonos and carried large rice ladles as placards.         Consumer groups, however, never became very powerful in Japan, a nation that sacrificed its consumers' life style to build its industry. The Housewives' Association, which now has 391 local chapters, has sometimes taken positions that seem anti-consumer, such as opposing the import of inexpensive rice in order to protect Japan's farmers.         Mrs. Oku was born in Fukui Prefecture in western Japan in 1895, the eldest daughter of a blacksmith.         She graduated from Japan Women's University and became active in 1920 in the women's suffrage movement. She also worked at a spinning company to become involved in the labor movement and was appalled by the working conditions. And she ran a home to help poor women and children from 1923 until it was destroyed in an American air raid in 1944.         Japanese women gained the right to vote and hold office in 1946, when the country was under United States occupation in the years after World War II. Mrs. Oku won a seat the next year in the upper house of Parliament and served for three six-year terms.         Mrs. Oku always wore a traditional Japanese kimono, joking that she could not afford Western clothes.         ''She always wore a kimono beautifully but her mind was tougher than men's,'' said Ms. Kihara. ''She was very clear in expressing her opinion even in front of men of high status. Very few women could do that in Japan at that time.''         Mrs. Oku is survived by a daughter, Kii Nakamura, who also served as a chairman of the Housewives' Association, and a son, Kyoichi Oku, both of Tokyo.         A funeral is to be held Thursday in Tokyo.       
         Janet Good, a longtime civil rights worker who cooperated with Dr. Jack Kevorkian to help terminally ill people die, ended her own life yesterday in her home in suburban Detroit. She was 73.         Mrs. Good had suffered from pancreatic cancer and said she hoped not to die as her mother had, slowly and in great pain. As it was, Mrs. Good confounded her doctors, who had expected her illness to take her life by early 1996.         ''My time, obviously, is not quite here,'' she said in an interview late last year. Yesterday, she decided it was, said a person familiar with her decision and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         At a news conference in Southfield, Mich., Dr. Kevorkian's lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, asked the authorities not to pry into the circumstances of Mrs. Good's death.         And while Mr. Fieger declined to confirm that Dr. Kevorkian was present when she died, he said, ''Janet Good is no more the victim of a homicide than anyone else who has died in association and in the presence of Dr. Kevorkian.''         In recent years, Dr. Kevorkian has become well known for assisting in dozens of suicides. He has been tried but acquitted several times, and Mrs. Good became his top assistant, helping him screen those seeking help to die and consoling their survivors.         She said she was proud to have been indicted in late 1996 on charges of assisting in a suicide. ''I was almost offended when I wasn't charged last time,'' she said. The indictment was later dropped because of her deteriorating health.         Dr. Kevorkian's name was hardly known in 1989, when Mrs. Good started the right to die movement in Michigan by founding a chapter of the Hemlock Society in her living room. The chapter now has several hundred members.         In June 1990, Dr. Kevorkian asked her if he could use her house for the very first assisted suicide.         Although she agreed at first, she later declined after conferring with her husband, Ray, a retired Detroit police commander who thought the deed might be illegal.         ''The doctor called me every name in the book,'' Mrs. Good recalled later.         But they mended their differences, and in May 1996, after her husband had changed his mind, she allowed Dr. Kevorkian to use her home to help end a life.         After her own illness was diagnosed, she said her belief in a right to die had come naturally, in part because of her mother's suffering. ''I have worked for civil rights and women's rights and human rights for many years, and this seemed to me just another right we should have,'' she said.         A native of Detroit, Mrs. Good worked for the State of Michigan, processing unemployment claims.         In the 1970's, she led a successful drive to make sexual harassment illegal in the state, a triumph that won her election to the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.         She was also honored by the Log Cabin Society, a gay Republican group, for consoling AIDS patients and their families.         Survivors include her husband of 55 years; a son, Michael, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a daughter, Marjorie Helmling, and a sister, Margaret Moran, both of Detroit; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Her oldest daughter, Donna Ungar, died in 1995.       
         Joyce Ebert, a versatile character actress for more than 30 years with the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, died on Thursday at Southport Manor, a rest home in Southport, Conn. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said Kimberly Sewright, a spokeswoman for Long Wharf.         Ms. Ebert was a dedicated company actress, playing cameo roles as well as starring ones, and and unlike many actresses she never stopped working. She performed in 81 plays at Long Wharf, many of them directed by her husband, Arvin Brown, the company's longtime artistic director. She is survived by her husband.         In a highly productive career she appeared in diverse plays, from ''Arsenic and Old Lace'' to ''The Trojan Women.'' She was equally comfortable in the czarist Russia of Gorky and Chekhov and in the rustic American environment of ''Tobacco Road,'' although she seemed especially at home in the world of Lillian Hellman. Sometimes she would appear in several plays in one season. She also appeared on Broadway and Off Broadway and at other regional theaters.         She acted in revivals of plays by Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller, Thornton Wilder and John Osborne, while also performing in new works (''The Shadow Box'') and, occasionally, musicals (for 10 years she studied opera). Ms. Ebert often played less than glamorous roles. But with her comic touch she could capture the flamboyance of such vivid characters as Carlotta Vance in ''Dinner at 8'' by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, in a stylish revival directed by Mr. Brown.         Among the other highlights of her career was her title role in D. H. Lawrence's ''Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd.'' Mr. Brown's production was later shown on ''Theater in America'' on WNET, on Channel 13 in New York.         In 1996, the Connecticut Critics Circle gave her a special achievement award for 30 years of ''outstanding contribution to a theater in Connecticut.''         She was born in Homestead, Pa., and graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Later she studied with Uta Hagen and Lee Strasberg. She began her New York theatrical career playing Julie in ''Liliom'' at the Equity Library Theater, and continued to work Off Broadway in the late 1950's and early 60's.         For her performance in ''The Trojan Women'' at Circle in the Square in 1963, she won an Obie and the Clarence Derwent Award. In 1961, she was Ophelia to Donald Madden's Hamlet at the Phoenix Theater. A decade later she played Gertrude to Stacy Keach's Hamlet at Long Wharf.         Her first Long Wharf performance was in ''Misalliance'' in 1966. In 1996, she played opposite Fritz Weaver in the full-length version of Noel Coward's ''Song at Twilight,'' and gave her last performance in ''The Show Off'' by George Kelly, a play she had done 21 years before, also at Long Wharf.         Interviewed by the Times in 1982, she said: ''I really had a spectacular career and it's been in a quiet way. I'm not a star and never wanted to be one.'' She added, with evident pride, ''I work constantly.''       
         Ruth Adler, who kept the staff of The New York Times informed about its own milestones and behind-the-scenes adventures and shaped the legends and lore of The Times for other journalists and students for 33 years as editor of the newspaper's in-house journal Times Talk, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         Ms. Adler, who underwent open heart surgery in March, died of heart failure, her nephew, Peter Lewis, said.         Behind every news story there is an untold -- or rarely told -- tale of the reporter's personal experience: the hazards of covering a war or a riot, the grind of the campaign trail, a correspondent's travails with foul weather, bad food, crazy hours, unworkable communications and implausible expense accounts.         From 1947, when she became the first editor of Times Talk, to 1980, when she retired after 46 years with The Times, Ms. Adler chronicled these tales, and countless more routine doings, for the newspaper's 5,000 employees in a house organ that was one of the best and most widely read periodicals on the practice of journalism.         More than a compendium of staff marriages, births, deaths and achievements, it captured the life of the newspaper from the inside, with sometimes dramatic, often hilarious accounts from reporters around the world, from editors in a raucous city room, from printers riding Linotype machines, and hard men in square paper hats down in a thundering pressroom on 43d Street in Manhattan.         Reflecting its editor's fascination with the news and with the newspaper's daily production, her journal offered Tom Wicker's account of covering the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas; A. M. Rosenthal on his expulsion from Poland for reports that won a Pulitzer Prize; Claude Sitton on civil rights clashes in the South, and Robert Lipsyte on how to report a boxing match with a screaming fan standing on your typewriter. Such accounts were all the more intriguing in an era when most reporters were anonymous figures behind their news articles.         In 1966, Ms. Adler compiled 53 Times Talk articles in ''The Working Press: Special to The New York Times,'' published by G. P. Putnam's Sons. Eliot Fremont-Smith, in a review for The Times, said the book conveyed ''a remarkably clear picture of how The Times, as an entity, works -- how the news comes in and what happens to it, in both routine and crisis situations.''         Ms. Adler also wrote ''A Day in the Life of The New York Times'' (J. B. Lippincott, 1971), a 242-page account, hour by hour, of what the newspaper's staff did to put out the issue of Feb. 28, 1969, a date chosen arbitrarily, on which there was no earth-shaking news.         Based on memos from hundreds of Times employees, her account detailed the activities of reporters around the world and across the nation, looked over the shoulders of rewritemen pounding out inserts and of editors writing headlines and laying out pages, eavesdropped on advertising salesmen and then watched the presses roll and the delivery trucks roar away.         Ruth Adler was born in Rochester  on July 10, 1910, the daughter of Ida Lichtenstein and Mortimer Adler. She attended public schools in Rochester, graduated from Smith College and attended the Sorbonne in Paris for a year before joining The Times in 1934 as a secretary to Ivan Veit, then the promotion manager. She was not a member of the Adler family that is related to the Sulzbergers who own The Times.         Ms. Adler, who never married, played golf and tennis and was an extensive traveler.         She occasionally wrote articles for The Times's Sunday magazine or travel section. In 1947, she was asked to establish an internal news publication for the staff. Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher, was one of her principal fans and consultants; he gave her a small staff and complete autonomy to design, edit and produce Times Talk.         During her early tenure, Times Talk was 12 pages and appeared monthly. Later, the number of pages varied in a larger format, and it appeared 10 times a year. Its circulation went beyond The Times staff, to other journalists and to journalism schools, where many regarded it as a valuable teaching aid. Today, Times Talk has 28 pages, appears seven times a year and has a circulation of more than 8,500 current and retired employees of the newspaper.         When Ms. Adler retired in 1980, a full issue of Times Talk was devoted to her. The art critic John Canaday called her ''a living encyclopedia'' of the newspaper's recent history, and Russell Baker, the columnist, offered a tongue-in-cheek tribute to one of his favorite editors.         ''Some of the best people had worked for The Times for years before Times Talk revealed that they were actually first-rate reporters,'' he wrote. ''At a time when your material was usually reduced to chopped liver by The Times's famous editing process, the opportunity to tell the story right in Times Talk compensated for many a night when you stalked out of the office in a rage to tell it to the gin bottle.''       
         Jean Westwood, who was a leader of George McGovern's disastrous Democratic campaign for President in 1972 and was the first woman to be chairman of a major political party, died on Monday in American Fork Hospital in American Fork, Utah, where she had lived for the last two years. She was 73.         The cause was complications from a pituitary tumor, said her husband, Richard E. Westwood.         Mrs. Westwood was an enthusiastic supporter of Democratic candidates and Democratic causes. But her period of leadership came during a time of Republican victories. So the unenvious task of trying to put a brave face on the McGovern campaign fell to Mrs. Westwood, who became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee after Mr. McGovern won the Democratic nomination.         ''It is pompous nonsense for anyone to presume to predict the result of an election seven weeks hence,'' she said in September 1972 as Mr. McGovern badly trailed President Richard M. Nixon. ''And it is ridiculous for any observer to conclude now that the whole thing is decided and the campaign is all over.''         But the whole thing was decided and the campaign was all over. Mr. McGovern carried only the Democratic bastions of Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. He was not the only loser. Mrs. Westwood faced  her share of the blame for the rout and, three weeks after the election, found herself combating suggestions that she resign.         ''I will not quit,'' she declared. But by December, she was gone after just five months as party chairman, whose title she preferred over chairwoman (''It's not something I'm going to fret about,'' Mrs. Westwood said when she got the job.)         Mr. McGovern, reached today at his vacation home in Montana, remembered Mrs. Westwood as ''a person who combined a tough mind with a warm heart.'' As an example, he offered a description of how he reached the decision to drop Senator Thomas F. Eagleton as his Vice-Presidential running mate.         Mr. Eagleton had revealed that he was hospitalized for ''fatigue and nervous exhaustion'' three times and underwent electric shock treatments for depression, almost derailing an already stumbling Presidential campaign.         Mr. McGovern said: ''I was calling key people in the campaign to decide what to do, and I can remember almost her exact words. She said, 'It's painful for me to do anything that might hurt Senator Eagleton, but if his staying on the ticket endangers our election chances, that hurts all the millions of people we want to serve, so I think he should step down.' That showed her compassion and tough-mindedness.''         Mr. McGovern later settled on Sargent Shriver as a running mate.         In 1968, Mrs. Westwood worked for the Presidential campaign of Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York and, after his assassination, turned to Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, another loser to Mr. Nixon.         In 1975, she helped lead the Presidential campaign of Terry Sanford, then the president of Duke University, and in 1985 she played a similar role for Bruce Babbitt. She lived in Arizona from 1976 to 1995 and served as an adviser to Mr. Babbitt when he was the Governor.         The success that eluded Mrs. Westwood in politics came to her in business. In their home state, Utah, she and her husband simultaneously ran businesses that raised minks, built apartments and installed swimming pools.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Westwood is survived by a son, Richard E. Westwood Jr., of Highland, Utah; a daughter, Beth Davies of American Fork; two brothers, John K. Miles of Provo, Utah, and David H. Miles of Orem, Utah; 15 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren.       
         Lucy Somerville Howorth, a lawyer who said her advocacy of women's rights was inspired by the campaign that won women the vote under the 19th Amendment, died on Aug. 23 at her home in Cleveland, Miss. She was 102.         Mrs. Howorth watched from a crowded Statehouse gallery in Nashville on Aug. 18, 1920, when Tennessee ratified nationwide women's suffrage, and as the 36th state to do so put the 19th Amendment into the Constitution.         A native Mississippian, Mrs. Howorth spent much of her life in the political arena, including a turn as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1932. She was known as Judge Lucy, a sobriquet that stuck after she was appointed a United States Commissioner -- or magistrate -- for the Southern Judicial District of Mississippi in 1927.         A few years later, she moved to Washington and held legal positions in Federal agencies where few women had gone before. She retired in 1954 as general counsel of the War Claims Commission and returned home to the practice of law.         She was a national officer in the American Association of University Women, played a pivotal role in ending the organization's practice of racial segregation in the 1940's and headed a task force on the status of women and their employment opportunities after World War II. As an association vice president in the 1950's, she traveled widely and gave speeches around the country.         Born in Greenville, Miss., she came from a long line of lawyers rooted in colonial America. As a child, she said, her mother took her to suffragist meetings and nurtured her daughter's independent spirit and her wish to become a lawyer, an aspiration hardly befitting a fine Southern lady then.         Her mother, Nellie Nugent Somerville, was the first woman to be elected to the Mississippi Legislature, and Lucy also served there for four years in the 1930's.         Lucy Somerville graduated from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in 1916 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa and went on to study at Columbia University, where she attended political rallies and meetings and regularly visited settlement houses.         ''It was in New York City at that time,'' she recalled when Radcliffe College honored her in 1983 for a lifetime of achievements, ''that I learned to be a whole human being.''         Back home, she earned her law degree with highest honors at the University of Mississippi in 1922 and practiced law until her appointment as Judge Lucy five years later. She held positions on the legal staff in the Veterans Administration and was a director of the V.A. Employees Credit Union from 1937 to 1949, when she joined the War Claims Commission as associate general counsel.         After leaving the Government, she joined her husband, Joseph Marion Howorth, in practicing law again in Cleveland, Miss., until about 1980. Mr. Howorth died in 1982 after 54 years of marriage. There are no immediate survivors.         Mrs. Howorth was president of the Business and Professional Women's Club of Washington and often served as a mentor to women in government. President John F. Kennedy named Mrs. Howorth to a task force on Federal employment for his Commission on the Status of Women.       
         Kaaren Erickson, a soprano who was on the roster of the Metropolitan Opera for the last 12 years and whose repertory ranged from Handel oratorios to Philip Glass's most recent opera, died on Saturday at her home in Maryville, Tenn. She was 44.         Lawrence Wasserman, her manager, said the cause was cancer.         Ms. Erickson was born in Seattle and studied with Marshal Singher at the Santa Barbara Academy of Music, in California. She made her San Francisco Opera debut in a production of Massenet's ''Cendrillon'' in 1982. The same year she won first prize at the Munich International Competition. In 1984, she made her New York City Opera debut as Pamina in Mozart's ''Magic Flute,'' and the next year she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Susanna in ''Le Nozze di Figaro.''         At the Met, Ms. Erickson also sang Zerlina in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' and Alice Ford in Verdi's ''Falstaff,'' as well as roles in Wagner's ''Gotterdammerung'' and ''Das Rheingold,'' Strauss's ''Elektra,'' Poulenc's ''Dialogues des Carmelites'' and John Corigliano's ''Ghosts of Versailles.''         She also performed regularly as a soloist in performances of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Mahler's Fourth Symphony, Strauss's Four Last Songs, the Mozart Requiem and Handel's ''Messiah.'' She recorded ''Messiah'' with Robert Shaw (for Telarc Records), and sang on recordings of ''Parsifal'' (with James Levine, on Deutsche Grammophone), Dvorak's Stabat Mater (with Zdenek Macal, on Delos), and ''The White Election,'' a collection of Emily Dickinson settings by Gordon Getty, (also on Delos).         She is survived by her husband, Edward Sooter; a daughter, Esther Sooter; her mother, Annette Herr of Seattle, and two sisters, Jennifer and Heidi Herr, of Chlan, Wash.       
         Shirley Clarke, an Academy Award-winning filmmaker, a champion of independent filmmaking and a missionary for video as a force in communications, died on Tuesday at the Palliative Care Center of Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston. She was 77 and lived in Carlisle, Mass.         Her sister Elaine Dundy, the novelist and biographer, said Miss Clarke entered the center, a hospice, after a stroke two weeks ago. She also suffered from Alzheimer's disease.         As a filmmaker, Miss Clarke was probably best known for the three pictures she made between 1960 and 1963. ''The Connection,'' filmed in cinema verite style in 1960 and taken from Jack Gelber's Off Broadway play, was a frank study of drug addiction that was banned on grounds of obscenity by the motion picture division of the New York State Board of Regents.         Her 1962 documentary, ''Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel With the World,'' a portrait of the poet, won an Oscar.         Her gritty 1963 film, ''The Cool World,'' adapted from a novel by Warren Miller and filmed on the streets of Harlem, tracked the life of a young man who rises briefly to the leadership of a juvenile gang.         ''Right now,'' Miss Clarke said in 1962, ''I'm revolting against the conventions of movies. Who says a film has to cost a million dollars and be safe and innocuous enough to satisfy every 12-year-old in America?''         In 1962 Miss Clarke and the filmmaker and critic Jonas Mekas founded the Film-Makers Cooperative, a nonprofit company for the distribution of independent films.         ''There must be 40 or 50 others like me in the country, with a desire for self-expression and no urge to move to Hollywood and make soap opera,'' Miss Clarke said.         ''We're creating a movie equivalent of Off Broadway, fresh and experimental and personal. The lovely thing is that I'm alive at just the time when I can do this.''         In 1967, Miss Clarke attracted attention with the release of ''Portrait of Jason,'' filmed during a single 12-hour session in her Manhattan apartment. The documentary, shown at the New York Film Festival, was a 105-minute interview with a gay black male prostitute.         ''The result, I'm convinced, is a portrait of a guy who is both a genius and a bore,'' she said.         By the 1970's, Miss Clarke was turning to video. ''Videotape is going to teach Americans to play with each other,'' she said then. ''The fight of the 1980's will be the battle for access to communications media.''         Released in 1986, her final movie, ''Ornette: Made in America,'' a portrait of the great modern jazz composer and saxophonist Ornette Coleman, mixed film and video.         From 1975 to 1983, Miss Clarke was a professor of film at the University of California at Los Angeles.         She came to her life in film and video after a career in dance. Her concern with movement led her to motion pictures, and among her earliest films were dance-related shorts. ''I became more interested in people than abstractions,'' she said.         Reared in Manhattan and educated at the Lincoln School, Miss Clarke was the eldest of three daughters of the former Florence Rosenberg and Samuel N. Brimberg, a wealthy manufacturer.         ''Daddy was of the school which felt that men didn't talk about important matters to women,'' Miss Clarke once said. ''I guess I always had an enormous need to show him I wasn't the dope he thought I was.''         She said she attended seven different colleges without graduating. ''I studied anything as long as I could keep on dancing,'' she said.         For several years, she studied and danced with Martha Graham and Hanya Holm and was 17 when she offered her first work as a choreographer.         Her marriage in 1943 to Bert Clarke ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Dundy, who lives in Los Angeles, she is survived by another sister, Betty Lorwin of Brooklyn, and a daughter, Wendy, a video artist who also lives in Los Angeles.         As Miss Clarke lay dying, she was visited in her hospital room by her daughter and a group of friends, all film and video makers, who sipped Champagne as they reminisced about her and her work and how it paved the way for the MTV generation.         The next day, Ms. Dundy described the gathering to their sister Betty, who replied, ''It's so like a film Shirley would make.''         Correction:  September 29, 1997, Monday         An obituary on Friday about the filmmaker Shirley Clarke referred imprecisely to a documentary she directed. The film, ''Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel With the World,'' won an Academy Award in 1963 not for her but for its producer, Robert Hughes.       
         Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work among the poorest of the world's poor, died yesterday in Calcutta, India, where she had lived since her work with the destitute began five decades ago. She was 87.         Mother Teresa was hospitalized several times last year with heart, lung, kidney and other problems, and also suffered ill health in earlier years. Her physician in Rome, Vincenzo Bilotta, said she suffered cardiac arrest during the evening at her convent in Calcutta, The Associated Press reported.         As her health deteriorated over the past year, Mother Teresa stepped aside and her order, the Missionaries of Charity, chose a new leader, Sister Nirmala, in March.         Mother Teresa, an ethnic Albanian born in what is now Macedonia, was revered in India, where she worked for 68 years and became a citizen.         She also came to be honored around the world for the compassionate, effective way she set up and oversaw projects to provide care and comfort to the very poor and the very sick, orphans, lepers and the dying.         Traveling widely even in her later years, she became known to millions as a slight, brown-eyed figure -- she was only 5 feet tall -- smiling and dressed in the plain white sari with blue trim of her order.         Her work was considered by some a rebuke to widespread feelings of personal powerlessness in middle-class and wealthy societies. In 1968, Pope Paul VI praised her as an ''intrepid messenger of the love of Christ.''         The Nobel Committee said its award to her in 1979 was ''for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress in the world, which also constitute a threat to peace.'' Informed of the honor, she said simply, ''I am unworthy.''         But she came in for criticism, too. A British television documentary in 1994 contended that perceptions of her were colored by ''hyperbole and credulity.''         Mother Teresa, who had been a school administrator in a suburb of Calcutta, began working in the slums of that poverty-ridden and densely populated city in 1948. She had received what she described as a divine ''call within a call'' two years earlier while riding on a train. ''The message was quite clear,'' she recalled. ''I was to help the poor while living among them. It was an order.''         In 1950 she established the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, becoming its Superior General. She went on to organize far-flung programs for the impoverished, eventually reaching more than 90 countries.         Her chief task, as she defined it, was to provide ''free service to the poor and the unwanted, irrespective of caste, creed, nationality or race.''         In predominantly Hindu India, she made sure that the priests of her order gave last rites, the Roman Catholic sacrament for the dying, only on request, and that they dealt with the dead according to the practices of the individual's own religion. For the living, Mother Teresa set up orphanages, schools in slums and Pure Heart Homes for sick and dying homeless people.         Over the years, her work expanded. She set up mobile health clinics, centers for the malnourished, rehabilitation hospices for lepers, homes for alcoholics and drug addicts, and shelters for the homeless. Her centers in the United States included the Gift of Love Hospice for 15 men with AIDS, at 657 Washington Street, in Greenwich Village.         The number of sisters in her religious order, only 62 in 1957, grew enormously. By the time Mother Teresa won the Nobel Prize, her order had attracted 1,800 nuns and 120,000 lay workers, running more than 80 centers in India and more than 100 others in other parts of the world. The order's patients included 53,000 lepers.         By 1988, her order was operating 600 mobile health clinics where almost four million people received treatment. That year Mother Teresa visited South Africa, which was still under apartheid rule, to set up a hostel in a black township. By early 1992, experts on Catholic welfare work reported, members of her order -- 4,000 nuns and novices, 400 priests and brothers and hundreds of thousands of lay volunteers -- worked at 450 sites worldwide, including in Albania and Iraq.         Aid and Tribute, But No Pity         Mother Teresa often paid tribute to the stricken people she cared for. Speaking to a gathering at the United Nations in 1975, she recalled a woman she had found dying on a Calcutta street.         ''I knew she was dying,'' she said softly. ''After I did what I could, she took my hand, gave me a beautiful smile and thanked me. She gave me more than I gave her.''         Mother Teresa put particular emphasis on giving the deprived and the sick a sensation of dignity through personal contact. ''Ours is a humble service,'' she said in an interview in 1975. ''We try to remain right down on the ground.''         But she said pity did not help the poor. They ''don't need pity, they need love and compassion,'' she once said, adding, ''If you don't know them, you don't love them and don't serve them.''         She said some people used to advise her that her order should have fans in some rooms used by its nuns. ''I do not want them to have fans,'' she continued. ''The poor whom they are to serve have no fans. Most of the girls come from village homes where they had no fans. They should not be more comfortable here than at home.''         In addition to piety, humility and warmth, she displayed strength of will, blunt practicality and organizational talent. The Nobel Committee said it meant to honor her as much for her managerial skills as for her devotion to the poor.         Mother Teresa earned her Nobel Prize despite a political climate in India that was unfavorable to foreign missionaries. In the 1970's the Government took measures to discourage such work, and by the time she won the prize the number of missionaries in India had shrunk to only a few hundred. It had formerly been 6,000. In 1979 there were about 15 million Christians in the country, 2.4 percent of the population of 630 million.         On certain social questions, Mother Teresa adhered outspokenly to the doctrine of her church. She voiced strong opposition to contraception, abortion and divorce.         In accepting the Nobel Prize, she declared: ''To me the nations with legalized abortion are the poorest nations. The greatest destroyer of peace today is the crime against the unborn child.''         Strong Adherence To Church Doctrine         In 1995, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton, she helped dedicate a shelter in Washington for women and newborn infants. The center was meant to discourage abortions by providing quarters for children waiting to be adopted or put in foster homes.         And in February 1996, Senator Bob Dole, campaigning in Iowa for the Republican Presidential nomination, declared that Mother Teresa had called to praise him for helping pass a ban against certain types of late-term abortions.         In 1995, before a referendum in Ireland was narrowly passed to end a constitutional ban on divorce and remarriage, opponents of the law were exasperated when a hand-written letter from Mother Teresa urging a ''no'' vote was made public.         On another occasion, she contended in effect that women's place was in the home, ''allowing men to do what they are better suited to do.''         Criticism of her came from various quarters. In an interview in 1995 in Calcutta, Debasis Bhattachariya of the Indian Science and Rationalists Association declared, ''Mother Teresa is not at all any better than all the other godmen and godwomen, because she helps to place a more kindly mask on the overall exploitation in our society.''         Christopher Hitchens, a columnist for Vanity Fair and The Nation, voiced particularly strong criticism of her in a 1995 book, ''The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice'' (Verso). Mr.  Hitchens contended that she had ''furnished P.R.-type cover for all manner of cultists and shady businessmen.'' Her success, he said, ''depends on the exploitation of the simple and the humble by the cunning and the single-minded.''         The Philadelphia Inquirer's review of the book carried the headline, ''A Salvo of Cheap Shots Fired at a Contemporary Saint.''         The 1994 British television documentary that criticized Mother Teresa, titled ''Hell's Angel,'' was also written by Mr. Hitchens. Asked about the documentary, Mother Teresa said simply, ''Forgive them for they know not what they do.''         In the United States, her views were of such wide interest that ''The Simple Path,'' a book of her thoughts, experiences and beliefs compiled by Lucinda Vardey, was a best seller for 12 weeks in 1995 and 1996.         She was ''an incredible person,'' President Clinton said yesterday in Edgartown, Mass., where he was on vacation. The House of Representatives, observed a moment of silence.         Answering the Call To Become a Nun         Mother Teresa was born Agnes Bojaxhiu on either Aug. 26 or 27, 1910, to Albanian parents in Skopje, about 200 miles south of Belgrade. Studded with churches and mosques, the city is today the capital of Macedonia, but was then ruled by Ottoman Turks, before becoming part of Serbia in 1913.         Accounts have differed as to the profession of her father. An authorized biography of her that came out in Britain in 1992 said he was a building contractor. While a schoolgirl, she belonged to a Catholic lay women's group. At its meetings, letters were read from Balkan Jesuits who had gone as missionaries to Bengal, in eastern India.         At the age of 12 she first felt the desire to become a nun. At 18 she decided to do so and got in touch with the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish Catholic order with missions in Bengal. She joined the order in Rathfarnham, a suburb of Dublin, in 1928. After English lessons there, she spent a more than a year in Darjeeling, north of Calcutta, where the order ran a girls' school.         She then became a teacher, mainly of geography and also of history and catechism, at St. Mary's High School, on the grounds of the Entally Convent outside Calcutta. Many of her pupils came from poor families. In time she learned Bengali and Hindi and became the school's principal.         It was while riding on a train on Sept. 10, 1946, that she received her ''call within a call,'' she said. She left her school and learned nursing skills from other nuns. Then she began her good works among Calcutta's poor, feeling uncertainties at first but also happiness as she set about meeting peoples' needs. ''I knew where I belonged,'' she recalled, ''but I did not know how to get there.''         Before long -- in 1950 -- she won canonical recognition for her new order, the Missionaries of Charity. The religious sisters who joined took vows of chastity, obedience, poverty and service.         One day in 1952, as her longtime associate Sister Agnes recalled years later, ''she found an old woman dying in the streets.''         ''We tried to get someone to take her to a hospital,'' Sister Agnes said, ''but before we could, she died. Mother said there should be a place where people can die with dignity and know that they are wanted.''         And so Mother Teresa set about establishing a home for the dying destitute. She persuaded Calcutta's municipal authorities to give her a shabby one-story building, which happened to stand next to a complex of Hindu shrines.         In that humble structure, she succeeded in creating a place where those who died would do so with dignity. The space was cleaned. The dying were cared for with compassion. The establishment was called Nirmal Hriday, the place for the pure of heart.         Mother Teresa's undertakings continued, one after another. There was a home for abandoned children, a leper colony and an old people's home. She went on to set up welfare institutions ranging from a family clinic, to mobile leprosy clinics, to nurseries for abandoned children.         A Strong Disdain For Mere Money         Her work brought in donations from admirers. She liked to say that money was ''really no problem, we depend on divine providence,'' and she said simply that her works were underwritten by ''cash and kind.''         She recalled that when her order opened a house in New York, ''Terence Cardinal Cooke was very anxious that he should give every month a maintenance for the sisters.''         ''I didn't want to hurt him,'' she said, ''but I didn't know how to explain to him that our services are purely for the love of God and that we cannot accept maintenance. I expressed it the only way I could: 'Your Eminence, I don't think God is going to become bankrupt in New York City!' ''         One longtime source of support was Catholic Relief Services, the overseas aid agency of the United States bishops, which operates in scores of countries. Its backing came largely in donations of United States Government surplus food.         In 1971 Mother Teresa's order opened its first house in the United States, in Harlem. It was soon moved to the Bronx, where, on a visit to the United States in 1980, Mother Teresa helped open a soup kitchen and declared her thanks to the poor people of New York ''for allowing themselves to be taken care of'' by her order. In 1981, she opened a mission in Newark.         Then in 1982, when she was 72, she worked for a number of days in Beirut, Lebanon, crisscrossing the Green Line that divided Christian East Beirut from Muslim West Beirut. She rescued dozens of mentally ill children from the dangers of warfare in the Muslim part of the city.         One of her biographers, Eileen Egan, reported in a 1985 book, ''Such a Vision of the Street: Mother Teresa -- the Spirit and the Work,'' that a Red Cross official who helped her observed later: ''What stunned everyone was her energy. We didn't expect a saint to be so efficient.''         After suffering heart problems, Mother Teresa sent her resignation as head of her order to Pope John Paul II early in 1990. She said the time had come for ''younger hands.'' A new head was to be chosen that September. But when the time came she told reporters in Calcutta that God's will had kept her from stepping down. Catholic clergymen said she had been prevented from doing so when members of the order's electoral college, gathered from many countries, had been unable to agree on her successor. They re-elected her to her post.         Over the years, she received many awards and honors, including honorary degrees from universities ranging from the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome to Harvard. She was awarded the Jewel of India, the country's highest civilian award. And she was an honorary citizen of Assisi, the hill town in central Italy where Francis of Assisi was born in 1182.         In addition to all her good works, Mother Teresa found time to compose prayers, including this one:         Make us worthy, Lord,         To serve our fellow men         Throughout the world who live and die         In poverty or hunger.         Give them, through our hands         This day their daily bread,         And by our understanding love,         Give peace and joy.         But she could also be briskly prosaic. In an interview in 1994 she said: ''I work all day. That is the best way.''       
         Nancy Dickerson, who in the 1950's and 60's combined network television reporting with her role as a sought-after Washington partygiver and insider, died yesterday in New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and maintained homes for many years both in Washington and New York.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke she suffered in January 1996, said a son, John Dickerson. Ms. Dickerson suffered from declining health after being stricken by a heart attack, and then the stroke. She seemed to be making progress but then began to regress, said her husband, John C. Whitehead. Ms. Dickerson was given final rites of the Roman Catholic Church last Thursday.         In 1960, as Nancy Hanschman, she became the first woman to be hired as a network correspondent by CBS News and was a mainstay there and in the Washington bureau of NBC, in which she worked from 1963 to 1970. After that, she formed her own company and devoted herself to producing and appearing in syndicated television productions. One project was ''784 Days That Changed America -- From Watergate to Resignation,'' which won the Peabody Award. Another of her programs was ''Being With John F. Kennedy,'' a documentary co-produced with Robert Drew. She also served as a commentator for Fox News.         Among the stories of which she was most proud were her 1980 interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The interviews were presented by the Public Broadcasting System.         She also produced for PBS a documentary on the role of women in the Arab world titled, ''Islam: The Veil and the Future.''         Ms. Dickerson often acknowledged over the years that her success came partly from knowing people.         ''My social life always seems to revolve around business,'' she said.         The people on her ''A'' list who attended her parties included Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Averell and Pamela Harriman, Walter Annenberg, Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Edward Bennett Williams, Joseph Califano, Elliot Richardson and other prominent figures in administrations from John F. Kennedy's to Mr. Reagan's.         She entertained them at her townhouse in Washington's Kalorama Triangle or at Merrywood in McLean, Va., the estate where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Princess Lee Radziwill grew up. Merrywood was acquired in 1965 by her husband then, C. Wyatt Dickerson, a real-estate investor, and it was where some of Ms. Dickerson's most lavish parties were held.         It was an indication of her place in the capital's social firmament that when she married Mr. Dickerson in 1962, a party was given in her honor, hosted by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Justice Arthur Goldberg of the Supreme Court and Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut.         In her memoirs, published as ''Among Those Present'' by Random House in 1976, Ms. Dickerson revealed that in the 1950's, she had dated John F. Kennedy when he was a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York and had been propositioned at least once by Lyndon B. Johnson. (She turned him down, she said.) Left unfinished at the time of her death was a sequel to this book.         Ms. Dickerson used her contacts to get many scoops in Washington. One of them was Mr. Johnson's decision, in 1964, to ask Senator Hubert H. Humphrey to be his running mate. Another was a rare interview with Speaker Sam Rayburn (who did not like to be interviewed on camera) and an exclusive interview with Senator Barry Goldwater, who wanted to explain to her why he had voted against the Civil Rights Bill.         Not all her exclusives came from Washington. In 1963, she was first to learn that an airline crash near San Francisco had been caused because a deranged passenger had shot the pilot.         She was born Nancy Conners Hanschman to Frederick R. and Florence Conners Hanschman on Jan. 27, 1927, in Wauwatosa, Wisc., a suburb of Milwaukee. She attended Clark College, then a Catholic school for women in Dubuque, Iowa, then entered the University of Wisconsin, where she concentrated in English, Spanish and Portuguese, earning her bachelor's degree in 1948.         She taught school for a time in Milwaukee but in 1951, came to New York in search, she said, of an interesting job. When she could not find something suitable, she went to Washington, where she became a registrar in the Institute of Languages at Georgetown University. She soon found a more desirable job, doing research for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.         She heard that CBS was looking for somebody to produce a radio show about the political scene in Washington called ''The Leading Question,'' and talked her way into it. She did well as a producer, although she had never done it before, and as a result was named associate producer of ''Face The Nation,'' when CBS started that successful interview program in the middle 50's. One of her coups was to persuade the Speaker of the House, Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, to make his television debut on CBS.         She wanted to be on the air herself but in those days, the national reporting staff of CBS was a male preserve. In order to break into it, she used her 1959 vacation to go to Europe to do a radio feature on the peacetime activities of the Women's Army Corps. CBS officials liked it so much, they used it on ''The World Tonight,'' then a mainstay of CBS Radio.         In 1960, CBS decided it would expand its staff to cover the Presidential elections and named her its first woman correspondent in February of that year. The other two networks, NBC and ABC, already had named women to their news staffs, but Miss Hanschman was certainly in the vanguard of women in the ranks of network correspondents. She first covered Senator Humphrey's campaign, but when he lost the West Virginia primary to Mr. Kennedy and dropped out of the primary, she covered Senator Lyndon Johnson all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in July of 1960, where he became Mr. Kennedy's running mate,         Later that year, CBS gave her own weekday radio show, ''One Woman's Washington,'' in which she discussed Washington topics that she thought might be of interest to women around the country. But she did not want to be involved only in women's programming and in the next few years, covered Mr. Kennedy's funeral and the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington.  In 1963, she left CBS and joined NBC News in Washington, where she remained until 1970, covering general national news and politics.         She married C. Wyatt Dickerson,  in 1962. That union ended in divorce in 1983. In 1989, she married John C. Whitehead, chairman of AEA Investors, an investment concern in New York, and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He is also a former senior partner and co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and was a Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. She maintained a home in New York on Sutton Place and was active in various philanthropic efforts, including serving on the boards of Covenant House, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the New York Public Library. She was also a member of the Central Park Conservancy. In Washington she was active in the White House Endowment Fund, among other causes.         Survivors in addition to her husband include three daughters, Elizabeth Earls and Jane Dickerson, both of Washington, and Ann Pullion of Villanova, Pa.; and two sons, Michael Dickerson of Atlanta, Ga., and John Dickerson of Washington, and a sister, Mary Ellen Phillip of Milwaukee.         Correction:  October 20, 1997, Monday         An obituary yesterday about Nancy Dickerson referred incorrectly to Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a host at a party for her when she was married in 1962. Johnson was Vice President, not President, at the time.       
         Pilar Miro Romero, a pioneering female director of movies and television who also fostered Spain's film industry by introducing state aid for promising young filmmakers when she served in the Socialist Government of the 1980's, died at her home here on Sunday. She was 57.         She collapsed from a heart attack, doctors said. She had undergone surgery in 1975 to be outfitted with two heart valves, and they were replaced in a second operation in 1985.         King Juan Carlos, a friend of Ms. Miro's since they were law students in Madrid 40 years ago, paid condolences at the city morgue on Sunday. Just two weeks ago, she directed Spanish state television's coverage, beamed worldwide, of the wedding in Barcelona of the King's daughter Princess Cristina.         Ms. Miro's film ''Beltenebros,'' a tale of intrigue about the resistance during Franco's dictatorship, won a Silver Bear award at the Berlin Film Festival in 1992. Her movie ''El Perro del Hortelano,'' an adaptation of a 17th-century Spanish comedy about palace romance, garnered seven prizes, including best director, at this year's Goya Awards, Spain's top film honors.         Ms. Miro, who became the first woman to direct dramas for Spanish television in 1966, was known for her link to progressive causes like the fight against racism. She won respect even from many leading conservatives, who attended her funeral today.         As the Culture Ministry director of cinema from 1982 to 1985, she began Government subsidies to cash-starved young filmmakers. Among the directors who acknowledged the benefit were Pedro Almodovar, nominated for an Oscar in 1989 for ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' and Fernando Trueba, who won the foreign-film Oscar in 1994 for ''Belle Epoque.''         Born on April 20, 1940, in Madrid, Ms. Miro studied law at the University of Madrid but switched her interest to cinema and began working at state television in 1960. She directed her first feature-length film in 1975, and her 1979 movie ''El Crimen de Cuenca'' was censored for almost two years in Spain for depicting a torture scene by Civil Guards. When it finally opened, it was a top box office attraction.         In 1982, she was a media adviser to Felipe Gonzalez when he was elected for the first time as Prime Minister, starting nearly 14 years of Socialist Party rule. Ms. Miro served in his administration, first in the Culture Ministry, then as Director General of state television and radio. She resigned from that post in 1989 during a controversy over her spending some $30,000 in Government funds for her personal wardrobe. She paid back the money and was cleared of wrongdoing by a court in 1992.         Her subsequent projects included directing television coverage, in 1995, of the royal wedding in Seville of Princess Elena, the King's eldest daughter.         Mr. Gonzalez attended the funeral today, as did the Spanish tenor Placido Domingo, whom Ms. Miro had seen perform at the Royal Theater opera house in Madrid the night before she died. The large crowd also included Princess Cristina and her husband, making their first public appearance since their wedding, and NATO's Secretary General, Javier Solana, formerly a Socialist minister under Mr. Gonzalez.         Ms. Miro is survived by a son, Gonzalo, and a brother, Carlos.       
         Margaret Harshaw, an American soprano and mezzo-soprano who was best known as a Wagnerian singer but whose performances in Mozart and Verdi operas were also highly regarded, died on Friday at Condell Memorial Hospital in Libertyville, Ill. She was 88 and lived in Lake Forest, Ill.         Ms. Harshaw sang at the Metropolitan Opera for 22 seasons, from November 1942, when she made her debut as the Second Norn in Wagner's ''Die Gotterdammerung,'' until March 1964, when she gave her final performance as Ortud in ''Lohengrin.'' Because she spent the first nine years of her Met career as a mezzo-soprano and then switched to soprano roles, she sang more Wagner roles than any other singer in the Met's history.         These include 14 roles in the ''Ring'' operas, in which she began as a Rhinemaiden and eventually sang all three Brunnhildes, as well as both Senta and Mary (in the same season) in ''Die Fliegende Hollander,'' Isolde in ''Tristan und Isolde,'' Magdalene in ''Die Meistersinger,'' Kundry in ''Parsifal'' and Elisabeth and Venus in ''Tannhauser.''         Miss Harshaw was born in Philadelphia in 1909 and began singing in church choirs as a child. From 1928 to 1932, she sang alto with the Mendelssohn Club, a chorus that performed with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra. A series of competition victories in the early 1930's led to performances in Philadelphia, Washington and New York City, all before she enrolled at the Juilliard Graduate School to begin her formal studies with Anna Schoen-Rene in 1936.         In March 1942, Miss Harshaw won the Metropolitan Opera's Auditions of the Air, and she began her career at the house at the start of the next season. In 1950 Rudolf Bing, the Met's general manager, was looking for a dramatic soprano to succeed Helen Traubel, particularly in Wagner roles, and persuaded Ms. Harshaw to switch to the higher range. She did so with notable success: her recordings as a soprano show her to have a clear timbre and considerable power.         All told, she sang 375 performances of 39 roles in 25 works at the house and was heard in 40 of the Met's weekly live broadcasts. Her non-Wagner roles at the Met included four in Verdi works -- Amneris in ''Aida,'' Ulrica in ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' Mistress Quickly in ''Falstaff'' and Azucena in ''Il Trovatore'' -- as well as Donna Anna in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' Gertrud in Humperdinck's ''Hansel und Gretel,'' Genevieve in Debussy's ''Pelleas et Melisande'' and Herodias in Strauss's ''Salome.''         Ms. Harshaw also sang at Covent Garden, Glyndebourne, the San Francisco Opera, the Paris Opera and with companies in Philadelphia, Cincinnati, New Orleans, San Antonio, Pittsburgh and Houston. She also made several Latin American tours and was a soloist with many of the major American orchestras. Roles she sang outside the Met include Dalila in Saint-Saens's ''Samson et Dalila,'' Leonore in Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' and the title roles in Puccini's ''Turandot'' and Gluck's ''Alceste.''         In 1962, Miss Harshaw became a professor of voice at Indiana University, where she taught until 1993. She is survived by a son, Oskar L. Eichna Jr., of East Northport, N.Y.       
         Catharine Carver, who won trans-Atlantic esteem as the editor of a galaxy of mid-20th century authors, including Hannah Arendt, John Berryman, Saul Bellow and Flannery O'Connor, died on Tuesday at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. Ms. Carver, an American who lived in London, was 76.         Friends said she died after a series of strokes.         Ms. Carver was widely known for her work at Lippincott with Leon Edel on many of the volumes of his biography of Henry James, a work she abridged at the author's request into a single volume. He acknowledged her success with thanks in his preface.         The last book to receive her professional attention, which was characterized by devotion to her authors, profound intelligence, sensitivity and scholarship and mastery of subject, as well as attention to detail and, above all, passion, was Richard Ellmann's biography ''Oscar Wilde,'' published by Knopf in 1987.         Aileen Ward, whose biography of John Keats won a National Book Award, said she was impressed that Ms. Carver had reread all of Keats's work before beginning to edit the manuscript. It was Ms. Carver who pointed out to Mr. Ellmann, who was baffled by James Joyce's use of the word trombone in a nonmusical sense while he was collecting an edition of the author's letters, that Joyce had simply appropriated a French colloquialism for paper clip.         Besides the praise she earned from individual authors, whose ranks also included E.E. Cummings, Lionel Trilling, Katherine Anne Porter, Bernard Malamud, Leslie Fiedler and Peter Matthiessen, Ms. Carver was given a citation some 20 years ago by New York P.E.N., the writers organization, for her ''creative contributions to authors and their works.''         Ms. Carver, who was born in Cambridge, Ohio, graduated in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Muskingum College in Ohio, where she was a classmate of the future astronaut and senator, John Glenn.         She began her editing career in 1945 with Reynal & Hitchcock, became the first reader at Partisan Review and was hired in 1950 by Robert Giroux as an editor at Harcourt, Brace and Company.         Subsequently she worked for Viking, Lippincott in Philadelphia and, briefly, for The New Yorker before leaving the United States in the 1960's to settle in England. There she worked at John Murray's and Chatto & Windus before joining Oxford University Press. But when that publisher shut down its offices in London, Ms. Carver declined to move to Oxford. Remaining in London, she worked with various publishers, including Victor Gollancz, and in the 1980's joined Trianon Press in Paris before returning to London.         She is not survived by any immediate family members.       
         Joyce Wethered, an elegant Englishwoman described by ''The Encyclopedia of Golf'' as ''the supreme woman golfer of her age, perhaps of all time,'' died last Tuesday, the day after her 96th birthday.         The Times of London agreed with that assessment. It said Wethered was ''the most stylish and successful woman golfer of her day, and is still widely regarded as the best the world has seen.''         In an era when women's golf was strictly an amateur game, Wethered, later known formally as Lady Heathcoat Amory, had a short career. Yet she won the British Amateur championship four times (1922, 1924, 1925 and 1929) and the English Amateur five consecutive years (1920 through 1924).         In 1930, Bobby Jones, the celebrated American golfer, played an exhibition with her at St. Andrews in Scotland. Afterward, he said he doubted if there had ever been a better golfer, man or woman.         In The Associated Press's 50-year poll in 1950, Wethered ranked seventh among all golfers and first among female golfers. The men ahead of her were Jones, Ben Hogan, Walter Hagen, Byron Nelson, Sam Snead and Gene Sarazen.         As a child, she was considered too frail for school and was tutored instead. On vacations, she was introduced to golf. She played with her brother, Roger, a future British Amateur champion. At age 10, she shot an 89.         In 1920, she was the No. 6 player on the Surrey county team, but had had only one lesson from a professional. She entered the English women's championship only because a teammate insisted on it. She beat Cecil  Leitch in the final, Leitch's first loss in a nonhandicap match in seven years.         At 5 feet 10 inches, Wethered was willowy, with a long and easy picture-book swing. She was a long hitter, outdriving the male amateurs who represented Britain in the Walker Cup matches by 20 yards.         When Willie Wilson, a Scottish professional who settled at the Pinehurst Country Club in North Carolina, was asked about her driving, he said: ''Why, mon, she could hit a ball 240 yards on the fly while standing barefoot on a cake of ice.''         At 23, after winning the 1925 British Amateur, she retired for the first time. She explained her decision this way: ''I have simply exercised a woman's prerogative of doing something without the slightest regard for what anybody thinks and because I want to please myself.''         In 1929, she was persuaded to play again. In a classic British Amateur final, she was five shots down after 11 holes to the American champion Glenna Collett, but won the scheduled 36-hole match, 3 and 1.         She retired again. In 1933, she was hired by Fortnum and Mason, the London department store, to advise customers about golf clubs and golf clothes. Uneasy British officials felt sure that made her a professional.         In 1935, she removed all doubt. She wanted to visit friends in North America. To help defray expenses, she agreed to accept money to play more than 50 exhibitions with such golfers as Jones, Sarazen and Babe Didriksen. She netted $20,000.         In one exhibition, her partner was Charlie Yates, an American who won the British Amateur three years later. ''I shot a 76 that day and I didn't help Joyce a single shot,'' he said. ''Not one. God, she could play.''         In 1937, Wethered married a baronet, Sir John Heathcoat Amory. Golf took a back seat in her life.         At home in Devon, she and her husband built a fine collection of paintings. Their garden won the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honor. They had no children. When her husband died in 1972, their house was turned over to the National Trust.         Perhaps the best-known story about her golf dealt with her concentration. Once, as she was about to hit a 9-foot putt on the 17th hole at the Sheringham course in Norfolk, a train rumbled by within 100 yards. She sank the putt anyway. When her playing partner said he was surprised the train had not interfered with her shot, she appeared baffled.         ''What train?'' she said.       
         Marguerite Henry, the author of the children's book classic ''Misty of Chincoteague,'' one of some four dozen books that introduced young readers to animals in the great outdoors, died on Wednesday at her home in Rancho Santa Fe, near San Diego. She was 95.         While much of her work as a professional writer remains highly popular, and in print, it was the tale of ''Misty,'' first published in 1947, that captured the imagination and took on a life of its own. It told of two orphaned siblings drawn to a wild horse on Chincoteague Island, off the Virginia shore. Ms. Henry's colorful story found its way onto film, still seen on television to this day, and made a popular tourist destination of the annual roundup and auction of wild horses on Virginia's barrier islands.         The real Misty died in 1972 but a life-size statue of the horse was recently dedicated at the site of that midsummer roundup, called Pony Penning Day. Ms. Henry spun out further stories about the filly and its young friends, Paul and Mary Beebe, into the 1990's.         She also wrote of wild mustangs, thoroughbreds, Arab stallions, Lippizaners and, notably, Gaudenza, the pride of the Palio, the annual horseback competition in Siena, Italy. She wrote of dogs and all manner of living things in a characteristic style, weaving the romance and history of mankind's association with the animal world into her illustrated texts.         In fact, Ms. Henry was city-bred and came to her love of animals and nature as an adult. The former Marguerite Breithaupt of Milwaukee  caught a whiff of printer's ink in her father's shop, honed her sense of drama in college and discovered the outdoors when she and her husband, Sidney Crocker Henry, a sales manager, moved to a farm in Wayne, Ill.         Her father owned a printing shop and piqued her interest one rainy Sunday by letting her read proofs. She was 10 and decided to become a writer, too. Delineator magazine  published one of her maiden efforts the next year, and paid for it.         ''It was just one step away from heaven,'' she said later.         At Milwaukee State Teachers' College she wrote prodigiously and acted in plays. She married after graduation and took up writing professionally soon after.         Her articles appeared in trade and business periodicals, and then national publications like The Saturday Evening Post and Reader's Digest. After moving to the farm in 1939, she readily took to country ways and showed it in her first book for children, ''Auno and Tauno: A Story of Finland'' (1940). Next she tackled ''Pictured Geographies,'' a series about Latin American countries for schoolchildren. She also began to write storybooks for the very young, including ''Benjamin West and His Cat Grimalkin''(1947). Researching ''Misty,'' she went to Chincoteague to sit in the sand and sense the island come alive around her.         The same sense of immediacy and adventure characterized her work for four decades. Among the many film and television adaptations that kept her writing alive for new audiences were ''Brighty of the Grand Canyon'' (1967), ''Justin Morgan Had a Horse'' (1972), ''Peter Lundy and the Medicine Hat Stallion'' (1977), ''Story of a Book'' (1980) and, most recently, her 1948 classic, the adventure tale about a white Arabian horse, ''King of the Wind'' (1990).         ''Misty of Chincoteague'' came to the big screen in 1961 and starred David Ladd and Pam Smith. By then the book that inspired it had sold well over a million copies. Sequels included ''Stormy, Misty's Foal'' (1963) and ''Misty's Twilight'' (1992).         Ms. Henry won many awards, including the John Newbery Honor Award for ''Misty of Chincoteague''  and the Newbery Medal for ''King of the Wind.'' She shared some of them with her illustrators, among them Wesley Dennis and Rich Rudish. Her books were translated into a dozen languages.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Francine Katzenbogen, a Brooklyn-born lottery millionaire who loved cats so much she worked tirelessly for animal adoption agencies, donated generously to their support and housed 20 beloved strays in luxury at her own suburban Los Angeles mansion, died on Oct. 30 at her home in Studio City. She was 51 and may have loved cats rather more than was good for her.         Her aunt, Lorraine Katzenbogen of Spokane, Wash., said the cause was a chronic asthma condition aggravated by strong allergic reactions to the very cats that were her niece's overriding passion.         In 1988, when she won a $7 million jackpot the first time she played the New York State Lottery, Miss Katzenbogen was a cosmetics consultant living at home with her parents and younger brother in Canarsie, where the whole family collected and sheltered stray cats.         Four years later, when a grief-stricken Miss Katzenbogen decided to move to the West Coast after the deaths of her mother and brother, she never considered leaving the cats behind, or allowing them to travel without her. So she booked space for herself and her brood on a cargo plane, packed up cats, Katzenbogen, kit and caboodle and, at a cost of some $8,000, including $4,000 in mandatory veterinary fees, flew off to a new life in Los Angeles. Her father, Irving, a retired house painter, later joined her.         Even before she arrived and settled into a $1 million Studio City estate she had bought three years earlier, Miss Katzenbogen, who had deferred an earlier planned move after her mother became ill, found that she was not entirely welcome in her exclusive new neighborhood.         Her neighbors were not amused that she planned to house 20 cats in a converted two-story garage she had refurbished at a cost of $100,000. The luxurious cat complex included tile floors, climbing towers, scratching posts, skylights and cozy, low-lying window ledges where the cats could stretch out and watch the world outside their air-conditioned lair.         In Brooklyn, where a fictional cat named Rhubarb once inherited a baseball team named the Loons, Miss Katzenbogen's expensive eccentricities on behalf of cats might have been shrugged off, but not on Laurel Canyon Boulevard.         Miss Katzenbogen had commissioned the renovations for what her neighbors called her cat house before learning that municipal zoning regulations imposed a limit of three cats per household. When she sought a belated exemption, 50 neighbors opposed her petition, arguing that the large number of cats would lower property values and even lure pet-eating coyotes into the neighborhood.         After Miss Katzenbogen gave assurances that cat litter would be removed daily and that the cats would be confined to their quarters and not loosed on the timorous neighborhood, she received an exemption allowing her to keep her 20 cats as long as they lived.         With the cats taken care of, she plunged into her new life, becoming a mainstay of several animal care agencies both as volunteer and philanthropist.         For all the time she devoted to cats in general and her cats in particular, Miss Katzenbogen managed to live a rich, full and varied life, indulging her passions for expensive clothes, movies and the arts and enjoying an active social life with a wide circle of friends.         If her extravagances on behalf of her cats raised eyebrows along the way, Miss Katzenbogen stood her ground.         ''If I went out and bought a piece of jewelry or an expensive car, nobody would think twice or criticize me,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1992. ''If I want to spend my money and take care of my cats, which are my family, I don't think it's anybody's business.''         Aside from her father and aunt, Miss Katzenbogen, who never married, is survived only by her cats, all of whom, her animal adoption friends vowed, would be placed in loving homes, although none perhaps as loving and certainly not as luxurious as the one they have been accustomed to.       
         Karen Hubert Allison, who with her husband, Len Allison, lived out every cook's fantasy of turning a home into a restaurant and later earned three stars for the establishment, Huberts, in Manhattan, died on Tuesday in Maui, Hawaii. She was 49 and had lived in Maui since 1995.         The cause of death was breast cancer, said Dr. Wayne Lavender, a family friend.         When the couple opened their restaurant on East 22d Street in Manhattan in 1981, American restaurants were still in the grip of French traditions. The best restaurants were those whose chefs were trained in other countries and were most comfortable with ingredients and techniques developed thousands of miles away. The Allisons were among the pioneers who advocated exploring America's own ingredients and traditions.         ''They keyed into this very new idea of new American cuisine, which was about finding good producers and good ingredients,'' said Peter Hoffman, who cooked at Huberts from 1981 to 1985 and now owns Savoy in SoHo.         Neither Mr. Allison nor Ms. Hubert Allison was a trained chef. In 1977, when the couple began serving meals in their Brooklyn home, their ambition was not to open a restaurant but to make a documentary about a neighborhood clothing store. Ms. Hubert and Mr. Allison, who married in 1984, needed to raise $10,000 for a new camera, and they hit on the idea of inviting their friends to buy weekend meals in their three-story house in Cobble Hill. Both Mr. Allison, an English teacher, and Ms. Hubert, a writer, did the cooking. Their plan worked so well that they not only raised the money but also decided to go into the restaurant business.         Their first restaurant, also called Huberts, opened in 1979 in a romantically ornate Victorian corner bar in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, where they quickly won critical acclaim. By 1981, demand for seats had overflowed the 12-table bar and they moved to 102 East 22d Street in Manhattan. There, with Ms. Hubert Allison in the dining room and Mr. Allison in the kitchen, Huberts became one of the signature New York restaurants of the 1980's, a time when New Yorkers were enthusiastically discovering the joys and social possibilities of fine wining and dining. It earned three stars in 1985 from Bryan Miller, the restaurant critic for The New York Times.         ''There were people coming from all over the globe who were either cooking there or sharing food thoughts, and you saw this riot of tastes and flavors settle down into this kind of signature cuisines,'' said Joshua Wesson, the wine writer and merchant who was the sommelier at Huberts from 1983 to 1986. ''Before there was a Greenmarket, there was Karen Hubert and Len Allison seeking out little growers and artisanal makers of cheese and bringing them down to this restaurant.''         Karen Hubert was born in New York City in 1948. She received a bachelor's degree from City College of New York, where she met Mr. Allison, and a master's degree in fine arts from Columbia University.         In 1987, the couple's daughter, Halley Cyd Marie Allison, was born, and in 1989 they had a son, Luke Edward Allison. In addition to her husband and children, Ms. Hubert Allison is survived by a stepson, Matthew Allison, 32, a record industry executive in Hong Kong.         After Halley's birth, Ms. Hubert Allison began to withdraw from the restaurant business. At the same time, the couple closed the 22d Street restaurant and opened a more expensive Huberts at Park Avenue and 63d Street. With four times the seating and three times the staff, it had less of the warmth and intimacy that characterized their earlier efforts. It, too, received three stars, but lasted only two years.         They tried to regain their touch in 1991 with Onda, a more modest restaurant serving a hybrid of Thai and Italian cuisines. It did not last long.         After that, the couple taught at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and then moved to Hawaii after Ms. Hubert Allison became ill in 1995. In Hawaii, she concentrated on writing. Her first novel, ''How I Gave My Heart to the Restaurant Business'' (Ecco Press), a roman a clef, was published earlier this year, and she completed a cookbook, ''The Vegetarian Compass,'' which is to be published by Little, Brown next spring.         Despite the couple's many achievements, one nagging detail always remained. Their documentary was never completed.       
         Esther Peterson, a dogged consumer advocate whose work has an impact on Americans every time they buy a can of soup or a box of laundry detergent, died on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 91.         Mrs. Peterson served in the Administrations of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter, and worked for businesses as well. Among her accomplishments was the labeling of foods with their nutritional value, so that shoppers can determine whether so many vitamins and proteins are worth their price in calories.         Similarly, she successfully advocated that products be priced per unit, so that a calculator was not needed to figure out whether 14.5 ounces of breakfast cereal at $4.29 or 15.75 ounces at $4.59 is the better buy.         And she accomplished those things with a gentle cajoling that masked an iron determination. At a party marking Mrs. Peterson's 90th birthday last year, Lynda Johnson Robb recalled the help that her father, President Johnson, got from Mrs. Peterson, and said, ''She had a velvet hammer and talked people into doing what was right, even if we didn't know it at the time.''         In her long career, in which she was active until just recently, Mrs. Peterson was an educator, a labor organizer, a public official and an advocate of women's rights.         She organized a strike in Boston in the 1930's among women who sewed aprons at home and were forced by their employer to switch from square pockets to heart-shaped ones, which were more difficult to cut and sew, without any increase in wages.         ''She won the strike,'' her son Iver said over the weekend, ''after she told the women to picket the boss but to dress nicely, because the police in Boston used to back their horses into pickets, 'but if you are properly dressed, the police won't do it.' ''         Mrs. Peterson was born in 1906 in Provo, Utah, to two immigrants from Denmark, Lars Eggertsen, the local superintendent of schools, and his wife, Annie, who, according to her son, ''kept boarders because they didn't pay superintendents much in those days.''         She received a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University in 1927 and a master's from Teachers' College, Columbia University, in 1930. She held several teaching positions in the 1930's, including one at the innovative Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, which brought milliners, telephone operators and garment workers onto the campus.         A Bryn Mawr College official described the school as a place ''not only to teach but to learn from the women workers the problems that together they and we must solve,'' but her son said that Mrs. Peterson's description was more succinct: a place that combined Shakespeare, drama and socialism.         She worked for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the American Federation of Teachers and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. In 1961, President Kennedy named her an Assistant Secretary of Labor and Director of the Women's Bureau, an agency that administered the labor laws concerning women.         When Mr. Johnson became President, he brought Mrs. Peterson into the White House as his special adviser for consumer affairs, and she served in a similar capacity for President Carter.         In 1971, at the age of 65, Mrs. Peterson started another career, this time in business as vice president for consumer affairs at Giant Food Inc., the largest supermarket chain in the Washington-Baltimore area.         Odonna Mathews, who worked with Mrs. Peterson as a University of Maryland undergraduate intern and now holds Mrs. Peterson's old position at Giant, said: ''Her friends in consumer activism asked, 'How can you work for a business and represent the consumer?' She showed it could be done.''         At Giant, Ms. Mathews said, she worked with Mrs. Peterson on the grade labeling of food. ''She found it confusing,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She asked, 'What's the difference between U.S. Fancy No. 1 and Extra Fancy?' ''         Ms. Mathews said Mrs. Peterson persuaded the supermarket to disclose what seafood had been previously frozen, a widespread practice now but one not in use before then.         ''She got Giant to try nutritional labeling on its private products before it was required by Federal law, comparing calories and proteins,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She got Giant to use open dating -- putting a date by which products like yogurt or milk must be sold.''         Before then, the stores used letter and number combinations to express the dates, a code that was not clear to buyers.         Ms. Mathews said Mrs. Peterson visited Giant stores often and was easily recognized by shoppers. She was tall, about 5 feet 10 inches, and she wore her long braided gray hair in a distinctive upsweep on the top of her head, a style described by her children as a ''Gretchen braid.''         Her photograph appeared in many of Giant's advertisements, including one in April 1972 when a shortage of beef caused its price to rocket and Mrs. Peterson urged the supermarket chain's customers to avoid beef purchases until the price came down.         ''You have a right to be informed about meat prices,'' a Giant advertisement said. ''We consumers can help bring prices down. Buy less meat. Use other forms of protein.''         The advertisement listed alternatives to meat like beans and lentils and was signed by Mrs. Peterson.         Mrs. Peterson later was hired by the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents as its consumer adviser, concerning herself particularly with the problems of older people, and she continued to keep a foot in both camps, serving on the board of Consumers Union.         She ended her public service career under yet another Democratic President, serving in a largely honorary role for the Clinton Administration with the United States Delegation to the United Nations.         Besides her son Iver, of Lawrenceville, N.J., who is a reporter for The New York Times, Mrs. Peterson is survived by two other sons, Eric N.,  of Alexandria, Va., and Lars E., of Washington; a daughter, Karen K. Wilken of Fort Collins, Colo., and 12 grandchildren.       
         Denise Levertov, a poet of intense emotion and fervid political conviction, died on Saturday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle, where she lived. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lymphoma, said Griselda Ohannessian of New Directions, Ms. Levertov's publisher.         As a poet and political activist, Ms. Levertov was ''a touchstone, a maintainer for our generation,'' the poet Robert Creeley, one of her first publishers in the United States, said yesterday. ''She was a constantly defining presence in the world we shared, a remarkable and transforming poet for all of us. She always had a vivid emotional response and also a completely dedicated sense of political and social need.''         The poet Kenneth Rexroth once wrote that Ms. Levertov was ''the most subtly skillful poet of her generation, the most profound, the most modest, the most moving.''         In the tradition established by William Carlos Williams, she wrote with a concrete immediacy of language. She spoke directly through her poetry, favoring commonplace objects and images over large philosophical concepts.         The author of more than 30 books of poetry, essays and translations, she wrote with great particularity and sensitivity about aspects of love, spiritual as well as erotic. More and more, her work conveyed her political awareness and social consciousness. She was, as in the title of her first book of essays, ''The Poet in the World.'' At the same time, in her art she would contemplate her own life, writing confessional poems about her marital and familial problems. For her, content and form were ''in a dynamic state of interaction.''         In ''The Ache of Marriage,'' she wrote:         The ache of marriage:         thigh and tongue, beloved,         are heavy with it,         it throbs in the teeth         We look for communion         and are turned away, beloved,         each and each         It is leviathan and we         in its belly         looking for joy, some joy         not to be known outside it         two by two in the ark of         the ache of it.         And in ''Of Being,'' she wrote:         I know this happiness         is provisional:         the looming presences --         great suffering, great fear --         withdraw only         into peripheral vision:         but ineluctable this shimmering         of wind in the blue leaves:         this flood of stillness         widening the lake of sky:         this need to dance,         this need to kneel:         this mystery:         A defining moment of her life was the Vietnam War. She helped found a group called the Writers' and Artists' Protest Against the War in Vietnam, she was actively involved in the anti-nuclear movement, and in 1967 she edited a volume of poetry for the War Resisters League. In the same year, she published ''The Sorrow Dance,'' a book of poems whose sorrow included the war and also the death of the poet's sister.         Ms. Levertov was born in Ilford, England. Her father was Paul Philip Levertoff, a Russian Jew who converted to Christianity and became an Anglican priest. Her mother was from Wales. Her father's conversations about the family background in Hasidism and her mother's knowledge of Welsh and English folklore proved influential. Educated by her parents, she was introduced to poetry by her older sister, Olga, and was writing from an early age.         During World War II, she worked as a nurse in London and also began publishing her poetry. In 1940 her first poem appeared in Poetry Quarterly, and, said Mr. Rexroth, he and other poets were soon ''in excited correspondence about her'' as ''the baby of the new Romanticism.'' Her first volume of verse, ''The Double Image,'' was published in 1946.         After the war she married Mitchell Goodman, an American writer, and for several years they lived in France near Mr. Creeley, who was a friend of Mr. Goodman. In 1948 the couple moved to the United States, where Ms. Levertov studied and was influenced by such modernist poets as Williams, Wallace Stevens and Ezra Pound, and also continued her artistic relationship with Mr. Creeley, Robert Duncan and other Black Mountain poets.         Both she and her husband frequently spoke out on political issues, particularly regarding the Vietnam War. Mr. Goodman was convicted along with Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling resistance of the draft. Ms. Levertov and Mr. Goodman were divorced in 1975. Mr. Goodman died last February. They had one son, Nikolai, who lives in Seattle.         When Ms. Levertov's 11th collection of verse, ''The Freeing of the Dust,'' was published in 1975, the poet David Ignatow wrote in The New York Times Book Review that ''by nearly unanimous agreement Levertov was well on her way to becoming one of our leading poets'' with ''her forceful and compassionate presentations of urban lives'' and ''the beauty and sensuousness of her nature poems.'' By shifting to ''passionate Vietnam poems,'' she had lost some of her following but gained a new vitality.         Ms. Levertov wrote through six decades. In the 1990's, she published ''New and Selected Essays''; four poetry volumes, ''Evening Train,'' ''Sands of the Well,'' ''The Life Around Us: Selected Poems on Nature'' and ''The Stream and The Sapphire: Selected Poems on Religious Themes,'' and the prose memoir  ''Tesserae: Memories and Suppositions.''         She taught at colleges and universities, and served as poetry editor of The Nation and Mother Jones. Among her honors were the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award in poetry and the $50,000 Lannan Prize. In 1996, she won the Governor's Award from the Washington State Commission for the Humanities.         She felt compelled to clarify and justify the uses of poetry in a world of political crisis. In ''New and Selected Essays'' she wrote, ''One is in despair over the current manifestation of malevolent imbecility and the seemingly invincible power of rapacity, yet finds oneself writing a poem about the trout lilies in the spring woods. And one has promised to speak at a meeting or help picket a building. If one is conscientious, the only solution is to attempt to weigh conflicting claims at each crucial moment, and in general to try to juggle well and keep all the oranges dancing in the air at once.''         Ms. Levertov was a masterly juggler of words, images and feelings, as well as a defender of artistic and political liberty.         In ''Overheard Over S.E. Asia,'' she wrote:         I am the snow that burns.         I fall         wherever men send me to fall --         but I prefer flesh, so smooth, so dense:         I decorate it in black, and seek the bone.       
         Marion Bell, who created the leading role of Fiona MacLaren in the original Broadway production of the Alan Jay Lerner-Frederick Loewe musical ''Brigadoon'' in 1947 and then married Mr. Lerner, died on Dec. 14 at the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, Calif. She was 78 and lived in Culver City.         As the innocent young woman in the mysterious Scottish town that comes back to life one day in every 100 years, Ms. Bell captivated critics as well as theatergoers. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson was so taken with the show as ''a singing pattern of enchantment'' that he hesitated to write about individual performers.         He did say, however, that ''Almost Like Being in Love'' was ''sung rapturously'' by David Brooks and Ms. Bell. The musical historian Miles Kreuger, who saw the show in its premiere engagement and later became a friend of Ms. Bell's, said this week that as Fiona ''she had the most wondrous, doe-like, ethereal quality.''         For her role in ''Brigadoon,'' she won many awards, including the Donaldson Award for best debut performance by an actress in a musical. Subsequently she made record albums for RCA Victor, including the original cast album of ''Brigadoon.''  It was to be her only New York musical.         She was born in St. Louis. By the age of 8, she was singing on radio. After the family moved to California, the director Robert Z. Leonard heard her singing at a party and was instrumental in having her signed by Metro Goldwyn Mayer.         She appeared with the Marx Brothers in ''A Night at the Opera.'' She studied voice both in Rome and in California and later sang a duet with the Metropolitan Opera tenor James Melton in the movie, ''Ziegfeld Follies.''         Mr. Lerner and Mr. Loewe apparently wanted her to play a role in their musical, ''The Day Before Spring,'' but MGM held her to her contract. Several years later, she auditioned for ''Brigadoon,'' and acted in the show for a year.         She married Mr. Lerner in 1947 and they were divorced two years later. Ms. Bell was the second of his eight wives.         In 1948, she was in the world premiere of Kurt Weill and Arnold Sundgaard's folk opera, ''Down in the Valley,'' at Indiana University and repeated her role on television. Later she sang at the St. Louis Municipal Opera, the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera and the Sacramento Music Circus. In recent years she taught voice in Culver City.         She is survived by a son, Tom Charlesworth of Portland, Ore., and two sisters, Evelyn Lewis of Hawaii and Veronica McKinley of New Castle, Pa.       
         Dr. Elizabeth B. Keller, a biochemist who made it easier to understand a basic principle of life because she had the insight to see a cloverleaf where others saw only an infinitesimally small strand of the genetic material called RNA, died on Saturday at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester. She was 79 and lived in Ithaca, N.Y.         The cause was complications from acute leukemia, said a sister, Sandy Socolar.         Dr. Keller's cloverleaf model, still used in textbooks, describes transfer RNA, which helps control how the genetic information in DNA is translated into the building of proteins.         Her model was sent to a colleague, Dr. Robert W. Holley, in a Christmas card, according to lore at Cornell University, where she worked in molecular biology from 1965 until close to her death. She retired as a professor emerita in 1988 but continued to do research. The model was later published by Dr. Holley as part of a larger set of work that won him a share of the Nobel Prize for unraveling the genetic code of RNA. Dr. Holley gave some of the prize money to Dr. Keller and others on his research team at Cornell.         Using paper, pipe cleaners or pieces of Velcro, Dr. Keller would make models of the 77 subunits of a kind of transfer RNA. She found that the cloverleaf model best showed how transfer RNA did its work, finding and transporting the right amino acids to be linked together into proteins, said Dr. Joseph Calvo, a biochemist at Cornell.         ''Anybody in the field would know that design today but would not know Betty,'' Dr. Calvo said. ''Her contributions were always behind the scene, looking until she found the shape that something wanted to take.''         Dr. Keller is best known for her early explanations of how proteins are made within cells. ''Her work was like taking the engine out of a car to see how it works,'' Dr. Calvo said. ''If it works outside the car, you know something. She was one of those who figured out a way to make proteins outside the cell so they could be studied.''         Elizabeth Waterbury Beach, the youngest daughter of Congregational missionaries, was born in Changle, in Fujian Province in China.         She studied at Oberlin College and received her B.S. degree at the University of Chicago in 1940, and her Ph.D. at Cornell University Medical College in Manhattan in 1948. She worked at the Huntington Memorial Laboratory of Massachusetts General Hospital and at Harvard University, the United States Public Health Service and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before Dr. Holley recruited her to join Cornell.         Her marriage to Geoffrey Keller ended in divorce.         Survivors include her husband, Dr. Leonard Spector, and two sisters, Frances B. Bingham of New Haven, and Mrs. Socolar, of Manhattan.       
         Amanda Pirie Warrington, an equestrian, died yesterday at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Del., of injuries she received after falling from her horse while competing at the Fair Hill horse trials in Maryland. She was 29 and lived in Unionville, Pa.         Mrs. Warrington was considered  one of the top riders in the country in the three-day event. In that Olympic equestrian discipline, the horse and rider are called on to perform a prescribed set of movements called  dressage; a speed and endurance test, which involves jumping a set of fixed obstacles in the countryside, and show jumping.         She represented the United States in 1996 at the Blenheim Castle three-day event in England; also that year she won the fall national championship three-day event of the United States equestrian team at Fair Hill. Earlier this year she won the Essex three-day event in Gladstone, N.J.         She was born on Aug. 22, 1968, in Boston, the daughter of Robert S. Pirie, vice chairman of investment banking at Societe Generale Securities Corporation, and Deirdre H. Pirie, also an equestrian. She was  educated at Marlboro College in Marlboro, Vt., and was married in June 1993 to Daniel L. Warrington, a race horse trainer.         In addition to her parents, of Hamilton, Mass., and her husband, she is survived by a sister, Sophie Clifton of Bozeman, Mont., and a brother, John Pirie of Hamilton.       
         Mildred Mosler Weisenfeld, who helped build an organization for researching blindness, died last Saturday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 76.         The cause was complications of lung cancer, said Dr. Kenneth R. Barasch, national president of the Fight for Sight, an organization through which she raised money.         Ms. Weisenfeld, who lost her eyesight at 25 as a result of retinitis pigmentosa, began her effort as the National Council to Combat Blindness in 1946. Starting with $8 of her own but no office door on which to hang a sign, she soon transformed it into the Fight for Sight Inc. Her campaign became a national group that has awarded grants that total more than $13 million.         Ms. Weisenfeld was chief organizer and executive director over 50 years, often working 12-hour days. The money enabled the Fight for Sight to provide 40 grants a year totaling $400,000. Additional aid goes to five children's eye clinics, in New York City, Newark, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, including the Fight For Sight clinic in the Harkness Institute at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.         The group sponsors grants and postdoctoral and student fellowships, as well as backing basic research proposed by vision specialists early in their careers. According to Dr. Barasch, the money let many recipients to become prominent in the field.         The projects have contributed directly and indirectly to advances made in areas like lens implants, the preservation of donated corneas, laser techniques and treatments to slow glaucoma.         Ms. Weisenfeld was born in Brooklyn. She attended Brooklyn College in the early 40's. In 1936, she was given a diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa, when she was 15. The hereditary degenerative disease causes night blindness, retinal pigmentation changes, narrowing of the visual field and, eventually, blindness.         As her condition worsened, Ms. Weisenfeld found that much remained unknown about the disease. Her initiative won the attention of Congress in 1949, when she coordinated testimony on eye research before the House.         The hearings led Congress to recognize eye disease as a factor when it created the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Blindness. That move, again with her encouragement, led to the establishment of a separate National Eye Institute in the National Institutes of Health.         In 1956, she married Albert G. Mosler, a businessman from Philadelphia who was blinded by retinitis pigmentosa. He died in 1967. There are no immediate survivors.
