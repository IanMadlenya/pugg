         Dr. Alma Hawkins, a pioneering modern-dance educator who founded the dance department at the University of California at Los Angeles, died on Jan. 8 at her home in Santa Monica. She was 94.         Born in Rolla, Mo., Dr. Hawkins graduated from the University of Missouri and went on to study at Teachers College, Columbia University, where she became interested in modern dance. She trained in dance at Bennington College and in Colorado before earning master's and doctor's degrees at Columbia.         She taught at Emporia State University in Kansas and George Williams College in Chicago before joining the dance program at U.C.L.A.; she was its chairwoman from 1953 to her retirement in 1977.         In 1962, Dr. Hawkins established an autonomous dance department, equal in status to the departments of art, music and theater arts, at the College of Fine Arts at the university.         According to the University of California at Los Angeles, it was the nation's first university dance department, eventually offering degrees in dance therapy, dance history, esthetics and education as well as choreography and performance.         Dr. Hawkins encouraged the establishment of an interdepartmental program in ethnic arts that later became the world arts and cultures program. She worked closely with dance presenters to bring leading American and foreign troupes to perform at Royce Hall at the university.         In 1967, she formed the Council of Dance Administrators, a product of a national conference on dance sponsored by the arts and humanities division of the United States Office of Education.         The council published ''Standards for Dance Major Programs'' of colleges in 1979, leading to a national dance certification program. Also in 1967, Dr. Hawkins founded the West Coast Dance Film Archives. She later founded the national Council of Graduate Dance/Movement Therapy Educators.         Dr. Hawkins was a dance therapist and researcher at the university's Neuropsychiatric Institute from 1960 to 1977, training dance therapists and creating a series of educational research films about the field. On her retirement from U.C.L.A., Dr. Hawkins taught for more than 10 years in the dance department at Santa Monica College.         She is survived by her sister, Alice Hawkins of Santa Monica, Calif.       
         Rose Sheppard Milbank, a longtime volunteer with the Red Cross and the United Nations, and a philanthropist who supported projects in underdeveloped countries, died on Monday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. She was 81 and had suffered a stroke, a family spokesman said.         For many years, Mrs. Milbank, who was known as Posy, divided her time between the United Nations in New York and Red Cross meetings around the world. As chairwoman of five United Nations committees from 1962 to 1973, all of which dealt with cooperation between the United Nations and nongovernmental organizations, she focused on the coordination of disaster relief.         Mrs. Milbank was born in New Haven on Aug. 23, 1916, one of eight children of Rose Marie and John Day Jackson, owner of the New Haven Register and the New Haven Journal-Courier.         After graduating from the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., she attended Vassar College and the University of Lausanne in Switzerland before marrying John Wade Sheppard. Mr. Sheppard ran a printing and office supply concern in Long Island City, Queens, and other family businesses in Charlotte, N.C. He later became an estate planner in Greenwich.         She began her volunteer career in 1951 with the Greenwich chapter of the American Red Cross and in 1957 was chosen as the representative of the League of Red Cross Societies to the United Nations.         Mr. Sheppard accompanied his wife on most of her trips. In 1979, observing that foreign aid generally alleviated major needs but left smaller ones untouched, the couple set up their own charitable trust fund, called NEEDS (Neighbors Everywhere for Education and Development). The fund made grants to small grass-roots projects in underdeveloped countries.         Her husband died in 1990, and the following year she married Jeremiah Milbank, a philanthropist whose family was involved in investment banking and founded the International Center for the Disabled. The couple worked together for the center, the Red Cross and the Boys and Girls Club of America.         Mrs. Milbank is survived by her husband; her children, Sandra Rodgers of Winchester, Mass., Gail Moloney of Greenwich, Conn., Lynn Manger of Manhattan and John W. Sheppard Jr. of Darien, Conn.; a brother, Lionel Jackson of Montecito, Calif.; a sister, Katharine Reese of Havre de Grace, Md., and 11 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Barbara Benson Crowther, a business manager of a law firm and a volunteer in mental health, died yesterday at her home in Palmyra, Va. She was 60 years old. She died of a heart attack, her husband, F. Bosley Crowther 3d, said.         Ms. Crowther was born in New York City and managed Mr. Crowther's law firm in Palmyra. She was a former chairwoman of a community board in Fluvanna County, Va., that provided services for mental health, mental retardation and drug addiction.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Barbara C. Marziali of Charlottesville, Va.; a son, F. Bosley Crowther 4th of Los Angeles; a brother, Edward George Benson Jr. of Storrs, Conn. and a sister, M. Ophelia Benson of Seattle.       
         Countess Anthony Szapary, the doyenne of Newport society and the great-great-granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt who lived a good part of the year on the upper floors of  the Breakers, maintaining the family's presence in the 70-room mansion built by her grandparents, died on Sunday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 79.         The Countess had suffered a stroke at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y., her family said.         The former Sylvia Anita Gabriel Denise Irene Marie Szechenyi (pronounced sa-CHAIN-ee) was one of five daughters of Count Lazlo Szechenyi and Gladys Moore Vanderbilt Szechenyi. Her father was the first minister from Hungary to the United States and later served at the Court of St. James. Her mother was the daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt 2d, who built the Breakers as the family's summer home.         The house, designed by Richard Morris Hunt and covering more than an acre of the 11-acre estate, was modeled after Renaissance palaces in Turin and Genoa, and was finished in 1895. The mansion, which, with furnishings costing $7 million, was one of the Gilded Age estates referred to by their owners at the time as cottages.         The Breakers was maintained as a private residence until 1947 when it was leased to the Preservation Society of Newport County for $1 a year. The maintenance and the taxes were paid by Countess Szechenyi until her death in 1965. The society bought the property in 1972, but Countess Szapary (pronounced sa-PAR-ee) continued to live in rooms on the third floor, and her devotion to the Breakers endured to the end of her life, officials of the society said yesterday. The original furnishings were not included in the sale of the property, but over the years Countess Szechenyi's descendants gave most of them to the society.         Countess Szapary, who was known as Syvie to her friends, was a lively woman with strong opinions, an impish sense of humor and an adventurous spirit. As a child, she used a large silver tray to toboggan down the impressive staircase at the Breakers, a tradition that younger members of the Vanderbilt family are said to have carried on. She also rode her bicycle at breakneck speed around the great hall, and during World War II, when the house was shuttered, she maintained, tongue in cheek, that she kept America safe through her volunteer work as a plane spotter on the roof of a boys school in Newport.         In her later years, after the Breakers was opened to tourists (who were always called guests, at her insistence), she would occasionally join the tour group, casually dressed, her identity unknown, and correct the guides if she believed they had made a mistake.         Born in Remete, in Austria-Hungary, on Oct. 9, 1918, the Countess attended the Potomac School in Washington, Miss Faunce's School in London and the Chateau Brilliantmont in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1949, she married Count Anthony Szapary, a founder of the Hungarian National Sports Federation. Earlier, during World War II, he had been sent to a concentration camp for activities with the Hungarian Red Cross and his relief work for Polish and Jewish refugees. He was released through the intervention of King Gustav V of Sweden and came to the United States in 1947, becoming an adviser to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. He died in 1972.         The Countess is survived by a son, Paul, and a daughter, Gladys Szapary, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Countess Ferdinandine Eltz of Salzburg, Austria.         Countess Szapary was a former president of the Rhode Island Arts Foundation at Newport and was actively involved in the Newport Preservation Society. She was an organizer of the Newport Coaching weekends and aided several charities. She enjoyed both giving and going to parties and, as an avid amateur photographer, almost always had a small camera slung around her neck at the many social occasions in which she took part. She was known among her friends for the small albums of photographs that she often sent to other celebrators.         Countess Szapary was chairwoman of the 1995 centennial celebration of the Breakers, for which she created, in the stables of the estate, ''New York Central With the Vanderbilts,'' a small-scale version of the New York Central Lines, founded by Cornelius Vanderbilt. The model was created using her own trains and has become a favorite display for the younger guests of the house.         Creating an image that has endured among preservationists as well as family members, the Countess appeared at the opening, immediately before the family ball was to begin, clad in a T-shirt with a New York Central logo, an engineer's cap and a bandaged foot.         ''She told me she had hurt it bungee jumping,'' said Alfred Vanderbilt Jr., a cousin.       
         Ruth Forbes Young, who founded the International Peace Academy, an organization that trains negotiators, diplomats and military personnel in peacekeeping and provides meeting grounds for diplomats involved in efforts to prevent hostilities, died on March 5 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 94.         Mrs. Young's interest in peace started with the dropping of the atomic bomb in 1945. She first joined the World Federalists, a group that worked to influence governments toward peace, but came to believe that an organization that directly involved private citizens would be more effective.         ''When the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, I realized that something enormous had happened, something that had never happened before and that people should take responsibility about what to do about it, for the world would be a really different place from now on,'' she said in a videotaped history of the academy, which is based in Manhattan. ''U Thant was Secretary General of the United Nations at the time. So I asked for a meeting with him. He responded and met me and sat on a bench with me outside. I told him my ideas that an international peace academy could be really useful, but I did not know the right people to start such a thing and how would you suggest I go about it.''         U Thant recommended that she enlist the aid of Maj. Gen. Indar Jit Rikhye, who had been military adviser to U Thant and Dag Hammarskjold. After helping establish the academy in 1970, General Rikhye became its first president, holding that position for 20 years. Mrs. Young provided the start-up money for the organization and, together with several foundations, continued to contribute to its financing.         The academy consists of a few specialists who prepare training models in conflict avoidance, mediation, negotiation, maintaining cease-fires and armistice agreements, negotiation and peacekeeping. There were also off-the-record meetings that brought together United Nations representatives, government officials and an assortment of specialists.         More recently, the group sponsored informal monthly breakfast meetings, also off the record, for such participants and led by Olara Otunnu, the current president, and Rita Hauser, chairwoman of the board.         ''The academy has helped in the career development of hundreds of diplomats and military commanders,'' General Rikhye said from his home in Charlottesville, Va. ''Its pioneering efforts in training future peacekeepers and trainers have had a global impact.''         Mrs. Young was born into a family of diplomats in Milton, Mass., the daughter of Ralph Emerson Forbes and Elise Cabot and a great-granddaughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Her uncle Cameron Forbes was the first Governor-General of the Philippines and often entertained government and military officials, including President William Howard Taft and Gen. John J. Pershing.         In the mid-1920's, she married George Lyman Paine Jr., an architect in New York City. They divorced in the 1930's. Two sons, Michael Paine of Harvard, Mass., and Cameron Paine of Tylersport, Pa., and two grandchildren survive.         In the early 40's she married Dr. Giles Thomas, a psychologist in Manhattan, who died several years later. Her third marriage, to Arthur M. Young, who built the first helicopter to be certified for commercial use, was in 1948.         The couple set up the Institute for the Study of Consciousness in Berkeley in 1972, believing that the world had become too focused on material objects and needed a new spiritual and moral order. Mr. Young died in 1995.       
         Jeanette Wakin, an expert in the arcane world of medieval Islamic law, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 69 and was a senior lecturer at Columbia University, where she had long been a mainstay in the department of Middle Eastern and Asian language and culture.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         The daughter of Lebanese immigrants, Dr. Wakin, who was born in Bridgeport, Conn., moved to California as a teen-ager, beginning her college studies at the University of California at Los Angeles before completing her undergraduate studies at the New School for Social Research in New York.         For all her Lebanese heritage, Dr. Wakin, a Greek Orthodox Catholic, attributed her interest in Arabic and Islamic studies to a chance course she took as an undergraduate.         Islamic law, which is so abstruse that algebra must be used to calculate inheritances, may not seem like an especially appealing field of scholarship, but once she caught the bug, Dr. Wakin could not shake it off.         After a brief period as travel editor of the Saturday Review, she entered graduate school at Columbia, where she studied under Joseph Schacht, who was widely regarded as a pioneer in the modern study of Islamic legal traditions.         After receiving her master's degree and doctorate, Dr. Wakin remained at Columbia as a member of the faculty, attaining tenure as senior lecturer in 1974 and serving as department chairwoman.         Although she set high standards for her students, Dr. Wakin, who was just as demanding of herself, was a popular teacher. A workhorse who cheerfully accepted administrative tasks others shunned, Dr. Wakin never became a full professor. Her friends attributed the slight to the internecine world of academic politics.         One of her more important scholarly contributions was a 1972 book, ''The Function of Documents in Islamic Law.'' Dr. Wakin was also editor of the Journal of the American Oriental Society and chairwoman of the Columbia Seminar on Arabic Studies.         She took an active and compassionate interest in the modern Islamic world. In 1975, during the war between Lebanon and Israel, she traveled to Lebanon and meticulously gathered the names of Lebanese citizens who had disappeared. More recently, she arranged scholarships at American universities for Muslim students from Bosnia.         Dr. Wakin is survived by a son, Daniel, an Associated Press correspondent in Rome; a sister, Mary Lou Wakin of Manhattan; a brother, Joseph Wakin of Stamford, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Augusta Braxston Baker, a spellbinding storyteller, editor and former custodian of the children's section at the New York Public Library, died on Feb. 23 at Baptist Medical Center in Columbia, S.C. A Columbia resident since 1980, she was 86 and formerly lived in St. Albans, Queens.         Mrs. Baker was associated with the New York Public Library for 37 years, until her retirement in 1974 as coordinator of children's services and supervisor of storytelling for all its branches. She also conducted a weekly broadcast, ''The World of Children's Literature,'' on WNYC radio in the 1970's and continued as a visiting lecturer on library sciences at Columbia University until 1979.         After moving to the South, she became the storyteller in residence at the University of South Carolina.  Columbia established a yearly storytelling festival in her honor in 1987,  called ''A(ugusta) Baker's Dozen,'' and the Association of Library Services to Children of the American Library Association in 1993 cited her for a Distinguished Services Award, its highest tribute to a member.         Mrs. Baker was admired as someone who could enchant children and their parents alike. Over the years she also reviewed children's books for The New York Times and was a  judge of its Book Review's list of best-illustrated books.         In 1941, she printed her first listing of books about black life. Teachers and librarians kept it current as a guide for all library visitors. Mrs. Baker usually reviewed about 150 to 200 books for her list.         She was a past chairwoman of the Newbery Caldecott Committee, which bestows medals each year on the authors and illustrators of the children's books deemed the most distinguished. With Ellin Greene, she wrote ''Storytelling: Art and Technique.''         Mrs. Baker suggested that a parent start with books of folk and fairy tales to be retold while sitting comfortably on a living room rug or under a shade tree in the park, preferably without interruptions. It is the voice that counts, she said, and it  must be pleasing, flexible and enthusiastic enough to add drama to the story line, though overly dramatic gestures ought to be avoided.         ''Naturally, we try to entertain:  that is the heart of all storytelling,'' she told an interviewer in 1955. ''But our initial purpose is to teach the child to listen. Through this approach we try to strengthen his literary awareness.''         She was born in Baltimore and graduated in 1933 from what is now the State University of New York at Albany, where she received a degree in library science the next year.         She joined the New York Public Library in 1937 as a children's librarian for its Countee Cullen Branch in Harlem.         While at the Harlem branch she helped build its James Weldon Johnson Collection of quality books about the black experience and in 1946 compiled a bibliography, ''Books About Negro Life for Children.''         She advanced to the main branch in 1961 as assistant coordinator and storytelling expert and was named  coordinator of children's services in 1961.         She was divorced from her first husband, James Henry Baker Jr., who died in 1956. Her second husband, Gordon Alexander, died in 1987 after 43 years of marriage.         She is survived by a son, James Henry Baker 3d of Columbia, and two granddaughters.       
         Joanne Eve Lukomnik, a consultant and lifelong advocate of community health services who was also active in national professional and policy-making health groups, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 51.         The cause was complications from multiple myeloma, her family said.         Over the years, Dr. Lukomnik held teaching, medical and administrative positions at Columbia University's School of Public Health, the United States Public Health Service, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Jersey City Family Health Center, among others.         She was on many committees and boards of the American Public Health Association and was elected chairwoman in 1995. Her other associations included the National Conference on Primary Care, sponsored jointly by the Federal Public Health Service and the Kellogg, Kaiser and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations. She was also a member of the editorial board of The Journal of the American Medical Women's Association.         She was raised in the Bronx, studied sociology and anthropology at Reed College, and graduated with a degree in fine arts from New York University in 1969. She took premedical studies at Columbia and received her M.D. in 1975 from the State University Health Science Center in Stony Brook, N.Y..         She held a master's degree in public health from Columbia, and she studied sociology at the University of Edinburgh and social medicine at the Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem.         Dr. Lukomnik is survived by her husband, Len Rodberg; two children, Simon and Josie Rodberg of Manhattan; her mother, Mary Lukomnik of the Bronx, and her brothers, David and Jon Lukomnik, both of Manhattan.       
         Maria Grandy, a ballet teacher and coach long associated with the Joffrey Ballet and the chairwoman of the Dance Notation Bureau, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 61 and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Seymour Schorr.         In 1957 and 1958, Ms. Grandy was a dancer in the Robert Joffrey Theater Ballet, as the company was then called. After appearing on television, in summer stock and at Radio City Music Hall, she returned to the Joffrey Ballet in 1966 as a coach in its apprenticeship program.         Because of her teaching ability, she was asked in 1972 to help guide Joffrey II, the organization's second company. She worked with its artistic director, Sally Bliss, as an associate director and eventually served as full director for two years until the troupe was reorganized in 1985.         While with the Joffrey, Ms. Grandy studied Labanotation, a system of notation for preserving dance, at the Dance Notation Bureau. Over the years, she staged ballets by Joffrey, Leonide Massine and Antony Tudor for the Vienna State Opera Ballet, the Royal Ballet of Flanders and Ottawa Ballet Theater, among other companies. She became chairwoman of the notation bureau in 1994.         A native of Portland, Ore., Ms. Grandy began her dance training there, and in 1955 toured with the New York City Ballet on a special short-term contract. She came to New York with that company, and later danced with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet.         Ms. Grandy joined the dance faculty of the Juilliard School in 1989. She served on the board of the National Association for Regional Ballet, a group now known as Regional Dance America. She also was ballet mistress for the New York City Opera and a member of the dance panel of the New York State Council on the Arts.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Grandy is survived by her mother, Frances Grandy of Manhattan; two daughters, Allegra Fitch of Brooklyn and Lydia Silverman of Riverdale, the Bronx, and three grandchildren, Zachary Fitch and Julia and Evan Silverman.       
         Florence Skelly Altman, an innovator in opinion research, died on Tuesday at Scottsdale, Ariz., Memorial Hospital. She was 73 and lived in Scottsdale.         The cause of death was complications of heart disease, her daughter, Alexandra Altman, said.         Ms. Skelly, as she was known professionally, was instrumental in developing many techniques that are now standard in market research, including the use of simulated test markets to estimate the potential of new products. Today, variations of the method are used by major packaged goods marketing companies such as Procter & Gamble.         ''She had a great flair for the numbers side of the business, but saw the human implications of the numbers like no one I have ever known,'' said Daniel Yankelovich, a partner of Ms. Skelly at the opinion research firm that bore their names.         The social implications of Ms. Skelly's work were apparent in a study of younger Americans she and Mr. Yankelovich conducted in the late 1960's, among the first to call them baby boomers.         Arthur H. White, another partner and a professional colleague of Ms. Skelly for 50 years, said, ''The study revealed gender and race problems, that we had a society in which large segments of the population were not treated as well as other segments and that attitudes about institutions were changing.''         ''In those studies,'' he added, ''we saw that most people did not want to accept everything an employer or the Government said.''         Ms. Skelly had firsthand experience with sex discrimination early in her career. Mr. White recalled a meeting in the 1950's that he, Ms. Skelly and another male executive from Stewart Dougall, a New York research firm where she worked early on, were asked to attend with the board of the New York Stock Exchange. ''She had to sit outside in the hall while we, the two men, went in to talk,'' Mr. White said.         Suffering such indignities did little to dispel what her colleagues said was an admirable disposition.         ''She was a wonderful, witty person, very funny but serious at the same time, which is a great combination,'' Mr. Yankelovich said. ''Our clients loved her, and she loved the business.''         Ms. Skelly, a longtime resident of New York, moved to Scottsdale in the mid-1990's. She was a graduate of Hunter College, where her senior honors paper in social psychology, based on a public opinion survey of a Y.W.H.A. project in New York, exhibited her interest in market research.         She spent four years at Stewart Dougall, went to Washington for two years and worked on the 1950 Census, and then returned to the firm.         In 1961 she and Mr. White left to join Mr. Yankelovich. Later in the decade, the firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. was renamed Yankelovich, Skelly & White. In 1986, two years after the firm was bought by the  Saatchi & Saatchi Company, the advertising concern, Mr. Yankelovich, Ms. Skelly and Mr. White left to start another firm, citing policy disagreements.         Until her death Ms. Skelly served as vice chairwoman of the new firm, DYG Inc., based in Danbury, Conn. (Saatchi & Saatchi sold the former Yankelovich, Skelly & White, now Yankelovich Partners, in 1992.)         In recognition of her contributions to the field, in 1990 the Market Research Council inducted Ms. Skelly into its Market Research Hall of Fame.         Over the years Ms. Skelly served on numerous boards, including the National Council of Christians and Jews, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Business Advisory Board and the Warnaco Corporation.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, Ms. Skelly is survived by her husband, Eugene Altman of Scottsdale, and a son, Jonathan Altman of Los Angeles.       
         Belle Zeller, an emeritus professor of political science at Brooklyn College and a scholar of the legislative process who was an indomitable leader of unions representing City University of New York professors for more than 30 years, died on Friday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 95.         Dr. Zeller, who at 83 survived an accident in which she was struck by a bus and critically injured, died in her sleep, said her niece, Laura Glass.         From 1944 until 1972, Dr. Zeller was the chairwoman of the Legislative Conference of the City Colleges, a lobbying group that later became the first union to represent the permanent faculty in the City University system. In 1972, the conference merged with the United Federation of College Teachers, a rival union representing part-time instructors. For the next four years, Dr. Zeller was president of the joint group, the Professional Staff Congress.         As a labor advocate for the professors, Dr. Zeller lobbied for legislation to establish tenure and pensions that today are considered some of the basic rights of public college teachers in New York State. She used her academic expertise in the legislative process to champion the rights of faculty members, becoming a familiar figure at City Hall and the State Capitol.         ''When it came to representing the faculty, she was irrepressible,'' said Irwin H. Polishook, who has been president of Professional Staff Congress since Dr. Zeller retired in 1976. ''She would burst in on legislators who were busy with other business, even if they were behind closed doors, even if they were in conference. Because of who she was, people accepted that. She was able to get people's attention because she was a scholar as well as an activist.''         Belle Zeller was born in New York City on April 8, 1903. She was one of nine children of a couple who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to New York, where her father worked in a shoe factory. Her parents and older siblings often discussed politics around the dinner table and she became fascinated by government at an early age.         She attended Hunter College High School and Hunter College, where she specialized in history and the social sciences, earning a B.A. in 1924 and an M.A. in 1926. She was one of the system's few female professors when she began teaching at Hunter College's Brooklyn campus in 1927. She remained there when it changed its name to Brooklyn College in 1930, becoming one of the institution's founding instructors.         In 1937, she received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University.         Her doctoral dissertation, ''Pressure Politics in New York'' (Prentice Hall, 1937) was one of the first major studies of lobbying in New York State politics and it was reprinted in 1967. She was later recognized nationwide as an authority on lobbying and served as an adviser to Senator John F. Kennedy and other legislators who were revising the Federal Lobbying Registration Act.         Throughout her long career, Dr. Zeller was the recipient of numerous academic awards, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the Graduate School of City University in 1985 and the President's Medal from Brooklyn College on the institution's 50th anniversary in 1980.         Dr. Zeller never married. In addition to Ms. Glass, she is survived by four other nieces and a nephew.       
         Julia Perles, a longtime Manhattan lawyer who played an important part in bringing about a significant change in New York State's divorce legislation, died early Wednesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla. She was 84 and had lived in Sarasota for about four years.         The cause was not immediately clear, but she had had a fall at her home, said Janet Post, a friend.         Ms. Perles is widely considered to have played the leading role in bringing about the passage of what is popularly known as New York State's equitable distribution law, which went into effect in 1980. The law brought about what its admirers have called a revolutionary change in the practice of matrimonial law and in the rights of marital partners.         At her death, Ms. Perles was still affiliated with the law firm of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon, based in Manhattan, where she became a partner in 1970, having been invited by Louis Nizer to head the firm's matrimonial practice.         She went on to become a senior partner until about eight years ago,  and remained head of her department until she moved to Florida. After that, she continued to be affiliated with the firm and its matrimonial department.         While she was practicing matrimonial law, she became chairwoman of a special committee of the New York County Lawyers Association. The panel's members were respected specialists in marital law who favored getting the equitable-distribution change made in the state law. Committee members communicated with the State Legislature in Albany repeatedly, former colleagues of Ms. Perles recalled, and it took much attention and perseverance to persuade the Legislature to make the change.         Under the law as it was passed in 1980, both spouses, in the event of a divorce, are enabled to share equitably in the assets that either or both of them have accumulated during the marriage, even if title to the property -- a house for instance, or a business -- is in the name of only one spouse. Parties to a marriage did not have that legal right in New York State before the law was passed.         The underlying assumption behind the law is that both parties to a marriage contribute to the acquisition, maintenance and growth of the marital assets.         Ms. Perles's clients over the years included Woody Allen; Nancy Allen, the actress-wife of Brian De Palma, the movie director; the former Eve Ella Sherpick Green, the first wife of Harry B. Helmsley, the New York real estate titan; David Merrick, the producer; and Ethel Scull, who once was called the doyenne of the pop art world.         Ms. Perles was a former president of the New York Women's Bar Association, a fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and a member of the Dirty Thirty, an organization of American lawyers prominent in the field of matrimonial law.         She was born and raised in Brooklyn, and she wanted to be a lawyer from the time she was 12 years old. Rona J. Shays, a close friend, recalled that Ms. Perles used to say that her own mother had not wanted her to go to law school and had said to her, ''No one will want to marry you if they think you're smarter than they are.''         Nevertheless, Ms. Perles went on to attend Brooklyn College, and she received her law degree in 1937 from Brooklyn Law School.         She was an associate in the Manhattan law firm of Schwartz & Frohlich from 1942 to 1952 and then a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Greenbaum Wolff & Ernst before going to Phillips, Nizer.         In 1951 she married Howard Singer. He died in 1989.         Her survivors include a brother, David Perles, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Ruth Snedden Shoup, whose many years in New York public affairs and whose tenure on the city's Board of Higher Education bridged the mayoralties of Fiorello H. La Guardia and John V. Lindsay, died on June 25 at Ledges retirement home in Laconia, N.H. A former resident of Riverdale, the Bronx, she was 94.         Mrs. Shoup was a mainstay of the New York League of Women Voters and a staunch La Guardia supporter when she was sworn in by the Mayor in 1936 to the Board of Higher Education. She gained a reputation as one of the board's most active and outspoken members, quite capable of scolding City Hall when it trespassed on the body's mandate to run the municipal colleges.         By the time she retired from the board in 1970, Mrs. Shoup had been a member or chairwoman of many board committees and a perennial board secretary who had used her positions to play a key role in growing and nurturing the colleges.         When she took office, the city's college chain was already the country's largest system of higher education. It included four colleges: Brooklyn, City, Hunter and Queens. By the 1950's, their collective enrollment had passed 100,000 and the board had steered their evolution into today's City University of New York.         In 1957, the city opened the first two-year community college on Staten Island and a short time later those in the Bronx and Queens. In 1965, CUNY awarded its first two doctorates at its Graduate Center.         Throughout, Mrs. Shoup was a stalwart in planning, writing budgets and helping to evaluate academic leaders for college presidencies.         A native of Oakland, Calif., she was a graduate of Stanford University.         She is survived by her husband of 73 years, Carl S. Shoup; their daughter, Dale S. Mayer, of Center Sandwich, N.H.; a son, Paul S., of Charlottesville, Va., eight grandchildren  and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Sister Irene Kraus, a onetime schoolteacher with such a high-spirited talent for leadership and such hard-nosed business ability that she went on to run a series of hospitals and spend six years as the founding chief executive of the $3 billion Daughters of Charity National Health System, died Aug. 20 at a hospital in Baltimore. She was 74 and lived in Emmitsburg, Md., where she was administrator of her order's provincial headquarters.         Friends said the cause was cancer.         While it is tempting to speculate on what direction her life might have taken if she had not joined the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, in an era when women's horizons were bounded largely by home and family, it would be hard to find a secular career path that would have allowed her to become president of the nation's largest nonprofit hospital chain.         But then for Sister Irene, who grew up in Philadelphia, the religious life seems to have been a foregone family conclusion. Like her business acumen and her boundless good humor, her religious commitment seems to have come from her father, Frank, a Pennsylvania Railroad executive with a weakness for practical jokes and such a spiritual bent, his daughter later recalled, that ''he would pray all the way to work, and when I went with him, I would pray, too.''         A standout student at the Daughters of Charity's Elizabeth Seton High School in Baltimore, Sister Irene graduated at 17 in 1941 and immediately joined the religious order.         After a year of novitiate training, she spent seven years teaching elementary and high school students in Richmond. Then her superiors decided it was time for her to get a college education and asked her to switch to a medical career.         After earning a nursing degree at the Catholic University of America in Washington in 1952, she quickly became an operating room supervisor, performing her duties at a series of hospitals with such efficiency and flair that three years later she was made administrator of Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in Binghamton, N.Y., the first of several hospitals nationwide she ran for the order.         When the five autonomous American provinces of the Daughters of Charity decided to consolidate their hospital systems in 1986, Sister Irene was the obvious choice to put the merger into effect and run the operation, which included three dozen hospitals and 19 other operations in 17 states with a combined annual budget of more than $3 billion.         And over the next six years, during a period of mounting fiscal and other pressures, she proved more than equal to the task of meshing often incompatible accounting and other systems into an efficient operation with common purchasing and other functions.         In addition to its embrace of women's potential, the religious order gave Sister Irene other advantages. In a business world where women have had to pick their way through contradictory advice on how to dress for success, Sister Irene never had a wardrobe worry. Whether conducting a board meeting or entertaining at a reception, she wore a version of the same understated habit, a simple blue dress, she had worn as an elementary school teacher.         If the men she encountered were unaccustomed to dealing with a hard-driving business woman in a habit, Sister Irene, a raconteur with an impish sense of humor, knew how to put them at ease and rarely stopped there. At stodgy gatherings, Sister Irene, a tall, imposing woman with a commanding laugh, would sometimes break into an impromptu dance. And when she got up from her seat at a formal dinner to ''work the room,'' Sister Irene would be easy to track: She inevitably left a trail of laughter in her wake.         During a career in which she served on more than 70 national boards and committees, Sister Irene became accustomed to being the only woman in the room. And in 1980, when she became the first woman to serve as chairman of the American Hospital Association, she headed off a move to call her chairwoman or chairperson. She told the board, ''I didn't work this hard to get here and have my title changed.''         For all her accomplishments as president of the national system, Sister Irene, who later ran a hospital in Pensacola, Fla., and was still vice chairman of the merged Baptist St. Vincent's Hospital system in Jacksonville, Fla., at the time of her death, said her proudest achievement was developing a five-point value system for the national chain. The first four, including treating people with respect and serving the impoverished, sounded like familiar religious principles. The fifth, ''Be Creative to Infinity,'' sounded exactly like Sister Irene.         Sister Irene is survived by three sisters, Gertrude Hunter and Maguerite Williams of Bel Air, Md., and Dolores Freeman of Willards, Md.       
         Dorothy Carnegie Rivkin, an author and instructor who developed the Dale Carnegie Training company into a worldwide operation, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 85 and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         Mrs. Carnegie Rivkin, a native of Tulsa, Okla., was chairwoman of Dale Carnegie Training. In the 1940's and 50's she was married to the founder of the company, Dale Carnegie, who wrote the classic American self-help book ''How to Win Friends and Influence People.'' Mrs. Carnegie took control of company operations after Mr. Carnegie's death in 1955 and developed the business into a multinational one with offices in 70 countries, 5 million graduates and $187 million in annual sales.         With her strawberry blond hair, gleaming smile and rich Oklahoma twang -- Mrs. Carnegie was a student of Mr. Carnegie as well as his wife -- she proved as big a success in business as he was in motivational speaking. Though contemporaries in the 1950's wondered whether she had what it took to continue Mr. Carnegie's quintessentially enigmatic enterprise, she scoffed at such skepticism. She told a reporter in 1973 that she immediately took over the operations ''so that I have no time to sit and whittle and spit.''         Even before she met its creator, she had become an early devotee of the Carnegie approach to self-improvement. His book was first published in 1936 and took America by storm with its simple, upbeat message. Even the most retiring people can learn to wow a crowd, he wrote. Look people in the eye, shake hands firmly, flash a winning smile and remember names. Never complain or blame other people.         In the early 1940's, she was Dorothy Price Vanderpool, a divorced mother with a baby daughter to support because of what she called an ''unfortunate teen-aged marriage.'' She took a Carnegie course at a Y.M.C.A. in Tulsa and afterward credited the skills she acquired for the jump she made from stenographer in the Gulf Oil Corporation's accounting department to a senior secretary in the executive suite. She also became president of Tulsa's Young Republicans Club.         Her improvement so impressed Carnegie people that the company offered her a job in New York. She became Mr. Carnegie's secretary in January 1944 and, several months later, his second wife. He later made her his business partner.         Following his style, she collected anecdotes and how-to case histories for a book she wrote, ''How to Help Your Husband Get Ahead in his Social and Business Life,'' published in 1953. Among the homespun advice she offered wives eager to please their husbands were such aphorisms as ''Share his interests and ideals'' and ''Try some intelligent listening. Be a sounding board or a wailing wall.''         But Mrs. Carnegie put business before her personal writing and teaching interests. She once started the Dorothy Carnegie Course, a workshop for women, by women, in contrast to the male-centered Dale Carnegie program. It never took off financially, however, and her business instincts prevailed over her desire to offer a women-only alternative. She did preside over a sharp rise in the number of women taking the regular course.         Her genius was to transform Dale Carnegie Training into a staple of corporate America. She once contended that 400 of the Fortune 500 companies sent employees to study at the company. It became a right of passage for young executives who sought to develop the confidence to present themselves well in public settings. Companies, moreover, paid the enrollment fees, which can now surpass $1,000 for a two-week session.         Graduates were often the best advertisement. The chicken magnate Frank Perdue attended, as did Mary Kay Ash of Mary Kay cosmetics. So did Lee A. Iacocca, the former chief of the Chrysler Corporation.         ''For the first few years of my life I was an introvert, a shrinking violet,'' the sometimes brash auto executive wrote in his autobiography, ''Iacocca.'' ''But that was before I took a course in public speaking at the Dale Carnegie Institute.'' Even the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders spruced up their smiles with the help of Carnegie teachers.         Mrs. Carnegie had a casual working style. She vowed that employees would never find her sitting idly behind a desk. She dictated letters from the porch of her home in Forest Hills Gardens and ran meetings by telephone from her ranch in the Black Hills of Wyoming. She decorated her office with a bronze Philip La Verne conference table, an expensive statement of taste in the late 1960's.         Mrs. Carnegie remarried in 1976, to David Rivkin, also of Tulsa. She retired from active management of the closely held company in 1978 in favor of her son-in-law, J. Oliver Crom, though she remained chairwoman.         She is survived by Mr. Rivkin and her daughter, Donna Dale Carnegie of Lake Oswego, Ore. Another daughter, Rosemary Crom, died earlier. She is also survived by three grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and three stepchildren.       
         Eloise O. Spaeth, an art collector and booster of American art in particular, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 96.         Over many years, Mrs. Spaeth and her husband, Otto L. Spaeth, an industrialist and a vice president of the Whitney Museum of American Art, put together a collection that concentrated on European and American art between the two world wars, including works by Picasso, Matisse, Alexander Calder, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe, Stuart Davis and Charles Sheeler. Mr. Spaeth, who died in 1966, founded the Dayton Tool and Die Company, Metamold Aluminum of Cedurburg, Wis., and several other ventures.         In the mid-1950's, the Spaeth collection was exhibited at several museums, including the Gallery of Fine Arts in Columbus, Ohio. Most of it has since been sold, and a few paintings were given to museums, most notably Hopper's ''Carolina Morning,'' which went to the Whitney.         But it was as a volunteer that Mrs. Spaeth, who was born in Decatur, Ill., made her mark. She was active in the American Federation of Art, where she served as traveling exhibitions chairwoman, started a newsletter and sponsored a book on films about art. In 1952, she was deputy commissioner of the American Pavilion at the Venice Biennale.         In the early 1960's, as a way to raise money for the Archives of American Art Mrs. Spaeth started organizing art junkets to sites around the world, a device since adopted by many museums. She also helped get the archives accepted as a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution, which later rewarded her work for the archives with the Henry Medal, its highest honor. At her death,  she was a board member emeritus of the Archives of American Art and the Guildhall of East Hampton, N.Y.         She is survived by two children, Otto L. Spaeth Jr. of Rye, N.Y., and Mary Louise Koon of St. Louis; 16 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.       
         Jean Andrus Crockett, the first chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and first chairwoman of the finance department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, died on Saturday at her home in Media, Pa. She was 79.         While at Wharton, Ms. Crockett conducted several analyses of the stock market and investors. In 1970, for example, she and two colleagues found that mutual funds did little to improve the market's efficiency. On average, they found, mutual-fund investors would have fared better had they simply bought an equal number of shares of every common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.         From 1977 to 1982, she served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and was appointed chairwoman of the regional bank in 1982. In one of her first statements in that post, she echoed a theme sounded by Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman, who argued that Federal deficits had to be cut to make the Fed's job less painful. ''Interest rates,'' Ms. Crockett said, ''would not have to be this high if fiscal policy were used in addition to monetary policy to fight inflation.''         Ms. Crockett was born April 20, 1919, in Tucson, Ariz. Before joining the Wharton faculty in 1954, she was a mathematics instructor at the University of Arizona, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois, a staff researcher for the Cowles Commission at the University of Chicago and an economist with the Commerce Department.         She was promoted to full professor at Wharton in 1966 and named chairwoman of the finance department in 1977. In 1989, she received the university's Distinguished Faculty Award for ''pioneering all-University leadership and for dedication to furthering the careers of junior colleagues and graduate students.''         Ms. Crockett is survived by her husband, Robert O. Crockett Jr.; three children, Jennifer, Elizabeth and Robert, and three grandchildren.       
         Anita Kurman Gulkin, president and chief executive of Greenwich House Inc., a social-service and cultural community organization based in Greenwich Village, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 59, lived in Springfield, N.J., and also had an apartment in Chelsea in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack during hip surgery last Friday, and she also had cancer, said Paul Racioppi, Greenwich House's chief development officer. She went to work as usual the day before the surgery.         Ms. Gulkin, a former specialist in programs for drug abusers, became Greenwich House's executive director in 1976. Her title was changed to president and chief executive in 1991.         The multifaceted organization has its headquarters at 27 Barrow Street, employs 250 people and also carries on its programs at seven other sites in and near Greenwich Village. In her 22 years as its senior salaried executive, its annual operating budget grew to $13.5 million from $1 million or less, Mr. Racioppi said.         In the years since 1986, Ms. Gulkin set into motion new Greenwich House programs for recovering alcoholics, other substance abusers and people with H.I.V. or AIDS, as well as for providing music and fine-arts classes in public elementary schools, for treating abused children and preventing child abuse and for serving hot meals for elderly Greenwich Villagers to eat together.         She joined Greenwich House's staff as a supervisor of its programs for drug abusers in 1968 and was made director of its substance abuse clinics in 1972.         Over the years, she was also active in other Manhattan social-service organizations. At her death, she was chairwoman of Caring Community, which administers programs for the elderly, mainly in Greenwich Village, and the West Side Association of Community Centers. She was also a co-founder and a former member of the board of what is now called Urban Pathways.         She was inducted into Greenwich Village's Hall of Fame and received the United Way's Big Apple Award.         A native of Newark, she received a bachelor's degree from Pennsylvania State University and later studied social work at Columbia.         She is survived by her husband, Sam Gulkin; a brother, Dr. Martin Kurman of Manhattan, and a sister, Bernice Winarsky of Springfield.
