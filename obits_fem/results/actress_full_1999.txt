         Susan Strasberg, who at 17 electrified Broadway with her luminous portrayal of the title role of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' and -- with highs and lows professional and private -- went on to a career onstage and in movies, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 and also had a home in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her stepmother, Anna Strasberg.         As the daughter of Lee Strasberg, the director of the Actors Studio, and the acting coach Paula Miller, Ms. Strasberg spent her childhood surrounded by celebrated figures of the American theater, people who were, she said, ''supremely talented, alive, sensitive, eccentric, and some were neurotic and miserable.''         When she made her Broadway debut as Anne Frank in 1955, she was unknown, except for her last name. She had appeared in an Off Broadway play and had acted in two films, ''The Cobweb'' and ''Picnic,'' that had not been released. And she had never studied acting with her father.         With a naturalness and an authority that belied her limited theatrical experience, she was an astonishing success in her first major role. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson characterized her as ''a slender, enchanting young lady with a heart-shaped face, a pair of burning eyes and the soul of an actress.''         Ms. Strasberg's father was among those surprised by her performance. He and his wife had tried to talk to her about the interpretation of the role, but then left her to work on her own and with her director, Garson Kanin. ''When we saw Susie in action  we were all amazed at her great sensitivity,'' Mr. Strasberg said at the time. ''I just don't know how she picked it all up. She's never had any formal training.''         Ms. Strasberg was born in Manhattan, and her birth announcement heralded her as ''a four-star hit.'' After working briefly as a model, she made her theatrical debut Off Broadway in ''Maya,'' and followed that with several roles on television, including ''Romeo and Juliet,'' live on the Kraft Television Theater.         She auditioned for the role of Anne Frank, but the producer Kermit Bloomgarden made no decision about casting and the show was postponed. When the play was rescheduled in 1955, Ms. Strasberg was in Hollywood acting in the film of William Inge's ''Picnic.'' Mr. Bloomgarden and Albert and Frances Hackett, the authors of the play ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' asked her to read for the role again.         ''Susan was so terrified at the thought of being rejected that she declined to read at all,'' Mr. Bloomgarden had said in an interview. ''Finally, with tears in her eyes, Susan did read the last, touching scene from play. Within 10 minutes, she knew the part was hers.''         The play was an enormous hit, running for two years and winning the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the New York Drama Critics award and Tony Award for best play. Within the year, she was a certified Broadway star, with her name above the title on the Cort Theater marquee.         In 1957 she starred with Richard Burton and Helen Hayes in Jean Anouilh's ''Time Remembered.'' The next year she was in the Actors Studio revival of Sean O'Casey's ''Shadow of a Gunman'' and then she toured with Franchot Tone in ''Caesar and Cleopatra.'' In 1963 she returned to Broadway in the title role of Franco Zeffirelli's production of ''The Lady of the Camellias.'' When her first two films were released, she was on her way to movie stardom, and was soon playing opposite Henry Fonda in ''Stage Struck.''         Within several years, her career had crested and her private life was in turmoil. In the early 1960's she  was using a wide variety of drugs. When she wrote her autobiography in 1980, it was titled ''Bittersweet,'' a word that seemed to sum up her life. Her marriage to the actor Christopher Jones had ended. Her daughter, Jennifer, was born with a congenital birth defect: Ms. Strasberg blamed herself even though there was no medical evidence linking the drugs and the daughter's disabilities.         A reason she wrote her book, she  said, was that her career was stalled: ''It become totally untenable to me that after acting for 25 years -- I've played Juliet, Cleopatra and Anne Frank -- there I was, sitting in Hollywood, just waiting for somebody to want me.'' Her films include ''Kapo,'' ''The Trip,'' ''Manitou,'' ''Delta Force'' and ''Prime Suspect.'' In the book, she criticized her father for being preoccupied with his acting classes and she criticized her mother for being overly supervisory about her daughter's work.         She was also close to some of her father's students, especially Marilyn Monroe, whom she wrote about in ''Bittersweet'' and in her 1992 book, ''Marilyn and Me, Sisters, Rivals and Friends.''         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms. Strasberg is survived by her brother, John, who lives in Paris and New York, and by two half-brothers.         Even as Ms. Strasberg's life spiraled, those who saw her in her Broadway debut remembered her as the image of Anne Frank. After that opening night performance, she entered Sardi's with her parents, followed by Ms. Monroe. Before the reviews were read, Mr. Tone offered a toast: ''Little Susan, you have been launched on a long and glittering career.''       
         Betty Bryant, who had such a satisfying childhood career in the backwaters of show business that she never bothered to try to top herself in the Broadway mainstream, died on Jan. 15 at her home in Park Ridge, Ill.         She was 76 and was recalled as the third generation of a family of showboat performers who brought corn  pone and culture to riverside mid-America.         If her life wasn't actually written by Edna Ferber or set to music by Jerome Kern, it was surely because Miss Bryant was only 4 when Ferber's novel ''Show Boat'' came out in 1926, two years before Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d translated it to the Broadway stage.         By then Miss Bryant was an experienced on-board performer, one who had made her acting debut at the age of 6 weeks, stoically (she didn't cry) portraying the slave girl Eliza's baby in the dash across the ice in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.''         If ever an actress was at home in the theater it was she.         The family showboat was both her home and her stage, and for 20 years, until World War II helped bring the showboat era to an end, she spent her springs, summers and falls going from town to town along the Ohio River and its tributaries, sometimes stopping for several weeks in bigger river cities like Pittsburgh or Cincinnati.         During the off-season, with the boat tied up in West Virginia, the family would visit New York or Chicago, sometimes staging variety acts, sometimes just taking in the theatrical sights.         With her mother as her tutor, Miss Bryant managed to get her high school diploma from a cooperating school that monitored her progress.         Based on Miss Bryant's 1994 book ''Here Comes the Showboat'' (University Press of Kentucky), hers was an idyllic life and one she was certainly born to.         To say that show business was in her blood would be something of an understatement. Her grandfather, Sam Bryant, a onetime gardener at Buckingham Palace, had no known theatrical inclinations until he fell in love with a young Gilbert and Sullivan actress named Violet Chapman, who had inclinations enough for both of them.         After the couple married and came to the United States in 1884, it didn't take many years of nagging before Lady Violet, as she preferred to be known, had persuaded her husband to seek thespian adventure, initially, as it turned out, in a horse-drawn traveling medicine show in which Dr. Sam, as he was known, would hawk a cure-all mixture of gasoline and red pepper on the first night in a town, then stage a tent show on the second.         The couple's children, Billy and Florence, were part of the dodge from the beginning and by the time the family graduated to vaudeville a few years later, they had become the Four Bryants.         A chance summer booking on a turn-of-the-century Mississippi River showboat gave them the river bug. Within a few years, Dr. Sam and Captain Billy, as his son was soon known, had acquired first the Princess and then, in 1918, Bryant's New Showboat.         By then, Captain Billy had married the floating troupe's piano and calliope player, Josephine Costello, who gave birth to Betty four years later.         From her start in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' Miss Bryant swiftly advanced to other roles and vaudeville turns, including impressions of George M. Cohan and Eddie Cantor.         As the only member of her generation among the now six Bryants (although Aunt Florence was increasingly an absentee actress), she played boys as often as girls, but regardless of the sex, she soon learned, her forlorn character was sure to die before the final curtain.         That's because the Bryant plays tended to be heavy, heart-rending  melodramas, which never failed to delight their small-town audiences.         Captain Billy did stage an abridged version of ''Hamlet'' once,  but after he got a look at the dazed audience on its way out, he quickly reverted to more familiar fare, replacing it with ''Ten Nights in a Barroom,'' a sure audience pleaser, partly, no doubt, because Miss Bryant died so convincingly.         By the time she graduated to grown-up roles, Miss Bryant had mastered the psychological subtleties of the showboat method of melodrama.         As she wrote in her book, ''A dependable leading lady must be able to run, duck, fall, get up, fall again, crawl over a bed and under a dresser, scream, swing by a rope, deliver an uppercut, struggle and kick and still have enough breath left to say, 'If this is aristocracy, thank God I'm a country girl.' ''         At 20 she married a fellow showboat actor, Jat Herod, a jazz violinist who joined the Army and was soon entertaining troops, as he and his wife continued to do after the war.         She is survived by two daughters, JoAleene Miranda of Des Plaines, Ill., and Mary Perry of Park Ridge, and three grandchildren.         After their divorce in 1962, Miss Bryant, who never tried to win acting jobs in New York or Hollywood, settled in Park Ridge, where she directed amateur theatrical productions and frequently gave lectures on what it was like to grow up on a showboat.       
         Virginia Verrill, the on-screen singing voice of some of Hollywood's most famous leading ladies and later a popular radio star, died on Jan. 18 at the Mayview Nursing Home in Raleigh, N.C. She was 82 and lived in Raleigh.         Ms. Verrill, born in Santa Monica, Calif., was a child of Hollywood, where her parents were musicians. At the age of 5 months she appeared in her mother's vaudeville act, and at 3 she made her first public singing appearance when Paul Whiteman, in whose band her father used to play, stood her on a piano while she sang ''I Never Knew I Could Love Anybody'' at the Palais Royale in Times Square. ''And from that minute, I guess,'' she later said, ''singing was what I wanted to do more than anything else.''         At 15, already a veteran of a West Coast band led by Orville Knapp, she was heard performing in a school play and asked to audition for an off-screen role singing ''Ten Cents a Dance'' in Barbara Stanwyck's film of the same name. She beat out more than 300 competitors.         She soon landed work as a professional dubber. Traveling from John Marshall High School in Los Angeles to Hollywood studios almost every day after school, she would sing for leading ladies whose voices were not considered quite up to par.         Disillusioned, Ms. Verrill left Hollywood in 1935 for the ''Socony Sketchbook'' on CBS radio and recorded with the Isham Jones Orchestra.         The tables seemed to turn in 1937, when she was seen on screen in ''Walter Wanger's Vogues of 1938,'' starring Warner Baxter and Joan Bennett. Ms. Verrill sang ''That Old Feeling,'' which became a hit.         The same year she was cast as the female lead in ''The Goldwyn Follies'' and taken under the wing of Samuel Goldwyn.         With newly dyed and styled hair, high heels and lifts in her shoes, Ms. Verrill was presented as ''the second Myrna Loy,'' and stardom seemed almost a certainty.         But the Goldwyn Company decided that the similarities between the two actresses were too strong. Ms. Verrill, who had already recorded the film's soundtrack, suddenly found herself ousted by the actress of the moment, Andrea Leeds, who had become an overnight success that year in ''Stage Door.''         Ms. Verrill abandoned Hollywood in the spring of 1938 for a career in radio and retired in 1942.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Louis Duddleston, and a son, James Breyley Jr., both of Raleigh; a daughter, Diana Caldwell of Anchorage, and seven grandchildren.       
         Shirley Stoler, an actress best known for her role as the Nazi commandant in Lina Wertmuller's 1976 film ''Seven Beauties,'' died on Feb. 17 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure after a long illness, said her brother Ira.         Ms. Stoler, a native of Brooklyn whose acting career spanned four decades, considered herself the first significantly fat actress to do dramatic roles rather than comedy. Her weight, which hovered around 250 pounds in her early years, limited her choices, she said in a 1976 interview with The New York Times. ''Weight shouldn't be a hindrance, but casting people are afraid of it,'' she said. ''I could play 'Medea,' but they wouldn't cast me for it.''         Her imposing figure frequently landed Ms. Stoler the part of the villain or shrew, most notably in ''Seven Beauties,'' in which she played the sadistic commandant of a Nazi concentration camp to critical acclaim. Six years earlier, in Leonard Kastle's ''Honeymoon Killers,''  she played a predatory nurse executed for murder. Her film credits  also include ''The Deer Hunter'' and ''Klute.''         Ms. Stoler appeared on Broadway as Lolita's mother in Edward Albee's 1981 stage adaptation of the Nabokov novel. She played villainous roles on many television series.         In addition to her brother Ira, of Fairfield, Conn., she is survived by another brother, David, of Wanaque, N.J., and a sister, Miriam, of Delray Beach, Fla.       
         Bidu Sayao, a Brazilian soprano whose gossamer voice and vivacious personality made her one of the most popular stars of the Metropolitan Opera from the late 1930's through the 40's, died yesterday at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport, Me. She was 94 and lived in Lincolnville, Me.         The diminutive Miss Sayao, restricted by her small voice to the lyric and coloratura repertory, often expressed regret that she could not sing such heavier roles as Tosca and Butterfly. But her interpretations of Manon, Violetta in ''La Traviata,'' Mimi in ''La Boheme'' and Susanna in ''Le Nozze di Figaro,'' among other roles, received consistent praise, with critics stressing her expressiveness, sensibility, girlishness and excellence of phrasing.         Balduina de Oliveira Sayao was born on May 11, 1902, into a wealthy family in Rio de Janeiro. Although her childhood dramatizations in front of a mirror convinced her that she had a future as an actress, the family conviction that it was a metier for loose women dashed that hope. Piano lessons, too, were a decided failure, but when she was 13 a music-loving uncle helped arrange lessons with a celebrated former soprano, Elena Theodorini.         After several years of study and  appearances at the court of Romania, her teacher's native country, Miss Sayao studied recital repertory in France with the tenor Jean de Reszke. An eventual audition in Rome led to an engagement as Rosina in ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia,'' and by her late 20's she had sung at many opera houses in Europe and South America.         In a review of her first performance in the United States, a Town Hall recital on Dec. 30, 1935, Noel Strauss of The New York Times wrote that Miss Sayao's voice ''if light, was one of pronounced sweetness; silky and caressing when used at its best.''         Soon afterward, Arturo Toscanini, who was preparing an all-Debussy program for the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra -- precursor of the New York Philharmonic -- engaged the young soprano whose years in France had perfected her pronunciation, and gave her one week to learn ''La Demoiselle Elue.'' A short time later the Metropolitan Opera, which had recently lost Lucrezia Bori, a stalwart of French repertory, to retirement, invited Miss Sayao to sing the title role in ''Manon'' in February 1937.         In The Times, Olin Downes wrote of the debut, ''Miss Sayao triumphed as a Manon should, by manners, youth and charm, and secondly by the way in which the voice became the vehicle of dramatic expression.'' The singer never again left the Western Hemisphere. The Met was her base, the San Francisco Opera her alternate headquarters and South America the only foreign territory to hear her in live performance.         A month after her first Met ''Manon,'' Miss Sayao sang the lead role in ''La Traviata.'' Two weeks later she sang her first ''Boheme'' in the house, and Howard Taubman wrote in The Times that she sang with ''freshness and simplicity.''         In all, the soprano sang more than 200 performances of 12 different roles at the Metropolitan. She made several opera and song recordings and gave many recitals. In December 1943 she and the baritone Lawrence Tibbett were soloists with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Artur Rodzinski for the inaugural concert at the City Center of Music and Drama. The United States Government decorated her for her many performances in Army camps and hospitals during World War II.         Miss Sayao resigned from the Metropolitan Opera in April 1952, a month before her 50th birthday. ''I am proud, and I did not want to wait until I was asked to leave,'' she said in an interview in 1987. And in 1957 after a performance of ''La Demoiselle Elue,'' which seemed to bring her career full circle, she abruptly retired, canceling many engagements for subsequent seasons. She told an interviewer years later that it was hard to stop but that being able to smoke again was a pleasure.         The soprano's first marriage, to the Italian impresario Walter Mocchi, who headed the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires for a time, ended in divorce. She and the baritone Giuseppe Danise were married in 1947, and he gave up his career to manage hers.         After her husband's death in 1963, she divided her time between the Salisbury Hotel in Manhattan and her home in Lincolnville. She was  often seen at vocal events in New York City, a tiny woman in high heels, her reddish hair pulled back in the chignon familiar to several decades of opera fans.         On a Metropolitan Opera broadcast in December 1989, the soprano plaintively gave a personal summation of her career: ''I had something appealing, I don't know what. The sincerity of my singing. I give my heart. I give my soul. I give myself.''         Correction:  March 16, 1999, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary of the Brazilian soprano Bidu Sayao on Saturday misstated her age. She was 96, not 94. The obituary also omitted Ms. Sayao's most celebrated recording. The piece, ''Bachiana Brasileira No. 5,'' is a vocalise -- an aria without words -- transcribed for her by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos.       
         Ann Corio, the auburn-haired, green-eyed queen of burlesque whose long-running show, ''This Was Burlesque,'' kept alive the art of strippers and the comedy of baggy-pants clowns in the age of the X-rated film, died on March 1 at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. Ms. Corio, a resident of Cliffside Park, N.J., kept her age a closely guarded secret, but was believed to be in her 80's.         A survivor of a shapely sisterhood that included Gypsy Rose Lee, Maggie Hart and Georgia Sothern, Ms. Corio lasted long enough to reach the iconic status that enabled her to present the striptease as a put-on.         ''We emphasize comedy,'' she said one day in 1976 as she discussed her show, which began Off Broadway in 1962 and continued for at least two decades in various productions, tours and revivals with Ms. Corio as author, director, star and interlocutor. ''There is no total nudity. The girls are lovely and artistic, and they're terribly, terribly pretty.         ''What is called burlesque today isn't that at all. Those girls aren't artists. They just take clothes off, and they don't even do that very well. Burlesque is exactly what it says it is. It's from the Italian word burlare, to satirize, to laugh. That's what we do, and we are not offensive.''         Those old enough to remember when strippers in burlesque houses were regarded as hot stuff could recall Ms. Corio as a reigning beauty of the East Coast wheel of burlesque houses that extended from Boston to Washington, with many a whistle-stop in between.         Her fame won her roles in jungle films like ''Swamp Woman'' (1941) and touring stage productions like ''White Cargo,'' in which she sashayed onstage one night in Boston, playing a native girl under a light layer of brown powder and not much more. When she declaimed, ''I am Tondelayo,'' a Harvard undergraduate leaped from his seat and shouted, ''What an actress!''         Legend had it that it was said in Boston, ''You can't graduate from Harvard until you've seen Ann Corio.''         The play had the honor of being banned in Boston, Chicago and Hoboken, N.J.         Of her movies, Ms. Corio said, ''Those pictures always made money, and I made a lot of money. I asked for $10,000 a week and a percentage and got it, but I didn't know they were going to shoot the movie in six days. They didn't want the movie good. They wanted it Tuesday. I was the Queen of the Quickies. Those pictures weren't released, they escaped.''         As burlesque faded away, Ms. Corio toured in shows like ''Rain,'' ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' and ''Once More With Feeling'' until she conceived the idea of ''This Was Burlesque.''         ''We're naughty and bawdy, but never vulgar,'' she said. ''More than half our audience are women. They love it. Even the kids respond to it. To go to a movie these days, you need a computer to figure out the ratings. The whole family can see my show.''         ''Nudity,'' she added, ''is an invasion of privacy on both sides of the footlights.''         Ms. Corio was one of 12 children of Italian immigrants from Naples who settled in Hartford, where, she said, she was once a Sunday school teacher. Her father died when she was  young, and at 16, after working as a dancer, she discovered she could earn more on the burlesque circuit.         In addition to her husband, Michael P. Iannucci, she is survived by two sisters, Helen LaRue of West Hartford, Conn., and Lillian Denote of Bristol, Conn.         ''This Was Burlesque,'' billed as a musical satire based on Ms. Corio's recollections, opened at the Casino East Theater on Second Avenue and 12th Street in Manhattan and ran for 1,509 performances before it moved to the Hudson Theater on Broadway and ran for 124 more. Over the ensuing years, numerous productions played across the country from Miami to Las Vegas to San Juan. The last performance was in St. Petersburg, Fla., in 1991.         In a 1981 review of a revival at the Princess Theater on West 48th Street, Richard F. Shepard of The New York Times wrote: ''Miss Corio, who looks radiant, does it all by the book and, whether you like the book or not, it is to her credit that she catches the flavor of the old burlesque with little attempt to ennoble or elevate it. This is close to the real thing.''         Ms. Corio and her third husband, Mr. Iannucci, a former linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers, made millions from the show. Eventually, they leased the Playhouse on the Mall in Paramus, N.J., where, for many years, they presented legitimate productions and where ''This Was Burlesque'' was eventually filmed as an HBO cable attraction.         Ms. Corio, who retired about eight years ago, recalled that shortly after the show first opened on Second Avenue, the police showed up. ''One night we thought we were being raided, but it was only the cops arriving to escort Mike to the bank. We never had trouble with the police. And I was invited to Gracie Mansion. Mayor Wagner insisted I sit next to him for the photographers.''         As a result of charges that burlesque had become lewd and unsavory, it was banned in New York in 1937. Five years later, it was permitted to return, but without the use of the label and in a restricted format. A court finally lifted the ban in 1955.         Nevertheless, Ms. Corio's efforts to present her show at the 1964-65 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens, were rebuffed by Robert Moses, the pillar of municipal rectitude who presided over the corporation that ran the event.         ''You know, we're really quite mild compared to what children are exposed to on television -- topless bathing suits and all,'' Ms. Corio said.         But the show did not go on.         ''There's nothing really new,'' she said. ''It's comedy, pretty girls, bubble gum, stepping on toes, the kind of stuff you can leave your brains home for. It's burlesque.''         As she once put it, ''We do nothing you wouldn't write home about to your aunt in East Cupcake, Ohio.''         Correction:  March 10, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary of the burlesque performer Ann Corio yesterday misstated the given name of another prominent performer in her field. She was Margie Hart, not Maggie.       
         Peggy Cass, a brassy-voiced comedian best known for her portrayal of the pregnant, unwed secretary in ''Auntie Mame,'' died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 and had homes in Manhattan and Westhampton, N.Y.         The cause was heart failure, Eugene Feeney, her husband and only survivor, said.         Born in Boston, Mary Margaret  Cass succumbed to the lure of Broadway and moved to New York at 19 after spending three years in the Cambridge Latin School drama club without winning a single speaking role.         After turns as a stenographer, telephone operator, advertising solicitor and model, she finally convinced a producer that she was an actress. She was cast in a U.S.O. tour of ''The Doughgirls'' and spent seven months in Australia without stepping into costume because the United States Army had by then moved to the Philippines.         Her break came when, as an understudy, she took over for Jan Sterling in Chicago in the national tour of ''Born Yesterday.'' Soon after, the producer George Abbott hired her for the 1949 Broadway musical ''Touch and Go.''         But it was the role of the dimwitted secretary, Agnes Gooch, in the 1956 Broadway show ''Auntie Mame'' with which Ms. Cass was most associated. Her performance earned her a Tony Award for best supporting actress. She was nominated for an Academy Award for her work in the  1958 film version.         By the late 1950's, Ms. Cass's facility for brash repartee landed her regular appearances on the television quiz show ''Keep Talking.'' She also appeared often on ''The Jack Paar Show'' in the late 50's and early 60's.         The possessor of an encyclopedic mind, she could be seen during the 60's as often as seven times a week on the quiz shows ''Match Game,'' ''Password'' and ''To Tell the Truth.''       
         Lucille Lortel, whose pioneering efforts to bring innovative theater and adventurous new playwrights and actors to the American stage earned her the title Queen of Off Broadway, died on Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 and had homes in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         Among the legacies of Miss Lortel's cutting-edge career, which spanned more than 70 years, is the theater that bears her name in Greenwich Village; the still thriving White Barn Theater that she started in Westport in 1947; the Lucille Lortel Room at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, and the funds and fellowships she established to aid the arts. She also leaves a veritable Who's Who of people in international theater -- playwrights, actors, directors, composers and designers -- whose careers were advanced by her daring and her confidence in young talent.         ''If you love the theater you must be innovative,'' she once said. ''You must try new ideas and new faces. That's the only way theater can develop. You can't do it on Broadway because it costs too much. The costs are lower Off Broadway, so you can afford to take a chance, and you must take a chance.''         Forsaking the Footlights For a Backstage Role         Miss Lortel gave up a career as an actress in 1939 in deference to her wealthy husband's wishes and in 1947 began an experimental summer theater for American and foreign plays and playwrights in the barn of the couple's summer estate in Westport. From the start she wanted White Barn, as she called it, to be a sanctuary from commercial pressures, a place where writers could take a chance with their plays and where actors could stretch their talents. It was there that Miss Lortel staged readings, mothered performers like Eva Marie Saint, Geoffrey Holder and Zero Mostel and presented plays by Samuel Beckett, Edward Albee, Eugene Ionesco and Sean O'Casey.         In 1955 her husband, Louis Schweitzer, gave her a Manhattan theater, now known as the Lucille Lortel Theater, as a 24th wedding anniversary gift. The first production in the house, at 121 Christopher Street, then called the Theater de Lys, was Marc Blitzstein's adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ''Threepenny Opera. '' It caused such a sensation that the production ran for seven years and put Off Broadway on the map.         As Stuart W. Little observed in his 1972 book ''Off Broadway: The Prophetic Theater'': ''For thousands of theatergoers, a visit to the de Lys was the authentic Off Broadway experience. Off Broadway meant the discovery of new talent and fresh theatrical experiences in unfamiliar parts of the city. . . .The de Lys at the far end of Christopher Street, near the Hudson River docks, was situated in a borderline neighborhood between the known residential part of the city and the open seaport. The unknown world beyond, in imagination, merged with the pulsing underworld life of 'The Threepenny Opera' and became sinister, exotic, menacing.''         Miss Lortel was frustrated by the success of ''Threepenny Opera'' because she wanted to bring more plays into her theater, so she  persuaded the American National Theater and Academy to support a matinee series as a ''laboratory for innovation.'' The series ran for 20 years and became a legend. A verse adaptation of Alan Paton's novel ''Cry the Beloved Country'' became the first venture of the series in 1956, followed that  season by such groundbreaking productions as Anna Sokolow's Kafkaesque dance-drama ''Metamorphosis'' and May O'Donnell's modern-dance interpretation of Maeterlinck's play ''Pelleas and Melisandre.''         Over the years the series offered ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' a dramatization of Langston Hughes poems with Godfrey Cambridge; adaptations of poetic works by Robert Frost, Archibald MacLeish, W. H. Auden and Conrad Aiken; performances of rarely seen plays by O'Casey, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Albee and William Inge, and presented actors like Richard Burton in ''An Afternoon of Poetry,'' Siobhan McKenna as Hamlet, Helen Hayes in an anthology of Shakespeare and Dame Sybil Thorndike and Sir Lewis Casson in a joint dramatic reading. Terrence McNally and Adrienne Kennedy were among the new writers whose works were presented.         She brought Jean Genet to the attention of American audiences with a production of ''The Balcony,'' which she co-produced at Circle in the Square in 1960. She also oversaw the first American production of a play by Athol Fugard, the South African playwright; it was ''Blood Knot,'' starring James Earl Jones and J. D. Cannon, and it ignited audiences at the Cricket Theater on Second Avenue in 1964. She introduced many plays by Beckett, including ''Rockaby,'' on Theater Row on West 42d Street.         Creating a Setting For Cutting-Edge Work         At the Theater de Lys, she provided a home for such plays as David Mamet's ''A Life in the Theater,'' Sam Shepard's ''Buried Child'' and ''Getting Out,'' early work by Marsha Norman, Caryl Churchill's ''Cloud Nine'' and Wendy Wasserstein's ''Isn't It Romantic.'' The house was renamed the Lucille Lortel Theater in 1981, and has been the setting for Larry Kramer's ''The Destiny of Me,'' for ''Groucho'' and for ''Gertrude Stein and a Companion,'' the recipient of the National Education Film and Video Award for historical biographies.         The 38th volume of John Willis's ''Theater World'' (1981-82) is dedicated ''To Lucille Lortel, whose vibrant spirit and untiring efforts have made immeasurable contributions to all components of the theater by discovering and encouraging new talent, and whose devotion to Off Broadway provided the impetus for its proliferation.''         In 1960 Miss Lortel began sponsoring dramatic productions and seminars at the Library of Congress. The presentations included O'Casey's ''Time to Go,'' Mark Van Doren's ''Last Days of Lincoln'' and Albee's ''Fam and Yam.''         Miss Lortel produced or co-produced some 500 plays, 5 of which were nominated for Tony Awards -- ''As Is'' by William M. Hoffman, ''Angels Fall'' by Lanford Wilson, ''Blood Knot'' by Mr. Fugard, ''Sarafina!,'' an import from South Africa, and ''A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing. Several were produced in Broadway theaters and the others moved to Broadway.         The theater on Christopher Street was only one of many unusual gifts that Mr. Schweitzer lavished on Miss Lortel before his death in 1971. A chemical engineer who made his fortune manufacturing cigarette papers, he also owned the FM radio station WBAI.         In 1957, when his wife told him it was sometimes difficult to find a cab after the theater, he bought a gray Mercedes-Benz. He had been told there was a cab driver named Louis Schweitzer in town and he arranged to get a taxi medallion for the car and for his namesake to act as its part-time driver. When the driver wasn't transporting  Miss Lortel, he was free to use the car as a taxi and split the earnings with the boss.         In 1956, Mr. Schweitzer was the first foreigner in more than 400 years allowed to buy a gondola in Venice. Although traditionally gondolas were identified only by numbers, he was given permission to name his purchase ''Lucille.'' The gondola continued to carry passengers and the gondolier was told that if American visitors used Mr. Schweitzer's name to book a ride, they were to be charged double. ''My friends can afford it,'' he explained.         For some years, the Schweitzers spent part of each winter on a houseboat in Florida. The two-story villa on a raft, anchored off Miami Beach, had two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, servants' quarters and a bar sheltered by a thatched roof.         Lucille Lortel was born in Manhattan on Dec. 16, 1900, the daughter of Harry and Anna Wadler. Lucille was her given name, Lortel an alliterative concoction for the stage. Her father was a manufacturer of women's clothes and frequently traveled to Europe to buy designs that he would copy. For some years, Miss Lortel was tutored at home and although she said, ''I think I went to public school after that,'' she did remember that she never graduated. She attended Adelphi College briefly and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. A 1921 review in ''The Musical Leader'' of her  graduating class's production of D'Annunzio's ''Honeysuckle'' described her as ''an exquisite little creature who seemed to be inspired.'' Later, she studied briefly with Max Reinhardt in Berlin.         Miss Lortel made her Broadway debut in 1925 in the Theater Guild production of George Bernard Shaw's ''Caesar and Cleopatra'' with Helen Hayes as Cleopatra and Lionel Atwill as Caesar. She had a small role, which she said had been added by the director, playing what she described as a whore. She never forgot her unwhorelike lines: ''No no, no, I'll have nothing to do with you,'' addressed to the line of men following her.         She met Mr. Schweitzer in 1930. ''I wasn't interested in getting married,'' she recalled. ''I was involved in the theater.'' Mr. Schweitzer pursued her. During a business trip to France he telephoned and told her he was sending a ticket and that they would get married in Paris. Friends persuaded her to accept -- ''You can always get a divorce,'' they said.         When she arrived in March 1931, the couple discovered that official proclamations of their intended marriage had to be posted for several weeks before the marriage could take place. They sailed back to the United States on the Leviathan and were married by the captain. ''I wouldn't have anything to do with my husband until we came back to New York,'' she said, and even then she waited for two more ceremonies,  one at City Hall and a religious service in Manhattan performed by the Jewish chaplain at West Point.         The year after her marriage, Miss Lortel appeared on stage with Jean Arthur and Claude Rains in ''The Man Who Reclaimed His Head,'' but her husband objected to her absence in the evenings. His unhappiness led to a new activity that continued until 1939 -- acting in movie shorts filmed in Brooklyn in the afternoons. This was followed by a temporary retirement.         ''My husband's mother disapproved of acting, and he was very possessive,'' Miss Lortel said in a 1996 interview. ''After a while, I was getting bored. I thought I'd go nuts so I started readings at Westport, moving the tractors and Ping-Pong table from the barn.''         From a White Barn To Off Broadway         In 1947 Miss Lortel was approached by the actor Canada Lee and Philip Huston, a playwright, who needed a place and a distinguished audience for a staged reading of a new play called ''The Painted Wagon.'' Miss Lortel provided both. This was followed by a request from the agent Audrey Wood, who wanted a showcase for a musical, ''No Casting Today.'' Thus the White Barn was opened with Miss Lortel as its sole backer and hostess, providing room and board for the actors.         She had a permanent stage built, brought in new and innovative troupes like the Dublin Players Company, the Oxford University Players and Mr. Holder and his Trinidad Dance Troupe, established an apprentice school, introduced seminars in Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov, and offered playwrights, actors, designers, composers and directors a chance to spread their wings.         ''When the White Barn began, it was to summer theater what Off Broadway is to the commercial theater,'' the actress and producer Eva Le Gallienneonce said. ''An avowed pioneer, it proved that summer productions could be stimulating, avant-garde and enthusiastically received.''         Nurturing Newcomers And Seasoned Actors         Among the newcomers who got a chance at the White Barn were Peter Falk, Vincent Gardenia, Sada Thompson, George Peppard and Sidney Lumet. Working with them were more established actors seeking challenges  -- Mildred Dunnock, Mr. Mostel, Kim Hunter, James Coco and Peggy Wood.         Mr. Schweitzer initially enjoyed his wife's new enthusiasm and the idea of having actors around the estate in the summer. Later, his enthusiasm waned and although he continued to support her endeavors, it wasn't until his later years that his interest revived.         Miss Lortel was showered with virtually every theatrical award and honor except a Tony, which is given for achievement on Broadway. She received the first Margo Jones Award (1962) and the Lee Strasberg Lifetime Achievement Award (1985), as well as induction into the Theater Hall of Fame (1990) and recognition from the School of the Arts at Columbia University (1996). The first theater chair to be named for a woman bears her name, the Lucille Lortel Distinguished Professorial Chair in Theater at the City University of New York. A permanent tribute to her career is on display at the archives of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The Lucille Lortel Theater Collection, an archive of theatrical history and memorabilia, is on permanent exhibition at the Westport Public Library.         In 1986, the Lucille Lortel Awards were established by the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers to honor outstanding achievements in the Off Broadway theater. Recipients have included the playwright A. R. Gurney, for ''The Cocktail Hour''; John Tillinger, the director; Playwrights Horizons, and Lincoln Center Theater for ''Woza Afrika!''         Miss Lortel, who leaves no immediate survivors, was a generous donor in other theatrical areas. She established the Lucille Lortel Fund for New Drama at Yale University to support the production of new plays at the Yale Repertory Theater (the fund's premiere production was August Wilson's ''Fences''). The Lucille Lortel Fellowship in Playwriting was started at Brown University in Providence, R.I., in 1996. She also donated money for the annual Drama Circle awards and made sizable financial contributions to dance and music groups.         ''Honey, I've got a one-track mind and it's theater, theater, theater,'' she once said. ''I have no time for anything else.''         One of Miss Lortel's favorite possessions in her memento-filled midtown apartment at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, where she lived after her husband's death, was a box covered with notices of plays she had produced. The lid opened to the sound of applause and a voice calling out ''More! More!''         Circulating in a milieu where youth often takes the starring role, she frequently sidestepped the matter of age by saying ''age is a number and mine is unlisted.'' When a gossip column last year reported that Miss Lortel would soon celebrate her 98th birthday, Blanche Marvin, a friend, reported that she was furious.         ''This will kill my love life,'' she said.       
         Francine Everett, a singer, dancer and actress who was one of the stars of the all-black cast ''race'' movies of the 30's and 40's, died at a nursing home in the Bronx on May 27.         She gave her birth year as 1920, however by 1933 she was already appearing with the Four Black Cats, a nightclub variety act. Shortly thereafter, she began acting with the Federal Theater in Harlem, which was sponsored by the Works Progress Administration.         After marrying the actor Rex Ingram, she moved to Hollywood in 1936. Upon her arrival, she is said to have turned down a part as one of the angels in the Warner Brothers all-black spectacle ''Green Pastures,'' in which her husband starred as De Lawd, and she later refused to accept the stereotypical roles of servants that were offered by the studios.         Her marriage to Mr. Ingram ended in divorce in 1939, and Ms. Everett returned to Harlem. She quickly became a familiar face as a lead in low-budget, independently produced black films like ''Keep Punching'' (1939), which starred the boxing champion Henry Armstrong; ''Big Timers'' (circa 1945), which featured Moms Mabley and Stepin Fetchit, and ''Dirty Gerty From Harlem U.S.A.'' (1946), which was directed by Spencer Williams Jr., who later portrayed Andy in the ''Amos 'n' Andy'' television series.         Among her Hollywood film credits were bit parts in ''Lost Boundaries'' (1949) and in Sidney Poitier's first film, ''No Way Out'' (1950), which was her final appearance on the screen.         The entertainment historian Henry T. Sampson said that Ms. Everett  and Edna Mae Harris were the last of the leading ladies of the all-black films. The cultural historian and lecturer Delilah Jackson said that Billy Rowe, an editor of The Pittsburgh Courier and writer for The Amsterdam News in New York, called Ms. Everett ''the most beautiful woman in Harlem.''         The former actor and award-winning filmmaker and producer William Greaves said that Ms. Everett  ''was a true legend of black film and theater, one of the top stars of the 40's race movies.''         He added, ''She would have been a superstar in Hollywood were it not for the apartheid climate in America and the movie industry at the time.''         Her arresting looks may not have benefited her career as a Hollywood player at a time when black actresses were rarely portrayed as glamorous, but they served her well as a model and singer.         As a vocalist, Ms. Everett appeared in more than 50 ''soundies,'' short musical films featuring the most renowned jazz and popular musicians of the 1940's. One was the 1947 release ''Ebony on Parade,'' which starred Dorothy Dandridge, Cab Calloway and the Count Basie band. She was also a popular print model who appeared in clothing and cosmetic advertisements in the 40's.         She is survived by an aunt, Lucy Williams.         Ms. Everett retired from show business in the 1950's. She held a clerical job at Harlem Hospital until her retirement in 1985. But she maintained a keen interest in black film and entertainment. She was a member of the Negro Actors' Guild and often lectured and participated on panels and in seminars sponsored by the International Agency for Minority Artists Affairs, which promotes black films.       
         Hillary Brooke, an actress who appeared in some 50 films as well as in the early 1950's television series ''My Little Margie,'' died on May 25 at a  hospital in Fall Brook, Calif. She was 84 and lived in Bosnall, Calif.         Rarely the leading actress, Ms. Brooke mainly portrayed elegant blondes who were ''the other woman.''         She appeared in ''Jane Eyre'' (1944) with Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine; ''Ministry of Fear'' (1944) with Ray Milland and Marjorie Reynolds; ''The Enchanted Cottage'' (1945) with Robert Young; ''Road to Utopia'' (1945) with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, and ''The Man Who Knew Too Much'' (1956), directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring James Stewart and Doris Day.         On television she appeared on ''The Abbott and Costello Show'' in the early 1950's, and played Roberta Townsend, the love interest of Charles Farrell, as Gale Storm's widowed father, in ''My Little Margie,'' which ran from 1952 to 1955.         Born Beatrice Peterson in Queens, she attended Columbia University and worked as a model before becoming an actress.         She is survived by a son, Donald Klune of Ketchum, Idaho; a stepdaughter, Carol Klune of Arcata, Calif.; a brother, Arthur Peterson of Seattle; 17 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  June 14, 1999, Monday  An obituary of the actress Hillary Brooke on Tuesday misspelled the names of two California communities. Ms. Brooke died at a hospital in Fallbrook, not Fall Brook; and she had lived in Bonsall, not Bosnall.       
         Sylvia Sidney, whose vulnerable but spunky persona helped make her the ultimate heroine of realistic movies of the 1930's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Sidney determined to be an actress at the age of 15 and perfected her artistry over six decades in a versatile mix of 40 films and 100 classical and modern plays.         In her 20's, the petite actress with a heart-shaped face, large, moist eyes and a tremulous voice played anguished film heroines in Rouben Mamoulian's ''City Streets,'' Theodore Dreiser and Josef von Sternberg's ''American Tragedy,'' Elmer Rice and King Vidor's ''Street Scene,'' Sidney Kingsley's ''Dead End'' and Alfred Hitchcock's ''Sabotage.'' She also starred in the first three American films directed by Fritz Lang: ''Fury,'' ''You Only Live Once'' and ''You and Me.''         In Lang's stark cinema of social injustice, the film historian David Thomson wrote, the actress ''caught exactly the fragile happiness allowed in Lang's world and played with a restraint that perfectly matched the fatal simplicity of the plots. There are close-ups in 'Fury' of Sidney watching Spencer Tracy in a burning jail, as harrowed as any Lillian Gish close-ups'' in D. W. Griffith's silent film masterpieces.         Miss Sidney was grateful for tutelage from her first film directors. In 1977 she remarked: ''King Vidor and Mamoulian, of course, I adored. Fritz Lang and I became dear friends, though we had awful fights.'' But producers were reluctant to free her from type-casting, prompting her to deplore her repetitious roles as ''the girl of the gangster, then the sister who was bringing up the gangster, then later the mother of the gangster, and they always had me ironing somebody's shirt.''         Miss Sidney also resented being treated as studio property. She considered herself not a star, but an actress. Eventually she expanded her gallery of screen characters to include a chic Eurasian double-agent in ''Blood on the Sun'' (1945), an idealistic journalist in ''The Searching Wind'' (1946), a drudge in ''Les Miserables'' (1952) and a hard-bitten matriarch in ''Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams'' (1973), for which she was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress. In the 1980's her films included ''Hammett,'' ''Corrupt'' and ''Beetlejuice,'' directed by Tim Burton. In 1996 she appeared in a cameo as a prairie woman in Mr. Burton's ''Mars Attacks!'' as a favor to the director for casting her in ''Beetlejuice'' as a chain-smoking ghoul, a role she thought was ''great,'' said John Springer, her friend and publicist.         On Broadway, Miss Sidney appeared in Ben Hecht's ''To Quito and Back'' (1937), Irwin Shaw's ''Gentle People'' (with the Group Theater, 1939), Carl Reiner and Joseph Stein's ''Enter Laughing'' (1963) and Tennessee Williams's ''Vieux Carre'' (1977).         Her richly varied tour and stock performances included ''Pygmalion,'' ''Angel Street,'' ''Jane Eyre,'' ''Joan of Lorraine,'' ''Kind Lady,'' ''O Mistress Mine,'' ''Anne of the Thousand Days,'' ''The Rivals,'' ''The Madwoman of Chaillot,'' ''The Little Foxes,'' ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' ''She Stoops to Conquer,'' ''The Glass Menagerie,'' ''Cabaret,'' ''Sweet Bird of Youth,'' ''Butterflies Are Free'' and '' 'Night, Mother.''         Among Miss Sidney's dozens of starring television roles were acclaimed performances as a cancer-ridden patient in a hospice in the 1980 play ''The Shadow Box'' and as plain-spoken but compassionate grandmothers of homosexual AIDS patients in ''An Early Frost'' in 1985 and in ''Andre's Mother'' in 1990. Miss Sidney last appeared on screen in 1998 in several episodes of ABC's new version of ''Fantasy Island,'' for which she had a seven-year contract for a recurring role, Mr. Springer said. The show was canceled.         Sylvia Sidney, originally named Sophia Kossow, was born in the Bronx on Aug. 8, 1910, to Victor Kossow, a clothing salesman, and the former Rebecca Saperstein. Her parents were divorced when she was 9, and soon after she was adopted by her mother's second husband, Dr. Sigmund Sidney, a dentist.         Shy and a stutterer, she was given elocution and dancing lessons starting at the age of 10. As a teen-ager, she left Washington Irving High School to study acting at the Theater Guild school in Manhattan and was soon expelled for staying out late. Nonetheless, she obtained a dozen roles and favorable notices in Broadway plays, including a 1928 drama, ''Gods of the Lightning,'' and a 1930 comedy, ''Bad Girl.'' They won her a contract with Paramount Pictures and opened her path to fame.         Her main recreation at her homes in Roxbury and later Danbury, Conn., was needlework. Her designs are sold as kits, and she wrote two popular instruction books on the art: ''Sylvia Sidney's Needlepoint Book'' (1968) and ''The Sylvia Sidney Question and Answer Book on Needlepoint'' (1975).         Miss Sidney's three marriages all ended in divorce. Her husbands were Bennett Cerf, the publisher; Luther Adler, the actor, and Carlton Alsop, a publicity agent. With Mr. Adler, she had a son, Jacob (Jody) Adler, who died in 1987 of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig's disease. His illness prompted her to become a dedicated volunteer for the National A.L.S. Foundation. No immediate family members survive.         Ms. Sidney regarded her life and her career as inseparable. ''There isn't a role that I wouldn't accept, provided it's good and has something to say,'' she told an interviewer in 1975. ''I wouldn't know what to do with myself if I retired. I'm an actress, and I have to work.''         Correction:  July 3, 1999, Saturday  An obituary of the actress Sylvia Sidney yesterday misspelled her original surname. It was Kosow, not Kossow.         The obituary also omitted two survivors. They are her half-brothers, Albert C. Kosow of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Edgar J. Kosow of Plantation, Fla.       
         Nancy Guild, a film actress who starred opposite some of the leading men of the 1940's and early 50's, died on Monday at her home in East Hampton, Long Island, after a long battle with emphysema. She was 73.         Ms. Guild, whose full name was Nancy Guild Martin, was ''discovered'' in old Hollywood style when she appeared in a 1945 Life magazine picture layout about campus fashions while a student at the University of Arizona. With her bone structure and insouciance, she captured the attention of five movie studios, which offered her screen tests.         She was signed to a seven-year contract by 20th Century-Fox, during which she made her film debut as a nightclub singer in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ''Somewhere in the Night'' (1946), starring John Hodiak. Movie ads urged viewers to ''meet that Guild girl; she rhymes with wild.''         She went on to star with George Montgomery in ''The Brasher Doubloon'' (1947), based on the Raymond Chandler thriller ''The High Window,'' and with Orson Welles in ''Black Magic'' (1949). She retired from acting in the 50's and later wrote for Architectural Digest.         Ms. Guild married the actor Charles Russell, with whom she had a daughter, Elizabeth. They divorced in 1950 and she married Ernest H. Martin, who produced Broadway hits like ''Guys and Dolls.'' Divorced from Mr. Martin in 1975, she married John Bryson, a photojournalist, in 1978. They divorced in 1995.         She is survived by three daughters, Elizabeth Martin of Boulder, Colo., and Cecilia Martin Ford and Polly Martin of New York, and three granddaughters.       
         Viola Sheely, an actress, a singer and a founding member of the Urban Bush Women dance company, died on July 27 in Tompkins Square Park on the Lower East Side. She was 41 and lived in Manhattan and Bali.         Ms. Sheely had taken her daughter, Jessye, to the park and apparently had a heart attack, said Grisha Coleman, a friend.         The winner of a 1992 Bessie Award, which is bestowed for creative work in dance and performance art, Ms. Sheely had a long, thin body and a slightly prim demeanor that belied her intensity and daring as a performer. One of her most memorable roles was as the shy young visionary Hannah, a character inspired by the primitive painter Minnie Evans, in Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's 1990 ''Praise House.''         ''Viola Sheely's range here is impressive, but nothing prepares the audience for her last stunning soliloquy -- a bellowed, ecstatic release,'' Anna Kisselgoff, senior dance critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1991. But Ms. Sheely was just as convincing portraying the lusty, anarchic women who populate many of Ms. Zollar's pieces.         Born in Belle Glade, Fla., Ms. Sheely trained at Florida State University. In New York City, she studied with the dancer and choreographer Dianne McIntyre in the early 1980's. Ms. Sheely performed with Urban Bush Women from 1984 to 1993. She also performed in ''Vanquished by Voodoo,'' an En Garde Arts theater production, in 1992.         A founder of Hot Mouth, an a cappella singing group, she belted out songs in a show-stopping performance in 1994.         In addition to her daughter, survivors include her husband, Oded Carmi, and two sisters, Betty and Carey Sheely of Belle Glade.         Correction:  August 17, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary on Aug. 8 about Viola Sheely, a dancer and singer, misstated the relationship of a survivor and omitted a reference to four others. The survivor, Jessye, is her son, not her daughter. She also leaves her brothers Michael, Jerry, Joe and Larry, all of Belle Glade, Fla.       
         Jeanne Miles, an American painter of luminous geometric abstractions, died last Friday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 90.         Ms. Miles was born in Baltimore and grew up in Washington. She was the first woman to enroll in the art school at George Washington University. In 1937, she was given a travel grant and, determined to use it for something exotic, went to Tahiti for a year to paint. She later studied in Paris at the Atelier Marcel Gromaire and the Grand Chaumiere.  She left France after the start of World War II and came to New York, where she lived and worked in Greenwich Village for many years. She moved to Los Angeles two years ago.         Ms. Miles exhibited for many years with the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York during the gallery's  heyday, from 1943 to 1959, and counted artists like Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Bradley Walker Tomlin among her friends. More recently, she had solo shows in Manhattan at the Marilyn Pearl Gallery in 1988 and at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in 1994.         The paintings in the Shapolsky show were modest in scale, based on circular and starlike patterns done in shades of rich jade green interspersed with passages of gold leaf. Although abstract, they suggested both illuminated manuscript pages and mandalas. The work reflected both the artist's long-standing interest in Asian art and thought, and her commitment to the spiritual implications of Western modernist art. ''The mandala form is universal and deeply fixed in our psyche,'' she said in an interview.         Ms. Miles's paintings were included in many group shows from the 1930's on at the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, among other institutions. Her work is in the permanent collection of the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Guggenheim, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Newark Museum and elsewhere.         She received grants from the Yaddo Art Colony and the McDowell Art Colony, an award from the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1968, and two Mark Rothko awards, in 1970 and 1973. She taught at Oberlin College, Moravian College and Yale University.         Ms. Miles is survived by a daughter, the actress Joanna Miles; a grandson, Miles Brandman, and a sister, Kitty Daffron of Florida.       
         Ruth Roman, a screen actress who parlayed her electrically charged combination of sexiness and wholesomeness into Hollywood stardom in the late 1940's and 50's, died on Thursday at her home in Laguna Beach, Calif. She was 75.         She died in her sleep, said her son, Richard Hall.         After her breakout role opposite Kirk Douglas in Stanley Kramer's ''Champion,'' a 1949 adaptation of a Ring Lardner short story about a maniacal prize fighter, Warner Brothers gave her starring roles in nine films in under two years.         In one day she leaped from working with Bette Davis in ''Beyond the Forest'' to supporting Milton Berle in ''Always Leave Them Laughing.'' A week after the completion of ''Strangers on a Train'' opposite Robert Walker, she was whisked into ''Tomorrow Is Another Day'' with Steve Cochran.         From 1948 to 1965, Ms. Roman appeared in more than 30 movies, and in the 1960's and 70's in numerous television shows.         Her romantic partners in films included Randolph Scott in ''Colt .45,'' James Stewart in ''The Far Country'' and Gary Cooper in ''Dallas.''         Few of her films are studied in film schools today. But in their time they made box office cash registers ring like sleigh bells and in 1951 Ms. Roman was receiving 500 letters a week from around the world.         There were plenty of cheesecake queens in Hollywood seeking roles when Ms. Roman arrived in 1945, but it was her come-hitcher warmth, combined with her shapely, dark-haired good looks, that made her a standout. When Collier's profiled her in 1951, the magazine declared that Ms. Roman's career had been built on a ''pervasive air of wholesomeness.''         It was an appeal that even Ms. Roman did not fully understand. When she auditioned for a part in ''Champion,'' she thought she would be right for the role of the fighter's gold-digging floozy and accordingly wore a tight-fitting black dress and heavy makeup when she swivel-hipped into Stanley Kramer's office.         But somehow the wholesomeness showed through. ''Actually, I thought of you for the other girl,'' said Mr. Kramer, then serving as the film's producer.         Marilyn Maxwell played the floozy, with Kirk Douglas as the fighter and Ms. Roman as his demure and steadfast wife.         It had been that same quality that landed Ms. Roman her first film role: a bit part as a WAVE in ''Stage Door Canteen'' in 1942.         Clem Beauchamp, company manager for ''Stage Door Canteen,'' told an interviewer in 1951 that he chose Ms. Roman from dozens of eager actresses because ''I felt right away that here was a girl who would show up on time in the morning with her lines learned and no nonsense.''         By Hollywood standards, Ms. Roman's romantic life was a bit dull. She dated Bill Walsh, a publicity agent, for five years. She once stepped out with Ronald Reagan. And in 1950 she married Mortimer Hall, a Los Angeles television executive. The marriage ended in divorce.  A second marriage, to Budd Burton Moss, also ended in divorce. She told interviewers that she disliked nightclubs and flashy clothes. Her one extravagance, she said, was her collection of 35 pairs of shoes, and that consisted mainly of Indian moccasins.         Not all of the excitement in her life was make-believe. In 1956 Ms. Roman was aboard the luxury passenger liner Andrea Doria when it was struck by the Stockholm. Ms. Roman was returning from Italy with her 3-year-old son, Dickie. She was dancing in the ship's Belvedere room, she told a reporter for The New York Times, when ''we heard a big explosion like a firecracker.''         She said she saw smoke coming from the general area of her cabin and rushed there to protect her son. He was sound asleep. She said she awakened Dickie and told him,  ''We're going on a picnic.''         When it was clear that the liner was sinking and passengers began entering lifeboats, a seaman lowered Dickie into a boat. Ms. Roman said she followed down a rope ladder, but when she was halfway down the lifeboat pulled away. She called out to the boat but it did not return. She was put on another lifeboat.         Ms. Roman told a reporter she was never in fear for her son's life, but felt sure he would be safe in the lifeboat, which turned out to be true. Ms. Roman and her son were among the 760 survivors of the Andrea Doria.         Her son, her only survivor, lives in California.         Born in Lynn, Mass., on Dec. 23, 1923, she was the youngest of three daughters of immigrants from Lithuania. Her father, Anthony Roman, a carnival barker, died when she was a child, forcing her mother to work as a waitress, cleaning woman and laundress.         Ms. Roman was proud of her family's endurance. ''For a while,'' she once told a reporter, ''we were moving regularly once a month because we couldn't pay our rent.''         But she never felt sorry for herself, she said, remarking, ''When you start out poor, you don't know what you're missing.''         Ms. Roman quit high school in her second year when she decided to become an actress. During the day she worked as a movie usher and at night she performed with the New England Repertory Company, a semi-professional group in Boston.         With $200 in her pocketbook, she  soon struck out for Hollywood. For a while, she lived in a boarding house with several other aspiring actresses. They called their home the House of the Seven Garbos.         For six years she endured a series of disappointments. She got a good part in a western called ''White Stallion,'' but it was never released. Then came a role in ''A Night in Casablanca,'' but after the filming her part was cut. But then everything changed after her audition with Stanley Kramer.       
         Birgit Cullberg, a pioneering experimental choreographer in Sweden who earned an international reputation through her intense dramatic ballets and vigorous social-protest pieces, died on Wednesday in Stockholm, where she lived. She was 91.         Although Miss Cullberg was a disciple of the German Expressionist choreographer Kurt Jooss, her own style fused modern dance and ballet. She was resident choreographer of the Royal Swedish Ballet from 1951 to 1957, and her most famous works were danced by ballet companies throughout the world.         Among these was her acknowledged masterpiece, ''Miss Julie,'' based on the August Strindberg play; it had its premiere in Sweden in 1950. Restaged to great acclaim in 1958 for American Ballet Theater, ''Miss Julie'' was a triumph for Violette Verdy in the title role, as the Swedish aristocrat who seduces a butler, and for Erik Bruhn as Jean, the butler. Mr. Bruhn virtually made the role his own for 20 years through his astonishingly powerful portrayal.         Ballet Theater staged three other Cullberg works, including the haunting Lapp tale ''Moon Reindeer.'' In 1958 the New York City Ballet presented Miss Cullberg's ''Medea'' with Melissa Hayden in the title role. In his review, John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, wrote, ''There is not a superfluous phrase, a meaningless gesture, an item of mere decoration in the choreography from end to end.''         Psychological insight was Miss Cullberg's strength, as she showed again in 1982 when the Cullberg Ballet, which she founded in 1967, made its belated United States debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with  Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in attendance.         Never shy about exploring the neurotic and the erotic, Miss Cullberg was represented by a duet, ''Adam and Eve,'' and an especially sensuous performance of ''Miss Julie,'' which nonetheless focused on the class differences between Julie and her servant. In ''Adam and Eve,'' Daniela Malusardi and Niklas Ek, Miss Cullberg's elder son, moved seamlessly from innocent playfulness to adult passion, a couple expelled from Eden but rejecting God as well.         Most of the other choreography was by Mats Ek, Miss Cullberg's other son, who cast her as a Mother Africa figure in his ''Soweto.'' Miss Cullberg, then 74, came out swinging, kicking, fiery-eyed and goading the oppressed onstage to resist until they collapsed to the sound of gunshots. In 1991, with her long white hair still flying, Miss Cullberg performed in Mats Ek's television dance production ''The Old Woman and the Door.''         She excelled in choreography for television. Her duet ''Red Wine in Green Glasses'' (1970) was shown on public television in the United States and was awarded the Prix Italia.         Miss Cullberg started life in a secure, wealthy home, but she had a volatile relationship with Anders Ek, one of Sweden's leading actors, whom she married in 1942. They had three children: Niklas, a brilliant dancer; Mats, 54, and his twin, the actress Malin Ek. They survive her, as do several grandchildren.         Miss Cullberg and her husband separated in 1949, and ''Medea,'' like many of her works, was interpreted by several Swedish critics as a piece that universalized her private emotions of the time.         Miss Cullberg and her husband reconciled in 1959 and both joined the new Stockholm City Theater, she as a stage director. (She directed him in ''Othello.'') The couple eventually divorced, but in the late 1970's, after Mr. Ek's death, Miss Cullberg choreographed a meditation on their life entitled ''Dreams of Love and Death.''         Born in Nykoping, Sweden, on Aug. 3, 1908, Miss Cullberg was the daughter of Ella W. Cullberg and Carl Cullberg, a bank director, and attended the University of Stockholm. After Jooss, the choreographer of the celebrated antiwar ballet ''The Green Table,'' appeared with his company in Stockholm, Miss Cullberg spent four years in England studying with him at Dartington Hall, an experimental arts center.         Returning to Sweden in 1939, she formed a small company and danced solos inspired by animal movements. In the early 1940's she studied ballet and wrote dance criticism. In 1946 she and the choreographer Ivo Cramer formed the Swedish Dance Theater, which disbanded in 1948. As the Royal Swedish Ballet's resident choreographer, she staged eight ballets.         In 1967 the Swedish Government established the current Cullberg Ballet. Writing in 1982 the Swedish critic Erik Naslund paid tribute to Miss Cullberg by declaring that it was her troupe, not the Royal Swedish Ballet, that was ''definitely the more prestigious company.''       
         Bernadette O'Farrell, an actress best known for her role as Maid Marian in the 1950's television series ''The Adventures of Robin Hood,'' died this week at 75, The Daily Telegraph of London reported on Wednesday.         Ms. O'Farrell was often seen in cinematic roles written by her husband, Frank Launder, the British screenwriter and director whose boisterous ''St. Trinian's'' movies, created with Sidney Gilliat and set in a girls' school, amused filmgoers during the 1950's and 60's. But it was her role as Maid Marian in the long-running Robin Hood series that catapulted her to stardom.         The series became one of the first British television programs to succeed in the United States, and at the height of its popularity more than 30 million viewers in Britain and North America watched its weekly episodes. Essentially a traditional version of the legend, the series, which ran from 1955 until 1958 and starred Richard Greene in the title role, proved popular with younger viewers, partly because of its catchy theme song sung by Dick James. It also had a high standard of script writing, some of it by Ring Lardner Jr., who had been blacklisted in Hollywood for his suspected Communist sympathies.         But after two years and 78 episodes, Ms. O'Farrell feared that she was becoming typecast, and in 1957 she left the series despite receiving thousands of letters begging her to stay.         Born in Birr, County Offaly, Ireland, to a bank manager and a gifted amateur actress, Ms. O'Farrell nevertheless showed no interest in the stage. After being educated at a local convent, she was working as a lawyer's secretary when she was invited  to an audition by the film director Sir Carol Reed, who knew her father.         There she met Launder, who gave her a small part in his 1947 film ''Captain Boycott,'' with Stewart Granger. In 1949 she appeared as a glamorous gym teacher in Launder and Gilliat's ''Happiest Days of Your Life,'' with Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford. She married Launder the next year; he died in 1997.         In the early 1950's, Ms. O'Farrell combined stage work with small parts in her husband's films, including ''The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan''; ''The Genie,'' with Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and ''The Square Ring,'' a boxing tale in which she divorced her husband because she could not bear to see him battered. She last appeared in 1959 in Launder and Gilliat's ''Bridal Path'' before retiring to spend more time with her young family on their farm in Buckinghamshire, England.         Later, she and Launder moved to Monaco, where they were active in local stage productions and charities.         She is survived by two daughters.       
         Mary Kay Bergman, whose many voices were heard on ''South Park'' and in other animated television shows and films, died on Nov. 11 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 38.         The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said Officer Charlotte Broughton of the Los Angeles Police Department.         Ms. Bergman was a sought-after voice-over actress for the last two decades. She provided the voices of most of the female characters on ''South Park,'' the irreverent hit television series on Comedy Central. Because the show's characters are so sketchily drawn, Ms. Bergman's voices were perhaps more important than usual in an animation.         Ms. Bergman was found dead in her bedroom in a home she shared with her husband, Dino Andrade, in the Venice Beach area. She was discovered by Mr. Andrade and a friend.         ''This was a complete surprise,'' her lawyer, Robert Harrison, told  The San Diego Union-Tribune, adding that there had been no prior sign of depression. ''She did leave a note, a reason, but it didn't make any sense,'' Mr. Harrison said. ''She was a victim of mental illness, and no one knew.''         Ms. Bergman's other credits included the movies ''South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' ''Beauty and the Beast,'' ''The Iron Giant,'' ''Mulan,'' ''The Little Mermaid'' and ''Hercules.'' She was also the official voice of Snow White and the character Daphne Blake for several ''Scooby Doo'' videos and did voice-overs for popular video games.         After studying at UCLA from 1978 to 1981, Ms. Bergman worked with an acting troupe called the Groundlings. She also taught the technique of doing voice-overs for animation at the Kalmenson and Kalmenson Studios in Burbank.         Besides her husband, no survivors were immediately identified.       
         Mabel King, an actress and singer best known for her portrayal of Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West, in the Broadway and movie productions of ''The Wiz'' and her role as the mother in the mid-70's television comedy ''What's Happening!'' died on Nov. 9 at a hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif., where she lived. She was 66.         She died after a long illness and complications from diabetes, said a friend, Vickie Chamberlain.         Ms. King was born on Dec. 25, 1932, in Charleston, S.C., and grew up in Harlem. She appeared on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' early in her career and later made guest appearances on many other television shows, including ''Barney Miller,'' ''Fantasy Island,'' ''The Jeffersons'' and ''Wiseguy.''         She appeared in nine movies, including ''Scrooged'' (1988); ''The Jerk'' (1979), in which she played Steve Martin's mother; ''The Gong Show Movie'' (1980); and ''The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings'' (1976).         In 1975 she appeared in the play  ''The Wiz,'' an all-black musical based on L. Frank Baum's ''Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' that was later made into a movie; Ms. King had the same role in the film version. She also worked on Broadway in productions of ''A Race With the Wind'' and ''The Women.''         Ms. King's most visible role was as Mrs. Thomas, or Mama, in the ABC series ''What's Happening!'' from 1976 to 1979.         She is survived by her mother, Rosalee Washington, and a sister, Rose Washington, both of Manhattan. Her son, Larry, died in 1996.       
         Madeline Kahn, the Oscar-nominated comedian best known for her work in the films ''Paper Moon'' and ''Blazing Saddles'' and in the Broadway revival of ''Born Yesterday,'' died yesterday in a Manhattan hospital. She was 57 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was ovarian cancer,  said Jeff Schneider, a spokesman for the William Morris agency, which represented her.         Ms. Kahn acknowledged the illness publicly last month, saying she was undergoing ''aggressive treatment.'' She had been fighting the disease for the last year, Mr. Schneider said.         Once described as a Botticelli angel cracking a malicious grin, Ms. Kahn was one of the nation's queens of comedy on a par with Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin.         Ms. Kahn was nominated for Academy Awards for best supporting actress two years in a row, for her portrayal of a floozy named Trixie Delight in ''Paper Moon'' in 1973 and her role as a saloon singer in ''Blazing Saddles'' in 1974.         She was also nominated for Tony Awards for ''In the Boom Boom Room'' in 1973; ''On the 20th Century'' in 1978, and the revival of ''Born Yesterday'' in 1989.         Ms. Kahn made her debut in the  chorus line of the 1965 City Center revival of ''Kiss Me Kate,'' the show that is now on Broadway. Her Broadway break was in Leonard Stillman's ''New Faces of 1968,'' for which she received glowing reviews.         She won a Tony Award for best actress in 1993 with her role as a ditsy matron in the Broadway production of ''The Sisters Rosensweig.''         Ms. Kahn was also known for her roles in the Mel Brooks movies ''Young Frankenstein'' and ''High Anxiety.'' She had most recently taken on the part of Pauline, a neighbor on the CBS sitcom ''Cosby.''         Discussing comic technique and audience reaction in an interview in 1989 just before she opened on Broadway in the Judy Holliday role in ''Born Yesterday,'' Ms. Kahn remarked: ''Laughter is a strange response. I mean, what is it? It's a spasm of some kind! Is that always joy? It's very often discomfort. It's some sort of explosive reaction.''         Flashing a devilish smile, she added musically, ''It's very complex.''         Critics and fellow actors said her intuitive comic technique derived partly from the daffy, cartoonish way she spoke, savoring some words and flinging out others as if to pop soap bubbles.         One interviewer called her ''a kind of toy person: diminutive, delightful, sexy, impish, cute and capable of squirting vinegar in your eye.''         In ''Blazing Saddles,'' Ms. Kahn used her classically trained voice in an amusing portrayal of a saloon singer who helps Gene Wilder foil Mel Brooks's evil plan to do in the new sheriff in town.         ''She is one of the most talented people that ever lived,'' Mr. Brooks once said. ''I mean, either in stand-up comedy, or acting, or whatever you want, you can't beat Madeline Kahn.''         Madeline Gail Kahn was born in Boston and grew up there and in New York, the child of divorced middle-class parents. She is survived by her husband, John Hansbury, and a brother, Jeffrey.         Ms. Kahn took an early interest in acting. She continued to perform while a student at Hofstra University on Long Island. She was cautioned by a teacher that her baby-talk way of speaking -- which has been described as if ''filtered through a ceramic nose'' -- would be a handicap. But she turned this trait to her advantage. After flirting with a singing career, she made many movies in which she used her voice for comic effect and people remembered it.         In ''Blazing Saddles,'' for example, she played an all-fluff-and-garters loose woman of the Wild West -- a Dietrich sendup -- who makes cowpokes beg for her favors.         When she is bored she tells them to go away, and when one timorous soul presents her with a flower she exclaims memorably: ''Oh, one wed wose! How wovely!''       
         Anne Francine, an actress who worked in film, theater and television and who was also a prominent cabaret performer for six decades, died on Friday at the Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in London, Conn. She was 82 and lived in Old Lyme, Conn.         Born into Main Line Philadelphia society, Miss Francine came of age during the 1930's, when New York's numerous intimate night spots offered opportunities for beginners. With her imposing good looks, bawdy  humor and raspy contralto, she made her performing debut at the Coq Rouge, after winning an amateur contest, and went on to engagements at the Pierre, the Persian Room, the Copacabana and the Algonquin.         In the mid-1940's she traveled abroad, singing in late-night haunts in London and Paris. Impeccably mannered and beautifully spoken, she centered her programs on the flippant high-society songs of Cole Porter and Jerome Kern, inserting comedic gestures often funny enough to bring the house down.         Miss Francine made her Broadway debut in 1954 with Shirley Booth in ''By the Beautiful Sea'' before going on to work with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in ''The Great Sebastians'' the next season. In the A.P.A.-Phoenix Repertory Company production of ''The School for Scandal'' she stepped in for a vacationing Helen Hayes. But her favorite role was that of Vera Charles in the 1966 Broadway production of ''Mame,'' starring Angela Lansbury. She and Ms. Lansbury reprised their characters in the 1983 revival. Ms. Francine last appeared on Broadway in 1987 as Mrs. Harcourt in the Lincoln Center revival of ''Anything Goes,'' starring Patti LuPone.         Miss Francine's film work included ''Crocodile Dundee'' and Fellini's ''Juliet of the Spirits.'' On television she was best known for her portrayal of the conniving matriarch Flora Simpson Reilly in ''Harper Valley P.T.A.,'' with Barbara Eden, in the early 1980's.         A frequent performer on the summer stock circuit, Miss Francine was a regular presence at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., where she taught at the annual cabaret symposium. Even after a 1992 stroke left her unable to speak, she would instruct students by pantomiming her commands or writing them on an erasable box designed for that purpose.         No immediate relatives survive.
