         Lacey Fosburgh, a writer whose books chronicled murder, family passions and mystery in India, died last night at California Pacific Hospital in San Francisco. She was 50 years old and lived in Mill Valley, Calif.         Ms. Fosburgh, who began her writing career as a reporter for The New York Times, died of complications of breast cancer, said a friend of the family.         Ms. Fosburgh's books were the nonfiction "Closing Time" (1977) and the novels "Old Money" (1983), about a woman photographer's painful relationship with her father, and "India Gate" (1991), a sprawling, passionate novel set in India. At her death, she was writing a novel set in present-day New York City under contract to Simon & Schuster.         She was a staff reporter for the Times from 1968 to late 1973. In the last 20 years, she also wrote freelance newspaper and magazine articles, many of them for The Times, taught journalism at the University of California at Berkeley and was a consultant to newspapers, among them The Oakland Tribune.  Murder and Mysteries         A 1973 murder case about which Ms. Fosburgh wrote for The Times became the subject of "Closing Time," which was a selection of the Literary Guild and the Doubleday Book Club. It won a Mystery Writers of America award.         The murder victim was a troubled teacher, Roseann Quinn. The police said she took an Indiana drifter, John Wayne Wilson, home to her apartment on West 72d Street in Manhattan from a nearby singles bar. They said her body had been sexually mutilated. After being held five months on murder charges, Mr. Wilson hanged himself in his jail cell.         In "Contemporary Authors," a series of reference books, Truman Capote is quoted as remarking that the book showed that Ms. Fosburgh "is a skillful, selective reporter and also a literary artist."         Ms. Fosburgh was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Hugh Whitney Fosburgh, a journalist and author who died in 1976, and Helen Edwards Fosburgh. Through her paternal grandmother, Leila Whitney Fosburgh, Ms. Fosburgh was descended from the Whitney family. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and Sarah Lawrence College. She was a debutante at a dinner-dance at the St. Regis Hotel. From 1964 to 1966 she studied in New Delhi on a Fulbright grant.         Her 1973 marriage to Marc Libarle ended in divorce in 1975.         She is survived by her second husband, David Harris, a writer who was a prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, whom she wed in 1977; a daughter from her second marriage, Sophie Whitney Harris of Mill Valley; her mother, who lives in Manhattan, and a brother, Pieter, of Manhattan.       
         Diana Adams, who was a leading ballerina with both the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater and the former dean of students at the School of American Ballet, died on Sunday at Mark Twain-St. Joseph's Hospital in San Andreas, Calif. She was 66 and lived in Arnold, Calif.         Miss Adams was one of George Balanchine's favorite dancers and created roles in many of his major ballets of the 1950's. Among her most complex parts was the almost fiendishly demanding pas de deux she danced with Arthur Mitchell in the Balanchine-Stravinsky "Agon" in 1957. Mr. Mitchell later said of the duet and its unusual pivots and balances, "Diana's nervous intensity made the whole pas de deux work because it's not so much the difficulty of the steps or how flexible you are, it's the precariousness."         She also appeared in films, performing with Danny Kaye in "Knock on Wood" (1954) and in "Invitation to the Dance" (1956), directed by Gene Kelly. A Versatile Talent         Miss Adams was born in Staunton, Va. Her family later moved to New York City, and she studied there at Ballet Arts School, where one of her teachers was Agnes de Mille. Miss Adams made her stage debut in 1943 in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "Oklahoma!," choreographed by Miss de Mille. In 1944, she joined Ballet Theater, as American Ballet Theater was then known.         Her talent and versatility were soon recognized. She performed the title role in David Lichine's comic "Helen of Troy," was the malevolent Queen of the Wilis in "Giselle," and was praised for her poignancy in Antony Tudor's bittersweet "Jardin aux Lilas" and for her ferocity in "Undertow," Tudor's ballet about slum life. In 1948, she created the role of the mother in Miss de Mille's "Fall River Legend."         She joined the New York City Ballet in 1950 and performed with it until 1963. She had a remarkable interpretative range and was as compelling in Balanchine'sabstractions as she was in Tudor's dance-dramas. John Martin wrote in The New York Times in 1951 that under Balanchine's guidance, Miss Adams "has become theepitome of the lyric dancer."         In addition to "Agon," she danced leading roles in the premieres of Tudor's "Lady of the Camellias" (1951), Frederick Ashton's "Picnic at Tintagel" (1952), and important Balanchine creations including "Caracole" (1952), "Opus 34" (1954), "Episodes" (1959) and "Liebeslieder Walzer" (1960). Transition Into Teaching         She began teaching at the School of American Ballet while still a member of the company. After she stopped dancing, she served as dean of students at Balanchine's request until she retired in 1971. It was Miss Adams who chose the teen-age Suzanne Farrell at a School of American Ballet audition in 1960.         Miss Adams married the dancer Hugh Laing in 1947; they were divorced in 1953. Her second marriage, to the stage manager and lighting designer Ronald Bates, also ended in divorce. In recent years, Miss Adams lived quietly in retirement, although she did teach for several companies, including the State Ballet of Missouri, which is directed by Todd Bolender, one of her former colleagues at the New York City Ballet.         She is survived by a daughter, Georgina Bates of Antioch, Calif.

There is to be a funeral service at 2 P.M. on Saturday at Green Gulch Farm, Muir Beach, Calif.       
         Elizabeth Wood, a public housing pioneer who advocated racial and economic integration and the designing of workable neighborhoods, died yesterday at a nursing home near Atlanta. She was 93.         She suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a broken hip and a stroke, said Gisela Titman, a niece.         Miss Wood was the founding director of the Chicago Housing Authority, an Illinois state housing official and an officer of the National Association of Housing Officials. She was later a housing consultant in New York City and an administrator at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.         Known as "Chicago's largest landlord," she headed the authority from 1937 to 1954, supervising the building and management of homes for thousands of families. Sought Real Neighborhoods         The philosophy she developed over the years was to mix residents by race, economic class and family size. She proposed that social workers help troubled families who might drag down a project.         Miss Wood favored small, dispersed projects rather than high-rise concentrations. A building's height should be limited to the distance that a mother in a window could be heard when calling to a child in a playground below, she said.         She urged planners to include shops, churches, parks and even pubs to turn housing complexes into real neighborhoods instead of human warehouses. Courtyards and indoor gathering places should have an inviting "design for loitering," she said. She sponsored flower-growing contests to brighten the projects.         Political pressure eventually forced Miss Wood out of her Chicago job. She said she fought with officials "and anybody else who stood in the way of getting homes built for the people."         She then went to New York, where she did studies for the City Housing Authority and the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. From 1965 to 1972 she worked at H.U.D. in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations to coordinate housing policy with other social and poverty programs.         She won Guggenheim and Ford Foundation grants to study in Iran and analyze housing in India. She wrote numerous articles and books.         The daughter of a missionary teacher, Miss Wood was born in Nara, Japan, and grew up in Bloomington, Ill. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees in rhetoric at the University of Michigan, she taught English for four years at Vassar College.         After moving to Chicago for doctoral studies, she instead became a social worker for United Charities. She then joined the Home Modernization Bureau, where a major contractor tutored her on the construction industry.         When the New Deal Public Works Administration began building housing, she became a planner. She also served as executive secretary of the Illinois Housing Board when it drafted a law creating housing authorities.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Audrey Hepburn, the actress who epitomized Hollywood chic in the 1950's and 60's, died yesterday at her home in Tolochenaz, near Lausanne, Switzerland. She was 63 years old and had undergone surgery for colon cancer in November.         Her death from cancer was announced by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, for which she had been a special ambassador since 1988.         In recent years, she made few movies, but traveled the world raising money and awareness for the U.N. organization. Her last screen role, in 1989, was a cameo as an angel easing the hero toward death in Steven Spielberg's "Always," a role in which the character's grace and serenity echoed the image Miss Hepburn had maintained throughout a 40-year career. An Oscar for a Princess         Her first major film role made her a star. In the 1953 romance "Roman Holiday," she played a princess who runs from her duties and falls in love with a journalist played by Gregory Peck. Audiences were enchanted by her combination of grace, elegance and high spirits, and she won an Academy Award as best actress.         The same year she won her Oscar, she won a Tony for her performance in the play "Ondine." Bosley Crowther, The New York Times critic, described her in words that characterized her youthful appeal. He called her "a slender, elfin and wistful beauty, alternately regal and childlike."         In a string of films that followed, she continued to play the lithe young thing with stars in her eyes and the ability to make Cinderella transformations. In "Sabrina" (1954), she was a chauffeur's daughter forced to choose between wealthy brothers, played by William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. In "Funny Face" (1957), opposite Fred Astaire, she played a bookstore clerk turned high-fashion model.         Descriptions of her beauty and appeal inevitably included the word "gamine." She was boyishly slender, with an aristocratic bearing, the trace of a European accent and a hint of mischief.  'A Wild-Eyed Doe'         Billy Wilder once recalled directing her in the 1957 film "Love in the Afternoon": "You looked around and suddenly there was this dazzling creature looking like a wild-eyed doe prancing in the forest. Everybody on the set was in love within five minutes."         Among her most popular and acclaimed roles was that of Holly Golightly, the backwoods beauty turned New York sophisticate in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (1961).         At the height of her career, she worked with such directors as William Wyler and George Cukor and acted with the great male movie stars of her day, playing the younger woman opposite Gary Cooper ("Love in the Afternoon"), Cary Grant ("Charade," 1963) and Rex Harrison, in the 1964 movie version of "My Fair Lady."         There was some grumbling from the theater world when she was cast as Eliza Doolittle in "My Fair Lady," winning the role over Julie Andrews, who had originated it on Broadway. Ms. Hepburn's singing was dubbed in the film by Marni Nixon. The film won several Oscar nominations, but Miss Hepburn was not nominated. A Blind Woman Terrorized         Throughout her career, she also took on dramatic roles. She won an Oscar nomination for the title role of a woman questioning her vocation in "A Nun's Story' (1959). She played a woman enduring 20 years of an embattled marriage, opposite Albert Finney, in "Two for the Road" (1967). And she won her fifth Oscar nomination for her role as a blind woman terrorized in her own home in "Wait Until Dark" (1967).  Other nominations were for "Sabrina" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's."         After "Wait Until Dark," she left full-time acting and lived mostly in Switzerland.         Miss Hepburn returned to the screen occasionally. In "Robin and Marian" (1976) she played the middle-aged Maid Marian to Sean Connery's Robin Hood. The role was considered the triumph of her later career and a reflection of the graceful way the actress herself had moved into middle age.         She also made some poorly received films, including "Bloodline" (1979) amd "They All Laughed" (1981).         Miss Hepburn, whose name originally was Edda van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston, was born on May 4, 1929, near Brussels, to a Dutch mother and an English father, and was educated largely in London. During World War II, she and her mother were caught vacationing in Holland when the Nazis invaded and her family endured much hardship during the occupation. During the war, one of her brothers was taken to a labor camp, and an uncle and cousin were executed. She once said the family was reduced to eating tulip bulbs. Spotted by Colette         But when she returned to London after the war, her life took the glamorous turn she would maintain for the rest of her life. She was a ballet student and model. On the Riviera, she was spotted by the author Colette, who insisted that Miss Hepburn star in the Broadway version of "Gigi," which led to "Roman Holiday."         She attributed her work with Unicef to her childhood experience of hunger and fear during the war.         As Goodwill ambassador for Unicef she traveled extensively in Africa and Latin America. She visited Ethiopia during the drought to call attention to the plight of starving children. In 1991 she described her Unicef role as "talking my head off," and said, "I just decided to do as much as possible in the time that I'm still up to it."         Last year she visited Somalia. It was shortly after returning from that trip that her cancer was diagnosed. With Frequent Appearances         Even in her last years she remained a visible presence in the film world. She received a tribute from the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1991. She was a frequent presenter at the Academy Awards, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently announced that she and Elizabeth Taylor would receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award this year.         In 1954, she married the actor Mel Ferrer (with whom she later co-starred in "War and Peace.") They were divorced in 1968. In 1969 she married Andrea Dotti, an Italian psychiatrist, from whom she was later divorced.         Her companion since 1980 was Robert Wolders, a Dutch actor. She is also survived by two sons, Sean, from her marriage to Mr. Ferrer, and Luca, from her marriage to Dr. Dotti. The Sprite in Designer Clothing         Audrey Hepburn made her American stage and screen debuts in 1951, and two years later her gamin haircut, sylphlike shape and tomboyish but elegant demeanor in "Roman Holiday" made her a star and won her an Oscar. These are the plays and films in which she appeared.

         Patricia Brooks Mann, a lyric soprano who helped fashion the modern standard for opera performers, died on Friday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 59.         She died of complications of multiple sclerosis, said her husband, Theodore D. Mann, the artistic director and co-founder of Circle in the Square Theater.         In an era when audiences and critics began demanding that opera performers display dramatic as well as musical talent, Ms. Brooks, who performed under her maiden name, arrived with a non-operatic training that fit the bill.         Her distinctive style drew on her earlier career in the theater and dance. Her opera performances won praise for her beauty, acting ability and graceful movements, as well as for her voice. Some classified her as a singing actress rather than an opera singer.         "The public was clamoring that opera performers had to look and act the part, not just sing it, and she was the new wave," said Beverly Sills, her famed contemporary at the New York City Opera. Command Performance         Ms. Brooks starred in numerous City Opera productions in the 1960's and 1970's, when she was in her 30's and 40's. She also sang with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and was a soloist at Carnegie and Alice Tully Halls, Covent Gardens in London and in concerts across the United States. She gave a White House command performance for President John F. Kennedy.         In an early review, Raymond Ericson of The New York Times wrote that as Gilda in "Rigoletto" in 1963, "Miss Brooks was attractive to both eye and ear, a musicianly artist and an intelligent actress." When she co-starred with Placido Domingo in "La Traviata" in 1966, Harold C. Schonberg's review praised her for "acting with a delicacy of detail rare in opera."         Her performances proved popular with audiences. An account of her appearance in "La Boheme" in 1961 said she "very nearly stopped the show." A review of "Tales of Hoffmann" in 1966 said she "brought down the house." And a report of her singing of Bellini with Marilyn Horne in 1971 said listeners were driven "into a frenzy." Studied Dance         Ms. Brooks was born in Manhattan. As a youngster she took lessons in music, ballet and acting and at the age of 10 won a WQXR-radio piano competition. She attended the High School of Music and Art and at 14 began studying dance with Martha Graham.         But a knee injury from a fall turned her from dance to theater. She auditioned for Mr. Mann, who was smitten and confided to his partner, Jose Quintero, that he intended to marry the aspiring actress.         Mr. Quintero cast her in Truman Capote's "The Grass Harp" and in "The Iceman Cometh," with Jason Robards and Peter Falk, and she studied acting under Uta Hagen.         Ms. Brooks began folk singing and appearing in musicals, encouraged by her mother, Eda, a voice coach. While singing in the chorus of nuns in "The Sound of Music" in 1960, Ms. Brooks decided to leave that Broadway hit and switch to opera.         Maturing rapidly in her new medium, she won an enviable array of praise. Critics hailed her performances as charming, bewitching and dazzling. Her voice was described as sweet, velvety, free-floating, delicate, warm and rich. Her acting was called nuanced, subtle, sensitive, elegant, expressive and exciting.         Although it was undisclosed, eventually multiple sclerosis limited her breathing, so she retired from performing in 1977. But she began teaching voice and directing productions at the State University of New York at Purchase and gave private lessons for several years.         When illness forced an end to her teaching, she turned her creative energies to oil and water-color painting.         Besides her husband and mother, Ms. Brooks is survived by two sons, Jonathan and Andrew, both of Manhattan and Mount Kisco; a stepbrother, Alan Brooks, and a sister, Joan Brooks Palermo, both of Manhattan.         A memorial service will be held at noon on Feb. 1 at Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway at 50th Street.       
         Cynthia Wood, a horse breeder and patron of the arts, died on Saturday at her ranch in Santa Barbara. She was 55.         She died of cancer, said Merrillee Ford, a friend of the family.         Ms. Wood grew up on a working ranch in the Simi Valley, where her father, Adrian Gordon (Buddy) Wood, was a rancher, philanthropist, cultural leader and powerful figure in county politics. In 1968 she built showplace stables on a 22-acre property where she bred, trained and showed thoroughbred horses. She sold the property in 1983.         In her youth, Ms. Wood studied singing in the West and at the Metropolitan Opera. She worked for a time as an assistant stage manager at La Scala in Milan, Italy, and as an assistant to several opera directors.         She was the founding president of the Friends of the Vienna Philharmonic and served on the boards of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Community Arts Music Association of Santa Barbara.         She joined the Metropolitan Opera board in 1989. Her gifts to the company included new productions of "Parsifal," "Elektra" and "Lucia di Lammermoor"; the 1990 telecast of Wagner's "Ring" cycle, and underwriting for future new productions. The public television broadcast of "Parsifal" scheduled for April 7 is also one of her gifts.         She is survived by her mother, Ailene Claeyssens of Santa Barbara.       
         Hannah Wilke, a sculptor and Conceptual artist who made the body and female sexuality the subject of her work, died yesterday at Twelve Oaks Hospital in Houston. She was 52 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications from lymphoma, said her husband, Donald Goddard.         In the late 1960's and early 70's, Ms.  Wilke startled the art world with beautiful sculptures made of latex or ceramic whose layered and folded flowerlike forms were both abstract and yet highly suggestive of female genitalia. This fortune-cookie-like configuration became the artist's signature; it was sometimes small and made of homey materials like chewing gum or laundry lint, or it could be larger and painted with Abstract Expressionist brushstrokes. These forms could hang on the wall, or be marshaled in great numbers across the floor, or be stuck directly to the body of the artist herself, as they were in some of her Conceptual photographic pieces.         In some ways, Ms. Wilke was part of the Post-Minimalist soft-sculpture esthetic that emerged in the early 1970's and that included artists like Eva Hesse and Keith Sonnier. But she brought to this esthetic a stronger sense of the erotic and an often witty political edge. Striking in appearance, she forthrightly made herself the primary subject of her videotapes, performance pieces and photographs, often posing nude or partially clothed in ways that ridiculed the role of the female nude in art. While some critics called her work narcissistic, others saw it as probing the mechanism of narcissism and voyeurism.  Ravages of Cancer         In the late 1970's, Ms. Wilke's involvement with the female body became even more personal when her mother contracted cancer and the artist began to photograph the physical ravages of the disease and its treatments. In 1986, when cancer was diagnosed in Ms. Wilke, she began a series of daily watercolor drawings of her face, her hands or flowers. With the help of her husband, she also turned the camera on herself, documenting her illness in a series of large-scale color photographs.         Ms. Wilke, whose original name was Arlene Hannah Butter, was born in New York City on March 7, 1940. She earned a bachelor of fine arts degree and a teaching certificate from the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia in 1962 and taught sculpture at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan for many years. Since her first one-woman exhibition in 1972, she has been represented by the Ronald Feldman Gallery in Manhattan.         Her work is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Jewish Museum in New York City, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, the Milwaukee Art Museum and the Allen Art Museum in Oberlin, Ohio. A retrospective of her career was organized at the University of Missouri at St. Louis in 1989.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Marsie Scharlatt of Los Angeles, and two stepdaughters, Katie Goddard of Minneapolis and Nellie Goddard of Chicago.       
         Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia, the widow of Peter II, whose reign as the last King of Yugoslavia was ended in 1941 by invading German troops, died Saturday at her home outside London. She was 71.         The Queen had been "very ill" with cancer for several years, said her daughter-in-law, Crown Princess Katherine.         Alexandra was born into Greek royalty -- and tragedy -- on March 25, 1921, five months after her father, Alexander, King of the Hellenes, died of blood poisoning after being bitten by a pet monkey.         Greece formally recognized her as a princess when she was 18 months old, but a year later she was in exile in England because of shifting Greek politics. She did not return to Greece until 13 years later, in 1935, when King George II, her uncle, returned to rule. Married Amid Royalty         When the Germans overran Greece in World War II, Alexandra and her mother, the former Aspasia Manos, the daughter of a royal equerry, again traveled to London. There she met King Peter II, who was studying at Cambridge after being swept from his throne. Both Alexandra and Peter were great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria.         She and Peter married on March 20, 1944, at the Yugoslav Legation in London, in the presence of three other monarchs in exile -- King George II of Greece, King Haakon of Norway and Queen Wilhemina of the Netherlands -- as well as King George VI of England, who was best man, and Queen Elizabeth, who is now the Queen Mother.         The next year, King Peter was formally deposed when Tito established a Communist Government in Yugoslavia. Peter's property was confiscated and the couple was soon virtually penniless. Peter died in Denver in 1970 after a liver transplant.         Their son, Crown Prince Alexander, who was born in Britain, traveled to Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, last summer as part of an effort to restore the family dynasty and to bring peace to the Balkans.         In addition to her son and daughter-in-law, Alexandra is survived by three grandchildren, Peter, Philip and Alexander.       
         Joy Garrett, an actress who performed in soap operas and on the New York stage, died on Thursday at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in the Westwood section of Los Angeles. She was 47.         Rich Elbaum, a spokesman for the medical center, said the cause was liver failure.         For the past seven years, Ms. Garrett played the role of the mother figure Jo Johnson on the NBC daytime soap opera "Days of Our Lives." Previously she had performed for a year on another daytime soap opera, "The Young and the Restless," on CBS.         In 1969, she appeared in "Gertrude Stein's First Reader," a musical revue based on works of Gertrude Stein, at the Astor Place Theater on Lafayette Street in the East Village. Ms. Garrett appeared in the 1970 production, at the Edison Theater, of "The Candyapple," playing the mistress of a lapsed Roman Catholic priest.         She also performed in "Silver Queen Saloon" at La Mama E.T.C. in 1978.         She also appeared in movies and stock and touring productions.         She was born in Fort Worth and attended Texas Wesleyan University and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.         She is survived by her parents, Clarence and Kathleen Garrett of Fort Worth.       
         Adina Blady Szwajger, a pediatrician who struggled to save young lives in the Children's Hospital in the Warsaw ghetto and survived to recount the horrors, died Feb. 18 in Lodz, Poland. She was 75 and lived in Warsaw.         The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, said Jerzy Warman, a friend in Manhattan.         When the Nazis finally shut the hospital Dr. Szwajger (pronounced SHVY-gher), despite her Jewishness, escaped the ghetto with special identity papers, then worked with the resistance.         After the war she resumed work as a pediatrician and occasionally spoke about her harrowing experiences. But she kept the most haunting episode a secret for decades, until she was ill and in retirement.         Her memoirs circulated in a Solidarity underground magazine in the mid-1980's, then were published in the West in 1988.  'Damning and Uplifting'         In a review of the Pantheon edition in The New York Times, Kati Marton said: "Dr. Szwajger's unsentimental, almost matter-of-fact memoir of the German occupation of Poland is the most damning and most uplifting of the many accounts of the Holocaust that I have read. I did not think the well-covered ground of Nazi atrocities could still astonish. 'I Remember Nothing More: The Warsaw Children's Hospital and the Jewish Resistance' proved me wrong."         Her story began with the high hopes of a young medical student from the University of Warsaw. She described herself as bubbling, happy and proud to help youngsters at the hospital.         But soon the hospital was filled with youngsters dying from tuberculosis, typhus and starvation. The Nazis occupiers sealed off the ghetto and eventually marched a steady stream of people to their deaths.         "So we tried to save them with those scraps of food, medicines and injections," she wrote. Some children revived enough to smile -- "except that this was the kind of smile that made your hair stand on end and your flesh crawl." She described "famished skeletons" fighting over the soup pot, spilling it and lapping the slop off the floor.  'Corpses and Living Together'         Every day she went to a square to looking for stray children, befriending a Ukrainian guard with vodka.         "Once he was talking to me when a little girl appeared at a window," she wrote. "He raised his gun, shot her and carried on talking to me. I picked up a child, said goodbye to him and walked away -- only I didn't know how to hold the child so that it wouldn't be hit if the Ukrainian shot at me."         At the hospital, toward the end, "corpses and living all lay together" as soldiers killed some patients and ordered others to the death camps. A nurse pleaded with Dr. Szwajger to inject the nurse's bedridden mother with a lethal dose of morphine.         The doctor agreed. She also decided -- and this secret she kept for 45 years -- to carry out euthanasia on some of the children. In the infants' ward, she spoonfed each of them a fatal dose of morphine.         "Just as, during those two years of real work in the hospital, I had bent down over the little beds," she wrote, "so now I poured this last medicine into those tiny mouths. And downstairs there was screaming because the Germans were already there, taking the sick from the wards to the cattle trucks." 'Why I Was Different'         She told the older children to get into bed, and "this medicine was going to make their pain disappear."         "So they lay down and after a few minutes ----," she wrote. "I don't know how many. But the next time I went into that room, they were asleep. And then I don't know what happened after that."         That memory never left, "and that's why I was always different from everybody else."         Dr. Szwajger's husband, a law student, was killed by the Nazis, who tricked him into turning himself in. Later she became pregnant by a man in the resistance. But she arranged an abortion, and also arranged abortions for three other women, because she was convinced that "children had no right to be born" into such a world.         Dr. Szwajger later married Wladyslaw Swidowski, who died several years ago. She is survived by two daughters, Hanna and Alina, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, all in Poland.       
         Barbara Redmond Ryan, a volunteer for social causes, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 59.         Her husband, Allan A. Ryan 3d, said the cause of death was cancer.         Mrs. Ryan was a member of the women's committee of the Boys' Club of New York for 30 years and served on the club's board for 20 years. She was a co-founder of the committee's Homework Help program, which provides after-school counseling for underprivileged youth.         She was an active member of the Zoological Society of New York and of the New York Junior League, and a longtime organizer of Les Boutiques de Noel, which raises funds for Cancer Care, the Children's Aid Society and other organizations.         Mrs. Ryan, a native New Yorker, graduated from Vassar College in 1955.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Melissa and Sally, both of Manhattan; a son, Allan A. 4th, of Palm Beach, Fla.; her mother, Frances Jones Redmond of Essex, Conn.; a sister, Jean Cushing of Riverside, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Constance Ford, an actress who appeared for 25 years in the role of Ada Hobson, an indestructably upbeat mother in the NBC daytime serial "Another World," died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, said Murray Schapiro, her business manager.         Ms. Ford was born in the Bronx and graduated from St. Barnabas Grammar and High School. Later, she attended Hunter College.         She made her Broadway debut as the prostitute in the original 1949 production of Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman." Her other Broadway credits included "See the Jaguar" with James Dean, "Say Darling," "Golden Fleecing" and "Nobody Loves an Albatross" with Robert Preston.         She also made many appearances on television. For her performances in "Another World," Ms. Ford was awarded a Certificate of Merit for Outstanding Contribution to Daytime Drama by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.         Ms. Ford appeared in a number of films, including "A Summer Place," "Home From the Hill," "Rome Adventure" and "The Caretakers."         There are no survivors.       
         Enid Britten-Stux, who danced with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Ballet de Lyons, died on Jan. 22 at her home in Manhattan. She was 46.         Her brother-in-law, Stefan Stux, said the cause of death was a brain hemorrhage.         Ms. Britten was best known for her work in the mid-1970's with the Ailey company; she stood out for the emotional range of her dancing. Her repertory included the Eve figure in John Butler's "After Eden" and a doomed young lover in Talley Beatty's "Road of the Phoebe Snow," for which she was singled out for the understated, contained quality of her dancing and the driven physicality of the character's panic. She was also praised for her portrayal of Mahalia Jackson in "The Mooche," choreographed by Ailey.         She is survived by her husband, Ivan Stux; her mother, Rosa Aytch of Philadelphia; two sisters, and a brother.       
         Lillian Gish, the last of the great silent film stars, who performed for more than 85 years in movies, theater and television, died in her sleep on Saturday evening at her home in Manhattan. She was 99 years old.         Her personal manager, James E. Frasher, said the cause was heart failure.         "She was the same age as film," Mr. Frasher said. "They both came into the world in 1893."         Miss Gish was still performing as recently as the late 1980's. In 1986, she appeared as Alan Alda's hilariously addled mother in "Sweet Liberty," and in 1987 she was widely praised for her sensitive portrayal of an indomitable old woman in "The Whales of August," which co-starred another movie legend, Bette Davis.  Advocate of an Early Start         "To become an actress, one cannot begin too soon," said Miss Gish, and she meant it, for she had made her acting debut at the age of 5.         Under the guidance of the director D. W. Griffith, Miss Gish became the pre-eminent actress in silent films, appearing in classics like "The Birth of a Nation," "Intolerance," "Broken Blossoms" and "Way Down East."         After performing in dozens of one- and two-reel silent movies (with running times of 10 or 20 minutes) and then in the longer Griffith epics, Miss Gish made a successful transition to the "talkies," and later into television.         Between film and television roles, she also worked on the stage. In 1930 she starred as Helena in Jed Harris's Broadway production of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," and in 1973 she appeared as the nurse in Mike Nichols's revival of the play. She made her last Broadway appearance in 1975, in "A Musical Jubilee."         Especially in her youth, Miss Gish evoked an aura of fragility, and hers was a vulnerable waiflike beauty. The renowned theatrical impresario David Belasco pronounced her "the most beautiful blonde I have ever seen." George Jean Nathan, the Broadway critic who courted Miss Gish without success for more than a decade, compared her to Eleonora Duse.         Miss Gish, though not always in excellent health, was accustomed to hard work and took a no-nonsense view of her physical attributes.         "I didn't care about being a beauty," she said in an interview in 1975. "I wanted to be an actress. When I was in the movies, I didn't care what I looked like, except for that image up there on the screen. I wanted to create beauty when it was necessary; that's an inner thing. But if all you have is a facade, it isn't interesting."         Throughout her life Miss Gish remained singularly devoted to her mother and to her sister, Dorothy, who was younger, but who became an actress at about the same time Lillian did. Mrs. Gish died in 1948 after a long invalidism, and Dorothy Gish died in 1968.         Miss Gish, who never married and who leaves no survivors, finally rejected Mr. Nathan's long series of marriage proposals, and said that a primary reason was his "seeming resentment" of her devotion to her family. She gave another reason for staying single: "Actresses have no business marrying. I always felt that being a successful wife was a 24-hour-a-day job. Besides, I knew such charming men: perhaps I didn't want to disillusion any of them."         Lillian Diana Gish, a daughter of the former Mary Robinson McConnell and James Gish, was born on Oct. 14, 1893, in Springfield, Ohio. The family moved to Baltimore, where Mr. Gish became a partner in a candy store. Before the turn of the century, he abandoned his wife and two daughters. He died in 1911.         Mrs. Gish took her daughters to New York City, rented an apartment on West 34th Street that was large enough to include two boarders, and began working in a department store. When Lillian was 5, a Gish boarder, an actress named Alice Niles, persuaded Mrs. Gish to let her take the child with her to act in a production of "In Convict's Stripes," which played one-night stands across the country. Lillian's salary was $10 a week.         At the age of 4, Dorothy joined another touring troupe; so did Mrs. Gish. The Gishes were separated at least half of each year, and life was lonely for Lillian as she traveled constantly and shared squalid hotel rooms with other company members to save money. More than once, she nearly fell into the hands of Elbridge Gerry's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which was dedicated to protecting children who worked in sweatshop factories as well as on the stage.         When the Gishes were together in New York, they shared quarters with Charlotte Smith, whose daughter Gladys was a bit player on Broadway. Lillian won the role of a dancer, a part that Gladys had hoped for, in Sarah Bernhardt's 1905 engagement on Broadway. She Knew Pickford As Gladys Smith         In 1909, while visiting friends in Baltimore, Lillian and Dorothy dropped in to see a short film called "Lena and the Geese," and immediately recognized its star as Gladys Smith. The next year the sisters showed up at the Biograph film studios in Manhattan, at 11 East 14th Street, and asked to see Miss Smith.         That very day Gladys Smith, who had changed her name to Mary Pickford, introduced the Gishes to D. W. Griffith, who at that time was churning out at least three one-reelers a week for Biograph.         He took the sisters to a rehearsal hall, where he produced a revolver and began to shoot over their heads. He later explained that he wanted to see how they reacted. They evidently passed the fear test, for within hours they were playing small roles in "An Unseen Enemy." Each received $5.         That was the beginning of an artistic collaboration between Lillian Gish and Griffith that lasted more than a decade. During that time Miss Gish appeared in dozens of Griffith's short films and starred in most of his critically and economically successful longer ones.         In some films she played bit parts; in others, she played several roles. Sometimes she was the star. All of Griffith's Biograph actors were moved around in this way: it was not until after the success of "The Birth of a Nation" that any received on-screen credit. One Source of Pride: Doing Own Stunts         Miss Gish was proud of the fact that she became an accomplished horseback rider, and performed her own stunts in dangerous scenes. She also learned to edit film, set up lights and pick costumes, and she directed two films for Biograph, one of which starred her sister, Dorothy.         During most of her years with Griffith, Miss Gish and the rest of the Griffith company of actors and technicians divided their time between New York and Los Angeles. In 1913, when Griffith joined Mutual Productions, Miss Gish, her sister and many other artists at Biograph moved with him. Miss Gish starred in his first Mutual film, "The Battle of the Sexes," in 1914.         Securing financial backing for "The Birth of a Nation," a Civil War epic and a milestone in the history of the motion picture, was a major battle for Griffith, for the movie's costs constantly outstripped the budget estimates. It was said to have cost $300,000.         First released in February 1915, under the title "The Clansman," the film ran an unheard-of two hours and was shown at first in only a handful of road-show theaters, to the musical accompaniment of a 30-piece orchestra. Customers paid $2 to see what soon became known as "The Birth of a Nation." Despite the high admission price, the picture was a great hit.         "In it I played Elsie, the sweet and virginal daughter of the family around which the action was built," Miss Gish said in 1975. "I played so many frail, downtrodden little virgins in the films of my youth that I sometimes think I invented that stereotype of a role."         Miss Gish's role in Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916) was small. Griffith had envisioned the film as his ultimate contribution to the motion-picture art, but he was forced to trim it drastically on the insistence of his creditors. Many other stars of the day, including Constance Talmadge, Bessie Love and Erich von Stroheim, made brief appearances.  Propaganda Films For World War I         During World War I, the Gish sisters went with Griffith to Europe to make propaganda films, among them the immensely successful "Hearts of the World" (1918). By that time, Griffith had joined Adolph Zukor's company, which later became Paramount Pictures.         Hendrick Sartov, the still photographer for "Hearts of the World," eventually became a cinematographer for Griffith and invented for Miss Gish the "Lillian Gish lens," now called a soft-focus lens, which gives its subject a warmly blurred appearance.         In the fall of 1919, Griffith moved his entire company to Mamaroneck, N.Y., where he built his own movie studio on a huge estate. It was there, and on locations in New England, that he filmed Miss Gish's popular melodrama "Way Down East," released in 1920.         Miss Gish wrote in her autobiography that she volunteered to perform the dangerous climactic scene in that film, in which the heroine, lying on the ice floe in a freezing river, is headed for almost certain doom over a waterfall.         The frail-looking Miss Gish lay on the floe, her hair and one of her hands trailing in the frigid water. "My face was caked with a crust of snow and ice, and little spikes formed on my eyelashes, making it difficult to keep my eyes open," she recalled. "It was a delicious scene, one of my really favorites, but I remember being cold for days afterward."         "Orphans of the Storm," a French-Revolution melodrama released in 1922, was Griffith's last financially successful picture and, perhaps not coincidentally, the last Miss Gish made for him. "With all the expenses I have, I can't afford to pay you what you're worth," he told her. "You should go out on your own."         With heavy investments of her own money, she then made two successful movies in Italy, "The White Sister" and "Romola."         In the mid-1920's Miss Gish became embroiled in a long legal battle with Charles Duell, a socialite who had been her financial adviser (and, as she said in 1975, "sort of my Svengali"), over sums he claimed she owed him. Miss Gish munched carrots during the trial, and newspaper photographs of her stirred a carrot-chomping fad across the country.         Americans had become enchanted with the new artistic aristocracy, made up of movie stars like Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino and Miss Gish. Earlier, in a movie, when Miss Gish had pushed up the sides of her mouth with her fingers to demonstrate feigned happiness, the gesture became a much-copied fad. From the Silents To the Talkies         Miss Gish made the transition from silents to talkies in 1930 in "One Romantic Night," with Rod LaRocque and Conrad Nagel. By that time, she had signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. "My contract called for six pictures in two years, for which I was paid, I believe, a million dollars," she wrote.         Miss Gish made a triumphant return to the stage in 1930 in "Uncle Vanya" on Broadway. In 1936 she played Ophelia to John Gielgud's Hamlet and Judith Anderson's Queen Gertrude, and in 1941 she began a record-breaking 66-week run in "Life With Father" in Chicago. In 1960, she starred in "All the Way Home" on Broadway.         As Miss Gish grew older, roles were more difficult to come by, but she played in summer stock and in an occasional movie, like "The Comedians," "The Night of the Hunter" and "The Undefeated." An early recruit to television, she appeared in "Arsenic and Old Lace" with Helen Hayes and in Horton Foote's "Trip to Bountiful."         Commenting on what was to be Miss Gish's last screen performance, in the 1987 "Whales of August," Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times: "There's not a gesture or a line-reading that doesn't reflect her nearly three-quarters of a century in front of a camera. Scenes are not purloined when she's on screen."         Correction:  March 2, 1993, Tuesday         A picture in some copies yesterday with an obituary of Lillian Gish, showing a scene from "Life With Father," was published in error. It showed Dorothy Gish.       
         Ruby Keeler, the innocent-faced tap-dancing sweetheart of nine Warner Brothers musicals in the 1930's, died yesterday morning at her home in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 82 years old.         The cause of death was cancer, said her daughter Kathleen Lowe.         In seven of those musicals, including "42d Street," "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "Footlight Parade," Miss Keeler was teamed with Dick Powell, and they became one of the most popular screen couples of the early 1930's. Among the songs she introduced were "Shuffle Off to Buffalo," "42d Street," "Honeymoon Hotel," "She's a Latin From Manhattan" and "Too Marvelous for Words."  A Comeback at 60         In 1971, 30 years after she had retired from show business, Miss Keeler starred on Broadway in a revival of the 1925 musical "No, No, Nanette." The show, which ran for 871 performances, was among the season's surprise hits and won warm critical notices for its star, whose return to show business at the age of 60 was hailed one of the most remarkable show business comebacks in years.         Miss Keeler was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Aug. 25, 1910, and moved to New York City with her family when she was 4. At the age of 13, after receiving three months of dance instruction, she got her first job in the chorus of the George M. Cohan show "The Rise of Rosie O'Reilly." For the next three years she worked in New York nightclubs, and in 1926, she was discovered at a dance contest by Earl Lindsay, a stage director who cast her in the Broadway revue "Bye, Bye, Bonnie."         At her next Broadway appearance, in the musical "Lucky," she was spotted by Florenz Ziegfeld, who offered her a role in the musical "Whoopee," starring Eddie Cantor. But before rehearsals began, she went to Los Angeles for a brief stage engagement. There she met Al Jolson, whom she married in 1928. Although signed to star in the Ziegfeld extravaganza "Show Girl," she dropped out of the show during tryouts to join Jolson on the West Coast. Five years later she made her film debut in the movie musical "42d Street."         In the film, which is regarded as the quintessential backstage musical, Miss Keeler played Peggy Sawyer, a smiling young member of the chorus line who takes over for the leading lady on opening night, saves the show, and finds happiness with Billy Lawler (Mr. Powell). Among the numbers she sang were "Shuffle Off to Buffalo" and the title song. Busby Berkeley's Style         The film introduced the elaborately choreographed routines of Busby Berkeley in which dozens of toe-tapping, high-kicking dancers were arranged in fantastic kaleidoscopic designs. After its success, the same formula was applied to "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "Footlight Parade," which also teamed Miss Keeler with Powell, and again had choreography by Berkeley and songs by Harry Warren and Al Dubin.         Miss Keeler went on to star in six more films for Warners before leaving the studio at Jolson's insistence. The films included "Dames" and "Flirtation Walk" (both 1934), "Go Into Your Dance" (her only film with Jolson) and "Shipmates Forever" (both 1935), "Colleen" (1936) and "Ready, Willing and Able" (1937).         "Mother Carey's Chickens" (1938), under a new contract with RKO, was a failure. She made her last film, "Sweetheart of the Campus," in 1941.         In 1940, her marriage to Jolson ended, and she retained custody of their 5-year-old adopted son, Al Jr. The next year, she married John Homer Lowe, a real estate broker in Pasadena, Calif., and retired. They had three daughters and a son.  An Association Spokeswoman         Shortly after her husband's death in 1969, the producer Harry Rigby called Miss Keeler and invited her to return to Broadway in "No, No, Nanette." Her name had been suggested, he said, by Berkeley, the show's production supervisor, who was then 74. Miss Keeler ended up staying with the show for its full two-year run and then touring with it for two more years.         In 1974, Miss Keeler had a brain aneurysm. She later became spokeswoman for the National Stroke Association, which established the Ruby Keeler Fellowship Memorial.         In addition to her daughter Ms. Lowe and her son Al Jolson Jr., she is survived by another son, John Lowe Jr., and two other daughters, Theresa Hall and Christine Pratt.       
         Andrea Boroff Eagan, a journalist, educator, union founder and advocate for women, died on Tuesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 49 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         The interwoven themes of her career were social change, group action, women's rights, health and writing. Her causes grew from beliefs she formed as a campus activist in the turbulent protests of the 1960's.         In a celebrated moment during the Columbia University protests in 1968, she and Richard Eagan were unofficially married in a seized building. A chaplain pronounced them "children of the New Age." They were later legally married by that same chaplain.  Feminist Advice for Girls         Drawing on her personal experiences, Ms. Eagan wrote the first feminist advice book for teen-age girls, "Why Am I So Miserable, if These Are the Best Years of My Life?" (Lippincott, 1976). Later she wrote "The Newborn Mother: Stages of Her Growth" (Little, Brown, 1985), about the psychological changes in women after childbirth.         She also wrote many newspaper and magazine articles, mostly on health and women. She was the editor of the National Women's Health Network Series for Pantheon Books and president of Healthright, a nonprofit organization.         Ms. Eagan was active in local and national efforts for abortion rights and other health and women's issues. She taught about them at New York University and at La Guardia, Manhattan Community and Hunter Colleges.         From 1983 to 1987 she served as the founding president of the National Writers Union, which won contracts for freelance writers at several national magazines. She was also a founding board member of the Writers Room, Manhattan office space for writers free of distractions.         Ms. Eagan, who graduated from Columbia in 1969, reaffirmed her protest-era beliefs in a 1988 interview in The Washington Post: "The fact is, we were absolutely correct in what we perceived as being wrong. We were in error only in that we weren't successful."         Her survivors include her mother, Dorothy Boroff of Manhattan; her husband, Richard, and two daughters, Molly and Daisy, the Tony-award winning child actress in "The Secret Garden."       
         Claire Huchet Bishop, an author of popular children's books and a leading opponent of anti-Semitism, died on Thursday at her home in Paris at the age of 94. She had resided in Manhattan for about 50 years.         The cause of death was a hemorrhage of the aorta, said Mira Felner, a friend.         Mrs. Huchet Bishop began her career following in the footsteps of her grandfather and mother, noted storytellers in her hometown of Le Havre, France. She carried on that tradition in Paris and the United States, then began transcribing her stories. Many Translations         Her resulting books, which won several prizes, have appeared in a dozen languages, and some continue to be reprinted. Two were made into films. Her first book, "The Five Chinese Brothers" (Coward), is being translated to Spanish, 55 years after its original publication.         The persecution of Jewish friends in France in World War II prompted the second theme of Mrs. Huchet Bishop's life. She began writing for children and adults on spiritual issues and became an advocate in efforts for religious and racial harmony.         A Catholic, she was credited with helping win the deletion of anti-Semitic passages from the catechism with her analysis, "How Catholics Look at Jews" (Paulist Press, 1974). In a delegation visiting the Pope in the 1980's, she encouraged formal Vatican recognition of Israel.         She also served as the president of the International Council of Christians and Jews in 1975-77 and of the Jewish-Christian-Fellowship of France from 1968 to 1981.         Mrs. Huchet Bishop was born in Geneva. As a young woman, she discontinued her studies at the Sorbonne to devote more time to storytelling. In 1924 she opened France's first library for children, L'Heure Joyeuse (The Joyous Hour), and served as its director for five years.         She married Frank Bishop, an American concert pianist, and moved to the United States. She was in charge of the children's reading room at the New York Public Library in the mid-1930's and was the children's book editor of Commonweal.         After retelling a fable about Chinese quintuplets with superhuman powers, she decided to write down her version. That led to its publication and her career as an author of about 30 books. Two were runners-up for the Maybery Award, the highest honor for children's books, and she won other awards and citations.         Often her books had serious themes. "Pancakes-Paris" (Viking, 1947) was about food scarcity in wartime France. "Twenty and Ten" (Viking, 1952) told the true story of Christian French youngsters who hid their Jewish playmates from the Nazis. Wonderworks made it into a film, "Miracle at Moreau," for PBS television.         Her husband died in 1944.       
         Masha Tumarkin, who helped institute a new technique for teaching English to upwards of 50,000 recent immigrants in New York City, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 49 and was a Manhattan resident.         The cause of death was leukemia, her family said.         For several years she was the director of the English program for the New York Association for New Americans, a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that aids in resettlement. She employed a system by which students start speaking in English within 12 weeks, when conventional methods often take many months longer. She supervised development of texts and curriculum and teacher retraining.         The concept, developed by her predecessor, Ira Goetz, features a fast-paced, question-and-answer format in which the teacher moves about the classroom from one student to another.         Born in Manhattan to Russian immigrants, Ms. Tumarkin grew up in a bilingual home with relatives and neighbors speaking in accents. After graduating from Columbia, she earned a master's at New York University in teaching English as a second language. She taught English at City College before joining the association in 1980.         Her marriage to Ethan Gologor ended in a divorce that drew publicity for a custody accord in which the children shuttled between the mother's and father's homes on alternating days.         Her survivors include her husband of a year, Richard Girard; two sons, Matthew Gologor of Oberlin, Ohio, and Benjamin Gologor of Manhattan; her mother, Suzanne Tumarkin of Manhattan, and a sister, Nina Tumarkin of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Helen Hayes, the tiny actress whose big-hearted portrayals of Queen Victoria and other regal women helped make her one of the century's best-loved stars, died yesterday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 92 and lived in Nyack.         The cause was heart failure, said John Springer, her longtime press agent and friend. Miss Hayes was admitted to the hospital on March 9 suffering from congestive heart failure and irregular heartbeat.         The human warmth and masterly acting technique that Miss Hayes brought to the stage and screen earned her many triumphs in her long career. She was one of the three great women of the American theater, with Katharine Cornell and Lynn Fontanne, in its glory days of the 1920's and 30's. Lights Dimmed on Broadway         In tribute to the actress, who was often called the First Lady of the American theater, Broadway marquees were dimmed for one minute last night at 8 P.M.         Miss Hayes's greatest stage success was the 1935 drama "Victoria Regina," in which she played the long-lived British monarch from girlhood to widowhood, aging visibly from act to act thanks to the makeup artist's skill, and her own.         Her other stage triumphs included the title roles in "Mary of Scotland" (1933) and "Harriet" (1943), about Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her first great success was in "Coquette" in 1927, and her last was in the 1970 revival of "Harvey."         Miss Hayes won an Academy Award for best actress for her first major film role, in "The Sin of Madelon Claudet" (1931). She went on to star in screen hits including "Arrowsmith" (1931) opposite Ronald Colman, "A Farewell to Arms" (1932) with Gary Cooper, and "Night Flight" (1933), in which she joined John Barrymore in an all-star cast. In 1971 she won a second Oscar, as best supporting actress, for "Airport."         With her bright eyes and elfin smile, Miss Hayes's looks were highly winsome, and through sheer grace and stagecraft she was able to convey an impression of downright beauty when she chose. Although she was only 5 feet tall and weighed a mere 100 pounds, she could also create an aura of strength and weight and splendor if a role required one.         "Tremulously magnificent" was the way Brooks Atkinson, as drama critic of The New York Times, described her opening-night performance in "Victoria Regina." "Since the Queen is dead, God rest her soul," he wrote, "let the cheers go to her actress, who deserves all the homage the town contains."         And audiences did cheer, again and again over the years, partly because of Miss Hayes's skill and versatility -- she performed comedy and drama with equal skill -- and partly because her warmheartedness always put them on her side. An Active Role In Public Life         Once Miss Hayes was established as a great star, she threw herself into many areas of public life. She was president of the American Theater Wing and the American National Theater and Academy and was the national chairwoman of women's activities for the March of Dimes. She was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church, was denied its sacraments after marrying the playwright Charles MacArthur -- who had been divorced -- and returned to the church after his death in 1956. In 1979, she received an award from the Catholic Interracial Council of New York for her work "to combat racial and religious bigotry and discrimination in our society."         Her own view of her success and eminence was modest. "Without the compensation of glamour, I am hard put to explain the durability of my career and the loyalty of the audience," she wrote in "On Reflection," a volume of memoirs published in 1968.         "Perhaps it is just identification," she went on. "I was once the typical daughter, then the easily recognizable wife, and then the quintessential mother. I seem always to have reminded people of someone in their family. Perhaps I am just the triumph of Plain Jane." Hard Work And Unworldliness         Hers was also a triumph of hard work. Over the years she became the consummate theater professional, literally down to her toes: early in her career she had a nervous habit of making her body rigid when she felt insecure onstage, but she eventually trained herself to work off her tension less conspicuously, by simply curling her toes.         Even after she became well known, Miss Hayes remained somewhat unsophisticated and shy in private, although her husband was a high-living sophisticate who cut a dashing figure in cafe society.         When she was in her late 20's and already a stage veteran, the producer Jed Harris remarked after talking to her that she was ignorant, but he later said admiringly that "as an actress, her instinct was always perfect."         Miss Hayes liked to tell stories about her own unworldliness. There was the time, for instance, when her husband took her to call on the writer Gertrude Stein and Miss Stein's friend Alice B. Toklas in their Paris home. Although the walls were decorated with fine paintings, Miss Hayes later recalled, "Nothing impressed me more than Alice B. Toklas's mustache."         One long-ago day in Hollywood, as Miss Hayes told it, Clark Gable sent her "a mash note" -- evidently inviting her to an assignation -- but she ignored it. Years later he went backstage to see her, gave a dimpled smile and said, "You were too shy, weren't you, Helen?"         Simplicity and virtue were Miss Hayes's by birthright, along with a yearning for the stage. Helen Hayes Brown was born on Oct. 10, 1900, in Washington, the only child of Francis Van Arnum Brown, a pork and poultry salesman, and Catherine Estelle Hayes Brown, a sometime actress who remained stagestruck all her life. Catherine Brown was a great-niece of an Irish-born singer, Catherine Hayes, who was known as "the Swan of Erin" in California in the Gold Rush days.         Helen did her first acting barely after her days as a toddler, when she was known in her family as "the white mouse." It was a part in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Holy Cross Academy, a Washington school that emphasized theatricals. She also did some singing at galas organized by her dancing school, Miss Minnie Hawke's School of Dance. When she was 6 years old, Lew Fields, a producer and star of musical comedies, heard one of her singing performances and was impressed.         Mrs. Brown was delighted to encourage her daughter as a performer, and soon afterward Helen made her professional stage debut in a local stock production of "The Prince Chap." She also appeared in summer stock in subsequent years. Meeting Destiny At the Age of 8         Deciding that her daughter was destined for an upper-crust life, Mrs. Brown took in washing to pay for French lessons to supplement the curriculum of the Sacred Heart Academy in Washington, where Helen was enrolled. Thus prepared, mother and daughter, then 8 years old, took the train to New York and waited outside Mr. Fields's office. Then destiny beckoned: he emerged, remembered Helen and signed her for a principal role in Victor Herbert's "Old Dutch" at the old Herald Square Theater.         She went on to appear in several other stage productions overseen by Mr. Fields, and she began her film career in an early "quickie," "Jean and the Calico Doll," made in the old Vitagraph Studio in Brooklyn.         At the age of 13 she was hired to perform with the renowned John Drew in a romantic comedy, "The Prodigal Husband," produced by Charles Frohman, which opened in 1914 at the old Empire Theater at 40th Street and Broadway. The play was undistinguished, but Miss Hayes shone.         Mr. Frohman, one of the titans of the theater, went down with the Lusitania in 1915 and so was not able to quash the false rumors -- which circulated for years -- that Miss Hayes was actually his illegitimate daughter by Maude Adams, a stage star of the day. "No one knows where these canards get their start," Miss Hayes wrote in "On Reflection." "I only know that they are hard to finish off."         After graduating from the Sacred Heart Academy back in Washington, she went on at the age of 20 to win her first star billing, for her part as a flapper in the play "Bab," which opened in New York in 1920. But as she later recalled, "On opening night, I gave one of those shrill, tense performances that became a hazard in my career whenever I was not in top form."         She was crushed when the reviewer Heywood Broun criticized her acting, dismissing her as "cute," which is what the critics kept calling her for years. A columnist once said she suffered from "fallen archness."         To forestall such complaints, Miss Hayes worked hard at improving her voice and delivery and tried to make her performances consistent. She also worked hard at seeming taller. "My posture became military," she later recalled. "I became the tallest five-foot woman in the world."         By the mid-20's, she was highly popular as a light comedian, despite critical ups and downs, and she caught the eye of Mr. Harris, the producer, with her poignant performance in the 1926 revival of the James M. Barrie comedy "What Every Woman Knows."         Years later, Mr. Harris reported, "Her subtlety and power astounded me; I thought she could do anything." He chose her for the leading role in the 1927 play "Coquette," about a well-born Southern girl, made pregnant by a hillbilly, who kills herself. Other theater people had doubts about casting Miss Hayes in the part, but when the curtain rang down on opening night, she received thunderous applause.         "I have never seen anything quite like the ovation Miss Hayes received that night," Mr. Harris said later. After 16 curtain calls, "the applause was still as strong and solid as it had been when the curtain fell."  Emeralds, Peanuts And a Lifelong Love         It was in a glittering New York salon that Miss Hayes, still rather shy, met Mr. MacArthur. In her best-selling 1990 autobiography, "My Life in Three Acts," written with Katherine Hatch, she recalled: "I picked up a glass of sherry to fit in and retreated to a secluded niche. Twenty minutes later, a good-looking fellow with curly brown hair and sparkling green eyes came over, maybe because he felt sorry for me sitting there all alone. He held out a small paper bag. 'Wanna peanut?' he asked. 'Thanks,' I said. He poured a few in my hand and said, 'I wish they were emeralds.' Right then and there I fell in love."         (That story was told so often in later years that he once said, "There ought to be a statute of limitations on lovelorn remarks." And in 1945, returning from a sojourn in India, he dropped a sack of emeralds in her lap and said, "I wish they were peanuts.")         The complex courtship that ensued -- Mr. MacArthur was married at the time -- came to a suspenseful culmination on the summer night in 1928 when his raffish play of newspaper life, "The Front Page," opened in New York. Miss Hayes was still appearing in "Coquette," but Mr. Harris closed the show for that day so she could watch the first night of "The Front Page."         "I was nervous," Miss Hayes recalled years later. "I knew Charlie wouldn't marry me unless he had a hit."         She took a seat in the balcony while the nervous Mr. MacArthur and his co-author, Ben Hecht, sat on a fire escape outside.         "A few minutes into the first act I knew we were in," Miss Hayes wrote in "My Life." "The Tribune critic was chuckling and pounding his companion on the back. The audience was breaking up with laughter. I ran to the fire escape and shouted, 'It's a hit!' Whereupon Charlie opened his arms and asked, 'Will you marry me, Helen?' "         Soon afterward his divorce came through, they wed (Harpo Marx sent the bride a Steinway piano crate filled with gardenias) and in all the rest of her life, Miss Hayes wrote, "I never loved another man."         Miss Hayes gave birth to her daughter, Mary, in February 1930. Later that year she acted in "Mr. Gilhooley," a flop, and "Petticoat Influence," which was only a moderate success, as was "The Good Fairy" in 1931.         Then Miss Hayes acted in her first Hollywood film, "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," a sob story that was notably teary even by Hollywood standards. She played Madelon, a woman who made degrading sacrifices so that her illegitimate son could become a doctor. Her First Queen: 'Mary of Scotland'         When Miss Hayes returned to Broadway in "Mary of Scotland," she was such a box-office draw that for many months it was difficult to buy tickets; the Maxwell Anderson drama, about the 16th-century Mary Queen of Scots, was a tremendous hit. Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times: "Slight as she is in stature (and Mary was six feet tall), Miss Hayes raises herself to queendom by the transcendence of her spirit."         She did even better in "Victoria Regina." Mr. Atkinson said her ability "to encompass in one evening the youth, maturity and venerability of one human being" was "a humbling personal triumph."         After some disappointing roles, Miss Hayes was again the toast of Broadway in "Harriet." She also won praise for her acting in Anita Loos's robustly commercial "Happy Birthday" (1946), and, after appearing in Josh Logan's disappointing "Wisteria Trees" (1950), she came back strong in Mary Chase's farce "Mrs. McThing" (1952) and also won praise for her part in the revival of Thornton Wilder's "Skin of Our Teeth" that opened at the ANTA Theater (now the Virginia) in 1955.         In her later years, she appeared on television and undertook repertory with the APA-Phoenix company in works ranging from Sheridan to Pirandello to George Kelly. She also had parts in several Walt Disney films, including "One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing" (1975).         In "My Life" Miss Hayes recalled deciding to retire from the stage in 1972, while she was performing in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" in Washington. "My career had begun in Washington and it would end there," she wrote. "I liked the idea of a circle being completed." An Epitaph Written Onstage         Her stage career also inspired another valedictory touch. In 1990 she told an audience of female journalists in Hollywood about a scene in "Victoria Regina" in which a tough-looking man bursts through a police line at Queen Victoria's 90th-birthday celebration and yells: "Go it, old girl. You've done well."         Miss Hayes told the journalists, "I've always meant, since I heard that line, to have it put on my tombstone."         Along with her achievements, Miss Hayes had great sadnesses in her life. Her daughter, Mary, a novice actress, died of polio in 1949, and Miss Hayes then spoke and wrote movingly of her grief. In her 1990 book she wrote that her own husband, Mr. MacArthur, "set about killing himself" with drink after Mary's death. "It took seven years," Miss Hayes wrote, "and it was harrowing to watch."         Earlier, in 1938, Miss Hayes and her husband adopted a son, James MacArthur, when he was 7 months old. He grew up to be a television actor, best known for the series "Hawaii Five-O." She is survived by Mr. MacArthur, of Palm Desert, Calif., and three grandchildren.         During her career, Miss Hayes received Emmy, Tony and other awards for her stage performances, and honorary degrees from Smith College, Princeton, Columbia and Fordham Universities and other institutions. President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, presented her with the nation's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1986. She was also a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1981.         Miss Hayes was further honored by having various institutions and programs named for her, notably the annual Helen Hayes Awards, given for artistic achievement in the professional theater in Washington, and the Helen Hayes Theater in Manhattan. In 1955, the Fulton Theater on West 46th Street was named in her honor. When that theater, along with the Morosco, was torn down in 1982 to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel, angering many theater professionals and preservationists, Miss Hayes declined the hotel developers' request to name the new theater within the hotel for her. Instead, the Little Theater, an older theater on West 44th Street, was renamed the Helen Hayes. Performances Of a Lifetime         In more than 60 years on stage and screen, Helen Hayes tried her hand at a constellation of roles, playing flappers and flibbertigibbets, matrons and monarchs. Here is a selected list of her credits.

         Joyce Carey, a British stage actress known for her performances in plays by Noel Coward, died on Feb. 28 at a London hospital. She was 94 and lived in London.         Miss Carey came from a theatrical family. Her mother, Lilian Braithwaite, was a star on the London stage, and her father, Gerald Lawrence, was a matinee idol who began his acting career as a juvenile in the company of Sir Henry Irving. In 1916, Miss Carey appeared as Princess Katherine in an all-female production of "Henry V." She made her professional debut in a revival of "Mr. Wu" and went on to play ingenue roles. In the 1920's she appeared in numerous Shakespeare plays and drawing-room comedies.         Miss Carey first met Coward, the dominant artistic influence on her career, at a dress rehearsal for his play "The Vortex" in 1924, when she went backstage to compliment the cast. When Coward's "Easy Virtue" opened in New York the next year, Miss Carey played a leading role, which she repeated when the show went to London.         In 1927 she appeared on Broadway in "The Road to Rome," and she spent the next seven years acting on the New York stage. She returned to London to perform in Coward's "Tonight at 8:30," and went on to act in a string of Coward plays over the next two decades, including "Present Laughter," "This Happy Breed," "Quadrille" and "Nude With Violin." She also appeared in several Coward films, among them "In Which We Serve," "Blithe Spirit," "The Astonished Heart" and, most memorably, as the manager of the train-station buffet in "Brief Encounter." Her other films included "The Way to the Stars" and "Cry, the Beloved Country." Nom de Plume         In 1934 she took a small role in "Sweet Aloes," a comedy about a young woman who has a trouble-filled affair with a nobleman. The author, listed as Jay Mallory, was in fact Miss Carey. The play ran for more than a year.         As she grew older, Miss Carey made a specialty of foolish aunts, disgruntled widows and elderly aristocrats, notably in Oscar Wilde's "Importance of Being Earnest" and "Ideal Husband.".         Miss Carey, who never married, continued acting on the stage right through her 80's, appearing with Peter O'Toole in Shaw's "Man and Superman" and "Pygmalion." At 90, she played an elderly lady facing eviction in "No. 27," a BBC play written by Michael Palin. She also made one of her final stage appearances in the rarely performed Coward comedy "Semi-Monde."         Miss Carey was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1982.       
         Irene Claire Fromer, a retired teacher and artist, died on Tuesday at Doctors Hospital on Staten Island. She was 70 and lived on Staten Island and in St. Croix, V.I.         Her death was a result of a myocardial flu virus, said her husband of nearly 50 years, Dr. Stephen Fromer.         Mrs. Fromer, a graduate of Hunter College, earned a master's degree at Columbia University with a thesis on Herman Melville and the industrial revolution. She taught in the public schools and at one time worked for Merck & Company, writing abstracts on new drugs.         She was an expert in Haitian art and had some of her own work -- paintings, collages and sculptures -- shown at several exhibitions. Together with her husband, she worked at Medical Consultants V.I. in St. Croix, advising doctors on office management.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Fromer is survived by a son, Dr. Carl H., of Staten Island; a daughter, Dr. Sandra A. Stingle of Manhattan; her mother, Bella Siegel of Staten Island; a brother, Jack Siegel of New Rochelle, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Kate Reid, an actress whose hundreds of roles included starring onstage in "Death of a Salesman," in the film "Atlantic City" and in television episodes of "Dallas," died on Saturday at her home in Stratford, Ontario. She was 62.         The cause of death was cancer, said her agent, Richard Schmenner.         For more than 40 years she was staple of stage, movies and television in the United States, Canada and Britain. A 1984 New York Times profile said, "Kate Reid may not be a household name to the general public, but she is to the theater industry, which knows her as an actress who works constantly."         Perhaps her most widely praised performance was as the wife of Dustin Hoffman's Willy Loman in the acclaimed revival of "Death of a Salesman" on Broadway in 1984 and for television in 1985.         "In the problematic role of the mother, Kate Reid is miraculously convincing," Frank Rich wrote in The Times, adding that "she somehow melds affection with pure steel." Richard Schickel said in Time magazine that her performance was "in its way as awesome as Hoffman's." A String of Nominations         Twice she was nominated for Tony Awards, first for co-starring with Alec Guinness in "Dylan" in 1964, then for her performance in "Slapstick Tragedy" on Broadway in 1965.         She was also twice nominated for Emmy Awards, for playing Queen Victoria in "The Invincible Mr. Disraeli" in 1963, then Mary Todd Lincoln in "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" in 1964. Both were "Hallmark Hall of Fame" productions.         In the 1981 film "Atlantic City," she won high marks for her portrayal of the reclusive, aging former beauty queen and sometime paramour of the small-time mobster played by Burt Lancaster.         Ms. Reid, whose voice was described as cello-toned, once said: "I'm a chameleon. There is something of everything I play in me."         Her stage work included many Shakespearean parts, especially at the Stratford Festival in Canada in the 1960's. Major Roles on Broadway         In her Broadway debut in 1962, she was praised for her performance as Martha in the matinee cast of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" In 1968, she co-starred in "The Price," by Arthur Miller. She played Big Mama in the 1974 revival of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Elizabeth Ashley, Keir Dullea and Fred Gwynne.         Her films include "The Andromeda Strain" (1971), "A Delicate Balance" (1973) and "Equus" (1977). Her many television roles included recurring appearances in "Dallas" as Aunt Lil Trotter.         Miss Reid was born in London and grew up in Toronto. She began acting while attending Havergal College, the University of Toronto and the Toronto Conservatory of Music, then formally studied acting under Uta Hagen at the Herbert Berghof Studio in New York City.         Her marriages to Michael Sadlier and Austin Willis ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son, Reid Willis of Edmonton, Alberta, and a daughter, Robin Willis of Manhattan.       
         Katherine Hynes de Groot, an English-born theater and television actress, died on Saturday at the Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. Ms. de Groot, who was 88, had been a resident of the Actors Fund Retirement Home in Englewood for the last six months.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Fiona Rhodes of Laguna Beach, Calif.         Ms. de Groot was born in a suburb of London and studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and appeared in British productions beside John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Tyrone Guthrie.         Her first performance in the United States was in "Lovers and Friends," with Katherine Cornell and Raymond Massey. Later, she appeared on Broadway in Bernard Shaw's "Apple Cart," with Maurice Evans; Sean O'Casey's "Red Roses for Me," with Kevin McCarthy, and "Point of No Return," with Henry Fonda.         She also appeared on television in several dramas by Paddy Chayefsky, including "The Mother" and "The Catered Affair."         After being selected by Moss Hart for the role of Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper, in "My Fair Lady," she toured with the National Company in the United States and the Soviet Union from 1956 to 1962.         In 1970, Ms. de Groot retired from acting to assist her husband, the food and wine expert Roy Andries de Groot, who died in 1983. The couple lived for many years in the Bleecker Gardens in Greenwich Village. Their first daughter, Christina, died of a heart ailment at the age of 26.       
         Barbara Stoler Miller, chairwoman of the Asian and Middle Eastern Cultures Department at Barnard College, died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center yesterday. She was 52 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, said Beverly Solochek, spokeswoman for the college.         A member of the Barnard faculty since 1968, she was the Samuel R. Milbank Professor of Asian and Middle Eastern Culture. Professor Miller was best known for translations of Sanskrit literature, including "The Bhagavad-Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War" (Bantam Books and Columbia University Press, 1986).         She was also an adviser to Peter Brooks on "The Mahabharata," performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1987 and broadcast on public television.         Her first marriage, to Dr. James Robert Miller, ended in divorce.         Surviving are her husband, Max Greenwood; a daughter, Gwenn Miller; her mother, Sarah Stoler of Stowe, Vt.; a brother, Will Stoler, of Montpelier, Vt., and her sister, Ann Stoler of Ann Arbor, Mich.       
         Nancy Quinn, the artistic director of Young Playwrights, an award-winning program dedicated to developing the talents of young writers, died on Saturday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 46.         The cause was a heart attack, said Sheri M. Goldhirsch, the managing director of Young Playwrights.         Ms. Quinn was born in Salinas, Calif. She grew up in Larchmont, N.Y., and graduated from Finch College in Manhattan. She began her career as an assistant to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Charles Gordone during the production of "No Place to Be Somebody" at the Public Theater.         For the next 25 years, she worked with other young playwrights, first as coordinator of the National Playwrights Conference at the O'Neill Center in Waterford, Conn.,, then as associate producer at Arena Stage in Washington.         Ms. Quinn joined Young Playwrights in 1987. As producing director, then artistic director, she oversaw the group's annual Young Playwrights Festival. Under her guidance, submissions for the Festival, which features the work of three to five young playwrights each year, have increased from 600 entries a year to almost 950 this year.         Ms. Quinn also developed programs to reach into New York City's poorer neighborhoods. One, "Take a Grown-Up to the Theater," gives free tickets to students and lets them take an adult along. Another, the Young Playwrights Tour, takes plays to schools and youth centers throughout New York City.         At her death, Ms. Quinn had been working with Helios Productions to develop a series of "Schoolbreak Specials" written by Young Playwrights Festival alumni for CBS television.         She is survived by her husband, Paul King; her mother, Kathleen Quinn of Larchmont; a sister, Patricia Quinn of Los Angeles, and a brother, Michael, also of Los Angeles.       
         Marian Anderson, whose velvety contralto and dignified, affecting stage manner melted the hearts of music lovers around the world, and whose determination helped shatter racial barriers in the arts, died yesterday in Portland, Ore. She was 96.         She died at the home of her nephew, the conductor James DePreist. Lee Walter, a friend of the singer, gave the cause as congestive heart failure a month after a stroke.         Miss Anderson's achievements, which inspired generations of young black performers, included a concert before 75,000 listeners at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939 arranged by Eleanor Roosevelt after the Daughters of the American Revolution denied the singer the use of the concert hall in their national headquarters. And when she made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1955, she became the first black singer to perform there.         The soprano Leontyne Price, one of the first artists to benefit from Miss Anderson's efforts, said yesterday, "Her example of professionalism, uncompromising standards, overcoming obstacles, persistence, resiliency and undaunted spirit inspired me to believe that I could achieve goals that otherwise would have been unthought of."         In 1989, when a group of musicians that included Isaac Stern, Jessye Norman and Julius Rudel put together a concert to raise money for the Marian Anderson Award, a prize given to young singers as an honor to its namesake, Donal Henahan wrote in The New York Times, "Miss Anderson's place as a high priestess of American musicians, whatever their color, is not to be denied." Bigotry on a Daily Level         But Miss Anderson had to fight hard to win her place in American music history. Although she won first prize in a voice contest in New York in 1925 and made an appearance that year with the New York Philharmonic at Lewisohn Stadium, she was unable to find operatic engagements, and within a few years her career came to a standstill. It was only after she toured Europe to great acclaim in the early 1930's that the American public began to pay attention to her.         Even after her artistry was recognized in her homeland, she faced racial prejudice on a more mundane level. Well into her career, she was turned away at restaurants and hotels. Even America's opera houses remained closed to her until Rudolf Bing invited her to sing at the Met near the end of her career.         Because opera was denied her for most of her career, Miss Anderson's reputation rests on the considerable communicative power that she brought to the recital stage. Her manner -- closed eyes, very few gestures -- conveyed stateliness and inner serenity. And her repertory covered considerable ground, from Bach and Handel oratorio selections to Schubert, Brahms, Schumann and Rachmaninoff songs, Verdi arias and spirituals.         Her recordings of standard concert works, most notably Schubert's "Ave Maria," were prized for the radiant beauty of her interpretations. But one of her real achievements was in emphasizing that spirituals deserved a place in the active repertory, something she demonstrated with sublime readings of "My Lord, What a Morning" and "Crucifixion," which were the centerpieces of many programs.  Sang at Age 3         "They are my own music," she once said. "But it is not for that reason that I love to sing them. I love them because they are truly spiritual in quality; they give forth the aura of faith, simplicity, humility and hope."         During her career, Miss Anderson gave her date of birth as Feb. 17, 1902, but June Goodman, a longtime friend of hers, said that while going through some family papers recently, she found Miss Anderson's birth certificate, which gave the date as Feb. 27, 1897. Miss Anderson was born in Philadelphia, the oldest of three children. Her father died when she was a child, and her mother took in laundry to support the family. She began singing when she was 3 years old; when she was 6 she joined the choir at the Union Baptist Church and impressed the director by learning all the parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass -- in the hymns the choir sang.         She did not have her first formal lessons until she was 15 and began studying with Mary S. Patterson. Her church choir raised money to pay for her lessons, and the Philadelphia Choral Society, a black ensemble, gave a benefit performance to support further studies with Agnes Reifsnyder and Giuseppe Boghetti.         In 1925, Mr. Boghetti entered his pupil in a New York Philharmonic voice competition, in which she competed with 300 singers and won first prize. She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic on Aug. 27, 1925, and was immediately signed by a concert manager. But after a Town Hall recital and a handful of concerts, her engagements dwindled. By 1930, she decided to go to Europe, not only in search of performance opportunities, but in the hope of perfecting her command of languages and devoting further study to the art of lieder singing.         Her performances in Europe were great successes. During a Scandinavian tour in 1930 she met the composer Jean Sibelius, who spoke glowingly of her voice and dedicated the song "Solitude" to her. And when she ended a 1935 tour in Salzburg, Arturo Toscanini told her, "A voice like yours is heard once in a hundred years."  Persuaded to Return         The impresario Sol Hurok heard Miss Anderson sing in Paris that same year, and offered to present her in another Town Hall recital. She had misgivings, having received so much more enthusiastic a reception in Europe than in the United States. But Mr. Hurok persuaded her, and he remained her manager for the rest of her career.         Miss Anderson's return to Town Hall on Dec. 30, 1935, was the success that Hurok told her it would be. "Let it be said from the outset," Howard Taubman wrote in The Times, "Marian Anderson has returned to her native land one of the great singers of our time."         In the late 1930's, she gave about 70 recitals a year in the United States. But her fame did not entirely eradicate the prejudice she confronted as a young black singer touring the United States. It was a particularly unfortunate display of that prejudice, however, that helped make Miss Anderson a household name. In 1939, Hurok tried to book her at Constitution Hall in the national headquarters of the D.A.R., and was told that all dates were taken.         When Hurok took his singer's case to the public, Eleanor Roosevelt, the First Lady, resigned from the D.A.R., and other prominent women followed suit. Harold L. Ickes, the Secretary of the Interior, offered Miss Anderson the Lincoln Memorial for a concert on Easter Sunday 1939. Some 75,000 people attended the concert, and millions more listened to the radio broadcast. Photographs and films of Miss Anderson singing in front of Lincoln's statue, before the enormous crowd, quickly became a poignant symbol for the nascent civil rights movement.  Noncombative Personality         During the dispute, Miss Anderson maintained the quiet dignity for which she was famous. Refusing to comment or to express any rancor when reporters pressed her for a response, she later wrote in "My Lord, What a Morning," her memoir, "I particularly did not want to say anything about the D.A.R. As I have made clear, I did not feel that I was designed for hand-to-hand combat."         Four years later, the D.A.R. invited Miss Anderson to take part in a China Relief concert at Constitution Hall. "When I finally walked onto the stage of Constitution Hall," she said later, "I felt no different than I had in other halls. There was no sense of triumph. I felt that it was a beautiful concert hall and I was very happy to sing there."         Miss Anderson continued to tour as a recitalist, but made no headway in the opera world until Mr. Bing invited her to sing Ulrica in Verdi's "Ballo in Maschera." She made her debut on Jan. 7, 1955.         "The curtain rose on the second scene," Miss Anderson said later about the evening, "and I was there on stage, mixing the witch's brew. I trembled, and when the audience applauded and applauded before I could sing a note, I felt myself tightening into a knot."         It did not matter that at 57 she was past her vocal prime. As Howard Taubman noted in his review in The Times, "men as well as women were dabbing at their eyes" during the tumultuous ovation. Toured for State Department         In 1957, the State Department sponsored a 10-week tour of India and the Far East in which Miss Anderson sang 24 concerts in 14 countries. A CBS News crew accompanied her, and the film was used in "The Lady From Philadelphia," a program in Edward R. Murrow's "See It Now" series.         She sang at President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration in 1957, and at President John F. Kennedy's in 1961, and later that year for American troops in Berlin. She toured Australia for the first time in 1962, and in October 1964 began her farewell tour, at Constitution Hall, and gave her last recital at Carnegie Hall on April 18, 1965. She made occasional stage appearances in the 1970's, as the reader in Aaron Copland's "Lincoln Portrait."         Late in her life Miss Anderson was frequently honored. She was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, and in 1978 was in the first group of artists to receive Kennedy Center Honors. In 1980, the United States Treasury Department coined a half-ounce gold commemorative medal with her likeness, and in 1984 she was the first recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award of the City of New York. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan awarded her the National Arts Medal.         Miss Anderson married Orpheus H. Fisher, an architect, in 1943; he died in 1986. They had no children. The singer spent her retirement at her farm, which she named Marianna, in Danbury, Conn., and although in her last years she had to use a wheelchair, she was occasionally seen at concerts in New York City. In July 1992 she moved to Portland to live with her nephew, Mr. DePreist, who is her only survivor.         In the late 1950's, when Miss Anderson began to wind down her singing career, she pursued several other interests. President Eisenhower appointed her an alternative representative in the United States delegation to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations. She gave benefit concerts for the Congress of Racial Equality, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the America-Israel Cultural Foundation. And she sang again at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.         She also made a point of helping young singers, particularly through the Marian Anderson Awards, which she started when the city of Philadelphia awarded her the $10,000 Bok Prize in 1943. Eventually the prize fund ran out of money, but since its re-establishment in 1990 it dispenses $25,000 annually. She was also associated with Young Audiences, an organization that presents school concerts with professional musicians.         In addition to direct involvement and encouragement, she was also, of course, a role model for the black musicians who followed her.         "At age 10 I heard, for the first time, the singing of Marian Anderson on a recording," the soprano Jessye Norman once said. "I listened, thinking, 'This can't be just a voice, so rich and beautiful.' It was a revelation. And I wept."       
         Maria Tolstoy, a professor of Russian language and a granddaughter of the novelist Leo Tolstoy, died on Monday at home in Manhattan. She was 85.         She had a brief illness, said Cynthia Whittaker, a friend.         Ms. Tolstoy fled her native Russia after the Bolshevik revolution, resettled in Czechoslovakia, then left there in 1939 to escape the Nazis and World War II.         Arriving by ship in America in 1940, she said, "I believe, with my grandfather, that every person, every country, has a right to freedom." She helped Soviet and German emigres publish political material, worked on foreign broadcasts of Radio Liberty and assisted the United States Army.         Ms. Tolstoy, whose mother was Irish, was fluent in both English and Russian. Her parents met when her father visited Ireland to buy race horses. Active in Politics         She taught Russian at Cornell, Columbia and Indiana Universities, at the University of Michigan and at Hunter College. She retired from Hunter in 1980 but continued tutoring students the rest of her life.         Ms. Tolstoy was active in American politics as a Republican but also supported Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and was state co-chairwoman of Republicans for Cuomo.         She was also known for her published Russian poetry on the solitude of the emigre. With the recent fall of Communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, she expressed interest in a return visit to her native country but was too frail to make the trip.         Ms. Tolstoy left the Soviet Union in 1925 at the age of 17. She completed her studies for a doctorate in Slavic linguistics at Charles University in Prague, but the Nazis shut down the school before it granted the degree.         Her marriage to Vladimir Mansvetov ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Tatiana Benetkova of Prague, and two grandchildren.       
         Pat Nixon, the quiet consort who stood by her husband, Richard M. Nixon, in the White House and out, through victory, defeat, sorrow and illness, died yesterday at their home in Park Ridge, N.J. She was 81.         Mrs. Nixon, who had been ill for several years, died of lung cancer, said Kim Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Nixon family.         She said former President Nixon and the Nixons' two daughters, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, were with Mrs. Nixon when she died at 5:45 A.M. She also said that Mr. Nixon, who visited Russia in February and China in April, was "in excellent health as evidenced by his recent travel schedule."         Commenting on Mrs. Nixon's death, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said, "Pat Nixon was an extraordinarily supportive First Lady, particularly good in her judgment of people."         Former President Ronald Reagan issued a statement that Mrs. Nixon was "a pillar of great strength during a time of turmoil." Dislike of Politics         On the eve of Richard Nixon's inauguration as President in 1969, Pat Nixon was asked if she had ever encouraged her husband to enter politics.         "No," she replied. "I did not. Politics was not what I would have chosen for him because, after all, you don't see as much of your husband as you would like and it's a hard life."         But, she went on, Mr. Nixon was convinced that politics was his duty.         "What could I do?" she said.         What Mrs. Nixon did was subjugate her instinct for privacy and homemaking and become her husband's faithful companion in his turbulent years in the political arena, from the happy early years after his election as United States Representative from California in 1946 until his humiliating resignation as President of the United States in August 1974, under the shadow of impeachment proceedings that grew out of the Watergate scandals.         In Mr. Nixon's years as Representative, Senator, Vice President, candidate for governor of California, Presidential candidate and President, his wife was a fixture at his side, always seeming to listen raptly to his speeches and maintaining a gracious, if thin, smile.         In 1968, the writer Gloria Steinem interviewed Mrs. Nixon aboard an airplane while she was accompanying her husband on the Presidential campaign.  In the New York magazine article, Ms. Steinem quoted Mrs. Nixon as saying: "Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I've stayed interested in people, I've kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank-you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I've never had it easy. I'm not like all you . . . all those people who had it easy." Image as President's Wife         Although her years before the public exceeded those of her two predecessors at the White House, Mrs. Nixon did not seem to stamp her personality on the nation's consciousness. Instead, her image was of a private, dutiful wife seemingly self-contained and impenetrable.         Her composure rarely wavered in her appearances with her husband in such trying circumstances as his televised Checkers speech in 1952, when he denied unethical use of an $18,000 political fund ("Pat doesn't have a mink coat"), the ordeal in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1958, when a stone-throwing, spitting, anti-American mob besieged the Nixon limousine; and the Nixons' grim, hand-in-hand walk down a red carpet from the White House after his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974.         Despite the early traumas and Mrs. Nixon's wish that her husband retire from politics, she was enthusiastic enough on the eve of his nomination as the Republican Presidential candidate in 1968 to say, "This really is the American dream, where people from humble circumstances can, through sheer hard work, go up the ladder." Humble Origins in West         Her own origins had, indeed, been humble. She was born Thelma Catherine Ryan on March 16, 1912, in the small mining town of Ely, Nev. Her father, William, an itinerant miner of Irish-American ancestry, gave her the nickname Pat because of her birth on the eve of St. Patrick's Day.         Before she was a year old, her mother, Kate, a German-born woman with a son and daughter from a previous marriage, prevailed on her husband to leave the mines. The family moved to Artesia, Calif., about 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and started a truck farm on a four-acre plot that had little plumbing and no electricity.         "We all worked hard," Mrs. Nixon recalled years later. "We dug potatoes, we picked tomatoes, we picked peppers, cauliflowers and peanuts."         In 1924, when Pat was 12, her mother died of cancer.         "For the last two or three months I used to sit with her through the night," she said years later. "We couldn't afford a night nurse and she needed attention."         Five years after her mother's death, Pat's jolly, blue-eyed father, whom she adored, died of the miner's disease, silicosis. Cross-Country Trip         The five children in the family soon split up. Pat, at the age of 18, at the height of the Depression, set out for New York, driving an elderly couple across the country in their Packard.         For two years, until 1932, she worked in New York as a secretary and X-ray technician. The money she saved eventually got her back to California and into the University of Southern California, where her major was merchandising. Walk-on parts on Hollywood movie sets helped finance her education.         She graduated cum laude in 1937 and tried unsuccessfully to find work as a buyer for a department store. So she took a job at $190 a month teaching shorthand and typing at a secondary school in Whittier, Calif.         She was also interested in amateur theater, and at auditions for the play "The Dark Tower" one night in 1938, she met Richard M. Nixon, a recent graduate of Duke Law School who had set up practice in Whittier.         Both won parts in the play that night, and the young Nixon proposed to her a few hours later.         "I thought he was crazy," she said in 1969.         Mr. Nixon courted her for two years, sometimes even driving her to meet other beaus, before she accepted the proposal. Married in Riverside         They were married June 21, 1940, in a Quaker ceremony in Riverside, Calif. The bride was 28 years old, and Mr. Nixon was 10 months younger.         After finishing his naval service in 1945, Mr. Nixon decided to run for the House of Representatives. Just before the campaign started, the Nixons' older daughter, Patricia (Tricia), was born, on Feb. 21, 1946. In Representative Nixon's first term, another daughter, Julie, was born, on July 5, 1948.         Two years later, Mr. Nixon began a successful campaign for the Senate. While he generated controversy with his anti-Communist campaign speeches, his wife was portrayed in the press as projecting what would later be called a "20th-century born-in-a-log-cabin image."         She also began projecting the image of game and gracious campaigner, always able to suppress distress and bitterness.         As the President's wife, Mrs. Nixon traveled more than 100,000 miles, campaigning for her husband, accompanying him to foreign countries and, on several occasions, representing him at ceremonies abroad. Foreign Affairs Duties         She was the first wife of a President designated to head a United Nations delegation abroad, to the inauguration of President William R. Tolbert Jr. of Liberia in 1972. She also visited Peru in 1970 to see areas devastated by an earthquake, and in early 1974 she headed the United States delegation to inaugural ceremonies for the Presidents of Brazil and Venezuela.         Mrs. Nixon promoted various education programs and sought to enlist Americans in volunteer aid programs.         She shied away from adopting any publicity-inspiring projects like Jacqueline Kennedy's historical redecoration of the White House. Instead, she seemed to enjoy a more traditional and limited role in the White House, as Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower had.         Nixon White House receptions and dinners were frequent, but small and sedate, with none of the exuberance of the Kennedy and Johnson Presidencies. Only in receiving-line chitchat and in quiet little teas and receptions at the mansion did the real warmth and thoughtfulness of Mrs. Nixon's personality emerge. Seclusion at San Clemente         After her husband's resignation, Mrs. Nixon remained in seclusion for nine months with him at their estate in San Clemente, Calif., and moved to New York in 1980.         In the summer of 1976, Mrs. Nixon suffered a stroke that partly paralyzed her left arm and leg and the left side of her face for about a year. She had another stroke in the early 1980's and fully recovered from it, too. But in recent years she was very frail and suffered from emphysema, and she was hospitalized several times for lung problems, said Kathy O'Connor, Mr. Nixon's chief of staff.         Besides her husband and her daughters, Ms. Cox of Manhattan, whose husband, Edward F. Cox, is a lawyer, and Ms. Eisenhower of Berwyn, Pa., whose husband, David Eisenhower, is a military historian and grandson of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mrs. Nixon's survivors include two grandsons, Christopher Nixon Cox and Alex Richard Eisenhower, and two granddaughters, Melanie and Jennie Eisenhower.         A service for Mrs. Nixon with family members and friends attending will be held at 10 A.M. Saturday in the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., with the Rev. Dr. Billy Graham presiding and eulogies by Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and others. A private burial service will follow on the grounds of the library.         Mrs. Nixon's body will lie in state at the library on Friday. The public will be admitted from 5 P.M. to 9 P.M.       
         Alice Magdol Conrad, who ran her own executive recruiting firm, Magdol & McCone, died on Wednesday at her country home in Bridgehampton, L.I. She was 52.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         Mrs. Magdol, who also lived in Manhattan, started her career as a copywriter at Seventeen magazine, moving to Adams Dana and Silverstein, an advertising agency in 1966. She subsequently joined Judy Wald Associates, a recruiting firm for the advertising industry, and then went to London where she founded that company's London office.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Conrad returned to New York where she joined Foote, Cone & Belding, the advertising agency.         In 1979 she founded Magdol & McCone with Bonnie McCone. Mrs. McCone retired shortly after the firm was founded. It specialized in recruitment for advertising companies, including Grey, BBD& O, and Wells Rich & Greene, and for such financial institutions as Citibank.         Mrs. Conrad was born in Manhattan. She attended Riverdale Country Day School, graduating in 1957. She graduated magna cum laude from Pembroke College in 1961.         She was active in the Financial Women's Association and Women's Campaign Fund.         She is survived by her huband, Richard; her son, David; her stepdaughter, Jordyn, and her mother, Bea, all of Manhattan, and two sisters, Caroline Anderson of Brooklyn Heights and Martha Hayes of San Francisco.       
         Sara K. Dadourian, superintendent of an Armenian day school, died at her home in Manhasset, L.I., on Saturday. She was 65 and also kept a home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.         The cause was cancer, family sources said.         Mrs. Dadourian joined the staff of the Holy Martyrs Armenian Day School in Bayside, Queens in 1974, serving as teacher, principal, then superintendent. She was also a benefactor of the Armenian Seminary of New York and a member of the Armenian Assembly, a national lobbying organization.         Born in New York, she attended Brooklyn College. After the death of her first husband, Ralph Anoushian, she received her master's degree in Education from Queens College in 1978.         Her second marriage to Dadour Dadourian ended with his death in 1991.         Survivors include a daughter, Suzanne Froundjian of Manhasset; two sons, Karl of Bellerose Village, L.I. and Walter Anoushian of Manhasset; her mother, Shoushan Kaprielian; a brother Walter Kaprielian, both of Bellerose Village, and four grandchildren.       
         Gusti Huber, a leading Viennese actress before World War II who continued her successful stage and film career in this country, died on Monday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 78.         The family said the cause was heart failure.         Ms. Huber made her American debut in 1952 in "Flight Into Egypt," the story of an Austrian refugee family struggling to get to America, directed by Elia Kazan. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote that Ms. Huber "brings a grave, sensitive beauty to the character and describes with rare perception the excitement and the pain of a woman whose responsibilities are beyond human strength." Portrayed Anne Frank's Mother         She is best known in this country for her portrayal of Edith Frank in the Broadway production of "The Diary of Anne Frank," which won the Pulitzer Prize and Critics Circle Award in 1956. "Gusti Huber gives a superbly controlled performance as the patient mother who is close to hysteria," wrote Mr. Atkinson.         Ms. Huber also won praise for her performance in George Stevens's 1959 film version of the Anne Frank story.  After retiring from acting in 1961, she lectured in New York area high schools on the legacy of Anne Frank, the Jewish girl who hid from the Nazis in a garret in Amsterdam and who died in a concentration camp shortly before the end of World War II..         While still a student at the Academy for Music and Representative Art in Vienna, Ms. Huber began her acting career in 1929 at the Deutsches Volkstheatre. Joining the Schauspielhaus in Zurich, she played more than 180 roles in a five-year period.         After the liberation of Austria in World War II, she joined a company entertaining American troops. She met and married Joseph Besch, a United States Army captain and former newspaperman.         She is survived by her husband of 47 years; three daughters, Christiana MacDonald of Paris, and Bibi Besch and Drea B. Gillogly, both of Los Angeles; a son, Andrew F. Besch of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Barbara Whitney, an expert in sex education and a leader in the battle against AIDS in New York City's public schools, died on Friday at a friend's home on Squam Lake, N.H. She was 56 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         For the last two years, Dr. Whitney worked in the School Chancellor's office as director of the H.I.V./AIDS Technical Assistance Project, a privately financed program that teaches AIDS prevention throughout the school system. 20 Years in the Field         Dr. Whitney spent the last 20 years as a trainer, educator and administrator in the field of human sexuality. From 1978 to 1985 she was executive director of Siecus, the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States, in New York City. She was director of health services for the Children's Aid Society and director of the AIDS Training Institute in the New York City Department of Health.         Dr. Whitney, a native of Iowa, graduated summa cum laude from the College of Nursing at the State University of Iowa and earned a master's degree at Boston University's School of Nursing. While pursing her career, she studied psychoeducation at Temple University and not-for-profit management at Columbia University's School of Business. She received a Ph.D. in 1988 from the human-sexuality program in the Department of Health Education at New York University, which entailed studies in Sweden, Japan and Kenya.         Dr. Whitney is survived by her mother, Azalea Boeke of Sun City, Ariz.; a sister, Janice Hayes of Bloomington, Ind., and two daughters, Jennifer Whitney of Port Townsend, Wash., and Katie Whitney of Philadelphia.       
         Mary Ellen Forbes Kramer, who led the campaign to preserve and redevelop the historic mill district in Paterson, N.J., died on Monday at a hospital in Norwalk, Conn. She was 56 and lived in Little Falls, N.J., and Weston, Conn.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Kramer became active in civic affairs as the wife of Paterson's Mayor for 14 years, Lawrence (Pat) Kramer. In her first major issue, she led the efforts that blocked state plans to build a highway that would have destroyed some old silk mills.         After that success, she became the executive director of the Great Falls Development Corporation and worked to preserve the mills, which were built in the early 1800's and used the water power of the 77-foot-high Great Falls. The buildings were adapted to new uses, including the Paterson Museum, offices and artists' residences.         In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford visited the district to proclaim its national landmark status, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave Mrs. Kramer an award. New Career at College         She started a new career in 1980 as the director of community affairs at William Paterson College in Wayne, N.J.         There she was instrumental in founding the Wayne Chamber Orchestra, creating the annual Legacy Awards to raise scholarship funds, collecting more than $300,000 to restore the Hobart Manor on campus and organizing a popular annual lecture series with speakers like Henry Kissinger, Norman Mailer, Alvin Toffler and Beverly Sills.         She also served on the boards of St. Joseph's Hospital and the Straight and Narrow drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, both in New Jersey.         Mrs. Kramer was born in Paterson. After graduating from Mary Washington College she earned a master's degree in clinical psychology from George Washington University and briefly practiced as a school psychologist. She was divorced.         Surviving are her companion, Irving Appleman; her mother, Catherine Forbes of Wyckoff, N.J.; a daughter, Patricia Kimberly Sposa of Vernon, N.J.; two sons, Lawrence 3d, also known as Kip, and Patrick, also known as Kelly, both of Paterson; three brothers, Cyril Forbes of Montclair, N.J., William Forbes of Paterson and Paul Forbes of Morristown, N.J., and two sisters, Joan Forbes of Wyckoff and Nancy Braithwaite of Nassau, the Bahamas.       
         Ariel D. Rubstein, a soprano who performed throughout the United States and Europe, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 41.         The cause was AIDS, her family said.         Ms. Rubstein made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1988 as Barena in an acclaimed concert version of Janacek's "Jenufa" by the Opera Orchestra of New York. The performance, which starred Gabriela Benackova and Leonie Rysanek, was recorded live and released on compact disk.         Ms. Rubstein was born in Portland, Ore., to parents in the performing arts. Her father, also named Ariel, was a Russian-born pianist, the director of the Portland School of Music and a founder of the Portland Opera. Her mother, the former Eleanor Reed, was a stage actress.         As a student, Ms. Rubstein was encouraged by Rudolf Serkin to pursue music. She studied at the Juilliard School and won a scholarship for studies in Vienna.         Ms. Rubstein performed with the Opera Company of Boston, the Houston Grand Opera, the Portland Opera and other ensembles throughout the United States. She also sang with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the New Orleans Philharmonic and other orchestras in the United States.         She is survived by her father, of Portland; a brother, Peter, of Manhattan, and a sister, Victoria Pierson of Portland.       
         Vivian E. Browne, a professor of art at Rutgers University and a painter whose work linked abstraction to nature, died on July 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.         The cause was bladder cancer, said her mother, Odessa Browne.         Ms. Browne joined the Rutgers faculty at Newark in 1970 as an instructor in the art and design department. She headed the department from 1975 to 1978, becoming a full professor in 1985. She taught contemporary black and Hispanic art, painting and other courses.         She was a founder of SoHo 20, a Broome Street gallery, established in 1973, that was one of the first women's art cooperatives in Manhattan. There she had several solo exhibitions, most recently in 1989, when she presented her oil and acrylic landscapes of towers and power lines superimposed on trees.         Her paintings are in many private, corporate and public collections.         Ms. Browne was born in Laurel, Fla. She graduated from Hunter College, earned a Master of Fine Arts degree, and studied for a time in Nigeria. Before joining Rutgers, she taught in high schools and colleges in New York and New Jersey.         She is survived, in addition to her mother, by two sisters, Lenice Pannell and Yvonne Allison, of Wheaton, Md.       
         Joyce Haber, known for her barbed commentaries as one of the last of Hollywood's powerful gossip columnists and the author of a best-selling book on the movie industry, died on Thursday at a hospital in Los Angeles.  Her age was variously given as 60 or 62.         The cause was kidney and liver failure, said a spokesman for the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.         Miss Haber and her syndicated column played a role in a sensational case in the 1970's that involved the actress Jean Seberg, who suffered a premature labor and later committed suicide.         In 1968, The Los Angeles Times named Miss Haber as a successor to Hedda Hopper, who had died in 1966. Louella Parsons, a rival Hollywood columnist for the Hearst papers, had retired in 1965.         Miss Haber once described Melina Mercouri as having "wall-to-wall hips, an ear-to-ear smile and more teeth than a pretzel has salt." She said Julie Andrews had "a kind of flowering dullness about her."         Miss Haber retired as a columnist to write "The Users" (Delacorte, 1976), a best-selling novel. Its passages on the exploits of 70 real and fictional Hollywood characters disturbed even some of her friends and sources. Role in Seberg Case         The Seberg episode started in 1970 when Miss Haber wrote about "the baby Miss A is expecting and its father." The column said: "Papa's said to be a rather prominent Black Panther."         Three months later, Newsweek named Miss Seberg, a white actress, as the expectant mother. The day after reading that, she went into premature labor. The baby girl died three days later. Miss Seberg and her husband, Romain Gary, a French novelist and former diplomat, sued Newsweek and settled for several thousand dollars.         It was later disclosed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had plotted to plant the rumor in a campaign to discredit and harass radicals, whom Miss Seberg had supported. But the agency's files said that J. Edgar Hoover had temporarily delayed the plan when the Haber column item mysteriously appeared.         Mr. Gary said Miss Seberg became despondent and tried to commit suicide on the anniversaries of the baby's death. Eventually she killed herself in 1979. Mr. Gary, who blamed the F.B.I. for her troubles, committed suicide in 1980, although the reason was unclear.         Miss Haber said that her report was based on a letter given to her by an editor, whom she did not name, and that she had not been aware of any F.B.I. involvement.         Miss Haber was a child of the movie industry. As a six-year-old, she acted in three "Our Gang" features. She was educated at Brearley School, Bryn Mawr College and Barnard.         After working briefly in summer stock theater, as a political campaign aide and at an advertising agency, she joined Time magazine as a researcher.         She was divorced from Douglas S. Cramer Jr., a television and film producer.         Her survivors include a son, Douglas 3d, and a daughter, Courtney Cramer.       
         Tatiana Troyanos, an American mezzo-soprano whose enormous repertory covered the full range of operatic history, from Monteverdi to Philip Glass, died on Saturday evening at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her manager, Janice Mayer at Columbia Artists, said the cause was cancer.         Miss Troyanos's dark, flexible mezzo was ideal for the wrenching emotionalism of such characters as Carmen, Kundry in Wagner's "Parsifal," Eboli in Verdi's "Don Carlo," Santuzza in Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana," and both Purcell's and Berlioz's Didos.         She was also a superb player of trouser roles. Her Octavian in "Rosenkavalier" was long the centerpiece of her repertory, and early in her career she gave highly regarded performances as Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Romeo in Bellini's "Capuletti e i Montecchi." And she was prized for the kind of vocal and dramatic agility, as well as the ability to learn difficult roles quickly, that made her a singer of choice for revivals of rarely performed Handel and Mozart works.         Her appearances in the last year indicate the scope of her repertory. In September she created the role of Queen Isabella in Philip Glass's "Voyage" at the Met. She performed in two "Ring" cycles, as Waltraute in the Metropolitan Opera's "Gotterdammerung" and Fricka in the Lyric Opera of Chicago's "Rheingold." In May she gave what James R. Oestreich called in The New York Times "a searching, almost harrowing reading" of the Mahler Third Symphony with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, and last month she sang Clairon in the San Francisco Opera production of Strauss's "Capriccio."         Tatiana Troyanos was born in New York on September 12, 1938, and grew up in Forest Hills. Her mother was German and her father Greek, and though she admittedly neither spoke Greek nor cared for Greek food, she identified closely with her father's homeland and described herself as Greek-American.         Both her parents were singers, and she sang in school and church choruses, but her first serious musical training was as a pianist. It was only during her high school years, when she began to listen to Maria Callas recordings and attend Metropolitan Opera performances as a standee, that she decided to study singing. While working at Random House as a secretary she enrolled at the Juilliard School, but left when the dean refused to let her study with the teacher of her choice, Hans Heinz. She studied privately with him for many years, continuing even after she began to sing professionally.         Miss Troyanos found few opportunities in New York, but she was a fighter: When the Met offered her small roles, she turned them down, and when she was denied a chorus role in "The Sound of Music" because Richard Rodgers thought her too glamorous to play a nun, she returned looking disheveled and got the part. Her first break was in 1963, when Julius Rudel signed her to the New York City Opera roster. She made her debut that year as Hippolyta in Benjamin Britten's "Midsummer Night's Dream," and also sang Jocasta in Stravinsky's "Oedipus Rex."         In 1965, following Heinz's suggestion that she would benefit from experience at a European house, she joined the Hamburg State Opera, where she made her way through a large part of the mezzo-soprano repertory in her decade there. But her first major appearances were at Aix-en-Provence, France, where she made her debut in 1966 as the Composer in Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos," and at Covent Garden, where she performed her first Octavian in 1969, learning the role in a week to fill in for another singer.         Miss Troyanos made her Met debut as Octavian in 1976, and became one of the house's most frequently heard mezzos. Among the many roles she sang there were the Countess Geschwitz in Berg's "Lulu," Sesto in Mozart's "Clemenza di Tito," Charlotte in "Werther," Adalgisa in "Norma," and her regular showpieces, Carmen, Kundry, Santuzza and the Composer.         In addition to her opera appearances, Miss Troyanos was an eloquent recitalist. Particularly interesting in recent years were her duo recitals with the soprano Benita Valente. After their last New York performance together, at Alice Tully Hall in January 1992, Bernard Holland wrote in The Times: "Ms. Troyanos's mezzo-soprano is intended less as a thing of beauty (which it often is) than as a conduit for the pain, exaltation and rushes of emotion that suffuse her musical personality."  A Recorded Legacy         Miss Troyanos made many first-rate recordings. Among those available on compact disk are performances in Leonard Bernstein's recording of his "West Side Story" (Deutsche Grammophon), "Carmen" (London), "Werther" (Angel), "Cosi Fan Tutte" (RCA), "Le Nozze di Figaro" (Deutsche Grammophon) and Schoenberg's "Gurre-Lieder" (Philips). Her recent San Francisco appearance in "Capriccio" was taped for video release; other video performances include a memorable Sesto in the Jean-Pierre Ponelle production of "La Clemenza di Tito" (Deutsche Grammophon) and, with the Metropolitan Opera, Venus in Wagner's "Tannhauser" and Dido in Berlioz's "Troyens."         She is survived by her mother, Hildegard Fournier of Florida, and her brother, John, of New York.       
         Mary Bickford Paulsen, the mother of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, died in her sleep yesterday at the Governor's Residence in Hartford, his office announced. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Paulsen until recently lived in Manhattan. For many years she had been active in the American Red Cross, serving as an ambulance driver during World War II.         Mrs. Paulsen was born in India to British parents, General and Mrs. Harold Bickford, and was a niece of the Most Rev. Randall Thomas Davidson, an Archbishop of Canterbury.         Mrs. Paulsen is survived by three other children from her marriage to the late Lowell P. Weicker Sr., who died in 1979: Theodore M. Weicker of San Francisco; the Rev. Harold H. Weicker, also of San Francisco, and Mary Audrey Mellor of Scottsdale, Ariz. She is also survived by 13 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren from that marriage.         Mrs. Paulsen's second husband, Howard C. Paulsen, died in 1959. She is also survived by three stepchildren from that marriage, Charles Paulsen of Marion, Mass., and Ann Reinhard and Lynn Leithe, both of Spokane, Wash.       
         Olivia L. Gilliam, a foundation executive, died on Sunday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 55 and also lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         For the last 20 years, Mrs. Gilliam was the executive director of the Myrin Institute, a foundation whose causes include international affairs, the environment and drug-abuse education through its offshoot, the American Council for Drug Research. Through Myrin, she was a founding editor and the artistic director of the Orion Society's Orion Nature Quarterly.         She worked with the Office of the Tibetan Mission to the United Nations in the 1960's. She also was active in the founding of Conservation International and served on the board of the New York Blood Center.         Surviving are her husband, Marion G. H. Gilliam; her mother, Natalie Davenport of Great Barrington and John's Island, Fla.; a sister, Baroness Bernard D'Anglejan-Chatillon of Paris and Vero Beach, Fla.; a half brother, William C. Ladd of Brewster, Mass.; a half sister, Cornelia Goode of Melbourne, Australia; two stepbrothers, Geoffrey and Eric DeBellaigue, both of London, and a stepsister, Cornelia Schwartz of Harrisville, N.H.       
         Rita Karin, a stage, film and television actress who performed in both Yiddish and English, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been ill with pneumonia, but no cause of death was listed on the death certificate, said her son, Dr. Michael Horowitz of Evanston, Ill.         Ms. Karin was born in Vilna, Poland, in 1919. During World War II, she studied at the Moscow State Jewish Theater. Her parents and other relatives in Poland were killed in the Holocaust. In 1945, she left the Soviet Union for Germany, where she narrated "The Mills of Death," the first United States Information Agency documentary on the liberation of the concentration camps.         In Germany, the American Government helped Ms. Karin and her husband, Norbert Horowitz, also a graduate of the Moscow State Jewish Theater, to create a Yiddish theater that performed for Holocaust survivors throughout Europe. Came to U.S. in 1949         In 1949, Ms. Karin and her husband immigrated to the United States, where she began to act in the Yiddish theater in New York City. She was also well known for her readings of the work of Sholom Aleichem, delivered with other actors at the home of Bel Kaufman each year on the anniversary of the writer's death.         In 1960, she made her Broadway debut in "The Wall"; the next year, she appeared in "A Call on Kuprin." In 1975, she was in "Yentl." Off Broadway, she appeared in "The Pocket Watch," "Scuba Duba," "The House of Blue Leaves" and "The World of Sholom Aleichem."         Her film credits include "The Big Fix," "Enemies, a Love Story," "Sophie's Choice" and, most recently, "The Pickle." On television, she appeared in the 1989 sitcom "Chicken Soup," as the mother of the character played by Jackie Mason, and, this year, in the anthology series "TriBeCa."         In addition to her son, Ms. Karin is survived by a daughter, Rochelle Axelrud of Woodmere, L.I.; four granddaughters, and one grandson.       
         Adrianne Allen, a winsome British actress who appeared on Broadway in the 1930's, 40's and 50's, and also acted in films, died on Tuesday in Montreux, Switzerland. She was 86 years and lived outside Montreux.         The British newspaper The Independent said she had suffered from cancer and other illnesses.         Miss Allen, who specialized in light comedy, won critical praise as a neat, highly skilled performer who radiated intelligence. She retired from the stage in 1958.         Her acting in the 1935 production of the comedy "Pride and Prejudice," at the Music Box, was praised for its adroitness. Big Moment on Broadway         Her co-starring performance in the 1956 comedy "The Reluctant Debutante," as a busybody mother who tried to marry her daughter to an eligible suitor, was lauded by one critic as crisp, alert and highly enjoyable.         In 1948, Miss Allen played a distraught wife and mother in "Edward, My Son." A scene in which she was bullied by her husband was called one of that year's big moments on Broadway.         Her films ranged from "Loose Ends" (1930) to "Meet Mr. Malcolm" (1954).         She was born in Manchester, England, and studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. She made her debut on the London stage in 1926, in Noel Coward's "Easy Virtue," and on the New York stage in 1931, in "Cynara."         She married the actor Raymond Massey in 1929; they were divorced in 1939. Later that year, she married William Dwight Whitney, a New York lawyer. He died in 1973.         She is survived by her daughter, Anna, who performed with Miss Allen on the stage, and by a son, Daniel, who is also an actor.       
         Susan K. Johnson, the senior vice president for account management at Mediamark Research Inc., a Manhattan-based media and market research company, died on Friday at the New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. She was 46 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.         The cause was meningitis, said her husband, Leonard Gelstein.         Ms. Johnson joined the company, which carries out research on subjects like magazine readership, in 1989. She was previously a vice president and associate media director of Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc., a Manhattan-based advertising agency.         At her death, she was also vice president of the Media Research Directors Association.         She was born in Wilmington, Del., graduated from Tower Hill School there and earned a B.A. in psychology from Vassar College in 1969.         In addition to her husband, whom she married in 1984, she is survived by their daughter, Megan Elizabeth Gelstein; her mother, Kathryn Johnson of Brooklyn; and a sister, Janet Grimminger of Townsend, Del.       
         Lillian Ruth Kessler, founder of the Kessler International Corporation, which exports railroad parts, electronics and heavy industrial equipment to Asia, Africa and South America, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Washington. She was 85.         Her daughter, Elinor Fuchs, said her mother had Alzheimer's disease.         Ms. Kessler founded the company in 1946. It is now based in Rockville, Md.         Before she established the business Ms. Kessler served for a year as an analyst for the Foreign Economic Administration, a Federal agency, conducting studies of postwar industrialization in Ethiopia and China. She then worked as an industrial economist for an international engineering firm and as a foreign markets consultant for the Sinclair Oil Corporation. W.P.A. History Project         While still a doctoral student in economic history in what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ms. Kessler was asked to direct a pilot history project for the Works Progress Administration, the New Deal program established in 1935 to provide employment through public works projects; eventually, the history project grew into the W.P.A.'s Historical Records Survey.         Ms. Kessler was named the director of the project for Ohio in 1939. During her work with the W.P.A. she wrote a guidebook to American folk songs, "Songs of Yesterday: A Song Anthology of American Life," with Philip D. Jordan.         She was born in Cleveland and attended Radcliffe College before enrolling at the Cleveland university, where she received an undergraduate degree in 1929.         In 1930 she married Joseph Fuchs, the violinist, who was then with the Cleveland Orchestra. They divorced in 1940.         Besides her daughter, Ms. Kessler is survived by a brother, Dr. Edwin S. Kessler of Washington, and two granddaughters.       
         Nina Berberova, a Russian-born poet, novelist, playwright, critic and professor of literature whose biography is a classic of the Russian emigre Diaspora, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Philadelphia. She was 92.         She died of complications from a fall last March, said Dr. Murl G. Barker, a friend, who is chairman of the Russian department at Rutgers University.         Miss Berberova is best known for her 1969 autobiography, "The Italics Are Mine," written during the years 1960 to 1965. Many of the figures in the worlds of emigre arts and politics -- including Anna Akhmatova, Alexander Blok, Vladimir Nabokov, Maxim Gorky and Fyodor Sologub -- come vividly alive in her reminiscences.         "She has brilliantly evoked the atmosphere of literary Petrograd," wrote a critic in The New York Times Book Review in 1969, adding that the memoirs "have yielded some remarkable portraits and vignettes." The book was re-issued last year by Alfred A. Knopf in a revised translation.  A Film From Her Novella         Recognition for her fiction came late, but French, German and English critics have compared Miss Berberova's sharp, incisive writing to that of Turgenev's and Chekhov's. Her 1934 novella "The Accompanist," about a young woman pianist who accompanies and competes with a soprano, was made into a film this year by the French director Claude Miller.         A selection of Miss Berberova's novellas, "The Tattered Cloak and Other Novels," was published by Knopf in 1991. Michiko Kakutani, writing in The Times, said: "Long overdue in America, this collection of stories deserves a wide and appreciative audience, while Miss Berberova herself deserves recognition as one of the most captivating Russian writers alive today."         Her fiction has been on best-seller lists in France, and she was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Government in 1989.         Miss Berberova (pronounced bur-BEAR-uh-vuh) was born in 1901 in St. Petersburg; her father was an Armenian civil servant; her mother was Russian. She attended Rostov University and was involved in the literary and artistic ferment in that city until she left in 1922, accompanying the poet Vladislav Khodasevich. Together they traveled about Europe as members of the household of Maxim Gorky, before settling in Paris in 1925. Reported the News         Miss Berberova then began a 15-year affiliation with the Russian-language daily Poslednye Novosti, reporting news events and writing book reviews, critical articles, short fiction and theater and movie reviews. She was also one of the founders of the emigre weekly Russkaya Mysl' in 1947.         She wrote four novels and "Tchaikovsky," a biography of the composer. Appearing in 1937, the book created a sensation because it dealt openly with the composer's homosexuality.         In 1950 Miss Berberova immigrated to the United States, working at a variety of jobs until she became the editor of the journal Mosty. In 1958 she joined the Slavic department at Yale University, and in 1963 she moved on to Princeton, where she taught until 1971.         Miss Berberova was the partner of Khodasevich until the 1930's, but they were never married. She married Nikolai Makeyev, a journalist, in 1937; and in the 1950's, George Kochevitsky, a musician who died last month. Both marriages ended in divorce.         Miss Berberova, who became a United States citizen, returned to Russia in 1989.         She received an honorary doctorate from Middlebury College in 1983, and another from Yale University last year. She moved from Princeton to Philadelphia in 1990.       
         Barbara Taylor Schoen, an author and the founder and director of the writing program at the State University of New York at Purchase, died on Thursday at her Purchase home. She was 69.         She had been ill for a long time, her family said.         Mrs. Schoen, a native of Manhattan, graduated from Bryn Mawr College, cum laude, and Boston University, where she earned a master's degree in physics. While pursuing a doctorate in physics at Boston, she worked on isotope analysis as a technician in the Department of Biophysics of Harvard Medical School.         While raising four children, she began a writing career in the 1950's and saw her short stories first published in Seventeen magazine. Over the years, she also contributed articles on education, personal computers and other subjects to various periodicals.         She was the author of two well-received novels for young readers, "A Place and A Time" (1967) and "A Spark of Joy" (1969), both published by Crowell.         Mrs. Schoen (rhymes with phone) became a teacher-counselor in 1970 at the Cooperative College in Mount Vernon, which was later merged into the College of Letters and Sciences at SUNY-Purchase. At Purchase she became an assistant professor of language arts in 1973 and an associate professor five years later.         A tenured faculty member, she was teaching nine undergraduate courses covering various aspects of writing from poetry to essays to fiction and science. She had been director of the college's Writing Program since 1984. As such she developed a series of courses and a set of creative-writing classes for literature majors hoping to write professionally.         Mrs. Schoen is survived by her husband of 47 years, Donald R.; two sons, Robert of Southport, Conn., and John of Riverside, Conn.; two daughters, Claire Werner of Norwalk, Conn., and Susan Terray of Woods Hole, Mass.; her mother, Caroline Colgate Taylor of Manhattan; a sister, Alice Day of Canberra, Australia; a brother, Howard C. Taylor 3d of Jericho, Vt., and six grandchildren.       
         Helen Adam, a poet and composer of Scottish ballads, died on Sept. 19 at a nursing home in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. She was 83.         A master of ballads and classical English poetry, she was nevertheless closely associated with the Beat authors and the San Francisco school of poets. She read her work alongside friends like Allen Ginsburg and Robert Duncan.         Ms. Adam was born in Glasgow, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. She was a child prodigy who had small books of poems published while she was still a teen-ager. After attending Edinburgh University and working as a journalist in London, she moved to New York with her family and then settled in San Francisco with her mother and sister, Pat, who often collaborated with her.         Her poems were collected in "Selected Poems and Ballads," published by Helikon Press in 1975. She also wrote a musical play with her sister. Called "San Francisco's Burning," it was produced in the 1960's at the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village. The score was written by the Rev. Al Carmines.         The experimental film maker Rosa von Praunheim featured Ms. Adam in several films, including a biographical documentary. Ms. Adam's last public appearance was in the public television series "Poetry Minute" in 1988. She became a recluse after her sister died later that year.       
         Reizl Bozyk, an actress who received top billing in the Yiddish theater for more than 60 years, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital Medical Center. She was 79 and lived on the Lower East Side.         Mrs. Bozyk was an enduring star of the Yiddish stage here and earlier in Poland and Argentina, appearing in hundreds of productions, often as a comedian and later as the familar mother or mother-in-law character who often stole the show.         In 1988 she played her first English-language role, appearing as the grandmother in Joan Micklin Silver's film "Crossing Delancey." It was her biggest success outside the Yiddish theater, and it came when she was 74. For it, she drew from the dozens of similar roles she had played on the Yiddish stage to portray a kindly meddler trying to find a husband for her granddaughter (Amy Irving).         Mrs. Bozyk began acting in the Yiddish theater in Poland at the age of 5 or 6, performing first with her parents and then with Max Bozyk, the Yiddish actor whom she later married. He died in 1970 after a performance at Town Hall. Inseparable for Three Decades         The Bozyks fled from the Nazis in 1939, traveling first to Argentina and in 1941 to New York City. For three decades, they were inseparable on the Yiddish stage here, starring in one play or revue after another.         In an interview when "Crossing Delancey" opened, Mrs. Bozyk said that her 37 years with her husband had been like 74 because they'd spent their entire days and nights together.         "After the concert in Town Hall, right there, he said he didn't feel well," she said. "I took him in my arms and he died. I would like to go the way he did."         In 1989 she played her first stage role in English, appearing in the comedy "Social Security" at the Forum Theater in Metuchen, N.J. A year later she recreated her "Crossing Delancey" role on stage.         Mrs. Bozyk is survived by her daughter, Suzanne Armetta of Parlin, N.J.; four grandsons, and a great-grandson.         A funeral service will be held at noon on Tuesday at the Riverside Chapel on Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street in Manhattan.       
         Lois Kibbee, a stage actress, director and writer who became known late in life for her decadelong role as the matriarch Geraldine Whitney Saxon on the daytime television serial "The Edge of Night," died on Monday in Memorial Sloane-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a brain tumor, said a friend, Carrie Nye Cavett.         Miss Kibbee joined the CBS serial in 1970 and played the character of Geraldine intermittently until the show went off the air in December 1984. She received four Emmy nominations for best supporting actress on the show, and, as an "Edge of Night" associate writer, shared an Emmy nomination for outstanding writing in the show's 1981-1982 season. Miss Kibbee took on the role of Elizabeth Sanders on the ABC television serial "One Life to Live" in 1986.  A Veteran of the Stage         Born in Wheeling, W.Va., she began her acting career at the age of 5 in a road version of "Rip Van Winkle" while her parents were appearing in a stock-company production there.         In 1951 she founded the Civic Theater of El Paso and was its resident director for eight years. Before establishing herself in daytime television, Miss Kibbee had appeared in more than 350 stage productions around the country. She also appeared on Broadway in "A Man for All Seasons" and "Venus Is."         Eventually she became a radio actress in Hollywood, appearing on "Our Miss Brooks," "Sam Spade," "The Jack Benny Show" and "The Green Hornet." She also acted in the 1980 movie "Caddyshack" and in many other films.         Miss Kibbee was the author of two books: a 1967 biography of Christine Jorgensen and a 1970 biography of Joan Bennett, "The Bennett Playbill."         At the time of her death she was writing a biography of her family, which traces its theatrical roots back to Mississippi River showboats. Her mother, the actress Lois Wilson Kibbee, made her theatrical debut in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" on a river boat; her uncle was the actor Guy Kibbee.         She is survived by her mother, of Chino, Calif.; two brothers, Milne, of Chino and James, of New Orleans; and a sister, Elizabeth Zonn.       
         Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress and philanthropist whose bittersweet life was woven of luxury, disputes and interludes of deep unhappiness, died yesterday at her house in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80 and had her main residence in Somerset County, N.J. She also had homes on Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, in Newport, R.I., and Hawaii.         The cause was progressive pulmonary edema resulting in cardiac arrest, said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Bernard Lafferty, a friend and adviser to Miss Duke who was with her at her death.         Her manifold interests as a philanthropist ranged from animal rights to AIDS, historical preservation to orchids. By some accounts she was an astute manager of her assets, and a person familiar with her affairs said that she had left nearly all her estate of more than $1 billion to charity.         Late one evening in Rome in 1945, Miss Duke, who was then 33 years old, told a friend that her vast fortune was in some ways a barrier to happiness.         "All that money is a problem sometimes," Miss Duke told her companion, a young American journalist, over a glass of wine at the Hassler Hotel. "It happens every time. After I've gone out with a man a few times, he starts to tell me how much he loves me. But how can I know if he really means it? How can I ever be sure?" An Inheritance With a Double Edge         At that stage of her life, Miss Duke, then between marriages and working as a foreign correspondent based in Rome, was known and liked by other American expatriates for her friendly, unassuming ways, her warmth, and her love of jazz and ballroom dancing. But her words that night showed that her life had been profoundly affected, even scarred, by her wealth.         Miss Duke was not only rich; she was also thought for years to be the richest woman in the world. And she had that reputation during the Depression, when her wealth stood out in especially stark contrast to widespread poverty and suffering. As a result, she was always a celebrity, and one who literally stood out, standing six feet one inch tall.         Her millions, and the elegant life they made possible, seemed to be of great importance to her two husbands, James H. R. Cromwell, an American sportsman and advertising man, and Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican playboy and diplomat. She divorced them both.         The Duke millions also attracted cranks and photographers and ordinary curious people, and to avoid them Miss Duke lived a partly secluded life in her later years. In recent years, she traveled extensively and spent much time in Somerville, Newport, Hawaii and Beverly Hills. A Generous Giver With Many Interests         Her many philanthropic activities included paying for the restoration of numerous old buildings in Newport. She also established the Duke Gardens Foundation at Somerville in 1958. The Duke Gardens' trellised greenhouses, open to the public part of each year, contain French, English, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Islamic gardens and a collection of rare orchids.         As a philanthropist, Miss Duke was also active in support of environmental causes and animal rights. This year she contributed $2 million for AIDS research at Duke University in Durham, N.C., which was named for her family, and $1 million to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.         In addition, she was the president of the Doris Duke Foundation, based in Somerville, whose areas of interest have ranged from social and health services to cultural programs. The foundation reported $775,000 in charitable contributions in the 1992 fiscal year.         The president of Duke University, Nannerl O. Keohane, said yesterday, in a statement released by the university, that Miss Duke's "recent gift in support of AIDS research at Duke is but one of many programs here that she supported, from our Primate Center to other programs across the campus." She added: "Many of her gifts were made anonymously."         A spokesman for the university, John F. Burness, declined to say what, if anything, it might receive from Miss Duke's estate.         In an act of personal generosity in 1988 that involved an old friend, Miss Duke posted $5 million bail for Imelda Marcos, the wife of the former Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos, who died in 1989. Mrs. Marcos had been indicted in New York on Federal racketeering charges.         At various times, Miss Duke's millions, and the publicity they generated, also helped to draw her into lawsuits and disputes, including tax litigation in New Jersey, the site of her 2,700-acre estate, Duke Farms. In 1964, she took legal action in Hawaii to obtain a court order forbidding a jazz musician, Joseph Castro, from maintaining, as had been rumored, that he was her husband. A Bomber for Travel And Clean Kitchens         Her fortune also made possible many pleasures, large and small. She once bought a B-25 bomber and had it refurbished for luxury travel. She had her Hawaii house fixed up with ceiling-high goldfish tanks.         She entertained gracefully there and at her various other residences and tried to put shy guests at their ease. As a hostess, she was calm, quiet and a little shy herself, friends said, although she was sometimes angered by sloppiness in the kitchen, as in other realms.         Miss Duke liked fine porcelain and jewels and enjoyed building her jewelry collection, which included notable Indian pieces and heirlooms from her mother. She liked to bake, and friends said her whole-wheat bread was delicious. She enjoyed relaxing, now and then, with a glass of white wine or a spot of Champagne.         Nonetheless, Miss Duke seemed to experience more than her share of unhappiness. Beyond the two divorces, there was the death of her father, the multimillionaire James Buchanan Duke, in 1925, when she was 12 years old. In July 1940, her premature daughter, her only child, died in a Honolulu hospital after only 24 hours of life.         And in 1966 there was the accidental death of Eduardo Tirella, an interior decorator who was a close friend, when the car she was driving slammed him against a gate on Rough Point, the Newport estate. Fenced with barbed wire and guarded, Rough Point was part of her inheritance from her father, known as Buck, who was president of the American Tobacco Company and had other extensive business interests. A Father's Fortune And a Young Heir         What made Miss Duke so enormously rich was the fact that she was his only child. She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 22, 1912, to his second wife, Nanaline Lee Holt Inman Duke.         Miss Duke, a shy, golden-haired child, had private tutors and for a time attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, where her father had built a three-story, 54-room mansion on the northeast corner of 78th Street and Fifth Avenue. The building now houses the Fine Arts Institute of New York University.         When Mr. Duke died, his total estate was valued at more than $100 million. His daughter's share of the estate was appraised in 1927 at more than $50 million, most of it in trust funds.         As a teen-ager and a young woman, Miss Duke spent much of her time at the 78th Street mansion, to which she sometimes referred jauntily in later years as "the rock pile." She took piano lessons, was tutored in French and Italian, went out to dinner at fashionable restaurants, and frequently went to the theater, although to avoid crowds she did not go to opening nights.         She also acquired a love of travel that was to stay with her through her life.         Miss Duke, who was known to some as Dee-Dee, was guarded by private detectives and sometimes traveled under an assumed name. "It saves trouble," she once said, "and keeps people from paying more attention to me than to anyone else."         Nevertheless, she was continually harassed by cranks, and there was some fear that she might be kidnapped.         Her half-brother, Walker Patterson Inman, who often traveled with her, once said: "Everywhere we go, it's the same. She gets to see a few of the sights, goes out to dinner a few times, and then her identity becomes known and we have to rush off somewhere else. We can't take any chances. When word gets out that she's in town, it's like telling gangsters: 'Here's a lot of money. Come and get it.' "         "But that's not the worst of it," he added. "Mail comes in by the bagful, and every crank in town wants to see her. Every imaginable plea for money comes by mail, to say nothing of threats against her because she's supposed to have so much money."         In hopes of seeing her, reporters gathered outside the 78th Street mansion on the evening of Nov. 21, 1933, but she eluded them and slipped out for a quiet dinner with friends. What made that night newsworthy, it was reported at the time, was that at the stroke of midnight, when she turned 21, she acquired control of one-third of the assets that had been held in trust for her.         Although no precise figures were released, it was estimated that the total value of her inheritance had shrunk by then, because of the financial crash and the Depression, to roughly $30 million. As stipulated in her father's will, Miss Duke acquired control over additional large parts of her inheritance on her 25th and 30th birthdays. Tobacco Queen As Married Woman         Soon after turning 21, Miss Duke began being seen in the company of a dashing, strong-jawed older man. It was James Cromwell, the son and grandson of prominent yachtsmen and the stepson of a partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company.         Mr. Cromwell and Miss Duke had first met in 1929 in Bar Harbor, Me., when she was a long-legged teen-ager and he was already 10 years out of the University of Pennsylvania.         Rumors of an engagement blossomed, were denied, blossomed again. And then, with little advance notice, the couple were married in a civil ceremony on Feb. 13, 1935, in the 78th Street house. The bride was 22, the groom 38. They sailed off on a prolonged honeymoon.         Visiting Agra, the Indian city that is the site of the Taj Mahal, the bride told a a questioner happily, "I'm a married woman now," and remarked that she did not like it when people called her "the world's richest girl" and "the tobacco queen."         "Tobacco queen -- what a name!" she said.         Back in the United States, the Cromwells set up housekeeping in ducal style at Duke Farms, with its 30-room stone manor house, its private movie theater (she loved movies) and 42 miles of private roads. For a change of scene, they built an elegant vacation house on the coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.         As time passed, relations between the Cromwells soured, and after protracted legal wranglings Mrs. Cromwell was granted a divorce in Reno in 1943 on grounds of cruelty. She resumed the use of her maiden name. Later, she testified that Mr. Cromwell had demanded an "endowment" of $7 million in return for the divorce. Learning to Work And Enjoying It         In 1944, Miss Duke went to Egypt to help the United States war effort by working, for $1 a year, for the United Seaman's Service, which operated canteens for American merchant seamen.         "I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something real to help in this war," she said at the time. "This may sound funny, but I honestly believe I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life. I feel I'm doing something worthwhile, earning the right to be friends with a lot of swell, interesting people that I've somehow missed before. I've discovered, I guess, that it's fun to work."         Relishing the overseas life, she went on to Europe, where she wrote dispatches in 1945 and 1946 for International News Service, an American news agency that is now defunct, getting around Rome on a bicycle.         Miss Duke was entertaining an American couple in her Rome apartment one day when a suave and handsome Latin American came to call. He was carrying a guitar, which he was to play while she accompanied him on the piano. It was Porfirio Rubirosa, the high-spirited Dominican society figure.         The harmony beween Mr. Rubirosa and Miss Duke proved so compelling that they were married on Sept. 1, 1947, in a civil ceremony at the Dominican Consulate in Paris, where she had gone to work for Harper's Bazaar magazine. He was 39; she was 34. By some accounts the formalities included the bridegroom's signing a legal document that affirmed the bride's control over her fortune.         They spent their honeymoon at Cap d'Antibes, on the French Riviera, where they swam, sunbathed and went motorboating. Not long afterward, he became the Dominican Republic's Ambassador in Buenos Aires.         Despite his charm, the marriage foundered. Miss Duke obtained a Reno divorce from Rubirosa on Oct. 27, 1948, after charging him with extreme mental cruelty.         As time went on it became clear that Miss Duke preferred to remain single. The life she fashioned for herself was largely centered on her estates, and it involved some frivolity and some high seriousness, along with much unobtrusive travel.         It included both new and old interests. She served as a trustee of Duke University, which her family had built up with donations of many millions, and in her later years she became fascinated by the search for alternative sources of energy. Cultivating Gardens And Saving History         At Duke Farms, she laid out a series of interconnected, glassed-in gardens, totaling thousands of square yards, that were opened to the public in 1964 after much labor by her and her workers.         "Sometimes when we're hanging the flowers I spend 16 hours a day," she once told a friend, adding cheerfully, "I work like a stevedore."         She also had a small museum set up on the New Jersey estate to house her collection of Asian art.         Over the years, Miss Duke and the foundation that bore her name made contributions to many other causes, ranging from the advancement of Russian studies at Princeton University to architectural restoration in Newport. She poured millions into the Preservation Society of Newport County, whose mission was to reclaim the city's rundown 18th-century buildings.         The project was welcomed by many Newporters because, among other reasons, it enhanced property values. They were careful to respect Miss Duke's desire for quiet and privacy, and some came to refer to her, almost reverentially, as "the lady."         In 1988, when she was 75, Miss Duke adopted Charlene Gail Heffner, then 35, a former adherent of the Hare Krishna religious group. But by February 1991, Ms. Heffner, known as Chandi, had become persona non grata at Miss Duke's residences, according to an unauthorized biography of Miss Duke, "The Richest Girl in the World" (Putnam, 1992), by Stephanie Mansfield. The author wrote that Miss Duke told a friend later that adopting Ms. Heffner had been "the greatest mistake I ever made."         Later, Ms. Heffner sued Miss Duke for breach of contract. This month, a New Jersey judge ruled against lawyers for Miss Duke, who had sought to have the suit dismissed.         Miss Heffner survives, as does Miss Duke's nephew, Walker Inman Jr. of Georgetown, S.C., and several cousins.       
         Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.         The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.         In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet. From Old West to Fall River         In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.         A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.         She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.         Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.         Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."         But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."         Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.         "The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."         Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.  She Felt Destined To Be an Artist         Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.         Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.         After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.         Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.         Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.  Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's         After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.         She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.         She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.         Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.  Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'         Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.         "Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.         "Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.         Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.  Created 'People And Not Automata'         Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."         Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."         Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.         Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.         Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."  Her Final Work Dealt With Death         In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.         Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.         Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.         Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."         Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.         Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.       
         Heather Farr, the professional golfer whose four-and-a-half-year battle with cancer won her scores of admirers from inside and outside the golf world, died Saturday night in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 28.         Since being diagnosed with breast cancer in July 1989, Farr underwent more than 15 operations, ranging from a radical mastectomy to breast reconstruction to bone marrow transplants and spinal surgery.         Through all the setbacks, she persevered, which characterized her approach to golf as well. Although she was just 5 feet 1 inch, she seemed bigger in stature.         "One of the things I always remember about her was that she walked so erect," said JoAnne Carner, the Hall of Fame golfer. "It was like she was saying, 'I'm not 5-1, I'm 6 feet.' "         Lessons at 7         Farr, born and raised in Phoenix, began her golf career at the age of 7, when she first took lessons from Bob Day, then the professional at Coronado Golf Course in Scottsdale. It was an unusually young age to begin lessons, but Farr's father, Gerald, convinced Day that Heather was ready.         "He told me that she followed him around all 18 holes every weekend," Day told The Arizona Republic. "I said: 'Stop right there. Anybody who can walk 18 holes and watch somebody else play golf, well, she's ready.' "         Because of her small stature, Farr could not hit the ball as far as many of her peers. But she made up for that with an excellent short game, a wonderful putting stroke and passionate aggressiveness.         She quickly developed into one of the country's most successful amateurs. At 13, she won the Arizona State Amateur. By the time she was 15, she was named the American Junior Golf Association player of the year for the first of two times.         'Like an Ambassador'         Under the tutelage of Arch Watkins, her game continued to develop in college at Arizona State University, where she was named to two all-America teams. Farr's coach at Arizona State, Linda Vollstedt, said Farr's influence there was enduring.         "She was like an ambassador for our golf program," Vollstedt said. "Everywhere she went, people sought out Heather."         Farr played on the 1984 Curtis Cup team and the 1984 World Amateur team. Two years later, at 20, she became the youngest player from the 1985 Ladies Professional Golf Association's qualifying school to make the L.P.G.A. Tour.         Her indefatigable nature and relentlessly upbeat attitude quickly won Farr many friends on the very competitive L.P.G.A. circuit. Twelve L.P.G.A. players were at the Scottsdale Memorial Hospital-North Saturday night when Farr died. "She never quit," said a former L.P.G.A. president, Judy Dickinson.         Spirit of Perseverance         In an interview last year, Farr characterized her philosophy on dealing with all of her problems. "You play through it," she said. "That's what you do. You just play through it."         She applied that philosophy to the golf course and to her medical battles. Like many rookies, Farr struggled in her first season, going eight tournaments without winning any prize money. But in her three L.P.G.A. seasons before the discovery of breast cancer, she improved each year. The 1988 season was her best. She won $75,821 and finished tied for third at the Mazda Classic. In the middle of the next season, the lump in her breast that originally had been diagnosed as benign was found to be cancerous.         Eleven months after Farr's first chemotheraphy treatments ended, doctors found that the cancer had spread to her skull and spine. A tumor on her back was removed, followed by a bone-marrow transplant. After the bone marrow transplant, a tumor on her skull and lesions on her hip were discovered. In March, while the cancer was in a brief remission, Farr was married to Goran Lingmerth, a former kicker for the Cleveland Browns. She is survived by her husband; her father, Gerald; her mother, Sharon, and her sister, Missy Farr-Kay, all of Phoenix.       
         Tatyana Nikolayeva, a Russian pianist widely respected for her interpretations of the music of Bach and Shostakovich, died on Monday in San Francisco. She was 69 and lived in Moscow.         The cause was a cerebral aneurism, said Jacques Leiser, her American manager. Miss Nikolayeva suffered a cerebral hemorrhage during a recital on Nov. 13 at the San Francisco Music Center. Stricken again soon afterward, she lost consciousness permanently. She was being treated at the California-Pacific Medical Center when she died.         Miss Nikolayeva was born on May 4, 1924, in Bezhitz, near Bryansk. She began piano study at the age of 5 with her mother. Her principal teacher was the renowned Aleksandr Goldenweiser, at the Moscow Conservatory, where she subsequently taught. Shared With Shostakovich         In 1950, she gained international recognition by winning a piano competition at the Leipzig Bach Festival. She impressed the jury, which included the composer Dmitri Shostakovich, by offering to play not merely the Bach prelude and fugue required, but any of the 48 preludes and fugues of Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier," from memory.         Shostakovich was so taken with her performances that on his return to Moscow he wrote his own set of 24 Preludes and Fugues (Op. 87), sharing each of the pieces with her as it was finished. She gave the work's premiere, in 1952 in Leningrad, and developed a close friendship with the composer. Having also studied composition at the Moscow Conservatory, she herself became a composer as well as a performer.         "As time passes," Miss Nikolayeva wrote a few years ago of her Leipzig award, "I feel more and more that I received then another, not so concrete but no less important, prize: the creative and personal friendship of Dmitri Shostakovich; a friendship which lasted more than 25 years, to the day of his death."         Miss Nikolayeva began to appear regularly in the West only late in life. She made her American debut in 1992, with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. She gave her New York debut recitals on Oct. 30 and Nov. 3 this year, playing the Shostakovich preludes and fugues at the 92d Street Y. She went on to play Bach and Shostakovich in Philadelphia, and she was playing the complete set of preludes and fugues again in San Francisco when she was stricken.         She recorded the Shostakovich preludes and fugues three times, twice for Melodiya and most recently for Hyperion. She also recorded many keyboard works of Bach for Melodiya and other labels.         She is survived by a son, Kirill, who lives in Moscow.       
         Jacqueline Shearer, a producer and director of documentary films about black Americans, died yesterday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 46.         The cause was colon cancer, said her brother Clement.         Ms. Shearer's works included "A Minor Altercation" (1978), about the Boston school-busing crisis; "The Keys to the Kingdom" and "The Promised Land" (1989), which were in the civil-rights television series "Eyes on the Prize," and "The Colored 54th Regiment" (1991) for the PBS series "The American Experience."         Ms. Shearer was born in Boston and graduated from Brandeis University. She helped found Boston Newsreel, a documentary company, and worked at WCBN radio and WCVB television in Boston.         Besides her brother Clement, of Northfield, Minn., she is survived by her mother, Erline, of Boston; two sisters, Debbie, of Boston, and Linda Gossage, of San Francisco; and another brother, Charles, of Boston.       
         Claudia McNeil, an actress known for her performances in stage and screen productions of "A Raisin in the Sun," died on Thursday in the Actors Fund Nursing Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 77 and had lived in the home for nine years.         The cause was complications of diabetes, said Rita Madero, a friend.         At the opening of "A Raisin in the Sun," by Lorraine Hansberry, in 1959 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, Miss McNeil won praise for her heroic performance as the matriarch in a black family on the South Side of Chicago. Critics found that Miss McNeil imbued that simple character with nobility of spirit. Film and Musical Versions         Miss McNeil went on to be a member of what has been lauded by critics as the outstanding cast of the 1961 film of "A Raisin in the Sun," directed by Daniel Petrie. The introspective movie, confined largely to one room, was found to be as fine as the play.         On the screen, Miss McNeil was stolid, voluminous and serene as a mother trying to control her son and wanting to buy her family a respectable home.         She was also was praised as bringing a commanding presence to a 1981 production of the musical "Raisin," presented by Equity Library Theater.         In the 1959 production, she weighed nearly 300 pounds, as she did in a television production of "The Member of the Wedding." But by 1978, when she sang at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, she had slimmed down to 159 pounds and observed, "I lost a whole person."         Until then, she had not sung in New York since she appeared in Langston Hughes's "Simply Heavenly" in 1957. Before then, she had been a slender dancer and singer.         Miss McNeil was born in Baltimore. She became a licensed librarian and early in her carer sang in vaudeville theatres and on the radio as well as in nightclubs. She made her legitimate New York stage debut in 1953, when she began playing Tituba in "The Crucible" at the Martin Beck Theater. She also appeared in the 1959 film "The Last Angry Man."         Early in her career, before she reached Broadway in "Simply Heavenly," she sang in Harlem and Greenwich Village and on 52d Street. She also toured with the Katherine Dunham troupe.         Ms. Madero said that Miss McNeil was married when she was 18 to a man who died in World War II, and that her second marriage ended in divorce after two years.       
         Ellin Hobbins Mitchell, a private dealer in medieval and Renaissance art and Old Master drawings, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 57.         Mrs. Mitchell, who had been suffering from brain lymphoma, was hit by a car early last month, said her husband, Jan, the New York businessman, art collector and former owner of Luchow's restaurant and the Longchamps restaurant chain.         She was born in Berlin but was taken to London by her parents before World War II. Educated at Cambridge, she became an actress, and she appeared with Mario Lanza in the 1959 film "For the First Time." She was under contract to Federico Fellini when she met and married Mr. Mitchell in 1960.         Mrs. Mitchell and her husband, from whom she was separated, were among the founders of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. She was also a director and a benefactor of the Bezalel Academy of Arts, Design and Architecture on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by three sons, David and Alexander, of Manhattan, and Oliver, of Tempe, Ariz.; her mother, Margot Hobbins of London, and a brother, Dr. Peter Hobbins of Zug, Switzerland.       
         Anne Spencer Lindbergh, a writer and the elder daughter of the aviation pioneer Charles A. Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, died Friday at her home in Thetford Center, Vt. She was 53.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Noel Perrin.         Ms. Lindbergh was one of six children of her famous parents; she was born eight years after the kidnapping and killing of Charles A. Lindbergh Jr.         She grew up in Darien, Conn., and, after studying at Radcliffe College for three years, moved to Paris to continue her education. While there she met and married a fellow student at the Sorbonne, Julien Feydy, who became a political scientist and university professor. They later divorced.         She later married Jerzy Sapieyevski, a composer and conductor she met in Europe and with whom she moved to Washington. They also divorced.         In her career as a writer, Ms. Lindbergh wrote 14 books, most of them for children. Her two most recent works are "Three Lives to Live" and "Travel Far, Pay No Fare." She was the recipient of several honors for her work, including an award from the International Reading Association.         Two of her more popular books are "The People in Pineapple Place" and "The Prisoner of Pineapple Place," both written in Washington, where she was then living. Many of the scenic backgrounds were taken from areas in Georgetown close to her home. She also taught school in Washington.         She moved to Vermont in 1987, and the next year she married Mr. Perrin, a writer and professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College. Ms. Lindbergh also taught for several years at the Riverside School in Lyndonville, Vt.         Ms. Lindbergh's mother, who is a poet and essayist, lives in Darien and Barnet, Vt. Her father died in 1974 at his home in Hawaii.         Ms. Lindbergh is also survived by a daughter, Constance Feydy, and a son, Marek Sapieyevski, both of Thetford Center; two step-daughters, Elisabeth Perrin, of Seattle and Amy Perrin, of White River Junction, Vt.; a sister, Reeve Tripp, of Barnet, and three brothers, Jon, of North Bend, Wash., Land, of Missoula, Mont., and Scott, of Brasilia. Brazil.       
         Myrna Loy, the urbane actress who personified a liberated wife of intelligence and wry good humor in some of the best American movie comedies of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         She died in surgery after a long illness, said Sherlee Lantz, a longtime friend of Miss Loy.         With a pert face, crinkly smile and velvet voice, the auburn-haired actress was universally called the "perfect wife." Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades. Turned Into Ideal Mother         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950). Miss Loy then settled into character roles in occasional films and stage and television plays. In 1973 she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's vitriolic comedy "The Women," again as a shrewd mother.         In 1981, Miss Loy and Henry Fonda were a graying couple perceptively reminiscing about their half-century marriage in a television movie, "Summer Solstice." Their performances prompted John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to write that "Mr. Fonda and Miss Loy demonstrate splendidly why they remain stars."         Of Welsh descent, the actress was born Myrna Williams on Aug. 2, 1905, on her father's cattle ranch near Helena, Mont. Her father, David Williams, called her Myrna, after the name of a railroad water stop that caught his fancy. Her mother, Della, was a singer. Started in a Chorus Line         From her father, a state legislator who was an advocate of President Woodrow Wilson's crusade to establish the League of Nations, she gained a sense of public service that lasted a lifetime.         The actress interrupted her career for Red Cross volunteer work throughout World War II. Soon after, she joined the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, serving as a peripatetic film adviser for five years.         Her father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and Mrs. Williams moved her daughter and son, David, to Los Angeles, where Myrna attended Venice High School and occasionally taught dancing. At the age of 18, she joined the chorus line in the stage show at Grauman's Chinese Theater.         She began getting bit parts in movies. A poet friend suggested the catchy name Loy, and it stuck. The teen-ager was quickly typecast as an exotic temptress, invariably Oriental and often villainous. Slinking and gyrating, she was trapped for nearly a decade in the stereotype in such films as "The Desert Song," "The Squall" and "The Black Watch," all released in 1929. 'The Thin Man,' a 'Quickie'         The most bizarre of these 60 or so oddities were two 1932 melodramas -- "The Mask of Fu Manchu," in which Miss Loy reluctantly portrayed the sadistic daughter of the archvillain Boris Karloff, and "Thirteen Women" in which, as a skulking Javanese half-caste, she plotted to do in 12 sorority sisters.         Occasionally, Miss Loy escaped the cliche. She gained notice for her acting as a predatory countess in the 1932 musical fantasy "Love Me Tonight," which starred Maurice Chevalier; as the materialistic wife of Leslie Howard in "The Animal Kingdom" in 1932, and as the love interest in a 1934 gangster thriller, "Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable and Mr. Powell.         A few months later, Myrna Loy became a household name and a full- fledged star. W. S. Van Dyke, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most versatile directors, persuaded studio executives to let him feature Miss Loy with Mr. Powell in a low-budget "B" movie, to be called "The Thin Man." The director shot the film in 21 days, and the "quickie" was a hit. In Well-Known Comedies         Later, when she was billed as "Queen of the Movies" and Gable was called the "King," the two were teamed in such madcap adventures as "Wife Versus Secretary," "Test Pilot" and "Too Hot to Handle."         At the start of World War II, Miss Loy left Hollywood and did full-time volunteer work, serving for four years as an assistant head of Red Cross welfare activities in New York. She also arranged for entertainment in 50 military hospitals and put in long stints at stage-door canteens.         After the war, she portrayed the compassionate, loving wife of Fredric March in "The Best Years of Our Lives," the much-honored 1946 film about servicemen returning from combat. The performance won her the Brussels World Film Festival prize for the best performance by an actress.         A political liberal, Miss Loy joined with other Hollywood figures in the late 40's in challenging what they deplored as the witch-hunting proceedings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         Of her postwar film work for Unesco, the actress said, "One little incident to battle prejudice, dropped into the middle of an entertaining film, is worth all the documentaries ever made."         Miss Loy was a longtime friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading Democrats and regularly campaigned for the party's Presidential candidates. She was also an adviser and former officer of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing. Started on Stage in 1960         She did not appear on the stage until 1960, at first in summer stock, because, she said, "I felt I had a lot to learn." She starred with Claude Dauphin in the comedy "The Marriage Go-Round" and played the mother in a national tour of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park."         In 1980, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures presented her with its first David Wark Griffith award "in grateful recognition of her outstanding contribution to the art of screen acting."         Miss Loy was married four times, to Arthur Hornblow Jr., a movie producer; John D. Hertz Jr., an auto-rental and advertising executive; Gene Markey, a producer-screenwriter, and Howland H. Sargeant, a producer and, at the time, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The marriages ended in divorce. Miss Loy had no children.         In later decades, Miss Loy lived in a book-lined terrace apartment in upper Manhattan overlooking the East River. She aided many civic causes, selecting her public-service committees as judiciously as her roles. Tribute at Carnegie Hall         In 1985, Hollywood movie stars and fans packed Carnegie Hall for a tribute to Miss Loy, who appeared in the audience looking frail but glamorous in a spangled gown. Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Some of the Best Years of Her Life         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films, including the following.         The Jazz Singer 1927         The Mask of Fu Manchu 1932         Penthouse 1933         The Thin Man 1934         Manhattan Melodrama 1934         The Great Ziegfeld 1936         After the Thin Man 1936         Test Pilot 1938         Too Hot to Handle 1938         The Best Years of Our Lives 1946         Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House 1948         Cheaper by the Dozen 1950         From the Terrace 1960         Midnight Lace 1960         The End 1978         Just Tell Me What You Want 1980

In Well-Known Comedies         Later, when she was billed as "Queen of the Movies" and Gable was called the "King," the two were teamed in such madcap adventures as "Wife Versus Secretary," "Test Pilot" and "Too Hot to Handle."         At the start of World War II, Miss Loy left Hollywood and did full-time volunteer work, serving for four years as an assistant head of Red Cross welfare activities in New York. She also arranged for entertainment in 50 military hospitals and put in long stints at stage-door canteens.         After the war, she portrayed the compassionate, loving wife of Fredric March in "The Best Years of Our Lives," the much-honored 1946 film about servicemen returning from combat. The performance won her the Brussels World Film Festival prize for the best performance by an actress.         A political liberal, Miss Loy joined with other Hollywood figures in the late 40's in challenging what they deplored as the witch-hunting proceedings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         Of her postwar film work for Unesco, the actress said, "One little incident to battle prejudice, dropped into the middle of an entertaining film, is worth all the documentaries ever made."         Miss Loy was a longtime friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading Democrats and regularly campaigned for the party's Presidential candidates. She was also an adviser and former officer of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing.         She did not appear on the stage until 1960, at first in summer stock, because, she said, "I felt I had a lot to learn." She starred with Claude Dauphin in the comedy "The Marriage Go-Round" and played the mother in a national tour of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park."         In 1980, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures presented her with its first David Wark Griffith award "in grateful recognition of her outstanding contribution to the art of screen acting."         Miss Loy was married four times, to Arthur Hornblow Jr., a movie producer; John D. Hertz Jr., an auto-rental and advertising executive; Gene Markey, a producer and screenwriter, and Howland H. Sargeant, a producer and, at the time, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The marriages ended in divorce. Miss Loy had no children.         In later decades, Miss Loy lived in a book-lined terrace apartment in upper Manhattan overlooking the East River. She aided many civic causes, selecting her public-service committees as judiciously as her roles. Tribute at Carnegie Hall         In 1985, Hollywood movie stars and fans packed Carnegie Hall for a tribute to Miss Loy, who appeared in the audience looking frail but glamorous in a spangled gown. Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Grace, Charm And Sophistication         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films. These are some of them.

         Susan Resnick Fisher, a family therapist who specialized in stepfamily problems, died yesterday at her Manhattan home after a long illness. She was 50 and practiced in Manhattan and Mount Kisco, N. Y.         Mrs. Fisher was a founder of Yeshiva University's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, a benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera and a board member of the Make a Wish Foundation.         She is survived by her husband, Sandford; four children from an earlier marriage, Joshua, Daniel, Jordanna and Benjamin Abrams; her mother, Pearl Resnick, widow of Jack Resnick, the New York real-estate developer; a sister, Marilyn Katz; and two brothers, Burton and Ira, all of Manhattan.       
         Alice Tully, a philanthropist who was an important figure in New York City's musical life for almost half a century, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Her lawyer, James McGarry, said the cause was the flu. She had not been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 1991.         Miss Tully, for whom Lincoln Center's chamber-music hall is named, was as respected for her knowledge of music and its practitioners as for her generosity.         As a singer who had a modest operatic and recital career in the 1930's, she was keenly aware of the problems performers face, and throughout her life was a friend and supporter of singers, pianists and composers. After she inherited her family's wealth -- her maternal grandfather was Amory Houghton, the founder of Corning Glass Works -- she donated many millions of dollars to the arts. A Birthday Portrait         For many years Miss Tully made her contributions anonymously, and when she agreed to underwrite a chamber-music hall in the Juilliard Building at Lincoln Center, she stipulated that her name not be associated with it. Eventually, John D. Rockefeller 3d, Lincoln Center's first chairman, persuaded her to allow the hall to be named in her honor. In 1987, to celebrate her 85th birthday, Lincoln Center commissioned Thomas Buechner to paint a full-length portrait of her, which hangs in the hall's main foyer. Miss Tully always refused to tell how much of the hall's cost she contributed, but she did not dispute reports that said she paid most of the $4.5 million.         She did say that one reason she was hesitant to accept the hall's dedication at first was that Philharmonic Hall and the New York State Theater had been acoustical disasters. "I did not want my name associated with a hall that would have bad acoustics," she told an interviewer in 1987. She changed her mind when Lincoln Center engaged Heinrich Keilholz, who had revamped Severance Hall in Cleveland in 1958, as acoustician.  More Space, Fewer Seats         She took an active hand in the hall's design, selecting the colors of the walls, seat covering and foyer carpeting. She paid particular attention to adequate leg room.         "I had spent so many, many hours cramped in narrow spaces, both here and in Europe, and I felt that this was something we should have," she said in the 1987 interview. "The architects disagreed, because what I wanted would have meant having three fewer rows. So I went to William Schuman, who was president of Lincoln Center at the time, and I said: 'You're a tall man. Wouldn't you like to sit comfortably? Do let us have one comfortable hall in New York City.' "         Mr. Schuman agreed, Miss Tully said. "So I drew a breath of relief. But I had to keep my eye on it just the same."         Later, after much personal research in Europe, she was deeply involved in selecting the Theodore Kuhn Company to build the hall's organ, which experts said cost well over $250,000.         When the hall was in the planning stages, Miss Tully encouraged the creation of its resident ensemble, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and was the chairwoman of its board for many years. She also served on the boards of the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and the Juilliard School of Music. Myriad Beneficiaries         In addition to her involvement with Lincoln Center, Miss Tully was an active supporter of dance, art and humanitarian organizations. She gave generously to the Martha Graham Dance Company and Eliot Feld's ballet troupe, and she was a board member of numerous other arts and educational institutions. She contributed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Frick Collection and the Morgan Library, among others.         Michael J. Spencer, a pianist who founded Hospital Audiences, which provides access to the arts for the disabled, said yesterday that when he began playing concerts in state mental hospitals in the 1960's he sought funds everywhere and only one organization responded. "It was something called the Maya Corporation, and it was only in the early 70's that I found out it was Alice Tully providing the funds." Miss Tully had founded the corporation to disperse cash gifts anonymously. Mr. Spencer added that he received a Maya donation only last week.         Miss Tully never wanted the extent of her largesse known. Irwin Scherzer, the manager of the Chamber Music Society in its early days and a close friend of Miss Tully, said: "She wouldn't know herself how much money she had donated. She did what she thought was best, where she thought it would do the most good."         Alice Bigelow Tully was born on Sept. 11, 1902, in Corning, N.Y. Her father, William J. Tully, was a lawyer and a two-term New York State senator. The actress Katharine Hepburn is her second cousin. When Mr. Tully became general counsel to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1908, the family moved to New York City, where Miss Tully attended Mrs. J. D. Randall MacIvor's School. Later she continued her studies at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn.  A Recital Inspired Her         Miss Tully often said that she decided to devote herself to music when she was 14 or 15 years old, after hearing a recital by the pianist Josef Hofmann. But although piano studies were part of her schooling, her first musical love was singing. In 1922, after studying voice in New York for three years, she went to Paris for seven years of study with Jean Perier, the baritone who created the role of Pelleas in Debussy's opera "Pelleas et Melisande," and with Miguel Fontecha and Therese Leschetizky.         Beginning as a mezzo-soprano and then moving to the dramatic soprano repertory, Miss Tully made her professional debut in 1927, when she sang works by Gluck, Franck, Chausson and Faure with the Pasdeloup Orchestra in Paris. Six years later she made her operatic debut at the Hippodrome in New York, singing Santuzza -- her best role, by her own estimation -- in a Salmaggi Opera production of Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana."         She also sang the title role in a production of Bizet's "Carmen" at the Manhattan Opera House in 1935, and through the late 1930's she performed frequently as a recitalist in Europe and the United States. Reviewing a 1937 Town Hall recital in The New York Times, Olin Downes wrote that Miss Tully's program was of "rare interest and artistic distinction" and praised her "musicianly zeal and catholicity of taste."         Miss Tully, looking back on her career in a 1982 interview with Harold C. Schonberg of The Times, said: "It may not have been the biggest career, but it was a good one. I was always concerned with the best in music, and I think I had something individual to offer."  Avid Amateur Pilot         With the outbreak of World War II, Miss Tully settled permanently in New York and continued her vocal studies. But she suspended her career to devote herself to the war effort. An avid amateur pilot, she joined the Civil Air Patrol and flew on submarine scouting missions. But she decided to "be of more use" and became a Red Cross nurse's aid at the French Hospital in Manhattan.         In 1950, Miss Tully stopped singing professionally because, she later said, she felt that her voice was losing its flexibility. Upon the death of her mother, Clara Houghton Tully, in 1958, Miss Tully inherited a substantial estate, and began her career as a philanthropist. It was at about that time that her cousin, Arthur Houghton Jr., one of the founders of Lincoln Center, approached her with the idea of contributing toward the concert hall that now bears her name.         The hall opened on Miss Tully's 67th birthday, Sept. 11, 1969, with a program by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. It was judged a superb setting for chamber music, both acoustically and visually, and the most successful of Lincoln Center's concert halls.         Miss Tully, who never married, was a tall, slender, regal woman with a friendly smile, a wry sense of humor, and a comprehensive knowledge of musical literature and the world of performers. After chamber music and art songs, her love was opera, particularly Wagner, and well into her 80's she regularly traveled to Europe to see new productions, keep track of singers and directors, and serve on competition juries. She was especially fond of the Spoleto Festival in Italy; its founder, Gian Carlo Menotti, wrote "Cantilene e Scherzo" and "Nocturne" for her. Others who dedicated works to her include Mr. Schuman, who wrote "A Round for Alice," and Riccardo Malipiero, who composed "Serenata per Alice Tully." Recipient of Many Honors         In 1970, Miss Tully was awarded a Handel Medallion, New York City's highest cultural award. She received the Gallatin Medal from New York University in 1976 for "contributions of lasting significance to society," was a recipient of the first National Medal of Arts in 1985, and received the American Red Cross Humanitarian Award in 1988. A devoted Francophile for most of her life, she received many honors from the French Government, and was made an officer in the French Legion of Honor.         Miss Tully's only sibling, a younger sister, Marion Tully Dimick of Washington, died in 1981.
