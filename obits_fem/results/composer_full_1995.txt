         Johana Harris, a pianist, composer and teacher and the widow of the composer Roy Harris, died on June 5 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 82.         Mrs. Harris, whose original name was Beula Duffey, was born in Ottawa on Dec. 31, 1912. In the early 1920's she studied with Henry Puddicombe, a student of Liszt, and at his suggestion she moved to New York in 1924 to study with Ernest Hutcheson at the Juilliard School. A year later, at the age of 17, she joined the Juilliard faculty as an assistant.         She married Roy Harris in 1937, and it was his idea to change her first name to Johana, in tribute to Johann Sebastian Bach.         Mrs. Harris began recording for RCA Victor soon after her marriage, and immediately caught the attention of the record world with the first recording of the difficult Busoni arrangement of the Bach Chaconne. She also recorded most of Beethoven's solo and chamber works, works by her husband, by Schoenberg, Debussy and Piston, and the Ginastera Piano Sonata, which was composed for her in 1952. All told, she made more than 100 recordings.         She was a member of the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles until 1993, and continued to perform until April 1994.         Mr. Harris died in 1979. Mrs. Harris is survived by her second husband, Jake Heggie of San Francisco; two sons, Shaun Harris of Livermore, Calif., and Dan Harris of Indio, Calif; three daughters, Patricia Connelly of Santa Monica, Calif., Maureen Forman of Palm Desert, Calif., and Lane Murray of Tahoe City, Calif., and a brother, Norman Duffey of Lakeland, Fla.       
         Esther Muir, a character actress who began her career on Broadway in the 1920's and went on to appear in some 70 films, died on Aug. 1 at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 92 and lived in Somers, N.Y.         Ms. Muir started modeling while still in high school in New York City and soon landed a role in a show called "Greenwich Village Follies." She went on to appear in the "Earl Carroll Vanities" and in "International Revue," a show that starred Gertrude Lawrence. Her big break came when she landed the title role in "My Girl Friday!" in 1929. Shortly thereafter, the columnist Walter Winchell introduced her to the Hollywood director and choreographer Busby Berkeley, whom she married. They were divorced in 1931.         In 1936 Ms. Muir toured with the Marx Brothers in a stage production of "A Day at the Races" while they gathered material for the film version, in which she also appeared. Her other screen credits include "I'll Take Romance," "City Girl" and "The Girl and the Gambler."         In the 1950's, Ms. Muir became a real-estate developer in Southern California, overseeing the construction of more than 400 tract homes.         Her second marriage, to the composer and producer Sam Coslow, ended in divorce in 1948.         She is survived by a daughter, Jacqueline Coslow of Manhattan, who is also an actress, and by two grandchildren.       
         Lillian Fuchs, a renowned violist, composer, teacher and keeper of musical tradition, died yesterday morning at the Actors Fund Nursing Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 91.         Lillian Fuchs Stein was "one of the best string players in America," Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times in 1962, and she went on to become one of the most respected string teachers in the world. She taught from 1962 to 1991 at the Manhattan School of Music, from 1964 to 1990 at the Aspen Music Festival and School, and from 1971 to 1993 at the Juilliard School, where she was an emeritus member of the faculty until her death.         Ms. Fuchs was born in 1903 in New York. She took up the piano at an early age, and she and her brother Joseph were taught violin by their father.         "I just developed quietly because nobody paid any attention to me even in my family," she told The Strad magazine in 1986. "They were always fussing over Joseph. I didn't mind at all. I was delighted to be left alone."         She studied violin with the noted Franz Kneisel at the New York Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School, and graduated with highest honors in 1924.         Ms. Fuchs made her New York debut on the violin in 1926, but soon shifted her concentration to viola. She collaborated often in performance with her brother Joseph and her other brother, Harry, a cellist. She played in a number of chamber groups, notably the Perole String Quartet and the Musicians Guild, and appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic and the Casals Festival Orchestra.         Ms. Fuchs was the first violist to perform and record the six Bach suites written for solo cello. "The measure of an artist is the silence he or she can inspire," Ross Parmenter wrote in The Times in 1948 of her performance of the Sixth Suite. "The silence for her performance was so intense that someone rattling cellophane in the back of the hall was an irritation to almost the whole audience."         Ms. Fuchs was an important teacher of chamber performance as well as of the viola. Her first pupil, she said in the 1986 Strad article, was "this boy from the West Coast": Isaac Stern. She also taught Pinchas Zukerman, and encouraged him to play viola as well as violin.         As a composer, she won several awards during her student years, and later wrote mainly for the viola.         Ms. Fuchs's husband, Ludwig Stein, died in 1992. She is survived by her brother Joseph; her daughters, Barbara Stein Mallow, a cellist, of Leonia, N.J., and Carol Stein Amado, a violinist, of Merion, Pa., and four grandchildren.         Services are to be held on Sunday afternoon at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street, Manhattan.         Correction:  October 10, 1995, Tuesday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Saturday about the violist and teacher Lillian Fuchs misstated the day of her death. She died on Thursday, not Friday.       
         Minna Lederman Daniel, who edited the influential magazine Modern Music for more than 20 years, died on Sunday at the Kateri Residence nursing home in Manhattan. She was 99.         Beginning in 1924, Modern Music chronicled concert music, jazz, musical theater, film, radio and dance in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Although the magazine, which was published quarterly, occasionally featured articles by distinguished European composers (among them Alban Berg, Bela Bartok and Arnold Schoenberg), its importance stemmed from its serious coverage of new American music.         Virgil Thomson, Aaron Copland, John Cage, Elliott Carter, Roger Sessions and Marc Blitzstein were regular contributors. The young Leonard Bernstein wrote for the magazine, as did Edwin Denby, the dance critic, whose career Mrs. Daniel helped nurture.         Mrs. Daniel in turn wielded considerable influence, Joan Peyser wrote in a 1983 article for The New York Times, and "probably shaped pre-World War II American music more than any single composer did."         Minna Lederman was born on March 17, 1896, in Manhattan. She studied music, drama and dance as a child and later attended Barnard College, from which she graduated in 1917.         In 1923 she helped form the League of Composers with a group of musicians and new-music enthusiasts. "Everybody was terribly upset that the first concerts given by the league had been so badly reviewed," she recalled in 1983. "The critics had absolutely no knowledge. At the time we were receiving those splendid little magazines from abroad -- like La Revue Musicale -- and someone said, 'Let's have a magazine.' So I undertook to do it."         The first issue was published in February 1924. It was originally called The  League of Composers' Review, but the name was changed the following year. When the magazine stopped publication in 1946, brought down by rising costs and ideological dissent within the League of Composers, many critics paid tribute. "It afforded information and informed editorial comment upon contemporaneous tendencies in music not to be found elsewhere," Olin Downes wrote in The Times.         Mrs. Daniel continued to write on music and dance. She edited the anthology "Stravinsky in the Theater" (1947) and contributed to American Mercury, Saturday Review, The Nation and other periodicals.         In 1974 she established the Archives of Modern Music in the Library of Congress, and in 1983 she assembled "The Life and Death of a Small Magazine," a  monograph published by the Institute for Studies in American Music. This compilation of articles, written for Modern Music by some of its most celebrated contributors and held together by Mrs. Daniel's commentary, won the ASCAP Deems  Taylor Award for distinguished music criticism in 1984.         Mrs. Daniel's husband, Mell Daniel, a painter, died in 1975.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Mercedes Rossy, a pianist, composer and bandleader, died on Thursday in Barcelona, Spain. She was 34.         The cause was intestinal cancer, said her brother Jorge.         Ms. Rossy, who studied classical piano from the age of 6, began playing jazz seriously in the early 1980's. In 1985 she moved to Munich, Germany, where she performed regularly. Four years later she won a scholarship to the Berklee School of Music in Boston, where she remained until her graduation in 1992.         It was at Berklee that she met many of the musicians with whom she later performed, some of the better players of her generation. Her band, with which she toured Europe, included the saxophonists Mark Turner and Steve Wilson. She also played with the saxophonists Herb Harris, Seamus Blake and Antonio Hart, the trombonist Hal Crook and the drummer Leon Parker.         Ms. Rossy performed frequently around New York and was to play at Small's in  January. In addition to her brother Jorge, a drummer, of New York, she is survived by her parents, Mario and Josefina, and another brother, Mario, a bassist, all of Barcelona.       
         Nancy LaMott, a cabaret singer and recording artist whose unadorned, heartfelt interpretations of songs epitomized the best of what could be called an all-American style of traditional pop singing, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 43.         The cause was cancer, said her manager, Scott Barnes.         In the last two years, Ms. LaMott had achieved a national reputation, and her recently released fifth album, "Listen to My Heart" (Midder Music), recorded with the arranger Peter Matz, received critical acclaim. In a cabaret field typified by showy histrionics, Ms. LaMott was a singularly unaffected voice. She brought to everything she sang a clean, clear sense of line, impeccable enunciation and a deep understanding of how a good song could convey a lifetime's experience.         Ms. LaMott, born in Midland, Mich., was a self-taught musician who began singing with her father's band in her hometown. In the late 1970's, she moved to San Francisco, where she sang at the Plush Room and other local clubs. Arriving  in New York in the early 1980's, she worked as a cocktail waitress and a singer  at the Duplex and Don't Tell Mama. She also did demonstration records of theater songs by composers like Alan Menken, Marvin Hamlisch and Cy Coleman. In 1983, she was featured in the cabaret revue "It's Better With a Band," a show at Don't Tell Mama that featured the lyrics of David Zippel. The next year, she teamed up with Christopher Marlowe, who became her longtime accompanist and musical director.         In 1990, she met the composer David Friedman and his companion, Mr. Barnes, who became her manager. Together with Mr. Zippel they produced her first album,  "Beautiful Baby," in 1991. Four more recordings followed. For her second album,  "Come Rain or Come Shine: The Songs of Johnny Mercer" (1993), she was named best female vocalist by the Manhattan Association of Cabarets. The following year, her third album, "My Foolish Heart," was chosen record of the year by the same organization. Her fourth album, a holiday collection, "Just in Time for Christmas," was released a year ago.         Ms. LaMott was plagued with illness for much of her life. At 17, she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, an ulcerative intestinal disorder. An operation  in 1993 reversed many of her symptoms and allowed her recording and singing career to blossom. In addition to her recordings, she made television appearances on "Good Morning America," "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee," "Today" and "The Charles Grodin Show."         She is survived by her husband, Peter Zapp, an actor whom she married on her  deathbed; by her parents, Judy and Jack LaMott, and three brothers and three sisters.       
         Alexina Duchamp, the widow of Marcel Duchamp, died on Wednesday at her home in Villiers-sous-Grez, near Paris. She was 89.         As a former daughter-in-law of Henri Matisse, the widow of Duchamp and a close friend of John Cage and Jasper Johns, she was in her later years the unquestioned doyenne of the survivors of a great age in art, dance and music.         She had close ties to Philadelphia and took pride in being an honorary trustee of its Museum of Art, which has by far the largest collection of Duchamp's work. She was delighted when in 1967 his last major work, the scenographic "Etant Donnes," or "Given," was installed there.         "Etant Donnes" had been built in secret in New York between 1964 and 1966, a  time when Duchamp was believed to have stopped working forever. During much of its construction, Mrs. Duchamp was her husband's sole confidante.         Alexina Sattler was born in Cincinnati on Jan. 6, 1906, the daughter of Dr. Robert Sattler, an ophthalmologist who ran his own hospital with a free clinic attached, and his second wife, the former Agnes Mitchell.         She at first thought of becoming an artist and for a time studied sculpture with Brancusi in Paris. In December 1929 she married the son of Henri Matisse, Pierre, who was to become a distinguished art dealer on Madison Avenue. When her husband was mobilized in Paris at the outbreak of World War II, she ran the gallery for some months.         After a divorce from Pierre Matisse in 1949, she married Duchamp in 1954. They lived in New York, in Paris and in the summer in Cadaques in northern Spain. After Duchamp's death in 1968, she became close to the composer Cage and  to a new circle of friends.         She is survived by the three children of her marriage to Matisse, Jacqueline, Paul and Peter, and by 12 grandchildren.       
         Heida Hermanns, a pianist, teacher and philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 89.         Mrs. Hermanns was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, in 1906. She received her first piano lessons from her mother, Alice Goldschmidt Hermanns, and when she was 15 she enrolled at the Berlin Hochschule fur Musik. Her teachers included Egon Petri, Artur Schnabel, Carl Friedberg and Isabella Vengerova.         She made her debut with the Berlin Philharmonic when she was 18 and toured Europe as a recitalist and concerto soloist through the 1920's and early 1930's. In 1931 she married Artur Holde, a music critic and author. They immigrated to the United States in 1936.         Mrs. Hermanns made her New York debut at Town Hall in 1942, and gave annual recitals that often included works by Busoni, Dussek, Kodaly and other composers whose works were not in the mainstream repertory. Her interest in unusual works  brought her to the attention of the Society for Forgotten Music, with which she  appeared several times.         As a chamber music player, Mrs. Hermanns performed regularly with John Corigliano, the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic (and the father of the composer of the same name). She also gave duo-piano recitals and made recordings with Ruth Steinkraus Cohen.         In the late 1940's, Mrs. Hermanns and Mr. Holde moved to Westport, where they helped start the Friends of Music, an organization that presented chamber music concerts, there. Mrs. Hermanns was also a founder of Performers of Connecticut, which arranged performance opportunities for young musicians and ran a contest that two years ago was renamed the Heida Hermanns Young Performers Competition.         She was also a supporter of the Levitt Pavilion for the Performing Arts. When the Westport Arts Center was built in the mid-1980's, she underwrote its concert hall, which is called Artur Holde Hall after her husband, who died in 1962.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Felicia Geffen, a former executive director of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, died on Dec. 21 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         She had been suffering from leukemia and osteoporosis, said her daughter, Eloise B. Segal.         Miss Geffen was born in New York City on Feb. 16, 1903. She was a graduate of Hunter College and studied music before becoming an administrative assistant to the conductor and composer Walter Damrosch, whom she succeeded as director of the academy in 1941. Upon her retirement in 1973 she was presented with an award for distinguished service to the arts.         Ms. Geffen's husband, the muralist Stuyvesant Van Veen, died in 1988.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by two grandchildren.       
         Sidney Robertson Cowell, an ethnomusicologist, writer and the widow of the composer Henry Cowell, died on Thursday at her home in Shady, N.Y., said Sean Hartnett, her executor. She was 92.         In her extensive travels from 1937 to 1957, Mrs. Cowell recorded American, Finnish, Irish, Portuguese, Iranian and Turkish folk music, among other types. Her collection, housed in the Library of Congress, is among the most extensive ever gathered and includes some of the earliest documentation of ethnic music in the United States. It holds not only field recordings, but also correspondence, field notes, photographs, articles and other materials.         She was born in San Francisco in 1903 and received a bachelor of arts in philology and Romance languages from Stanford University in 1924. After graduating, she studied piano in Paris with the pianist and teacher Alfred Cortot.         In 1935-36, she directed the social music program at the Henry Street Settlement in New York City. The next year, she worked for the Resettlement Administration (renamed the Farm Security Administration) in Appalachia and the Ozarks, recording black American music in chain-gang road camps.         She met Cowell in 1927 as his piano student. They were married in 1941 and together they traveled as cultural ambassadors for the State Department, collecting music from around the world. After his death in 1965, she became one of the biggest champions of his music.         Mrs. Cowell was also a teacher and writer. She taught courses in American folk music at the University of Southern California, and was an author, with her husband, of "Charles Ives and His Music" (1955).         No immediate family members survive.       
         Loyce Houlton, a leader in American regional dance and a choreographer whose works were performed by companies in the United States and Europe, died on Tuesday at United Hospital in St. Paul. She was 70 and lived in Minneapolis.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter, Lise Houlton Gilliland, a former member of American Ballet Theater and the Stuttgart Ballet.         Mrs. Houlton favored a rhapsodic choreographic style that combined ballet with various modern-dance techniques. She created more than 90 works, many of them to contemporary music, and her Minnesota Dance Theater became known for its experimental productions. Ballets by her have also been presented by Dance Theater of Harlem, the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Deutsche Oper Ballet of Berlin.         A tiny and perpetually restless woman, Mrs. Houlton liked to say to students: "Explode! Be voracious in space." Yet for the last two decades of her life, she was in chronic ill health. Undaunted, she once said in an interview that her illness had significantly changed her choreography. "I have more courage now," she declared.         Mrs. Houlton, a native of Duluth, Minn., studied dance at Carleton College and New York University and at several New York ballet and modern-dance schools. After settling in Minneapolis, she founded the Contemporary Dance Playhouse in 1962; seven years later, it was renamed Minnesota Dance Theater. Financial problems in 1986 forced the company to disband. But in the last few years, Mrs. Houlton had attempted to reorganize it, and last summer, it revived two of her important works: her version of Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring," and "Ancient Air," to music by George Crumb, an American composer she particularly admired.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Dr. William Houlton; three sons, Laif, Joel and Andrew, and four grandchildren, all of Minneapolis, and two sisters, Jewell Kraemer of Wausau, Wis., and Ardeth Becher of St. Paul.
