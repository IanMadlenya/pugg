         Ruby Keeler, the innocent-faced tap-dancing sweetheart of nine Warner Brothers musicals in the 1930's, died yesterday morning at her home in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 82 years old.         The cause of death was cancer, said her daughter Kathleen Lowe.         In seven of those musicals, including "42d Street," "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "Footlight Parade," Miss Keeler was teamed with Dick Powell, and they became one of the most popular screen couples of the early 1930's. Among the songs she introduced were "Shuffle Off to Buffalo," "42d Street," "Honeymoon Hotel," "She's a Latin From Manhattan" and "Too Marvelous for Words."  A Comeback at 60         In 1971, 30 years after she had retired from show business, Miss Keeler starred on Broadway in a revival of the 1925 musical "No, No, Nanette." The show, which ran for 871 performances, was among the season's surprise hits and won warm critical notices for its star, whose return to show business at the age of 60 was hailed one of the most remarkable show business comebacks in years.         Miss Keeler was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Aug. 25, 1910, and moved to New York City with her family when she was 4. At the age of 13, after receiving three months of dance instruction, she got her first job in the chorus of the George M. Cohan show "The Rise of Rosie O'Reilly." For the next three years she worked in New York nightclubs, and in 1926, she was discovered at a dance contest by Earl Lindsay, a stage director who cast her in the Broadway revue "Bye, Bye, Bonnie."         At her next Broadway appearance, in the musical "Lucky," she was spotted by Florenz Ziegfeld, who offered her a role in the musical "Whoopee," starring Eddie Cantor. But before rehearsals began, she went to Los Angeles for a brief stage engagement. There she met Al Jolson, whom she married in 1928. Although signed to star in the Ziegfeld extravaganza "Show Girl," she dropped out of the show during tryouts to join Jolson on the West Coast. Five years later she made her film debut in the movie musical "42d Street."         In the film, which is regarded as the quintessential backstage musical, Miss Keeler played Peggy Sawyer, a smiling young member of the chorus line who takes over for the leading lady on opening night, saves the show, and finds happiness with Billy Lawler (Mr. Powell). Among the numbers she sang were "Shuffle Off to Buffalo" and the title song. Busby Berkeley's Style         The film introduced the elaborately choreographed routines of Busby Berkeley in which dozens of toe-tapping, high-kicking dancers were arranged in fantastic kaleidoscopic designs. After its success, the same formula was applied to "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "Footlight Parade," which also teamed Miss Keeler with Powell, and again had choreography by Berkeley and songs by Harry Warren and Al Dubin.         Miss Keeler went on to star in six more films for Warners before leaving the studio at Jolson's insistence. The films included "Dames" and "Flirtation Walk" (both 1934), "Go Into Your Dance" (her only film with Jolson) and "Shipmates Forever" (both 1935), "Colleen" (1936) and "Ready, Willing and Able" (1937).         "Mother Carey's Chickens" (1938), under a new contract with RKO, was a failure. She made her last film, "Sweetheart of the Campus," in 1941.         In 1940, her marriage to Jolson ended, and she retained custody of their 5-year-old adopted son, Al Jr. The next year, she married John Homer Lowe, a real estate broker in Pasadena, Calif., and retired. They had three daughters and a son.  An Association Spokeswoman         Shortly after her husband's death in 1969, the producer Harry Rigby called Miss Keeler and invited her to return to Broadway in "No, No, Nanette." Her name had been suggested, he said, by Berkeley, the show's production supervisor, who was then 74. Miss Keeler ended up staying with the show for its full two-year run and then touring with it for two more years.         In 1974, Miss Keeler had a brain aneurysm. She later became spokeswoman for the National Stroke Association, which established the Ruby Keeler Fellowship Memorial.         In addition to her daughter Ms. Lowe and her son Al Jolson Jr., she is survived by another son, John Lowe Jr., and two other daughters, Theresa Hall and Christine Pratt.       
         Helen Hayes, the tiny actress whose big-hearted portrayals of Queen Victoria and other regal women helped make her one of the century's best-loved stars, died yesterday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 92 and lived in Nyack.         The cause was heart failure, said John Springer, her longtime press agent and friend. Miss Hayes was admitted to the hospital on March 9 suffering from congestive heart failure and irregular heartbeat.         The human warmth and masterly acting technique that Miss Hayes brought to the stage and screen earned her many triumphs in her long career. She was one of the three great women of the American theater, with Katharine Cornell and Lynn Fontanne, in its glory days of the 1920's and 30's. Lights Dimmed on Broadway         In tribute to the actress, who was often called the First Lady of the American theater, Broadway marquees were dimmed for one minute last night at 8 P.M.         Miss Hayes's greatest stage success was the 1935 drama "Victoria Regina," in which she played the long-lived British monarch from girlhood to widowhood, aging visibly from act to act thanks to the makeup artist's skill, and her own.         Her other stage triumphs included the title roles in "Mary of Scotland" (1933) and "Harriet" (1943), about Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her first great success was in "Coquette" in 1927, and her last was in the 1970 revival of "Harvey."         Miss Hayes won an Academy Award for best actress for her first major film role, in "The Sin of Madelon Claudet" (1931). She went on to star in screen hits including "Arrowsmith" (1931) opposite Ronald Colman, "A Farewell to Arms" (1932) with Gary Cooper, and "Night Flight" (1933), in which she joined John Barrymore in an all-star cast. In 1971 she won a second Oscar, as best supporting actress, for "Airport."         With her bright eyes and elfin smile, Miss Hayes's looks were highly winsome, and through sheer grace and stagecraft she was able to convey an impression of downright beauty when she chose. Although she was only 5 feet tall and weighed a mere 100 pounds, she could also create an aura of strength and weight and splendor if a role required one.         "Tremulously magnificent" was the way Brooks Atkinson, as drama critic of The New York Times, described her opening-night performance in "Victoria Regina." "Since the Queen is dead, God rest her soul," he wrote, "let the cheers go to her actress, who deserves all the homage the town contains."         And audiences did cheer, again and again over the years, partly because of Miss Hayes's skill and versatility -- she performed comedy and drama with equal skill -- and partly because her warmheartedness always put them on her side. An Active Role In Public Life         Once Miss Hayes was established as a great star, she threw herself into many areas of public life. She was president of the American Theater Wing and the American National Theater and Academy and was the national chairwoman of women's activities for the March of Dimes. She was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church, was denied its sacraments after marrying the playwright Charles MacArthur -- who had been divorced -- and returned to the church after his death in 1956. In 1979, she received an award from the Catholic Interracial Council of New York for her work "to combat racial and religious bigotry and discrimination in our society."         Her own view of her success and eminence was modest. "Without the compensation of glamour, I am hard put to explain the durability of my career and the loyalty of the audience," she wrote in "On Reflection," a volume of memoirs published in 1968.         "Perhaps it is just identification," she went on. "I was once the typical daughter, then the easily recognizable wife, and then the quintessential mother. I seem always to have reminded people of someone in their family. Perhaps I am just the triumph of Plain Jane." Hard Work And Unworldliness         Hers was also a triumph of hard work. Over the years she became the consummate theater professional, literally down to her toes: early in her career she had a nervous habit of making her body rigid when she felt insecure onstage, but she eventually trained herself to work off her tension less conspicuously, by simply curling her toes.         Even after she became well known, Miss Hayes remained somewhat unsophisticated and shy in private, although her husband was a high-living sophisticate who cut a dashing figure in cafe society.         When she was in her late 20's and already a stage veteran, the producer Jed Harris remarked after talking to her that she was ignorant, but he later said admiringly that "as an actress, her instinct was always perfect."         Miss Hayes liked to tell stories about her own unworldliness. There was the time, for instance, when her husband took her to call on the writer Gertrude Stein and Miss Stein's friend Alice B. Toklas in their Paris home. Although the walls were decorated with fine paintings, Miss Hayes later recalled, "Nothing impressed me more than Alice B. Toklas's mustache."         One long-ago day in Hollywood, as Miss Hayes told it, Clark Gable sent her "a mash note" -- evidently inviting her to an assignation -- but she ignored it. Years later he went backstage to see her, gave a dimpled smile and said, "You were too shy, weren't you, Helen?"         Simplicity and virtue were Miss Hayes's by birthright, along with a yearning for the stage. Helen Hayes Brown was born on Oct. 10, 1900, in Washington, the only child of Francis Van Arnum Brown, a pork and poultry salesman, and Catherine Estelle Hayes Brown, a sometime actress who remained stagestruck all her life. Catherine Brown was a great-niece of an Irish-born singer, Catherine Hayes, who was known as "the Swan of Erin" in California in the Gold Rush days.         Helen did her first acting barely after her days as a toddler, when she was known in her family as "the white mouse." It was a part in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Holy Cross Academy, a Washington school that emphasized theatricals. She also did some singing at galas organized by her dancing school, Miss Minnie Hawke's School of Dance. When she was 6 years old, Lew Fields, a producer and star of musical comedies, heard one of her singing performances and was impressed.         Mrs. Brown was delighted to encourage her daughter as a performer, and soon afterward Helen made her professional stage debut in a local stock production of "The Prince Chap." She also appeared in summer stock in subsequent years. Meeting Destiny At the Age of 8         Deciding that her daughter was destined for an upper-crust life, Mrs. Brown took in washing to pay for French lessons to supplement the curriculum of the Sacred Heart Academy in Washington, where Helen was enrolled. Thus prepared, mother and daughter, then 8 years old, took the train to New York and waited outside Mr. Fields's office. Then destiny beckoned: he emerged, remembered Helen and signed her for a principal role in Victor Herbert's "Old Dutch" at the old Herald Square Theater.         She went on to appear in several other stage productions overseen by Mr. Fields, and she began her film career in an early "quickie," "Jean and the Calico Doll," made in the old Vitagraph Studio in Brooklyn.         At the age of 13 she was hired to perform with the renowned John Drew in a romantic comedy, "The Prodigal Husband," produced by Charles Frohman, which opened in 1914 at the old Empire Theater at 40th Street and Broadway. The play was undistinguished, but Miss Hayes shone.         Mr. Frohman, one of the titans of the theater, went down with the Lusitania in 1915 and so was not able to quash the false rumors -- which circulated for years -- that Miss Hayes was actually his illegitimate daughter by Maude Adams, a stage star of the day. "No one knows where these canards get their start," Miss Hayes wrote in "On Reflection." "I only know that they are hard to finish off."         After graduating from the Sacred Heart Academy back in Washington, she went on at the age of 20 to win her first star billing, for her part as a flapper in the play "Bab," which opened in New York in 1920. But as she later recalled, "On opening night, I gave one of those shrill, tense performances that became a hazard in my career whenever I was not in top form."         She was crushed when the reviewer Heywood Broun criticized her acting, dismissing her as "cute," which is what the critics kept calling her for years. A columnist once said she suffered from "fallen archness."         To forestall such complaints, Miss Hayes worked hard at improving her voice and delivery and tried to make her performances consistent. She also worked hard at seeming taller. "My posture became military," she later recalled. "I became the tallest five-foot woman in the world."         By the mid-20's, she was highly popular as a light comedian, despite critical ups and downs, and she caught the eye of Mr. Harris, the producer, with her poignant performance in the 1926 revival of the James M. Barrie comedy "What Every Woman Knows."         Years later, Mr. Harris reported, "Her subtlety and power astounded me; I thought she could do anything." He chose her for the leading role in the 1927 play "Coquette," about a well-born Southern girl, made pregnant by a hillbilly, who kills herself. Other theater people had doubts about casting Miss Hayes in the part, but when the curtain rang down on opening night, she received thunderous applause.         "I have never seen anything quite like the ovation Miss Hayes received that night," Mr. Harris said later. After 16 curtain calls, "the applause was still as strong and solid as it had been when the curtain fell."  Emeralds, Peanuts And a Lifelong Love         It was in a glittering New York salon that Miss Hayes, still rather shy, met Mr. MacArthur. In her best-selling 1990 autobiography, "My Life in Three Acts," written with Katherine Hatch, she recalled: "I picked up a glass of sherry to fit in and retreated to a secluded niche. Twenty minutes later, a good-looking fellow with curly brown hair and sparkling green eyes came over, maybe because he felt sorry for me sitting there all alone. He held out a small paper bag. 'Wanna peanut?' he asked. 'Thanks,' I said. He poured a few in my hand and said, 'I wish they were emeralds.' Right then and there I fell in love."         (That story was told so often in later years that he once said, "There ought to be a statute of limitations on lovelorn remarks." And in 1945, returning from a sojourn in India, he dropped a sack of emeralds in her lap and said, "I wish they were peanuts.")         The complex courtship that ensued -- Mr. MacArthur was married at the time -- came to a suspenseful culmination on the summer night in 1928 when his raffish play of newspaper life, "The Front Page," opened in New York. Miss Hayes was still appearing in "Coquette," but Mr. Harris closed the show for that day so she could watch the first night of "The Front Page."         "I was nervous," Miss Hayes recalled years later. "I knew Charlie wouldn't marry me unless he had a hit."         She took a seat in the balcony while the nervous Mr. MacArthur and his co-author, Ben Hecht, sat on a fire escape outside.         "A few minutes into the first act I knew we were in," Miss Hayes wrote in "My Life." "The Tribune critic was chuckling and pounding his companion on the back. The audience was breaking up with laughter. I ran to the fire escape and shouted, 'It's a hit!' Whereupon Charlie opened his arms and asked, 'Will you marry me, Helen?' "         Soon afterward his divorce came through, they wed (Harpo Marx sent the bride a Steinway piano crate filled with gardenias) and in all the rest of her life, Miss Hayes wrote, "I never loved another man."         Miss Hayes gave birth to her daughter, Mary, in February 1930. Later that year she acted in "Mr. Gilhooley," a flop, and "Petticoat Influence," which was only a moderate success, as was "The Good Fairy" in 1931.         Then Miss Hayes acted in her first Hollywood film, "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," a sob story that was notably teary even by Hollywood standards. She played Madelon, a woman who made degrading sacrifices so that her illegitimate son could become a doctor. Her First Queen: 'Mary of Scotland'         When Miss Hayes returned to Broadway in "Mary of Scotland," she was such a box-office draw that for many months it was difficult to buy tickets; the Maxwell Anderson drama, about the 16th-century Mary Queen of Scots, was a tremendous hit. Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times: "Slight as she is in stature (and Mary was six feet tall), Miss Hayes raises herself to queendom by the transcendence of her spirit."         She did even better in "Victoria Regina." Mr. Atkinson said her ability "to encompass in one evening the youth, maturity and venerability of one human being" was "a humbling personal triumph."         After some disappointing roles, Miss Hayes was again the toast of Broadway in "Harriet." She also won praise for her acting in Anita Loos's robustly commercial "Happy Birthday" (1946), and, after appearing in Josh Logan's disappointing "Wisteria Trees" (1950), she came back strong in Mary Chase's farce "Mrs. McThing" (1952) and also won praise for her part in the revival of Thornton Wilder's "Skin of Our Teeth" that opened at the ANTA Theater (now the Virginia) in 1955.         In her later years, she appeared on television and undertook repertory with the APA-Phoenix company in works ranging from Sheridan to Pirandello to George Kelly. She also had parts in several Walt Disney films, including "One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing" (1975).         In "My Life" Miss Hayes recalled deciding to retire from the stage in 1972, while she was performing in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" in Washington. "My career had begun in Washington and it would end there," she wrote. "I liked the idea of a circle being completed." An Epitaph Written Onstage         Her stage career also inspired another valedictory touch. In 1990 she told an audience of female journalists in Hollywood about a scene in "Victoria Regina" in which a tough-looking man bursts through a police line at Queen Victoria's 90th-birthday celebration and yells: "Go it, old girl. You've done well."         Miss Hayes told the journalists, "I've always meant, since I heard that line, to have it put on my tombstone."         Along with her achievements, Miss Hayes had great sadnesses in her life. Her daughter, Mary, a novice actress, died of polio in 1949, and Miss Hayes then spoke and wrote movingly of her grief. In her 1990 book she wrote that her own husband, Mr. MacArthur, "set about killing himself" with drink after Mary's death. "It took seven years," Miss Hayes wrote, "and it was harrowing to watch."         Earlier, in 1938, Miss Hayes and her husband adopted a son, James MacArthur, when he was 7 months old. He grew up to be a television actor, best known for the series "Hawaii Five-O." She is survived by Mr. MacArthur, of Palm Desert, Calif., and three grandchildren.         During her career, Miss Hayes received Emmy, Tony and other awards for her stage performances, and honorary degrees from Smith College, Princeton, Columbia and Fordham Universities and other institutions. President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, presented her with the nation's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1986. She was also a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1981.         Miss Hayes was further honored by having various institutions and programs named for her, notably the annual Helen Hayes Awards, given for artistic achievement in the professional theater in Washington, and the Helen Hayes Theater in Manhattan. In 1955, the Fulton Theater on West 46th Street was named in her honor. When that theater, along with the Morosco, was torn down in 1982 to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel, angering many theater professionals and preservationists, Miss Hayes declined the hotel developers' request to name the new theater within the hotel for her. Instead, the Little Theater, an older theater on West 44th Street, was renamed the Helen Hayes. Performances Of a Lifetime         In more than 60 years on stage and screen, Helen Hayes tried her hand at a constellation of roles, playing flappers and flibbertigibbets, matrons and monarchs. Here is a selected list of her credits.

         Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won several Emmy awards for her work on Olympics broadcasts for ABC Sports, died yesterday at her home in West Tisbury, Mass. She was 63 and also lived in Vail, Colo.         The cause of death was cancer of the uterus, said her son, Robert P. Riger of Manhattan.         In 1973, Ms. Sanger became one of the first female producers in network television sports when she was hired by ABC to develop women's programs. Over the next decade, she produced dozens of programs for the network, including parts of Olympic broadcasts from Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1980 and Los Angeles in 1984.         She left ABC in 1985 and moved to London, but continued working part-time for the network and also produced programs for other organizations. She was a member of several professional groups and also was an adjunct lecturer in the media arts department at the University of Arizona.         Ms. Sanger was born Sept. 15, 1929, in Hong Kong and attended Smith College before earning a master's degree in public law and government at Columbia University. Before joining ABC Sports, she worked for several other television and news organizations.         In addition to her son, she is survived by three other children, Christopher Riger of Myrtle Beach, S.C., Victoria Riger Phillips of New Orleans, and Charlotte Riger Hull of West Tisbury, Mass.; a sister, Helen Sanger of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.         Correction:  March 9, 1993, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won Emmy awards for sports broadcasts, misidentified one of her residences. It was Vail, Ariz., not Colorado.       
         Patricia Peardon, the actress who created the central role in "Junior Miss" on Broadway, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said her daughter Christine Noel Cameron of Manhattan.         Miss Peardon grew up in Allendale, N.J., and first began acting at the age of 8 on such radio programs as "Cavalcade of America" and "March of Time."  A Sassy Teen-Ager         In 1941, when she was 17, she made her Broadway debut at the Lyceum Theater in the hit comedy "Junior Miss," after having been discovered in an audition by the play's director, Moss Hart. Miss Peardon originated the role of Judy Graves, a sassy but frequently muddled adolescent.         Miss Peardon "is acting the central part of the younger sister like an inspired bear cub," said Brooks Atkinson in his review in The New York Times.         While starring in the play, Miss Peardon appeared on the cover of Life on Dec. 11, 1941, the week after Pearl Harbor was bombed; it was too late for the magazine's editors to change the cover.         In the early 1950's she acted in the television series "Johnny Jupiter," and in 1955, on Broadway, she played the spitfire younger daughter in the Tony Award-winning play "The Desperate Hours," acting with Paul Newman and Karl Malden.         In the 1950's and 60's, Miss Peardon toured with Arnold Moss's Shakespeare Festival Players in "The Tempest," "Measure for Measure," "Twelfth Night," "King Lear" and "Love's Labour's Lost," and performed in the 1960's at the American Festival Theater at Stratford, Conn.  As a Sculptor         In 1966, she began exhibiting and selling cast bronze sculptures, which were displayed three times in the windows at Tiffany & Company in Manhattan. Her work was also shown at many galleries, at Tufts University, and at the Metropolitan Opera House and Avery Fisher Hall.         Miss Peardon was married three times: to Peter Kalischer, a broadcast journalist; to Peter Brandt Harmon, a writer, and to Richard Horner, a producer. The marriages ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Cameron, she is survived by another daughter, Anne Cameron of Albuquerque, N.M., and a grandson, Alexander Cameron Little.       
         Nancy Quinn, the artistic director of Young Playwrights, an award-winning program dedicated to developing the talents of young writers, died on Saturday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 46.         The cause was a heart attack, said Sheri M. Goldhirsch, the managing director of Young Playwrights.         Ms. Quinn was born in Salinas, Calif. She grew up in Larchmont, N.Y., and graduated from Finch College in Manhattan. She began her career as an assistant to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Charles Gordone during the production of "No Place to Be Somebody" at the Public Theater.         For the next 25 years, she worked with other young playwrights, first as coordinator of the National Playwrights Conference at the O'Neill Center in Waterford, Conn.,, then as associate producer at Arena Stage in Washington.         Ms. Quinn joined Young Playwrights in 1987. As producing director, then artistic director, she oversaw the group's annual Young Playwrights Festival. Under her guidance, submissions for the Festival, which features the work of three to five young playwrights each year, have increased from 600 entries a year to almost 950 this year.         Ms. Quinn also developed programs to reach into New York City's poorer neighborhoods. One, "Take a Grown-Up to the Theater," gives free tickets to students and lets them take an adult along. Another, the Young Playwrights Tour, takes plays to schools and youth centers throughout New York City.         At her death, Ms. Quinn had been working with Helios Productions to develop a series of "Schoolbreak Specials" written by Young Playwrights Festival alumni for CBS television.         She is survived by her husband, Paul King; her mother, Kathleen Quinn of Larchmont; a sister, Patricia Quinn of Los Angeles, and a brother, Michael, also of Los Angeles.       
         Eugenie Leontovich, an actress, playwright, director and teacher who created memorable roles on Broadway in "Grand Hotel," "Twentieth Century" and "Anastasia," died yesterday at the Kateri Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 93.         The cause was cardiac arrest and pneumonia, said Dr. Joseph Klager, a doctor at the nursing home.         Miss Leontovich was born in Moscow on March 21, 1900. Before the Revolution, she was a member of the Moscow Art Theater and studied under several legendary teachers, including Meyerhold. Her father, a military officer, fought with the White Army, as did her three brothers, who were subsequently captured, tortured and killed by the Bolsheviks.  A Hecht-MacArthur Star         A passionate anti-Communist, Miss Leontovich made her way to Paris after the Revolution and, in 1922, to the United States. She won favorable notices in 1930 on Broadway as Grusinskaya, the dancer, in "Grand Hotel." "She has the dignity, the pleading sincerity of an artist -- all nerves and pride," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times.         In 1932 she played Lilly Garland in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's comedy "Twentieth Century." Her first appearance on the London stage was in 1935, as the Archduchess in "Tovarich," opposite Sir Cedric Hardwicke.         With Elena Miramova she wrote "Dark Eyes," about three female Russian refugees trying to survive in New York. Produced by Jed Harris, the play opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for 230 performances.         Miss Leontovich also created the role of the Dowager Empress in the 1954 Broadway production of "Anastasia," which starred Viveca Lindfors. She played the Queen in William Saroyan's "Cave Dwellers" in 1957, and Mme. Kuprin in "A Call on Kuprin" in 1961. In 1972, she did her own adaptation of Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" Off Broadway; she titled it "Anna K." and both directed and starred in it.         Miss Leontovich, whose students addressed her and referred to her as "Madame," lived in a Manhattan apartment surrounded by family pictures and icons. Lithe, with an erect carriage that made her look taller than her 5 feet, she spoke in heavily accented English and favored dramatic speech. When asked about her traditional outfit of black trousers, black sweater and black scarf, she would respond, "I'm in mourning for my life." The line was from Chekhov's "Sea Gull."  Two Marriages         Miss Leontovich's two marriages ended in divorce. According to her official biography, her first husband, Paul A. Sokolov, was a member of the Russian nobility. Her second husband was the actor, producer and director Gregory Ratoff. "We met in Moscow, we were married in 1923, and that was the last of my legal marriages," she said of Mr. Ratoff in an interview in 1972. "He left me for a Georgian woman from Russia. She was beautiful. He left me our house in California, half of his money, and they went off to Italy."         Miss Leontovich also acted in films and television. Her best-known movie is perhaps "The Rains of Ranchipur," a 1955 remake of "The Rains Came" (1939), with Richard Burton and Lana Turner.         For seven years in the 1960's Miss Leontovich was an artist in residence at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She also taught acting in California and New York.       
         Edna Amadon Toney, a writer, an actress and a producer, died on Tuesday at her home in Katonah, N.Y. She was 79.         Her husband, Anthony, said the cause was liver cancer.         Mrs. Toney began her acting career with the WPA Theater Project in New York in the 1930's and was a writer for the "Kraft Music Hall" radio show, also in New York, in the mid-1940's.         From 1972 to 1984 she produced and acted at various community centers, colleges and libraries, including the Mid-Hudson Arts and Science Center in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and the Katonah Community Theater.         She was the author of several books, including "How to Become a Famous Playwright" and "Stuff and Nonsense." Her books were published by her under the name of Hanotak Kroywen (Katonah, New York, spelled backward).         Mrs. Toney was born in Manhattan and studied at the New Theater School, Columbia University and the New School for Social Research.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Anita Karen Toney of Fairfax, Calif., and Adele Susan Toney of Syracuse.       
         Joyce Haber, known for her barbed commentaries as one of the last of Hollywood's powerful gossip columnists and the author of a best-selling book on the movie industry, died on Thursday at a hospital in Los Angeles.  Her age was variously given as 60 or 62.         The cause was kidney and liver failure, said a spokesman for the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.         Miss Haber and her syndicated column played a role in a sensational case in the 1970's that involved the actress Jean Seberg, who suffered a premature labor and later committed suicide.         In 1968, The Los Angeles Times named Miss Haber as a successor to Hedda Hopper, who had died in 1966. Louella Parsons, a rival Hollywood columnist for the Hearst papers, had retired in 1965.         Miss Haber once described Melina Mercouri as having "wall-to-wall hips, an ear-to-ear smile and more teeth than a pretzel has salt." She said Julie Andrews had "a kind of flowering dullness about her."         Miss Haber retired as a columnist to write "The Users" (Delacorte, 1976), a best-selling novel. Its passages on the exploits of 70 real and fictional Hollywood characters disturbed even some of her friends and sources. Role in Seberg Case         The Seberg episode started in 1970 when Miss Haber wrote about "the baby Miss A is expecting and its father." The column said: "Papa's said to be a rather prominent Black Panther."         Three months later, Newsweek named Miss Seberg, a white actress, as the expectant mother. The day after reading that, she went into premature labor. The baby girl died three days later. Miss Seberg and her husband, Romain Gary, a French novelist and former diplomat, sued Newsweek and settled for several thousand dollars.         It was later disclosed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had plotted to plant the rumor in a campaign to discredit and harass radicals, whom Miss Seberg had supported. But the agency's files said that J. Edgar Hoover had temporarily delayed the plan when the Haber column item mysteriously appeared.         Mr. Gary said Miss Seberg became despondent and tried to commit suicide on the anniversaries of the baby's death. Eventually she killed herself in 1979. Mr. Gary, who blamed the F.B.I. for her troubles, committed suicide in 1980, although the reason was unclear.         Miss Haber said that her report was based on a letter given to her by an editor, whom she did not name, and that she had not been aware of any F.B.I. involvement.         Miss Haber was a child of the movie industry. As a six-year-old, she acted in three "Our Gang" features. She was educated at Brearley School, Bryn Mawr College and Barnard.         After working briefly in summer stock theater, as a political campaign aide and at an advertising agency, she joined Time magazine as a researcher.         She was divorced from Douglas S. Cramer Jr., a television and film producer.         Her survivors include a son, Douglas 3d, and a daughter, Courtney Cramer.       
         Lucinda Ballard, the Broadway costume designer, died yesterday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Miss Ballard won the first Tony Award for costume design, in 1947, for her work on several productions in that season: "Happy Birthday," "Another Part of the Forest," "Street Scene," "John Loves Mary" and "The Chocolate Soldier." She won another Tony in 1962 for "The Gay Life."         In 1945, she won a Donaldson Award, a prestigious theatrical prize that is no longer given, for the nostalgic costumes she designed for "I Remember Mama." In 1951, she was nominated for an Academy Award for her work on the film "A Streetcar Named Desire." Correcting an Omission         Miss Ballard was an energetic champion of the costume designer's importance to a play. She was known for her skillful use of color, and Elia Kazan also noted her talent for visualizing in advance how the costumes in a play would look together, when they were seen by the audience.         Writing in 1987 about Miss Ballard's role in the history of theatrical costume design, Jeanne T. Newlin, the curator of the Harvard Theater Collection of the Harvard College Library, said: "The costume designer waited far too long for full professional appreciation. No one in the modern American theater has done more to resist this omission and force open the eyes of the producer, the director and, best of all, the playwright than Lucinda Ballard."         Miss Ballard once described herself, with some understatement, as "a theatrical designer who was quite successful and was noticed, especially for making historical costumes look human rather than museumish."         Her first theater credits were as the scenic and costume designer for a 1937 production of Shakespeare's "As You Like It" at the Ritz Theater in New York. She retired in 1962, but came back in 1985 to design the costumes for a revival of Tennessee Williams's "Night of the Iguana." Born in New Orleans         Miss Ballard, whose given name was Lucinda Davis Goldsborough, was born in New Orleans, the daughter of Richard Goldsborough and the former Anna Farrar. She attended Miss McGehee's School in New Orleans and the Art Students League in New York. She also studied in Paris and elsewhere in France.         She married William F. R. Ballard in 1930; they were divorced in 1938. In 1951, she married Howard Dietz, who wrote the lyrics for more than 500 songs, and they lived for many years in Sands Point, L.I. He died in 1983.         Miss Ballard is survived by a son, Robert F. R. Ballard of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Liza Dietz Gard of London; six grandchildren, and two stepgrandchildren.       
         Miriam Irene Eolis, a lawyer, accountant and theatrical producer, died Wednesday at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. She was 80.         The cause was complications from a recent fall, her family said.         She was a graduate of Hunter College and one of the first women to graduate from St. John's University School of Law. She also held a graduate degree in tax law from Columbia University and was a certified public accountant.         Ms. Eolis was a tax consultant in private practice and served on the faculty of the New York University Tax Institute and Pace University. She also was treasurer and president of the New York State Society of Public Accountants.         She had a lifelong interest in the theater and toured Europe with the Pegasus Players and was a producer of the Westchester County, Yonkers and Kennebunkport playhouses for 10 years.         She was married to Alexander L. Eolis and, after his death, married Mortimer M. Kassell. They later divorced.         She is survived by three daughters, Sharon and Wendeen of Manhattan, and Susan Kassell of Potomac, Md.       
         Edith Meiser, a stage actress, writer and radio producer, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital. She was 95 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, said William Herz Jr., a friend.         In a career that spanned half a century, Miss Meiser, a versatile performer with a satiric wit, appeared in more than 20 Broadway shows, including "Garrick Gaieties," "Sabrina Fair" and the 1960 production of "The Unsinkable Molly Brown."         She was born in Detroit and graduated from Vassar College. She made her Broadway debut in "The New Way" in 1923 and went on to appear in "Fata Morgana" and "The Guardsman." Beginning in 1925, she appeared in three editions of the Theater Guild's "Garrick Gaieties," a hit musical revue that spoofed Broadway.         Film audiences saw her in "The Middle of the Night," "It Grows on Trees" and "Queen For A Day," a trilogy based on stories by Dorothy Parker, Faith Baldwin and John Ashworth.         She performed with the Marx Brothers on radio and wrote scripts for Helen Hayes's first radio serial, "The New Penny," and for the "Sherlock Holmes" series beginning in the 1930's.         Miss Meiser also wrote mystery novels and a play, "The Wooden O."         She was a member of the Actors Equity board of governors and the chairwoman of the Equity Library Theater.       
         Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.         The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.         In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet. From Old West to Fall River         In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.         A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.         She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.         Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.         Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."         But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."         Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.         "The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."         Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.  She Felt Destined To Be an Artist         Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.         Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.         After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.         Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.         Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.  Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's         After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.         She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.         She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.         Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.  Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'         Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.         "Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.         "Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.         Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.  Created 'People And Not Automata'         Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."         Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."         Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.         Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.         Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."  Her Final Work Dealt With Death         In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.         Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.         Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.         Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."         Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.         Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.       
         Jacqueline Shearer, a producer and director of documentary films about black Americans, died yesterday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 46.         The cause was colon cancer, said her brother Clement.         Ms. Shearer's works included "A Minor Altercation" (1978), about the Boston school-busing crisis; "The Keys to the Kingdom" and "The Promised Land" (1989), which were in the civil-rights television series "Eyes on the Prize," and "The Colored 54th Regiment" (1991) for the PBS series "The American Experience."         Ms. Shearer was born in Boston and graduated from Brandeis University. She helped found Boston Newsreel, a documentary company, and worked at WCBN radio and WCVB television in Boston.         Besides her brother Clement, of Northfield, Minn., she is survived by her mother, Erline, of Boston; two sisters, Debbie, of Boston, and Linda Gossage, of San Francisco; and another brother, Charles, of Boston.       
         Anna Sten, a melting-eyed but star-crossed Russian actress whom Samuel Goldwyn hoped to ballyhoo into another Garbo or Dietrich in the 1930's, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. Friends said she was in her late 80's.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her lawyer, Hiram G. Shields. He said she had been in poor health.         Miss Sten's case is cited by writers on film as a prime example of how, even in the golden age of the studio system, Hollywood moguls' plans to catapult promising performers to stardom sometimes went awry. As Ephraim Katz, a Hollywood historian and biographer, has written, "She somehow failed to appeal to American audiences."         Her early work in the Soviet Union included the title role in a 1927 comedy, "The Girl With the Hatbox," which has been lauded in the United States for her skillful acting. She then appeared in films in pre-Hitler Germany before Mr. Goldwyn took her to Hollywood, with much publicity. Exotic in Hollywood         Miss Sten's first acting there, the title role in "Nana" (1934), has been belittled as wooden though exotic. But she won critical praise with her sensitive portrayal of a wronged servant in her next film, "We Live Again" (1934). And her third Hollywood movie, "The Wedding Night" (1935), in which she co-starred with Gary Cooper, has been commended as entertaining. But it is also known for being, as Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide 1993 calls it, "Samuel Goldwyn's third and final attempt to make Anna Sten a new Garbo."         After repeated poor box-office showings by her American movies, Mr. Goldwyn ended her contract, and she became known as "Goldwyn's folly." She went on to perform in a dozen other films.         Miss Sten was born in Kiev, now in Ukraine. Originally she was named Annel Stenskaya Sudakevich and was sometimes called Anyuschka. She got her start in acting with the Moscow Art Theater.         A friend, William Hughes, an actor, said yesterday that her first marriage, to a Russian-born film director, Fedor Ozep, ended in divorce, and that her second husband, Eugene Frenke, a film director and producer to whom she was married in the 1930's, died about five years ago.       
         Myrna Loy, the urbane actress who personified a liberated wife of intelligence and wry good humor in some of the best American movie comedies of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         She died in surgery after a long illness, said Sherlee Lantz, a longtime friend of Miss Loy.         With a pert face, crinkly smile and velvet voice, the auburn-haired actress was universally called the "perfect wife." Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades. Turned Into Ideal Mother         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950). Miss Loy then settled into character roles in occasional films and stage and television plays. In 1973 she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's vitriolic comedy "The Women," again as a shrewd mother.         In 1981, Miss Loy and Henry Fonda were a graying couple perceptively reminiscing about their half-century marriage in a television movie, "Summer Solstice." Their performances prompted John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to write that "Mr. Fonda and Miss Loy demonstrate splendidly why they remain stars."         Of Welsh descent, the actress was born Myrna Williams on Aug. 2, 1905, on her father's cattle ranch near Helena, Mont. Her father, David Williams, called her Myrna, after the name of a railroad water stop that caught his fancy. Her mother, Della, was a singer. Started in a Chorus Line         From her father, a state legislator who was an advocate of President Woodrow Wilson's crusade to establish the League of Nations, she gained a sense of public service that lasted a lifetime.         The actress interrupted her career for Red Cross volunteer work throughout World War II. Soon after, she joined the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, serving as a peripatetic film adviser for five years.         Her father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and Mrs. Williams moved her daughter and son, David, to Los Angeles, where Myrna attended Venice High School and occasionally taught dancing. At the age of 18, she joined the chorus line in the stage show at Grauman's Chinese Theater.         She began getting bit parts in movies. A poet friend suggested the catchy name Loy, and it stuck. The teen-ager was quickly typecast as an exotic temptress, invariably Oriental and often villainous. Slinking and gyrating, she was trapped for nearly a decade in the stereotype in such films as "The Desert Song," "The Squall" and "The Black Watch," all released in 1929. 'The Thin Man,' a 'Quickie'         The most bizarre of these 60 or so oddities were two 1932 melodramas -- "The Mask of Fu Manchu," in which Miss Loy reluctantly portrayed the sadistic daughter of the archvillain Boris Karloff, and "Thirteen Women" in which, as a skulking Javanese half-caste, she plotted to do in 12 sorority sisters.         Occasionally, Miss Loy escaped the cliche. She gained notice for her acting as a predatory countess in the 1932 musical fantasy "Love Me Tonight," which starred Maurice Chevalier; as the materialistic wife of Leslie Howard in "The Animal Kingdom" in 1932, and as the love interest in a 1934 gangster thriller, "Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable and Mr. Powell.         A few months later, Myrna Loy became a household name and a full- fledged star. W. S. Van Dyke, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most versatile directors, persuaded studio executives to let him feature Miss Loy with Mr. Powell in a low-budget "B" movie, to be called "The Thin Man." The director shot the film in 21 days, and the "quickie" was a hit. In Well-Known Comedies         Later, when she was billed as "Queen of the Movies" and Gable was called the "King," the two were teamed in such madcap adventures as "Wife Versus Secretary," "Test Pilot" and "Too Hot to Handle."         At the start of World War II, Miss Loy left Hollywood and did full-time volunteer work, serving for four years as an assistant head of Red Cross welfare activities in New York. She also arranged for entertainment in 50 military hospitals and put in long stints at stage-door canteens.         After the war, she portrayed the compassionate, loving wife of Fredric March in "The Best Years of Our Lives," the much-honored 1946 film about servicemen returning from combat. The performance won her the Brussels World Film Festival prize for the best performance by an actress.         A political liberal, Miss Loy joined with other Hollywood figures in the late 40's in challenging what they deplored as the witch-hunting proceedings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         Of her postwar film work for Unesco, the actress said, "One little incident to battle prejudice, dropped into the middle of an entertaining film, is worth all the documentaries ever made."         Miss Loy was a longtime friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading Democrats and regularly campaigned for the party's Presidential candidates. She was also an adviser and former officer of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing. Started on Stage in 1960         She did not appear on the stage until 1960, at first in summer stock, because, she said, "I felt I had a lot to learn." She starred with Claude Dauphin in the comedy "The Marriage Go-Round" and played the mother in a national tour of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park."         In 1980, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures presented her with its first David Wark Griffith award "in grateful recognition of her outstanding contribution to the art of screen acting."         Miss Loy was married four times, to Arthur Hornblow Jr., a movie producer; John D. Hertz Jr., an auto-rental and advertising executive; Gene Markey, a producer-screenwriter, and Howland H. Sargeant, a producer and, at the time, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The marriages ended in divorce. Miss Loy had no children.         In later decades, Miss Loy lived in a book-lined terrace apartment in upper Manhattan overlooking the East River. She aided many civic causes, selecting her public-service committees as judiciously as her roles. Tribute at Carnegie Hall         In 1985, Hollywood movie stars and fans packed Carnegie Hall for a tribute to Miss Loy, who appeared in the audience looking frail but glamorous in a spangled gown. Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Some of the Best Years of Her Life         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films, including the following.         The Jazz Singer 1927         The Mask of Fu Manchu 1932         Penthouse 1933         The Thin Man 1934         Manhattan Melodrama 1934         The Great Ziegfeld 1936         After the Thin Man 1936         Test Pilot 1938         Too Hot to Handle 1938         The Best Years of Our Lives 1946         Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House 1948         Cheaper by the Dozen 1950         From the Terrace 1960         Midnight Lace 1960         The End 1978         Just Tell Me What You Want 1980       
         Myrna Loy, the urbane actress who personified a liberated wife of intelligence and wry good humor in some of the best American movie comedies of the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         She died in surgery after a long illness, said Sherlee Lantz, a longtime friend of Miss Loy.         With a pert face, crinkly smile and velvet voice, the auburn-haired actress was universally called the "perfect wife." Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades.         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950).

         Jennifer Howard Coleman, a painter and former actress, died on Tuesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 68.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Coleman's parents were Sidney Howard, who wrote the screenplay for "Gone With the Wind," and the actress Clare Eames. Mrs. Coleman had several Broadway stage and Hollywood film credits in the 1940's.         In 1950 she married Samuel Goldwyn Jr., a film producer. They were divorced in 1966, and in 1971 she married John E. Coleman, a painter, who died before her. Mrs. Coleman's watercolors and acrylics were on display at galleries in Santa Monica, Calif.         She is survived by three sons: Francis Goldwyn of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., John Goldwyn of Los Angeles, and Tony Goldwyn, the actor, of Hoboken, N.J., and a daughter, Catherine Goldwyn of Boston.       
         Ann Ronell, a songwriter whose credits include "Willow, Weep for Me" and the lyrics for "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?" died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was heart and lung failure after surgery for a hernia, said her niece, Lali Ray.         In the early 30's, while coaching singers on Broadway, Miss Ronell wrote the hits "Baby's Birthday Party," "Rain on the Roof" and "Willow, Weep for Me," which won her a job with Walt Disney Studios.         She was the music director on many films and wrote the scores for "Champagne Waltz" (1937), "Algiers" (1938), "The Story of G.I. Joe" (1945) and "Love Happy" (1949).         Miss Ronell married the producer Lester Cowan in 1937. He died in 1990.
