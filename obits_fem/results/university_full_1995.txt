         Reva Rubin, who was among the first specialists in maternity nursing, died on Saturday at her home in Harrisville, Pa. She was 76 and also lived in Panama City, Fla.         The cause was a heart attack, said officials at the University of Pittsburgh, where Professor Rubin had taught for 21 years before retiring in 1981.         In scores of case studies she observed and documented as a nurse, midwife and teacher, she examined how mothers use a variety of senses -- sight, smell and touch -- to become familiar with their newborns.  To encourage the bonding that she observed, she was an early proponent of keeping the mother and the newborn together as much as possible during the first days after birth.         By the 1980's, the concept that there is a special time right after birth during which mothers become emotionally attached to their babies began to receive criticism from some researchers, although the changes in hospital practice that the research wrought were never questioned.         She was the author of "The Maternal Identity and the Maternal Experience" (Springer, 1984). In 1972, she was a founder with her companion and longtime professional colleague, Dr. Florence H. Erickson of the Maternal Child Care Nursing Journal, the first research journal in the field. Together, they also established master's and doctoral programs in nursing at the University of Pittsburgh.         A graduate of Hunter College in 1941, she went on to Yale to receive master's degrees in nursing in 1946 and in mental health in 1954. She taught at Yale and the University of Chicago before joining the University of Pittsburgh in 1960.         Besides Dr. Erickson of Harrisville, she is survived by a brother, Harry, of Cape Coral, Fla.       
         Atlanta Constance Sampson, a painter who had her first one-woman show in New York at the age of 91, died on Thursday at a nursing home in St. Ansgar, Iowa. She was 98 and lived in Toeterville, Iowa.         Miss Sampson was born on a farm in Lyle, Minn., where she began painting watercolors as a child. After earning a degree in art education from the University of Minnesota, she taught in the Detroit public schools and exhibited her watercolors of flowers, birds and city streets in group shows, mostly in and around Detroit. In 1952, she won first prize at the Chicago International Watercolor Show.         In 1954, she moved to New York City, where she studied at the Art Students League with Theodore Stamos. She also studied with Hans Hofmann in Provincetown, Mass. In the 1960's, she began making Color Field abstractions using acrylic and oils.         Miss Sampson was discovered in 1987 when Owen Ryan, a management consultant, saw one of her paintings in the window of a Lexington Avenue delicatessen and offered to buy it. The owner introduced him to the artist, who invited him to look at the hundreds of artworks that filled her tiny apartment on East 61st Street. She had been preparing her return to Iowa, discouraged by her decades of poverty and obscurity.         Mr. Ryan organized a comprehensive show of Miss Sampson's work that was presented at the National Arts Club in Manhattan in 1988. In 1992 an exhibition devoted to her life and work was held in the rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building in Washington. Later that year she was given a second show at the National Arts Club.         "It was just as necessary as eating or sleeping for me to paint," Miss Sampson said in a newspaper interview in 1988. "It was an obsession all my life."         She is survived by a sister, Myrtella Langrock of Toeterville.       
         Kathryn Haeseler Stone, a former Virginia legislator who challenged school segregation and a reapportionment plan that penalized urban voters, died last Friday at her home in Alexandria, Va. She was 88 and had been a longtime resident of Arlington, Va.         Elected to the Virginia Legislature five months before the United States Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. the Board of Education in 1954, she became an early promoter of school desegregation. She was among those who argued that the state keep open its public schools and resist the spreading move to privatize schools as a means of resisting integration.         Mrs. Stone was also one of four plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging Virginia's reapportionment plan that reached the Supreme Court in 1964. The suit was joined with similiar efforts in other states that argued that the plans drawn by rural-dominated state legislatures were unfair to more heavily-populated areas. The Court's decision forced the redrawing of districts to balance the representation of urban and rural voters.         A Democrat, she retired from the Virginia House in 1966.         Born in Lisbon, Iowa, she received undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of Iowa in 1927 and 1932. With her husband, Harold A. Stone, she undertook in the late 1930's a study of some 25 county and town governments. With Donald K. Price, the Stones wrote two books published by the Public Service Administration in 1940, "City Manager Government in the U.S." and "Case Studies in City Manager Government."         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Paul of Orwell, Vt.; two daughters, Suzanne Stone of Narbeth, Pa., and Joanna Stone of North Leverett, Mass.; a sister, Virginia M. Miller of Chula Vista, Calif.; five grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Vivian Cadden, a New York writer and magazine editor, died on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cardiovascular disease, her family said.         A former senior editor of Redbook and McCall's magazines, she became the founding editor of Working Mother in 1978. She retired as its editor in 1990 but continued to write for the magazine.         She contributed to publications including Life, The Nation, Mademoiselle and Parents. Her articles often dealt with political matters, and she interviewed national and international figures.         She was born in the Bronx, graduated from Vassar College in 1938 and studied economics at Columbia University.         Her husband, Joseph E. Cadden, died in 1980. She is survived by two daughters, Joan, of Gambier, Ohio, and Wendy, of Falls Creek, N.M.; a son, Frank, of Manhattan; a brother, Bernard Liebman, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and one grandson.       
         Dr. Janine Andre-Schwartz, an immunologist and specialist in electron microscopy, died on April 26 at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 62 and lived in Brookline, Mass.         The cause was cancer, said a spokeswoman at the center, where she was a medical researcher in the division of hematology/oncology.         Dr. Andre-Schwartz was also an associate professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. She had been on the staff of both institutions for 26 years. Working with the electron microscope, she contributed to research on immunological disease.         Dr. Andre-Schwartz did much of her research in collaboration with her husband, Dr. Robert S. Schwartz, now deputy editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Andre-Schwartz is survived by a son, Louis-George Schwartz of New York City; two sisters, Francoise Poutiers of Bordeaux, France, and Claude Andre of Paris, and a brother, Jean-Pierre Andre, also of Paris.       
         Dr. Dorothy V. Whipple, who helped to secure the rights of women in the medical profession and advanced the cause of children through her widely influential work in pediatrics, died Friday at her home in Washington. She was 94.         Dr. Whipple was the first married woman admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School ("They objected on those grounds but finally took me in," she recalled in an interview decades later) and an early advocate of rearing children by using liberal amounts of cuddling and common sense. She graduated in 1929.         "Be natural and easy with your baby," Dr. Whipple wrote in her 1944 book "Our American Babies." In an era when many doctors advocated strict feeding schedules and letting babies cry to exhaustion, Dr. Whipple dared to argue that feeding a baby when it was hungry might be a good idea, and she insisted that love and understanding were what counted: "Nothing we can do or provide for a baby is more important."         As for letting a baby cry on and on, she said, "I found it made a lot of difference to me whose baby was crying."         She was speaking as a mother as well as a professional, a dual role that she played long before it became common. In a 1968 interview, she said it required a sympathetic husband (in her case, the economist Ewan Clague), domestic help and "the constitution of an ox."         Happy to be called "Mrs. Clague" by some friends and neighbors, Dr. Whipple, who grew up in New York City, did not change her name when she married Mr. Clague in 1923, after her graduation from the University of Wisconsin, where she had been a speed skater. She also received a master's degree from Wisconsin before attending Johns Hopkins.         In the New Deal era, Mr. Clague helped organize the Social Security Administration and later served as Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the early 1940's, Dr. Whipple was hired by the Federal Government to revise its popular "Infant Care" pamphlet.         In her revised pamphlet, as in her book and in a syndicated weekly newspaper column on child care, she promoted a nurturing, down-to-earth way with children even as she showed her awareness of common family problems. A grandmother, she wrote, could be a blessing, or "a terrible pain in the neck."         In 1939, Dr. Whipple began a private practice in Arlington, Va., one she continued for 40 years. She was a frequent contributor to professional and popular journals and wrote two other books: "Euthenic Pediatrics" and "Q: Is the Grass Greener? Answers to Questions About Drugs."         The book on drugs was published in 1971 and advocated a more lenient approach to prosecution of marijuana-related crimes because, she argued, criminal sanctions had not stemmed the spread of drug use.         Dr. Whipple's husband died in 1987. She is survived by two sons, Llewellyn Clague of Hastings, N.Y., and Christopher Clague of College Park, Md.; a daughter, Anne Farber of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Alice Manheim Kaplan, an art collector and a leading supporter of the arts in New York City, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Mrs. Kaplan was involved with New York City civic groups and with many museums throughout her life. In 1982 she received the Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture.         She was born in Budapest in 1903, and two years later her family moved to New York City, where she grew up. She attended Teachers College of Columbia University but left school to marry in 1925. Years later, she resumed her studies and received a master's degree in art history from Columbia University when she was 63.         For 10 years, from 1967 to 1977, she was the president of the American Federation of the Arts, where she developed many traveling exhibitions and produced an educational film, "The Art of Seeing." She also served on many boards, including those of the Museum of American Folk Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.         She headed the advisory council for the department of art and archeology at Columbia University. She was also a member of the visiting committee of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University and served on visiting committees at the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was on a committee to save Cooper Union Museum, now the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum.         With her husband, J. M. Kaplan, a financier who founded the J. M. Kaplan Fund in 1945, she was instrumental in the campaign to save Carnegie Hall when it was threatened with demolition in 1960. She was married to Mr. Kaplan for 62 years, until his death in 1987.         Although she insisted throughout her life that she wasn't a collector, Mrs. Kaplan was known for her extraordinary eye and flair. She often bought artworks before the artists were discovered.         On one occasion, browsing through an antique shop, she spotted a neo-classical drawing and bought it for $200. When she returned home and began researching the drawing, she discovered it was a long-lost preliminary study for Jacques Louis David's "Oath of the Horatii," which hangs in the Louvre.         Mrs. Kaplan also bought works by artists like the American painter Ammi Phillips and the Austrian artist Egon Schiele before they were well known. She discovered Schiele's work quite by accident. When she got off the elevator of the Fuller Building on the wrong floor one afternoon, she spotted some drawings by the artist, which she promptly bought. "That's how the collection grew," she once said. "Often the result of chance and circumstance rather than a systematic approach."         Mrs. Kaplan was known for her great style as a hostess, entertaining at her homes in New York City and East Hampton, L.I. In her spare time she was also a portrait painter and pianist.         She is survived by two brothers, Paul E. Manheim of New York City and Frank J. Manheim of London; a sister, Louise Espy of Manhattan; three daughters, the former State Parks Commissioner Joan K. Davidson, Elizabeth K. Fonseca and Mary E. Kaplan, all of Manhattan; a son, Richard D. Kaplan of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Claire Sterling, an American author and correspondent based in Italy, who was known for her writings on terrorism, assassination and crime, died yesterday in a hospital in Arezzo, Italy. She was 76 and lived in outside of Cortona, near Arezzo.         She had cancer of the colon, her husband said.         Mrs. Sterling was based in Italy for more than 30 years and traveled widely. Her most recent book, "Thieves' World: The Threat of the New Global Network of Organized Crime" (1994, Simon & Schuster), was praised by Stephen Handelman, of the Harriman Institute of Advanced Soviet Studies at Columbia University, as making "a significant contribution to post-cold-war debate" by affirming "that the growing interdependence among nation-states and financial institutions has made it easier for crime syndicates to cooperate across national boundaries."         In an earlier book, "Octopus: the Long Reach of the International Sicilian Mafia" (1990), she examined the Sicilian Mafia and charged gangster-chieftains based in Palermo with creating a multinational empire with the United States as its longtime main target.         In her 1984 book "The Time of the Assassins," Mrs. Sterling examined the attempt by a Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981. She contended that Mr. Agca had "come to Rome as a professional hit man, hired by a Bulgarian spy ring." She presented what she called "massive proof that the Soviet Union and its surrogates have provided the weapons, training and sanctuary for a worldwide terror network aimed at the destabilization of Western democratic society."         Mrs. Sterling's contention about a Bulgarian role in the attack was disputed, but writing in 1991, she maintained that Italian courts in 1988 had "expressed their moral certainty that Bulgaria's secret service was behind the papal shooting."         She also attracted wide attention with her 1981 book "The Terror Network," which traced connections among terrorist groups around the globe. William Abrahams, who edited the book for Holt, Rinehart & Winston, said that while she was writing it, the Italian Government posted a guard at her house to protect her.         A decade later, the New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis reported that William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence in the Reagan Administration, had held up a copy of "The Terror Network" before a group of official intelligence experts and had "said contemptuously that he had learned more from it than from all of them."         Mrs. Sterling's first book was "The Masaryk Case" (1969), about Jan Masaryk, the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister who was reported to have leaped to his death in 1948 from a window of his Prague apartment. She concluded that he had been killed by Soviet or Czechoslovak Stalinists to keep him from defecting to the West.         In her decades abroad, she also wrote articles for The New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, The Reporter magazine, Life, Reader's Digest, Harper's, The New Republic, The Washington Post, International Herald Tribune and The Financial Times.         Mrs. Sterling was born Claire Neikind in Queens, received a bachelor's degree in economics from Brooklyn College, and worked for a time as a union organizer among electrical workers.         In 1945 she received a master's degree from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, which awarded her a Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship.         She went on to work in Rome for what she described in a 1981 interview as "a fly-by-night American news agency." She learned Italian, and when the agency went out of business, she returned to the United States and joined the staff of The Reporter magazine, which began publication in early 1949.         Mrs. Sterling recalled that when she applied for the Reporter job, Max Ascoli, the magazine's Italian-born publisher and editor, said, "If anybody's going to write about Italy around here, it's me." So because of her union experience, she became the labor editor.         In 1951, she married Tom Sterling, a writer. She remembered that "Max Ascoli's wedding present to me was a six-month assignment in Rome."         Mrs. Sterling's six-month assignment lasted 17 years, ending only when The Reporter ceased publication in 1968. By then, the Sterlings were accustomed to life in Italy, where Mr. Sterling had written some of his more than a dozen books. So Mrs. Sterling, keeping Italy as her base, began writing her Masaryk book.         She is survived by her husband; a son, Luke, of Cortona; a daughter, Abigail Vazquez of San Francisco; two grandchildren, and a sister, Ethel Braun of Manhattan.       
         Sylvia Laibman Horwitz, a world traveler, an author and a founder of two schools, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Paul Horwitz.         When the guns stopped firing in Europe in 1945, Mrs. Horwitz was part of one of the first boatloads of American civilians headed for Italy to join spouses on special assignment on the war-ravaged continent. Her husband, Louis Horwitz, a social worker, was working with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency in the resettlement of refugees.         She quickly found that the disarray of postwar Rome extended to newcomers as well as to survivors. There was no school for English-speaking children, so she helped start one and served as its first director. The Overseas School of Rome is still in operation. She had already helped found the Downtown Community School, a private elementary school in Greenwich Village, in the early 1940's.         Her tenure in Rome also kindled an interest in archeology.         When her husband was posted in Tunisia, she began to explore the past of her new home and the site of ancient Carthage. Study there and later in Tiberias inspired her third book, "The Find of a Lifetime: Sir Arthur Evans and the Discovery of Knossos" (Viking, 1980). It celebrated the discoveries of one of history's greatest amateur archeologists, Arthur Evans, who uncovered evidence of a Minoan civilization in Crete dating back to 3500 B.C.         She also wrote the books "Toulouse-Lautrec: His World" (Harper, 1973) and "Francisco Goya: Painter of Kings and Demons" (Harper, 1974).         She was born in Newcastle, Pa., and grew up in Cleveland. She graduated from Case Western University in 1932 and moved to Manhattan, where she was a copywriter. Later, she was a teacher at the New School for Social Research.         Her husband died in 1979. In addition to her son, of Concord, Mass., she is survived by a sister, Natalie Barr of Lamoine, Me., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  June 26, 1995, Monday         An obituary on Wednesday about Sylvia Laibman Horwitz of Manhattan, an author and founder of two schools who died on June 18, misidentified the college she attended. Mrs. Horwitz graduated in 1932 from Flora Stone Mather College for Women, not from Case Western Reserve University. The women's college later became part of a university that helped form Case Western Reserve University in 1967.       
         Anne Tabachnick, a figurative artist whose painterly style was inspired by Matisse, died on Tuesday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 67.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her daughter, Felicity Turner.         Ms. Tabachnick was born in New York City in 1927 and studied painting under Hans Hoffman. She earned a B.A. in anthropology and art at Hunter College and also studied art at the University of California, Berkeley, and New York University. Like many artists of her generation, including Larry Rivers, Nell Blaine and her close friend, Robert De Niro Sr., Ms. Tabachnick was familiar with the gestural techniques of Abstract Expressionism, but, looking to Matisse, preferred to used them in portraits, landscapes and figure paintings.         Her first New York show was in 1951 at the Circle in the Square Gallery, and she was later represented by the Ingber Gallery. Her most recent exhibition was at the Erica Meyerovich Gallery in San Francisco in April.         Ms. Tabachnick is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the University Art Museum, Berkeley.         Her marriage to John Newbro ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, of Cambridge, Mass., she is survived by her mother, Freda Tabachnick of Manhattan; a son, David Newbro, also of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.         Correction:  June 26, 1995, Monday         An obituary on Friday about the artist Anne Tabachnick misidentified the San Francisco gallery that held her last exhibition, in April. It was the Eleanor Austerer Gallery, not the Erica Meyerovich.       
         Mary Raffa, the mother of Matilda Cuomo, former First Lady of New York, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I.         She was 91 and lived in Lake Success, N.Y.         Mrs. Raffa was born in Sicily and came to New York City in 1928.         Her husband, Charles, died in 1988. In addition to Matilda, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by another daughter, Nancy Mazzola, of Montville, N.J.; three sons, Frank, of Lake Success; Sam, of Syosset, L.I., and Joseph, of San Diego, 15 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.       
         Rema Hort Mann, a cable television executive, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 30.         The cause was stomach cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hort Mann was the licensing manager for Cablevision in Woodbury, L.I., handling market programming, licensing and negotiations for pay-per-view events. Previously, she was an independent consultant with National Economic Research Associates in White Plains and a senior consultant with Arthur Andersen & Co. in Manhattan.         She graduated from Tufts University in 1986 with a degree in computer science. In 1991, she received an M.B.A. in corporate strategic planning from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.         Mrs. Hort Mann is survived by her husband, Billy Mann; her parents, Susan and Michael Hort of Scarsdale, N.Y.; her grandparents, Dr. Selig and Blanche Strax of Queens; two brothers, Andrew and Peter, of Manhattan, and a sister, Shoshana, of Scarsdale.       
         Esther Rome, co-author of the best seller "Our Bodies, Ourselves" and women's health advocate for more than 25 years, died at her home in Somerville, Mass., on Saturday. She was 49.         The cause was breast cancer, said a friend, Judith Norsigian.         Ms. Rome argued that issues of cosmetic surgery, eating disorders, body image and sexually transmitted diseases as they affected women belonged in the social- and economic-policy arena as much as in the medical world. She was instrumental in fostering the public debate over toxic shock syndrome and its link to the use of tampons in the early 1980's.         A decade later, she served as a consumer advocate on the Food and Drug Administration committee that investigated the potential hazards of silicone breast implants. The committee's work led to a partial ban on implants and Ms. Rome led a support group for women with implants who had health problems.         Until days before her death, she was working on her latest book, "Risking Health for Love," with her co-author, Jane Hyman, that examines the health risks of choices that women make, covering breast implants, sexually transmitted diseases and domestic violence.         Ms. Rome was among 12 young professional women who were not medical experts but who were concerned about health issues who gathered in a lounge at M.I.T. in 1969 to exchange the information about doctors and other health topics. The group later formed the Boston Women's Health Book Collective.         A year later, the women published a collection of papers challenging long-held approaches to medical treatment of women. The papers addressed a range of topics including childbirth and rape. Called "Women and Their Bodies," it was a 75-cent newsprint guide to the physical and psychological makeup of women. In 1971 they changed the name to "Our Bodies, Ourselves" and the book inspired a grass-roots, consumer-advocacy movement, becoming a bible to a generation of young women.         In college dormitories and apartments across the country groups of female baby-boomers, hungry for the kind of information their mothers did not always have, gathered to discuss the book. They formed support groups and grappled with women's health issues made more immediate by the availability of birth-control pills and the legalization of abortion.         The book was attacked as pornographic by the Moral Majority and other conservative groups and it was banned from some schools. By 1973 it had sold more than 350,000 copies. Now in its third edition, it has sold nearly three million copies in the United States and has been translated into 14 foreign languages, including Hebrew, Swedish and Greek, said a spokeswoman for its publisher, Simon & Schuster.         Ms. Rome was born in Norwich, Conn. She graduated from Brandeis University in 1966 and received a master's degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1968.         She is survived by her husband, Nathan; two sons, Judah and Micah, both of Somerville; two brothers, Aaron Seidman of Brookline and Abe Seidman of Beverly Hills, Calif., and a sister, Sara Levine of Dallas.       
         Elizabeth Flower, professor emeritus of philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a standard history of philosophy, died on Monday at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. She was 80 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was cancer, said Prof. Gary Hatfield, chairman of Penn's department of philosophy, from which she retired in 1985.         Dr. Flower, whose affiliation with the university dated from her student days, was the author with Murray G. Murphey of the two-volume "History of Philosophy in America" (Putnam, 1977). She herself was honored in 1988 with a volume "Values and Value Theory in Twentieth Century America: Essays in Honor of Elizabeth Flower" (Temple University Press), edited by Professor Murphey and Ivar Berg.         Among her multitude of students, many of whom now teach around the country, was the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He attended her first graduate seminar, Ethics and Philosophy in History.         "Martin Luther King's contribution to the discussion was solid and articulate," she recalled later. "Interestingly, questions of discrimination did not seem to have come up, but questions of peace and of conflict, of moral order and the effectiveness of a moral stance -- as in Gandhi -- were much in the air. And in all this his thought was already vigorous and well forged."         Dr. Flower's teaching and writings were credited at Penn with having advanced the field of ethics. Many of her doctoral students went on to work in the ethics and philosophy of law.         Professor Hatfield said she had carried on the Pragmatist school of philosophy in the United States.         Elizabeth Farquhar Flower was born in Atlantic City. She received her Ph.D. at Penn in 1939, two years after she started her academic career as an assistant instructor. She received her promotion to full professor in 1974.         Dr. Flower is survived by her husband, Prof. Abraham Edel; a stepdaughter, Deborah Edel of Manhattan, and three stepsons.       
         Vera Aberle Ries, whose living room was lined from floor to ceiling with one of the country's richest private collections of early children's books, died at her home in Forest Hills, Queens, on Monday. She was 86.         Mrs. Ries's husband, Ludwig, began the collection in 1958 with trips to New England villages to rummage at antique stores and thrift shops. Mrs. Ries continued the search after his death in 1968, working mainly through catalogues.         The collection boasts about 3,000 books published between 1600 and 1850, many of them bearing childish scrawls and dogeared pages. Among the books were a moth-eaten first American edition of "Little Goody Two Shoes," a 1780 Bible no bigger than a man's thumb, New England primers, books with paper dolls and collections of fairy tales, along with standbys like "Robinson Crusoe" and "Alice in Wonderland."         "The wonderful thing about this kind of collecting," Mrs. Ries once said, "is that you are giving life to books that otherwise would have rotted away in an attic somewhere."         Born in Frankfurt, Mrs. Ries received a law degree from the University of Frankfurt and arrived in Forest Hills with her husband in the late 1930's. She did not practice law but joined her husband in a window-display business. Together, they worked at some of New York's most fashionable department stores.         Mrs. Ries is survived by her daughter, Dr. Jane Ries Pitt Socolow of Princeton, N.J., and two grandchildren.       
         Johana Harris, a pianist, composer and teacher and the widow of the composer Roy Harris, died on June 5 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 82.         Mrs. Harris, whose original name was Beula Duffey, was born in Ottawa on Dec. 31, 1912. In the early 1920's she studied with Henry Puddicombe, a student of Liszt, and at his suggestion she moved to New York in 1924 to study with Ernest Hutcheson at the Juilliard School. A year later, at the age of 17, she joined the Juilliard faculty as an assistant.         She married Roy Harris in 1937, and it was his idea to change her first name to Johana, in tribute to Johann Sebastian Bach.         Mrs. Harris began recording for RCA Victor soon after her marriage, and immediately caught the attention of the record world with the first recording of the difficult Busoni arrangement of the Bach Chaconne. She also recorded most of Beethoven's solo and chamber works, works by her husband, by Schoenberg, Debussy and Piston, and the Ginastera Piano Sonata, which was composed for her in 1952. All told, she made more than 100 recordings.         She was a member of the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles until 1993, and continued to perform until April 1994.         Mr. Harris died in 1979. Mrs. Harris is survived by her second husband, Jake Heggie of San Francisco; two sons, Shaun Harris of Livermore, Calif., and Dan Harris of Indio, Calif; three daughters, Patricia Connelly of Santa Monica, Calif., Maureen Forman of Palm Desert, Calif., and Lane Murray of Tahoe City, Calif., and a brother, Norman Duffey of Lakeland, Fla.       
         Dr. Beatrix T. Gardner, a psychologist who with her husband, Dr. R. Allen Gardner, taught a chimpanzee sign language in the 1960's and the 1970's, died while traveling with her husband in Padua, Italy, on June 5. She was 61 and lived in Reno.         Reached yesterday at the University of Nevada in Reno, where he and his wife had worked as a team, her husband said the cause of death was a central nervous infection. He reported her death this week.         In the 1970's the couple announced that by raising a chimpanzee, Washoe, in the manner of a human child they had taught the ape to communicate using signs similar to those widely used by deaf human beings.         Since then, other researchers have also reported success in training chimpanzees to communicate without depending on speech, as by pushing specific buttons on a keyboard. At the time of the Gardner announcement, Dr. Peter R. Marler of Rockefeller University termed their work "brilliant and exciting."         That such animals actually learned a "language" has, however, been challenged. Among the skeptics is Dr. Herbert S. Terrace, a Columbia University psychologist, who has argued that his chimpanzee experiments have shown that an ape cannot, in any meaningful way, connect "words" into sentences.         Beatrix Tugendhut Gardner was born on July 13, 1933, in Vienna and was living in Poland at the time of the Nazi invasion. The family escaped to Brazil and lived for six years in a suburb of Sao Paulo before moving to the United States.         Dr. Gardner, whose first name was sometimes written Beatrice,earned a bachelor's degree at Radcliffe College and a master's degree at Brown University. She received a doctorate in zoology at Oxford University in England in 1959. She studied the stickleback, a fish whose male builds a nest for his mate. She returned to the United States and taught at Wellesley College, where she met Dr. Gardner, who was studying rats.         They learned of the adverse behavioral effect on rhesus monkeys reared in isolation and ultimately decided to investigate the role of parent-child relationships in the upbringing of chimpanzees. They married in 1961, moved to the University of Nevada in 1963, and in 1966 began trying to teach Washoe, a 10-month-old female ape, to use signals from Ameslan, the American Sign Language.         In 1967, when Washoe was 15 months old, they reported early results to a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New York. They said Washoe had learned signs for hundreds of words.         The Gardners reported that the chimpanzee created expressions like "water birds" for a pair of swans and "open flower" to gain admittance to a flower garden. Washoe even seemed to be teaching sign language to a young companion. The Gardners did similar tests with four more chimpanzees: Moja, Pili, Tatu and Dar.         Skeptics suggested that these claims could be a product of inadvertent coaching or wishful thinking.         Other than her husband, Dr. Gardner had no immediate survivors.         But the chimpanzee project continues. Washoe just celebrated her 30th birthday. She lives in Ellensburg, Wash., at the Chimpanzee and Human Communications Institute, said Deborah Fouts, who with her husband, Roger, is co-director of the institute.       
         Louise Reinhardt Smith, a discerning collector of modern art and a prized supporter of the Museum of Modern Art since 1957, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Ms. Smith was one of the last of the strong-willed and independent-minded collectors whose activity was indispensable to the Museum of Modern Art at a time when there was still much new ground to be broken for its core collections.         Agnes Gund, president of the Museum of Modern Art, said yesterday: "Louise Smith brought to art a real, true love. She cared nothing for the social status or the public attention that it could bring. The only people she wanted around her were those who felt for art the way she did.         "Disregarding the safe and the sure, she was drawn to the tough and the difficult in art. Living with the tough pictures in her collection -- the redoubtable Picasso 'Woman Dressing Her Hair' of 1940, for one -- she developed over the years a friendship with them that was deeply moving to witness".         Mrs. Smith's many gifts to the Museum of Modern Art are the subject of an exhibition, "Masterworks From the Louise Reinhardt Smith Collection," which opened at the museum on May 4 and runs through Aug. 22. With the exception of two paintings -- one by Claude Monet, the other by Georges Braque -- that she bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum, everything in the show will now be part of the Modern's permanent collection. Matisse, Degas, Kandinsky and Seurat are among the major artists represented in the exhibition.         Louise Reinhardt Smith was born in Dallas on March 14, 1904. The daughter of Sidney Reinhardt and Alice Blum Reinhardt, she attended Washington University and the College of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio. In 1964, at the age of 60, she obtained her bachelor's degree from New York University.         For many years she wrote short stories for Ladies' Home Journal and other publications and in 1945 received the O. Henry Award. During her marriage to Bertram Smith, an investment broker in New York City, she kept registered Guernsey cows at the couple's farm in the Berkshires. After her husband's death, she began her long association with the Museum of Modern Art and its international council. She was made a trustee of the museum in 1965 and a trustee for life in 1993.         She is survived by a daughter, Ann Smith, and two grandsons, Bertram and Nicholas Nikola; all of Patterson, N.Y., and a sister, Alice Harrington of San Diego.       
         Maggie Keswick, a Scots-born connoisseur of China and its sensuous, mysterious gardens, died on July 8 in London. She was 53 and had homes in London, Santa Monica, Calif., and Wellfleet, Mass.         The cause was breast cancer, said John Taylor Williams of Palmer & Dodge, the family's legal counsel in Boston.         Margaret Keswick Jencks hailed from a family that has lived and done business in China for nearly 140 years. She was born in Cowhill, Scotland, but spent much of her early life in post-revolutionary China.         She became known in the United States with the appearance of her book "The Chinese Garden" (1978), which was richly embellished by her own photography.         "Miss Keswick's is no ordinary garden tour," a reviewer for The New York Times wrote, "but a first-rate job of intellect, intelligently illustrated."         The book was reissued in paperback by St. Martin's Press in 1986 and remains in print.         Miss Keswick's father, Sir John Keswick, was a major trader at the head of the Scottish company Jardine Matheson. He spoke Chinese and became a trusted friend of Zhou Enlai, Mao Zedong's most influential advisor.         In 1982, she edited "The Thistle and the Jade," a history of Jardine Matheson on its 150th anniversary. She also contributed to the "Oxford Garden Companion" and to books by her husband, Charles Alexander Jencks, a post-modernist architect and professor at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Architecture.         For many years she was the chairwoman of the Keswick Foundation, based in Hong Kong. She established the first cancer hospice there and extended the foundation's work to China. Most recently she created a cancer-care center in Edinburgh, where she was undergoing hospital treatment.         She was educated at Oxford University, where she studied Middle English, and at the Architectural Association in London. After "The Chinese Garden" was published, she lectured widely in the United States.         She was also in demand as a garden designer, collaborating with Frank Gehry, the architect, and Claes Oldenburg, the artist.         She is survived by her husband; a son, John; a daughter, Lily Clare; two stepsons, Cosmo and Justin Jencks, all of London, and her mother, Clare Lady Keswick of Portrack, Scotland.       
         Roberta Church, an official in the Eisenhower and Nixon Administrations who was the first black woman to be elected to the Tennessee Republican State Executive Committee, died on Saturday at Baptist Memorial Hospital East in Memphis. She was 81 and lived in Memphis.         She had suffered a brief illness, said Ronald A. Walter, the co-author of one of her books.         Miss Church was the last survivor of a family of black Tennesseans who were prominent in business and Republican politics when few Southern blacks were active in either business or the party.         With her aunt, Annette E. Church, she wrote a biography of her grandfather and father, "The Robert R. Churches of Memphis: A Father and Son Who Achieved in Spite of Race" (Burke's, 1974). She also wrote, with Mr. Walter, "Nineteenth-Century Memphis Families of Color, 1850-1900" (Burke's; 2d ed., 1989).         Miss Church, whose full name was Sara Roberta Church, was born in Memphis and received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Northwestern University. Her grandfather, Robert R. Sr., founded Memphis's first black bank and was believed to be the first black millionaire in the South.         Her father was an early civil rights leader; in 1916 he formed the Lincoln League to register and organize voters, and in 1917 he founded Tennessee's first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         He died in 1952 while campaigning for a seat on the Republican State Executive Committee. Miss Church took over the campaign and was elected in his stead to represent Memphis and surrounding Shelby County.         In 1953 she was named by the Eisenhower Administration to promote equal employment opportunities as a Labor Department consultant. In 1961 she started a Civil Service career as an administrator of Federal-state programs in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, later the Department of Health and Human Services. She retired in 1982.         Miss Cook also served two terms under President Richard M. Nixon as a member of his Advisory Council on Adult Education.       
         Virginia Mae Morrow, the Colorado woman whose hypnosis-induced recollections created a sensation in the 1950's, died on July 12 at a hospice outside Denver. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Richard, said.         According to Mrs. Morrow's own recollections, she had died before, after falling down a flight of stairs in Ireland in 1864, when she was known as Bridey Murphy.         Whether Mrs. Morrow really had a past life as Bridey Murphy, or even if there was a Bridey Murphy who lived the life Mrs. Morrow so vividly described in a thick Irish brogue during in taped hypnotic sessions in 1952 and 1953, has been the subject of intense emotional debate for more than four decades.         The debate began when her story was first told in articles by William J. Barker in The Denver Post in 1954, and it engaged a far wider audience when "The Search for Bridey Murphy" was published by Doubleday in 1956 and made into a movie the same year.         The book was by Morey Bernstein, the amateur hypnotist who had elicited the recollections in Pueblo, Colo. It became a best seller and was reissued in 1965 with additional material by Mr. Barker, but has been out of print for several years.         Whether Mrs. Morrow's account was dismissed out of hand or accepted as proof of reincarnation, Bridey Murphy became a 1950's phenomenon rivaling the Hula-Hoop. There were Bridey Murphy parties ("come as you were") and Bridey Murphy jokes (parents greeting newborns with "Welcome back").         The book triggered an interest in reincarnation and the use of hypnosis to regress a subject to early childhood, and perhaps beyond. It also spawned efforts to debunk Mrs. Morrow's recollections.         The notion that the book was an out-and-out hoax never gained much credence for several reasons. Mr. Bernstein, for example, was a wealthy and highly respected Pueblo businessman who had been experimenting with hypnosis for years.         His hypnosis sessions with Mrs. Morrow, which began on a lark after a party, were conducted in front of respected witnesses who vouched for the apparent authenticity of Mrs. Morrow's regression.         Also, Mrs. Morrow, then a 27-year-old mother of two known as Ginny Tighe, seemed an entirely guileless subject. She insisted that her real name not be used in the book, which called her Ruth Simmons, and then shunned virtually every opportunity to cash in on the Bridey Murphy phenomenon.         Efforts to debunk Bridey Murphy focused on the assumption that her detailed recollections an Irish life a century earlier were simply an outpouring of long-forgotten childhood memories.         In the 1965 edition, Mr. Barker took on the debunkers point by point. Yes, for example, as a child in Chicago Mrs. Morrow had lived across the street from a woman named Bridey (a common diminutive of Bridget), but so what? Mrs. Morrow said she had never known the woman's first name.         As for the visiting aunt of Scotch-Irish extraction who supposedly regaled her with tales from Ireland, the woman was born in New York and had no special interest in Ireland, and Mrs. Morrow was 18, not an impressionable toddler, when she was around.         Mrs. Morrow, whose original name was Reese, was born in Madison, Wis., on April 27, 1925, and raised by an aunt and uncle in Chicago. After studying at Northwestern University, she went with a friend to Denver, where she got a job and met her first husband, Hugh Tighe, who was later transferred to Pueblo.         They later moved back to the Denver area and were divorced.         Whatever the explanation of her highly detailed recollections, the one person who seemed immune to the debate was Mrs. Morrow.         As for all the fuss she had kicked up, she once said, "If I had known what was going to happen I would never have lain down on the couch."         In addition to her husband, of Englewood, Colo., Mrs. Morrow is survived by the three children from her first marriage, Marilou Butler of Valdosta, Ga., Nanci Lee of Hong Kong and Teri Francis of San Jose, Calif.; two stepchildren, Pam Zimmer of El Cajon, Calif., and Randy Morrow of Littleton, Colo., and 10 grandchildren.       
         Dr. Berta Vogel Scharrer, a pioneering biomedical scientist and founding faculty member of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University, died on Sunday at her home in the Bronx. She was 88.         Harvard University, conferring an honorary doctorate on Dr. Scharrer in 1982, said her "research journeys into the world of insects have profoundly affected the study of human physiology." The particular insect she had studied since 1937 was the South American cockroach.         Dr. Scharrer's specialty was neuroendocrinology, the study of the interaction between the nervous and endocrine systems. At her death, she was distinguished professor emeritus of anatomy and structural biology and of neuroscience at Einstein. She had been affiliated with the college since it was founded in 1955. She reached emeritus status in 1978 but continued her research until a few months ago.         In 1928, Dr. Ernst Scharrer, her future husband, working in Germany, discovered what he called gland-nerve cells in the hypothalamus of a fish's brain. From this, the Scharrers developed the concept of neurosecretion -- secretions from nerve cells -- that gave rise in the 1930's and early 1940's to neuroendocrinology as a new discipline.         Berta Vogel was born in Munich, Germany, and received a doctorate in biology from the University of Munich in 1930. She married Dr. Scharrer in 1934, and they remained a team at Einstein until his accidental drowning in 1965. Though not Jewish, the Scharrers left Germany in 1937 because of Hitler's policies.         Early in their collaboration, they decided on a comparative approach, dividing the animal kingdom so that he would study vertebrates and she invertebrates. They determined that certain principles found in an insect could explain certain things about mammalian systems, and vice versa.         Their discovery of neurosecretions took years to find acceptance, as their peers resisted the notion that neurons could dispatch neurohormonal, blood-borne signals, an activity previously associated only with the hormonal endocrine cells.         Once neuroendocrinology became established, Dr. Scharrer received many honorary degrees and other honors in the United States and in Europe. She was given the National Medal of Science at a White House ceremony in 1985.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Karl Vogel of Neustadt, Germany, and a sister, Lotte Vogel of Munich.       
         Susan McAllister Swap, an educator and writer who focused on involving parents in their children's schools, died last Thursday at her home in Winchester, Mass. She was 50.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         Dr. Swap joined the faculty of Wheelock College in Boston in 1977 and taught courses in child development, special education, consultation and parent studies. A past chairwoman of the department of professional studies, she was a professor of education and psychology.         Most recently she directed the Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning, and the Center on College-School-Community Partnerships, two research programs at Wheelock.         She wrote articles about home-school partnerships and promoting the academic success of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Her books in print are "Managing an Effective Interview Program" (Teachers College, 1984), "Parent Involvement and Success for All Children: What We Know Now" (Institute for Responsive Education, 1990), "Schools Reaching Out and Success for All Children: Two Case Studies" (Institute for Responsive Education, 1990), and "Developing Home-School Partnerships: From Concept to Practice" (Teachers College, 1993).         Born in Bridgeport, Conn., she graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe College and earned her Ph.D. in education and psychology at the University of Michigan. She taught at Tufts University before moving to Wheelock.         Dr. Swap is survived by her husband, Walter; a son, Clifford; a daughter, Alison, all of Winchester; her parents, John and Pauline McAllister of Fairfield, Conn.; two sisters, Joan Howard of Winterville, Ga., and June McAllister of Stratford, Conn., and a brother, Jef McAllister of Great Falls, Va.       
         Saidye Rosner Bronfman, a philanthropist and widow of Samuel Bronfman, founder of the Seagram Company, died yesterday at her home in Montreal. She was 98.         At her death, she was honorary president of the Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Family Foundation, which supports a variety of charitable and community causes. A patron of the arts, she and her husband founded the Samuel Bronfman Collection of Canadian Art. She created a special fund for the Montreal Musem of Fine Arts to encourage young artists through the purchase of their work.         She was active in many organizations, including Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, the National Council of Jewish Women and the Organization for Rehabilitalation through Training.         Born in Plum Coulee, Manitoba, she studied at Havergal Ladies' College in Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba before marrying Mr. Bronfman in 1922. Two years later, the couple moved to Montreal, where Mr. Bronfman opened his first small distillery and built the company into a beverage and distilled spirits empire.         Mrs. Bronfman is survived by a daughter, Phyllis Barbara Lambert of Montreal; two sons, Edgar M. of Manhattan, the chairman of Seagram, and Charles R. of Montreal, co-chairman; 11 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1971.       
         Dr. Ethel Emerson Wortis, a physician long active in civic affairs, died on Sunday at the San Simeon Nursing Home in Greenport, L.I. A former resident of New York City, she was 93 and lived in Southold, L.I.         For nearly three decades, she was associated with the Women's City Club of New York, holding various offices, including that of president in the 1950's. She was a past president of the Women's Medical Association of New York City and was active in the League of Women Voters, the Women's Prison Association and the Society of Friends.         Dr. Wortis was born in New York City, the daughter of Dr. Haven Emerson, a former City Commissioner of Health. She graduated from Radcliffe College and, in 1927, from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.         Early in her career, she worked as a doctor at the Bronxville School in Bronxville, N.Y. She was later visiting physician at Goldwater Memorial Hospital, on Roosevelt Island, and, in the 1970's, a doctor in the Suffolk County Outreach Unit's mobile health clinic. She retired just over 10 years ago.         Dr. Wortis is survived by two sons, Michael, of Burnaby, British Columbia, and Ethan, of Huntington, L.I.; a sister, Ruth Cooke of Kennett Square, Pa.; a brother, John H. Emerson of Arlington, Mass., and four grandchildren. Her husband, Dr. S. Bernard Wortis, died in 1969 after 35 years of marriage.       
         Onnie Lee Logan, the Alabama midwife who used what she called her God-given motherwit to deliver hundreds of babies before her 1989 autobiography made her a favorite in feminist circles, died on Tuesday at the Mobile Infirmary in Mobile, Ala. By her own reckoning she was about 85.         When she was born "somewhere about 1910," she once noted, midwives in rural Alabama weren't overly scrupulous about filing birth records for the grandchildren of slaves.         Mrs. Logan, the 14th of 16 children, was born on a farm in Marengo County, outside Sweet Water, about 120 miles north of Mobile.         On the surface, her life was little different from those of other black women of her era in southern Alabama. As a child she picked cotton, sewed and ironed to make money for her family. And for all her infectious optimism and perpetual good cheer, even as a "granny," as midwives were known in the South, Mrs. Logan, the daughter and granddaughter of midwives, was hardly unique.         In 1910, about half of the births in the United States were assisted by midwives, and the percentage was far higher in the rural south. Their clients were generally so poor that even Mrs. Logan, who delivered virtually every child born in the predominantly black Mobile suburb of Prichard from 1931 to 1984, had to supplement her income by working as a maid.         What ultimately set Mrs. Logan apart was not her work, but her compelling sense that hers was a story that had to be told. Or, as she put it, "I just got so much experience in here that I just want to explode."         Although she was barely literate, Mrs. Logan said she was so determined to tell it she would be prepared to "scratch it out" herself.         That proved unnecessary when a family she worked for introduced her to Katherine Clark, a young Harvard graduate who came to Mobile in 1984 to teach English at the University of South Alabama and is now a professor of English at the University of New Orleans.         "As soon as I met her, I knew there was a book in her," Professor Clark said yesterday, recalling that she had taped 100 hours of Mrs. Logan's recollections before editing them into what became "Motherwit: An Alabama Midwife's Story" (Dutton, 1989).         The book, still in print as a Plume paperback, was widely praised both for its vivid accounts of Mrs. Logan's life told in her distinctive vernacular and for her unflinchingly optimistic spirit in the face of pervasive adversity.         "Motherwit" made Mrs. Logan something of a folk hero, and two years ago she was represented along with Simone de Beauvoir, Anne Frank, Maya Angelou, Lillian Hellman, Joan Didion and other feminist luminaries in "The Norton Book of Women's Lives" (Norton, 1993).         Although lay midwives were outlawed by the state of Alabama in 1976, Mrs. Logan had attained such stature in Mobile that she was allowed to continue her practice under a permit from local authorities until 1984, when she received an abrupt notice telling her there was no longer a need for her services.         Mrs. Logan, who had delivered babies for almost two decades before receiving a state license in 1949, retired from her profession, but refused to abandon her calling. Despite all the advances in medical services to the poor, she knew that midwives were too often not the alternative to hospitals, but to husbands.         "They're not going to stop me from doing the gift that God give me to do," she said. "I don't be going there on no license. I be going there as a friend to help that husband deliver his baby."         Mrs. Logan, who was married three times, is survived by her husband, Roosevelt Logan; a son, Johnnine Watkins of Moss Point, Miss; a sister, Louise Blackman of Pensacola, Fla.; six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Alice V. Keliher, whose experiences as a lightly trained teacher of ill-prepared first graders led her to become a renowned expert on early childhood education and a champion of giving children unreserved respect and affection, died on Tuesday at the Tucson Medical Center in Arizona. She was 92.         A longtime professor of education at New York University, Miss Keliher cherished her unofficial title as the "grandmother of day care."         In the 1930's, she conducted seminal research on childhood development with Arnold Gesell at Yale University. In the 1940's and 1950's, as a member of N.Y.U.'s faculty, she served on virtually every city, state and national conference devoted to children and wrote widely on the subject.         And in the 1960's, while winding down her wide-ranging academic career as a professor at Wheelock College in Boston, she became the Massachusetts regional training officer for Head Start, the Federal program designed to provide disadvantaged children with the preschool enrichment Miss Keliher had been preaching to parents and educators for decades.         Although she trained teachers at N.Y.U. from 1936 to 1960, World War II provided her with her major platform.         As director of child and youth services of the New York Office of Civilian Defense, and secretary of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia's Committee on the Wartime Care of Children, Miss Keliher helped make day care an accepted staple of American life.         Her campaign for day care may have made her a legitimate feminist heroine, but Miss Keliher, who also helped lessen the burden on mothers by spearheading the development of kindergarten and nursery school, made it clear that her focus was not women, but their children.         Instead of talking about what "working mothers need," she said in 1949, the emphasis should be on "what makes a good next generation for America."         A native of Washington who received her teacher's certificate after two years of training, Miss Keliher was only 20 when she became a teacher in 1923. After four years in the Washington school system, she decided she could serve children better by teaching their teachers how to teach.         Obtaining bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in three years at Teachers College at Columbia University, she joined Dr. Gesell in 1930. She secured the job with the renowned child psychologist, she later confided, because she was the only applicant who knew how to operate a movie camera, a skill needed in research based on close observation of minute changes in infant behavior.         For all her dedication to her work, Miss Keliher's abiding passion was opera, and for decades she was a fixture in the center of the first row of the first balcony at the Metropolitan Opera (at just over 5 feet tall, she needed an unobstructed view), where her frequent guest was Eleanor Roosevelt.         The two women, who became friends when Mrs. Roosevelt took an apartment in Miss Keliher's building near Washington Square Park, enjoyed trading favors: Mrs. Roosevelt let Miss Keliher take her N.Y.U. students on field trips to the Roosevelt estate at Hyde Park. Miss Keliher, who had the larger oven, let Mrs. Roosevelt roast her turkeys in her kitchen.         Miss Keliher also shared Mrs. Roosevelt's devotion to human rights.         In a little-known chapter of her life, her lawyer, J. Dan O'Neill, said yesterday, Miss Keliher helped several Jewish families escape from Germany and Austria in the late 1930's. Her lawyer said the enterprise was organized by the love of her life, a shadowy American intelligence agent whose death in World War II led Miss Keliher to vow to remain unmarried.         Miss Keliher later created a furor when she refused to attend an education conference at a club known to exclude Jews. And she was such an outspoken champion of women, including their need for birth-control devices, Mr. O'Neill said, that she became a virtual pariah to her own Roman Catholic Church.         For all her books, like "Life and Growth" and "A Critical Study of Homogenous Grouping," Miss Keliher stressed a single theme, one she summed up in 1955: "If I could say just one thing to parents, it would be simply that a child needs someone who believes in him no matter what he does."         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Joan L. Hafey, a retired vice president for the New York advertising agency Young & Rubicam who was active in public-service advertising campaigns, died July 24 at Tisch Hospital of New York University Medical Center. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan and Southbury, Conn.         The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, a spokesman for Young & Rubicam said.         After beginning her career at Ladies Home Journal, Ms. Hafey managed press relations for Magnavox. She moved to Young & Rubicam in 1969. Ms. Hafey represented the agency and was involved in the Ad Council's public-service campaigns for the United Negro College Fund and the National Urban League. She also did volunteer public relations work for Covenant House and the Y.W.C.A. in New York, of which she was a board member.         After retiring in 1992, Ms. Hafey served as vice president for the agency's foundation and as the editor of its alumni magazine.         Ms. Hafey was a native of Holyoke, Mass., and graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1949.       
         Gail Beckenstein Sovern, a former investment analyst for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and legal librarian for the law firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, died on Tuesday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 39 and lived in Kew Gardens, Queens.         The cause was breast cancer, said her husband, Jeff Sovern. She was the daughter-in-law of Michael I. Sovern, president emeritus of Columbia University.         Ms. Sovern graduated from Brandeis University. She received a master's degree from Columbia's School of Library Service and an M.B.A. from New York University.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her parents, Murray and Shirley Beckenstein of Bellevue, Wash.; two daughters, Lindsay Madeline and Melanie; and a sister, Randi Fisher of London, Ont.       
         Mary Polak Oenslager, a philanthropist who supported the city's cultural institutions and helped causes from women's health to the visually impaired, died last Sunday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 98.         She endowed programs at several institutions that provide health care for women, like the Maternity Center Association on East 92d Street and Long Island College Hospital. The victim of an eye condition that left her nearly blind in midlife, she recovered her sight in one of the first cornea transplants and became a founder of Recordings for the Blind and a sponsor of blind university graduates.         Among her beneficiaries were the New York Philharmonic and its Free Concerts in the parks program, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Opera, the Metropolitan Museum, the Brooklyn Museum and the American Museum of Natural History.         She was the widow of Donald M. Oenslager, a theatrical designer, who died in 1975. She and her husband gave their collection of prints of theaters, costumes and stage sets to the Pierpont Morgan Library, of which she was a Fellow in Perpetuity. She also was a Conservator of the New York Public Library.         Mrs. Oenslager is survived by her brother-in-law, Malcolm G. Chace Jr. of North Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Fay Honey Knopp, an advocate of peace and civil rights who founded a Quaker ministry for men and women in prisons around the country, died on Thursday at her home in Shoreham, Vt. A former resident of Westport, Conn., she was 76.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, her family said in reporting her death this week.         A longtime Quaker minister to prisons, Mrs. Knopp retired two years ago as director of the Safer Society Program, which operates under the auspices of the New York State Council of Churches. The program, a national referral service for sex offenders seeking therapy, grew out of her visits to prison and the Prison Research Education Action Program she founded in 1976.         Under her leadership, an affiliated service, the Safer Society Press, produced about 20 books, research studies, manuals and training videos dealing with the treatment and prevention of sex-related crimes and intended for abusers and their victims.         Her affiliation with the Society of Friends dated to a peace demonstration in 1939. She became a Quaker in 1962 and was designated a "minister of record" to serve as a prison visitor throughout the Federal penitentiary system.         Over the years she also served as director of the New York Region of the American Friends Service Committee, projects director for the National Peace Education Division in Philadelphia and counselor to many conscientious objectors.         Prevention of sexual abuse was a major concern in her nearly 40 years of work with prisoners and, she said, she would be "tough with those guys."         "Society has let them off the hook by just locking them up," she told an interviewer in 1988. "I'm very up front with them. Yes, most of them were sexually abused as children, but that can't be an excuse to go out and abuse other people."         A native of Bridgeport, Conn., she studied at the Hartford Art School, the New School for Social Research and the University of California at Los Angeles.         She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Burton; a daughter, Prof. Sari Biklen of Syracuse; a son, State Representative Alex Knopp of Norwalk, Conn.; two sisters, Isabelle Yolen and Sylvia Wittenberg, both of Laguna Beach, Calif.; a brother, Leonard Irving of Fairfield, Conn., and four grandchildren.       
         Joyce Steins, a supporter of the arts and social causes who owned and operated several trendy Manhattan restaurants before retiring three years ago, died on Sunday in Riverhead Hospital on Long Island. A West Side resident, she was 52.         The cause was breast cancer, O. Aldon James Jr., a close friend, said.         Most recently she was the founder, owner and operating manager of Cafe Iguana on Park Avenue South, at 19th Street, a multilevel 225-seat Tex-Mex restaurant that had a strong following. Ms. Steins, the self-styled Mama Iguana, often went from table to table, extending personal greetings and chatting with regulars. The restaurant went out of business with her retirement.         She was born in Manhattan, and graduated with degrees in English and anthropology from the University of Hawaii. She was working on the staff of the American Museum of Natural History when a restaurateur interested her in the business. Changing course, she became a bus girl.         Twenty years later, in the early 1970's, she became an owner of El Rio Grande on East 38th Street, followed by Le Bar Bat on West 57th Street, a restaurant decorated with flying bats of blue, handblown glass. She later sold her stakes in them. Both remain in business.         She used her establishments for fund-raisers to benefit arts organizations and agencies combating AIDS, multiple sclerosis and child abuse.         Ms. Steins is survived by her sister, Loretta Friedman of West Hampton, L.I.       
         Oveta Culp Hobby, the creator of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps in World War II, the first Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and a longtime executive at the recently closed Houston Post, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 90.         Mrs. Hobby, whose media holdings made her one of the nation's richest women, suffered a stroke in April, her family said.         She went from being a small-town lawyer's well-read daughter to being a regular on fashion magazines' lists of well-dressed women, with her trendy designer gowns and hats from Bergdorf Goodman. She took lessons that erased the drawl from her conversations about the Picasso paintings she collected or the Bartok concertos she heard at the Houston Symphony. She also reorganized the business department of The Houston Post from top to bottom, and she later developed a reputation as a hard-working administrator who prized efficiency in government.         But she was not one to demand the credit.         "Everything that ever happened to me fell in my lap," she once said. "And nothing in my life would have been possible without Governor."         "Governor" was William P. Hobby, an easy-going newspaperman who was the top elected official in Texas from 1917 to 1921; his most notable action as Governor was to call out the state militia to crush a dock strike.         He was hired as publisher of The Houston Post-Dispatch at about the same time that Miss Culp, a friend of Florence Sterling, whose millionaire brother owned the paper, got a job in the circulation department.         Mr. Hobby's first wife died a year later. A couple of years later, after Miss Culp lost a campaign for a seat in the State Legislature, they were seen socializing around Houston. In 1931, when she was 26 and he 53, they were married.         "Will, she'll embarrass you," one of her husband's friends warned. "She doesn't give a hang about clothes."         But she learned to; in the 1950's her name appeared regularly on the lists of best-dressed women. She also learned about newspapers. The Hobbys eventually acquired ownership of The Post and she worked as a book reviewer, copy editor and editorial writer.         Their first child, William P. Hobby Jr., was born on Mrs. Hobby's 27th birthday, and her daughter, Jessica, on her 32d. As the publisher's wife, she became president of the Texas League of Women Voters, a member of the board of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, a member of the Houston Symphony Orchestra Committee and regional chairman of the Mobilization for Human Needs, all before she was 35.         Mrs. Hobby was born on Jan. 19, 1905, in Killeen, Tex., the daughter of Isaac and Emma Hoover Culp. Her first name was an Indian word that her parents chose because it rhymed with with Juanita, the name of one of her sisters.         Oveta soon demonstrated her independent-mindedness. A temperance campaign swept Killeen when she was 5, and her Sunday school class was asked to sign a pledge. She politely refused. Her grandmother heard about her refusal and had a switch ready. Not until afterward did her grandmother ask why she had refused. "I did not sign because I did not know what that word means -- temperance," she said. Her grandmother apologized.         She was her father's favorite; at 10 she read the Congressional Record in his office, and when he won a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1919 she went with him to Austin.         She briefly attended Mary Hardin Baylor College at Belton, Tex. Miss Culp was soon on the state payroll, in a job codifying statutes for the State Banking Committee. In 1925, when she was 20, a year shy of being old enough to vote, she was appointed parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature. Later she wrote a handbook on parliamentary procedure, "Mr. Chairman," which was used as a textbook throughout the state.         "If I hadn't been parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature, other things would never have been sparked," she said later. "Twenty is a wonderful age for things to be sparked."         One of the things sparked by her duties in Austin was an interest in politics. The 1928 Democratic National Convention was held in Houston, and she worked on senatorial and mayoral campaigns. She later ran for a seat in the State Legislature. Her opponent whispered that she was "a parliamentarian and a Unitarian." She lost. It was the last time she ran for office.         Mrs. Hobby was in Washington in 1941 for a meeting at the Federal Communications Commission -- the family owned radio station KPRC-AM -- when Gen. David Searles asked her to organize a section on women's activities for the Army. The War Department had been receiving 10,000 letters a day from women who wanted to serve their country. But Mrs. Hobby turned him down, saying that she had a husband, two children and a job.         General Searles asked her to draw up an organization chart with recommendations on ways that women could serve, and she did. He repeated his request that she go to work in Washington. She repeated her refusal. Then she told her husband.         "You shouldn't have made him have to ask you a second time," Mr. Hobby reportedly said at the time. "Any thoughtful person knows that we are in this war, and that every one of us is going to have to do whatever we are called upon to do." Mrs. Hobby went to Washington.         Her job was completely new in American military history, and she had to write her own rules. The idea of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps -- the name was changed to Women's Army Corps in 1943 -- was not well received by male commanders. Sergeants had jeeps, but Mrs. Hobby, who held the rank of colonel, had to call for a car from the War Department motor pool.         Members of the WACs enlisted for noncombat duty as medical technicians, cartography clerks, secretaries and similar types of jobs in the United States and in every war theater. By the end of World War II, about 100,000 women had joined the WAC. The organization was dissolved in 1978.         Mrs. Hobby received the Distinguished Service Medal in January 1945 for outstanding service "without guidance or precedents in United States military history.         Back in Houston, she renewed her political contacts and expanded the circulation of The Post, where she was an executive vice president and a director of KPRC, which came to include not only the AM station but also FM and television outlets.         Although she considered herself a conservative Democrat, she backed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, a Republican, when he ran for President in 1948, and Dwight D. Eisenhower in his successful Presidential campaign in 1952.         In return for her support, Mrs. Hobby was appointed to succeed Oscar E. Ewing as head of the Federal Security Agency. Her post did not have full Cabinet status when she was sworn in, but it was soon elevated to that rank and its name was changed to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mrs. Hobby was the nation's second woman to hold a Cabinet post; the first, Frances Perkins, was Secretary of Labor under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945.         In 31 months in charge of the department, which had a $1.7 billion annual budget, she oversaw the development of nurses training programs and a hospital reinsurance plan. She was also involved in the announcement of the Salk polio vaccine, and was praised at the time for having the patience to hold the announcement until the vaccine had been properly tested.         When Mrs. Hobby resigned, Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey was so dismayed that he said, "What? The best man in the Cabinet?"         Mrs. Hobby's reason for leaving Washington was straightforward: "Nothing is as important as Governor."         Her husband had been ill, but he improved once she was back in Houston. For the next nine years, until his death in 1964, they worked out of adjacent offices at The Post or a single large room in their home.         Mrs. Hobby sold The Post to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company in 1983 for about $130 million. The paper changed hands again a few years later, and was finally closed earlier this year.         In 1992, H&C Communications Inc., another family enterprise, sold its five television stations. The sale left H&C with only one broadcast outlet, the Hobby's original station, KPRC-AM in Houston.         Besides her son, who was the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991 and was recently named chancellor of the University of Houston, and her daughter, Jessica Catto, of San Antonio, she is survived by a sister, Mrs. Loy Loving, of Weslaco, Tex., 8 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Helen Singer Kaplan, a pioneer in the field of sex therapy and founder of the country's first clinic for sexual disorders established at a medical school, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Kaplan was considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists. She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods.         She agreed with others in the field that sexual difficulties often had superficial origins. But she held that, in case an unconscious conflict lay at the root of the disorder, it could indicate deep emotional problems and require the therapist to resort to more analytical means.         Consequently, her approach was seen as psychosexual therapy, to distinguish it from sex therapy. And her arrival on the scene manifested the way psychoanalysts gradually adapted to new sex-therapy techniques.         Although not so well known to the public as the sex researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson, Dr. Kaplan was a leader in her field. She also had her differences with the Masters-Johnson team, questioning their advocacy and use of two therapists working together because, she felt, one therapist of either sex would suffice.         Working as a clinical professor of psychiatry, she became the founder, in 1970, of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, one of the country's most prominent psychiatric clinics and part of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center complex. She remained its director until her death.         Born Helen Singer in Vienna on Feb. 6, 1929, she came to the United States in 1940 and became a citizen in 1947. She graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Syracuse University in 1951 and earned a master's degree in psychology at Columbia University in 1952. She got a Ph.D in psychology in 1955 at Columbia.         In 1959, she received her medical degree from New York Medical College, where she completed a comprehensive course in psychoanalysis in 1970.         She trained in clinical psychology at Veterans Administration hospitals and clinics in Montrose, N.Y., and the Bronx, interned at Bronx Hospital and completed her training as a fellow of psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital and New York Medical College-Metropolitan Hospital Center.         There the first phase of her professional teaching career unfolded as she developed and coordinated a basic behavioral science program for psychiatric residents as well as a freshman medical course in psychiatry. She also developed and taught a required course in psychopharmacology.         From 1960 until she established her program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, she was an associate professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College and an associate attending psychiatrist at Metropolitan, Flower and B.S. Coler Hospitals. At Medical College and Metropolitan Hospital Center she also served as chief of psychosomatic and consultation services, co-director of the Behavior Therapy Unit, chairman of the Behavioral Science Teaching Program and director of a program for women residents with children.         She established new programs, including one to train the psychiatric and obstetrics-gynecology staff in human sexuality.         She was appointed a professor of psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in 1970. Aside from directing her program at the Payne Whitney, she was in charge of undergraduate teaching of psychiatry and curriculum development until 1976.         Her human sexuality program included an outpatient clinic for the evaluation and treatment of psychosexual disorders. This generated clinical materials for postgraduate training courses for enrolled physicians and mental-health professionals. Dr. Kaplan was in charge of all education and training programs in human sexuality for Cornell medical students and psychiatric residents at the Payne Whitney.         Dr. Kaplan was credited with 110 publications and 127 lectures and presentations taking in the full range of her specialty.         Several of her books remain in print. These include "New Sex Therapy: Active Treatment of Sexual Dysfunctions" (Random House, 1974), "Disorders of Sexual Desires and Other New Concepts and Techniques in Sex Therapy" (Brunner-Mazel, 1979), "The Evaluation of Sexual Disorders: Psychological and Medical Aspects" (Brunner, 1983), "The Illustrated Manual of Sex Therapy" (Brunner; 2d ed., 1987), "How to Overcome Premature Ejaculation" (Brunner, 1989), and, with Donald F. Klein, "Sexual Aversion, Sexual Phobias and Panic Disorder" (Brunner, 1987).         Dr. Kaplan is survived by her husband of 15 years, Charles P. Lazarus; two sons, Dr. Phillip Kaplan and Dr. Peter Kaplan, a daughter, Jennifer Kaplan-D'Addio, all of the Upper East Side; a brother, Frank Singer of California, and two grandsons.         Correction:  August 23, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary on Saturday of Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan, founder of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, omitted a survivor. She is Sofie Kane of Manhattan, Dr. Kaplan's mother.       
         Gloria Chadwick, an international ski racing administrator who was especially dedicated to furthering women's cross-country competition, died on Sunday at her home in Lake Placid, N.Y. She was 63.         Her brother, Norman Chadwick of Mount Vernon, Wash., said she died of cancer.         In her youth, Miss Chadwick was a downhill ski racer on the United States A team. She had wanted to compete at the Olympic level, but a skiing accident in which she broke her leg sidelined that ambition.         Undaunted, she went on to make her mark in the sport through administrative undertakings, and in 1986, was inducted into the United States National Ski Hall of Fame in Ishpeming, Mich.         She had been director of the United States Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid since 1985, and was executive director of the United States Ski Association from 1961-68. She was also the first national coordinator for Nastar, a racing program for recreational skiers.         For the last decade, she focused her efforts on behalf of women in skiing as chairman of the International Ski Federation Subcommittee on Women's Cross-Country.         Miss Chadwick was born in Philadelphia, but her family moved to Lowell, Mass., when she was a toddler. As a teen-ager from a modest home, Miss Chadwick honed her Alpine skills by skiing regularly at nearby Cannon Mountain, N.H.         She received a bachelor's and master's degree in business from the now-defunct Staley College in Brookline, Mass., and later studied management at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif.         In a breakthrough for women in the ski industry, she was hired in 1971 by the Big Sky Resort near Bozeman, Mont., to be director of marketing, and later, a vice president.         From 1975 to 1983, she was president and general manager of Burke Mountain, Vt. In 1983, she became commissioner of economic development for the state of Vermont.         In 1985, Miss Chadwick opened the United States Olympic Education Center at Northern Michigan University in Marquette, Mich. Later that year, she also began supervising the $12 million modernization of the Lake Placid training center.         During the last two years, she was in charge of developing the ARCO United States Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Calif.         Miss Chadwick is survived by her brother.       
         Niuta Titus, whose philanthropy fostered culture and medical research, died on Tuesday in Gstaad, Switzerland, while on vacation. Mrs. Titus, who lived in Manhattan, was 82.         With her husband, Roy V. Titus, the former chairman of the Helena Rubinstein cosmetics empire, who died in 1989, Mrs. Titus supported endeavors like the film program at the Museum of Modern Art, biochemistry at Duke University and ophthalmological research at the Wilmer Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.         She was the president of the Roy and Niuta Titus Foundation, an honorary trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, a director of the Children's Blood Foundation, president of the Zion Orphanage in Jerusalem, a member of the international board of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and honorary director of the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, which is devoted to the health, education and welfare of women and children.         Many film buffs in New York have pursued their passion at institutions supported by Mr. and Mrs. Titus. Among them were the Film Society of Lincoln Center, the Film Forum as well as the Museum of Modern Art. In 1976, at a time of pressing financial problems for the museum, Mr. Titus and his wife donated $1 million to renovate its 37-year-old auditorium and for its endowment. Six years later, the couple sponsored a second theater, and the auditoriums are named for them.         Despite her high-visibility projects, Mrs. Titus was not a public figure. She enjoyed the company of friends and, in particular, liked a good game of bridge.         She was a member of the Regency Whist Club and the Cavendish Club, a private bridge club, where she met Mr. Titus after she had been widowed twice. They were married in 1960. Twenty years later, they were both still playing bridge at the club.         Mrs. Titus was born in Lithuania, where she grew up. Before World War II, she lived in Paris with her first husband, Benno Slesin, the general manager for Europe for Warner Brothers.         She came to the United States in 1940, and after Mr. Slesin died in an airplane crash in 1947, she marriedBernard Miller, a cutlery manufacturer in England. He died in 1953.         Mrs. Titus is survived by two children of her first marriage, Louis E. Slesin of Manhattan, and Suzanne Slesin Steinberg of Manhattan, an assistant editor in the Home section of The New York Times; and three grandchildren.       
         Florene May Schoenborn, a benefactor and life trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, to which she gave dozens of paintings collected over the years by her and her second husband, Samuel A. Marx, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         The couple came to own what was among the most distinguished collections of modern art in private hands. The collection included the most outstanding collection of early works by Matisse outside Russia, the museum said.         Mrs. Schoenborn became a museum trustee in 1953 and served on the program and drawing comittees. She was a founding member of the museum's international council in 1954.         She was born in Denver. Her father was David May Sr., the founder of May Department Stores, who started his chain in Leadville, Colo. As a young woman, she hoped to study journalism at Columbia University but her father would not permit her to attend.         Forty-four of her paintings were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in a 1965 exhibition, "The School of Paris: Paintings From the Florene May Schoenborn and Samuel A. Marx Collection." Mr. Marx, a successful Chicago architect, died in 1964.         Mrs. Schoenborn donated many important paintings, drawings, sculptures and prints to the museum. The core of her contributions consisted of five paintings by Matisse: "Moroccan Garden" (1912), "Woman on a High Stool" (1914), "Artist and Goldfish" (1914), "Variation on a Still Life by De Heen" (1915) and "The Moroccans" (1915).         The gallery showing Matisse works from the museum's permanent collection was named the Florene May Schoenborn Gallery in 1986.         Her first marriage, to Martin Straus, an advertising executive, ended in divorce. Her third husband, Wolfgang Schoenborn, a developer who helped to turn the old Pacific port of Acapulco into a fashionable resort, died in 1986.         She is survived by five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.         Correction:  September 1, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Saturday about Florene May Schoenborn, a benefactor and life trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, misstated the number of paintings she gave to the museum. Her gifts included five paintings by Matisse and drawings, sculptures and prints by many other artists, not dozens of paintings.       
         Lee Hadley, an Iowa State English professor who helped turn a collaborative pedagogical sendup into an acclaimed literary career as half of a writing team known to young readers as Hadley Irwin, died on Tuesday at her home in Madrid, Iowa. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, said her collaborator, Annabelle Irwin, a retired Iowa State professor.         In the arcane world of children's literature in which 8-to-12-year-olds are termed middle-aged and a 17-year-old is deemed to have one teen-age foot in the grave, the Hadley Irwin books were aimed at audiences aged 12 to 16, known as young adults.         Specializing in a subgenre known as problem novels, they wrote about teen-agers dealing with such distinctly adult themes as racism ("Kim/Kimi"), suicide ("So Long at the Fair") and alcoholism ("Can't Hear You Listening").         Even those themes were considered tame compared with that of "Abby, My Love," their breakthrough 1985 novel that stunned the industry as the first in children's literature to deal with incest.         As collaborators, the women justified their fused pen name by writing in such a seamless voice that it was impossible to tell where Ms. Hadley left off and Mrs. Irwin began.         No wonder. The women, who began their books at Mrs. Irwin's lakeside home during summer vacations then revised during the school year, sometimes sat side by side at the same typewriter finishing each other's sentences.         "She was better at characters, and I was better at plots," Mrs. Irwin said.         Ms. Hadley, a wiry, energetic woman who never married, and the older, plumper Mrs. Irwin, the mother of four children, were a study in contrasts when they took their collaboration on the road with a series of tag-team speeches to education and publishing conferences.         Ms. Hadley, an Iowa native, graduated from Drake University and received a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin. She spent seven years teaching at a junior college in New Jersey before she joined the Iowa State faculty to teach creative writing in 1969, a year before Mrs. Irwin, a former elementary school teacher, arrived.         Mrs. Irwin traced their collaboration to their experience as the only members of a faculty committee whose sole product was a jointly written final report, a spoof they peppered with such leaden jargon as "cognitive learning."         The dean was not unamused. "We weren't fired," Mrs. Irwin said.         With more than a dozen books still in print and a new one, "Sarah With an H," which deals with anti-Semitism, coming soon from their publisher, the Simon & Schuster McElderry imprint, the women had strong steady sales, but not enough to give up their teaching jobs.         Hadley Irwin was never more than a sideline for Ms. Hadley. Her main focus was her teaching, a task she accomplished with such flair that she was the only woman on the Iowa State faculty who was made a full professor without benefit of a doctorate.         In a field where creative-writing teachers are judged by the published authors they train, Ms. Hadley assured herself a measure of instant success. In a class on magazine writing, she promised an A to any student who produced an acceptance check from a magazine and always had two or three students who made the grade.         She is survived by a sister, Mildred Rich of Oskaloosa, Iowa.       
         Evelyn Wood, whose search for a way to improve the lives of troubled girls led to the development of speed reading techniques prescribed by Presidents and endorsed by multitudes, died on Saturday in Hospice Family Care in Tucson, Ariz. Mrs. Wood, who lived in Tucson, was 86.         The tiny, soft-spoken woman who gave her name to Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics liberated students, professionals and business people from the habits that shackled them to the average American's reading rate of 250 to 300 words a minute.         In courses that proliferated from coast to coast and spread overseas, they learned the methods that enabled them not only to read two to five times faster but also to better retain what they read.         "So many people are dubious about trying my method because they think they're liable to miss a lot," Mrs. Wood said in an interview a quarter of a century ago. "I say, which would you rather do: eat a dish of rice kernel by kernel or take a spoonful to get a good taste? My reading technique is actually comprehension by accumulation."         In years of research ignited by a professor who read her 80-page term paper at an astonishing rate while retaining its content, she found people from all walks of life who could read from 1,500 to 6,000 words a minute and sometimes more. And Mrs. Wood (who could herself read 2,700 words a minute), discovered that they shared several traits:         *They read down the page rather than left to right.         *They read groups of words or complete thoughts rather than one word at a time.         *They avoided involuntary rereading of material.         *Their reading efficiency was applicable to a variety of materials.         In time, President John F. Kennedy sent a dozen members of the White House staff to the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute in Washington. President Richard M. Nixon sent 35 high-ranking members of his Administration, and President Jimmy Carter followed suit.         Students learned to break the habits that slowed them, including saying words under their breath, or subvocalizing. And the hand or finger, sweeping down the page, was used to "pace" the eyes at increasingly faster speeds, while the reader was urged to concentrate not on single words but on groups of words -- sentences, clauses and the like -- that make up units of thought.         At one session, a college student devoured a sociology textbook at the rate of 14,000 words a minute. In another, 25 students were assigned to finish George Orwell's "Animal Farm" in 25 minutes, a feat that required a reading rate of 1,400 words a minute. Most finished in the allotted time, and most scored well on the comprehension test that followed.         There were few claims that extremely difficult or unfamiliar material could be mastered at accelerated rates. But it was clear that many people could be taught to read faster and more effectively.         "Speed is not most important, but only through speed do you get good comprehension," Mrs. Wood said.         It was a theory that Mrs. Wood began to develop during the late 1940's and early 1950's, when she was a teacher and girls' counselor at Jordan High School in Salt Lake City.         Dealing with underachievers with personality problems, Mrs. Wood realized that they had one thing in common. All were poor readers.         Mrs. Wood established the school's first remedial reading program and discovered that as the girls read better, their grades improved in every subject and they became better adjusted.         And she discovered one other thing: the faster the girls read, the better they read.         She began refining her techniques for faster reading.         The next breakthrough came when Mrs. Wood, who was born in 1909 in Logan, Utah, returned to the University of Utah. At the college where she had earned her bachelor's degree in English in 1929, she now pursued a master's degree in speech.         When she turned in her term paper to the head of the department, Dr. C. Lowell Lees, she recalled:         "I handed Dr. Lees a term paper and watched him flip through the 80 pages at a startling rate, grade the paper and hand it back. He appeared to be reading as fast as he could turn the pages. He knew the total content and was able to tell me not only what was in it, but also what was missing. Intrigued, I clocked him on other material and found he could read at a rate of 2,500 words a minute."         In 1958, when she was sent on a national promotional tour for "Reading Skills," a groundbreaking book on remedial reading written in collaboration with Marjorie Westcott Barrows of Jordan High, Mrs. Wood began asking everywhere, "Do you know anyone who can read fast?"         The answers led her to 53 people whose traits came to inform her teaching.         Later that summer, frustrated with her efforts to increase her own reading speed, she discovered the use of the hand as a pacer.         "Before I introduced that technique," she once told an interviewer, "only children in the early grades used their fingers on the printed pages to guide their reading. And then they were taught not to!"         In 1959, with her husband, Doug, Mrs. Wood established the first of her institutes, in Washington. In 1967, she sold the business. It has been owned since September 1993 by Pryor Resources, a business seminar training company in Kansas City, Kan.         Mrs. Wood continued to teach and was developing a remedial reading program for children when she suffered an incapacitating stroke in 1976.         Her husband died in 1987. She is survived by her daughter, Carol Davis Evans of Tucson; four grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.       
         Gloria Wills Landes, a former Broadway showgirl who capped a brief, effervescent career by founding and directing an acclaimed school for aspiring teen-age actors and playwrights, died on Friday at her home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 69.         Mrs. Landes was the director of the SUNY Youth Theater in Purchase, N.Y., until she became ill last year. She had breast cancer, her family said.         If Gloria Wills's days on Broadway had been a Busby Berkeley musical, she would have been the star's funny and bubbly best friend, the one who has her moments in the spotlight but gives up a promising career to marry a rich businessman.         Mrs. Landes's career lasted only three years, but by the time she left a Broadway-bound show in Philadelphia in 1948 to marry Jack Landes, a wealthy silver importer, she had something to tell her grandchildren.  Like hundreds of other stage-struck singers, dancers and actors who have passed through Broadway's revolving door over the years, she had a scrapbook proving that she had been a part of a great tradition.         She may have spent more time auditioning than performing, but she was a Brooklyn girl who could belt out a song, and her persistent auditions at least made an impression on Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. Rodgers once said she had auditioned for every part in "Oklahoma!" except the villain, Jud Fry.  If she missed a week trying out for the part of Ado Annie, the "girl who can't say no," Hammerstein would ask if she had been sick.         She may not have been a star, but the critic Walter Kerr once called her "one of the funniest things on Broadway," and she had her share of brushes with destiny and Broadway cliches.         In 1945, for example, she was in the chorus of "Carousel" when she discovered new meaning in the old theater good-luck wish of "break a leg." A featured singer got sick, and her understudy, rushing in to replace her, fell down the dressing room steps and actually broke a leg. Mrs. Landes, then all of 19 years old, spent the next six weeks singing "You'll Never Walk Alone."         Then there was the birthday party for "Oklahoma!" She did a comic version of Agnes de Mille's famous second-act ballet that left Miss de Mille in stitches and persuaded Rodgers and Hammerstein to cast her as Beulah, the campus vamp, in the musical "Allegro" in 1947.         That led to a part in the revue "Make Mine Manhattan," with Sid Caesar, but Mrs. Landes, who had doubts about the part and her future in the theater, left the show in Philadelphia to accept what she decided was a better offer: to marry Mr. Landes and live happily ever after.         That is more or less what she did. Several months after she was married, Cole Porter asked her to be Bianca in "Kiss Me Kate," but she was pregnant by then with the first of her four sons.         Unlike many other short-term performers who end up in the suburbs, Mrs. Landes found a second act. After performing in summer stock, she established a school for teen-age performers that was absorbed by the State University of New York at Purchase, where she taught a generation of young actors and playwrights, including Matt Dillon.         Mrs. Landes's husband died in 1989. She is survived by her sons, Mark of Potomac, Md., Dan of Brooklyn, Robert of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Peter of San Rafael, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and a brother, Herbery Wolfson of Wilmington, Del.       
         Eileen Chang, a popular novelist and short story writer whose finely honed psychological studies and precise language won her acclaim as a giant of modern Chinese literature, was found dead on Friday in the Los Angeles apartment where she had lived as a virtual recluse. She was 74.         Friends said that Miss Chang, known to Chinese readers as Chang Ai-ling, had died of natural causes several days before her building manager discovered her body after becoming alarmed that she had not answered her telephone.         Miss Chang, a native of Shanghai, was at once a beloved figure who had a huge devoted following in Taiwan, Hong Kong and in other Chinese communities around the world and a lionized author whose works, particularly her early short stories, were hailed as classics by literary critics.         News of her death drew front-page tributes in Taiwan and Hong Kong.         "She was a rarity," said Dominic Cheung, a poet and professor of East Asian languages at the University of Southern California.         Had it not been for the political division between the Nationalist and Communist Chinese, he said, she would have almost certainly won a Nobel Prize.         As it was, until recently her works had been suppressed in mainland China, largely because two of her most widely known novels, "Rice Sprout Song" (1954) and "The Naked Earth" (1956), both of which appeared in both Chinese and English, were unsparing in their criticism of Communists.         For all that, Miss Chang was largely apolitical in her life and in her works, many of them bitter love stories that captivated readers in Taiwan and Hong Kong, where several of her books and stories were made into movies. The films included "Love in a Fallen City" (1990), "The Rouge of the North" (1991) and "Red Rose, White Rose" (1995).         C. T. Hsia, a retired professor of Chinese at Columbia University who once called Miss Chang "the most gifted Chinese writer to emerge in the 40's," compared her favorably yesterday with such widely acclaimed writers as Katherine Mansfield, Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Welty and especially Flannery O'Connor and Franz Kafka.         Like both O'Connor and Kafka, he said, she tended to be "a bit odd and lonely."         Loneliness was a theme of her life. According to her friends, Miss Chang's insights into human emotions, especially those of women in the throes of thwarted romance, were grounded in her experiences with a cruel father who abandoned her mother and her first husband, Hu Lan Cheng, a Chinese writer who collaborated with the Japanese in World War II and later betrayed Miss Chang with another woman.         Her second husband, Ferdinand Reyher, a friend of Bertold Brecht's whom she met at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, died in 1967.         Miss Chang, who was forced by the Japanese invasion to abandon her college education in Hong Kong, enjoyed a measure of popular success after returning to Shanghai, but her works were dismissed as mere romances until her 1943 novella, "The Golden Cangue" (named for a form of restraint resembling the stocks used in colonial America), established her literary reputation.         Miss Chang, who returned to Hong Kong in 1952 and moved to the United States three years later, was such a recluse that she refused to meet the steady stream of prominent editors who sought her out.         Even her editor in Taiwan had to communicate with her by fax, sometimes waiting days for a reply because she used a machine at a neighborhood grocery store.         Last year she was persuaded to accept a major literary award in Taiwan, but, typically, she refused to accept it in person.         Instead she sent a group of photographs of herself dating back to the 1930's but including one recent likeness in which she looked so improbably young that she took the precaution of posing with a newspaper showing the date.         There are no survivors.       
         Frances Webb Roosevelt, a portrait artist who was the mother-in-law of Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, died on Monday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 78 and lived on the Roosevelt estate, Sagamore Hill, in Oyster Bay, L.I.         Mrs. Roosevelt was the widow of President Theodore Roosevelt's grandson, Quentin Roosevelt.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said Ilene Hoffer, a spokeswoman for Governor Weld.         Mrs. Roosevelt was a native of Kansas City, Mo., and graduated from Smith College in 1939. She married Quentin Roosevelt in England in April 1944, two months before her husband, an Army captain, participated in the D-Day invasion. During the war, Mrs. Roosevelt, a Red Cross worker, drew pictures of soldiers on postcards that they later sent home to their families.         After the war, the family moved to Shanghai and lived there until Quentin Roosevelt died in a plane crash near Hong Kong in 1948. Mrs. Roosevelt then moved with her children to Sagamore Hill.         A well-known portrait artist in Oyster Bay, Mrs. Roosevelt taught art at C. W. Post College in Brookville, L.I. During the late 1940's and early 1950's, she worked as a courtroom sketch artist for several newspapers and covered the perjury trial of Alger Hiss, the American diplomat who had been accused of spying for the Soviet Union.         Mrs. Roosevelt is survived by three daughters, Susan Roosevelt Weld of Boston, the wife of Governor Weld; Anna Curtenius Roosevelt of Chicago, and Alexandra Dworkin of Baltimore, and five grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Morris, an Emmy Award-winning television producer and director for WNYW-TV, died on Sunday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 75 and lived in Manhattan.         She died after multiple medical problems, her family said.         Ms. Morris, who was born in San Francisco, graduated from the University of California at Berkeley.         She was the director of public affairs for WNYW for 17 years. She won her Emmy in 1978 for an interview program on the eve of a local election.         As a member of the board of the New York City Council on Alcoholism in 1985, Ms. Morris produced a special program on recovering alcoholics. She also produced a series of shows for the Harlem Cultural Festival.         Ms. Morris is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Morris of Manhattan and Elede Hall of Menlo Park, Calif.       
         Joanne Toor Cummings, a philanthropist and patron of the arts, died yesterday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, according to the family.         Mrs. Cummings and her husband, Nathan Cummings, the founder of the Consolidated Foods Corporation, who died in 1985, were longtime collectors. The Cummingses gave more than 600 pieces of pre-Columbian works to a gallery bearing his name at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Their apartment overlooking Fifth Avenue was filled with an array of sculpture by Giacometti and Manzu and paintings by Matisse, Gauguin and Degas.         They also made substantial contributions to the Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York Hospital, Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and other hospitals.         Mrs. Cummings was born in Chicago, the daughter of Harriet Toor and Harold Toor, former chairman of the United States Shoe Corporation.         She graduated in 1953 from Connecticut College, to which she and her husband donated the Joanne and Nathan Cummings Art Center and endowed a scholarship for needy students. She served as a trustee of the college from 1981 to 1991.         She also received a master's degree from Columbia University's School of International Relations. She was a member of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy for 19 years, and its senior vice president since 1991.         Mrs. Cummings was involved in a wide variety of philanthropies. She was a life governing member of the Chicago Art Institute and a patron of the American Ballet Theater, New York City Ballet, New York City Opera, Metropolitan Opera and Metropolitan Museum of Art.         She is survived by a sister, Suzanne Toor Karpas of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and Manhattan.       
         Charlotte Appleton Kidder Ramsay, a philanthropist and wildlife conservationist, died on Saturday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. She was 53.         Her death, which her husband, William Ramsay, said was caused by an aneurysm, occurred two days before that of her mother, Dorothy Robinson Kidder, who died of cancer at age 78.         Mrs. Ramsay was a member of the advisory council of the African Wildlife Foundation and founder and chairwoman of the Jordan Conservation and Research Center, an organization dedicated to training African wildlife researchers.         Born in Australia, where her father, Randolph A. Kidder, was on assignment in the Foreign Service, Mrs. Ramsay was the great-great-granddaughter of Eben D. Jordan, founder of the Jordan Marsh department stores and The Boston Globe.         Her first marriage, to E. Joseph Luskey, ended in divorce in 1983.         She is survived by her second husband, Mr. Ramsay, a scientist and writer whom she married in 1988; a daughter, Ann Luskey Weir, and a son, Randolph Kidder Luskey, both of Washington; her father and a brother, Michael Randolph Kidder of Spofford, N.H.       
         Annie Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, the younger of the two sisters whose wisdom and triumphs have been celebrated in a best-selling book and in the Broadway play "Having Our Say," died yesterday at her home in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. She was 104.         "She just took a couple of deep breaths and passed away," said Amy Hill Hearth, co-author of "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 years," the 1993 best-selling oral history. "And it's an important thing she died at home, in her bed, with her sister there. That's all she wanted."         Her 106-year-old sister, Sarah, known as Sadie, with whom she had lived for more than 100 years, seemed to handle her sister's death with the same strength that had carried her through a century.         "I'll just do the best I can," Sarah Delany told Ms. Hearth in an interview at her home. "I'll continue right on as if Bessie were here."         She added that for her sister, whose life was filled with many achievements, the last few years had been particularly special. "Bessie lived to be 104, and she lived her life the way she wanted to," she said. "And especially the last couple of years, she has been having a ball. Between the play and books, she has been having the time of her life. And she said you really couldn't ask for anything more."         The two sisters had lived so long and seen so much that to some it seemed they might live forever. Born a generation after the Civil War, they had triumphed over Jim Crow, worked in Harlem during its renaissance, borne witness to the feminist and civil rights movements and in recent years, become national celebrities.         Their award-winning memoir has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 19 months, sold more than 900,000 copies and been translated into four foreign languages. They were co-authors of a second book, "The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom" (Kodansha America, 1994) which has sold 160,000 copies. And in April their Mt. Vernon parlor was re-created on Broadway, in a dramatization that earned three Tony nominations.         Bessie Delany often marveled that the nation would be interested in what two elderly black women had to say. She wanted her life seen not so much as a story of blacks or of women, but of America.         The sisters' lives remained simple despite their celebrity. They rose early to eat a breakfast of oatmeal, went to bed after watching the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour on a black-and-white television and had no telephone. They relied mostly on each other for comfort and company. In more than a century, they lived apart for only a few months. And Sarah Delany said many times that it was for her baby sister that she had lived so long.         Annie Elizabeth Delany was born on Sept. 3, 1891, in Raleigh, N.C., the third child of a former slave who became the country's first black Episcopal bishop. Raised on the campus of St. Augustine's College, she and her siblings were well-educated, nurtured and sheltered from the harsher edges of American racism.         But she and her sister often spoke of the first time they were told to go to the back of the trolley car. And they remembered how the staff at the drugstore refused to serve them. Still, Bessie Delany was undaunted. Known as the feistier of the sisters, she was once almost lynched for speaking rudely to a "rebby boy." And she often told tales of how as a child she would sneak a sip from the forbidden side of the water fountain. 'I'd just take a drink of the white water," she said. "It didn't taste any different."         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1911 and worked as a teacher in North Carolina and Georgia to earn the money she needed to continue her education. The few months in 1912 that she and Sadie taught in different parts of the South was the only time they did not live together.         In 1917, the two sisters made their way to New York City. Bessie had planned to become a doctor but ultimately decided to go to dental school. She graduated from Columbia University in 1923 and became the second black woman to work as a dentist in New York.         Known as "Dr. Bessie, Harlem's colored woman dentist," Dr. Delany socialized with Cab Calloway, W. E. B. Du Bois and the doyennes of the Harlem Renaissance. But she treated many of Harlem's poor, and in 27 years of practice never raised her rates. It was $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling, from 1923 until the day she retired, in 1950.         Like her sister Sarah, the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school, she never married or had children. They referred to themselves as "Negro maiden ladies" and lived together in a Harlem apartment, in a Bronx cottage and finally in the Mt. Vernon home they bought in 1957.         With the death of their youngest sister, Laura, in 1993, they were the last survivors among their parents' children. When asked in a 1993 interview if she could account for her and her sister's longevity, Dr. Delany replied, "Honey, we never married; we never had husbands to worry us to death." As for mortality, she said, "I haven't been afraid to live, and I won't be afraid to die."         Recently Dr. Delany had become more frail, Ms. Hearth said. And in the time the two women knew each other, she often spoke about death, though with characteristic sass and humor. "She was worried she was too mean to get into heaven," Ms. Hearth remembered, laughing.         A funeral service is to be held on Thursday at 10:30 A.M. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. And before the curtain rises on "Having Our Say" tonight, there will be a brief tribute at the Booth Theater.         In addition to her sister, Dr. Delany is survived by 14 nieces and nephews.       
         Mary-Scott Welch, a writer and feminist leader who fostered the concept of networking to advance a woman's career, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 75.         The cause was cancer, said Hubert Pryor, her companion.         Ms. Welch wrote "Networking: The Great New Way for Women to Get Ahead" (Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1980) in an era when more women were competing for jobs traditionally dominated by men.         Networking, through individual contacts and professional organizations, became an important technique for women to get career advice and make connections. Such contacts also helped offset the competitive advantage men often enjoyed through their own "old boy" network.         Ms. Welch wrote books on varied topics, including wilderness trips, cooking, travel for teen-age girls and etiquette. She was also a freelance magazine writer whose work was published in Redbook, Esquire, Ladies Home Journal, Woman's Day, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Reader's Digest and Modern Maturity. Ms. Welch also worked as an editor at Pageant and Look magazines and was editor in chief of Homemaker's Digest.         She served on advisory boards for Cornell University's Institute for Women and Work and for the National Organization for Women. In the 1970's, she was the coordinator of NOW's Rape Prevention Committee in New York City.         Ms. Welch, who was known as Scotty, was born in Chicago. After graduating from the University of Illinois, she was in the first group of Waves commissioned by the Navy during World War II.         For most of her career, she lived in New York City. She was married to Barrett Welch, a marketing and advertising executive, from 1943 until his death in 1981.         Her survivors include a son, Farley, of Portland, Ore.; three daughters, Laurie Welch of Washington, Margaret Welch of Seattle, and Molly Welch of Greenfield, Mass., and five grandchildren.       
         Anyone attending the inauguration this weekend of Ruth Simmons as Smith College's ninth president will be likely to note the presence of such luminaries as Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning author; Johnnetta Cole, the president of Spelman College; Cornel West, the scholar, and Henry Louis Gates, the writer and chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard.         But they might miss the people who Ruth Simmons believes are the most important -- those responsible for her becoming the first black president of one of the country's most elite women's colleges. They are her nine brothers and sisters: Elbert, Wilford, Atherine, Albert, Arnold, Nora, Clarence, Ozella and Azella. Her eighth-grade teacher, Modria Caraway. Her high school drama teacher, Vernell Lillie.         Her kindergarten teacher, Ida Mae Henderson, would like to be there, but at age 85, she is not strong enough to make the trip alone from Grapeland, Tex. "Miss Ida Mae," Dr. Simmons said. "I revere her."         Dr. Simmons, who is 50, is the great-great-granddaughter of slaves. She began her journey on a cotton farm in Grapeland, in East Texas. Her parents, the late Isaac and Fannie Stubblefield, were sharecroppers. Dr. Simmons was the youngest of 12 children -- two brothers are dead -- and was 7 when the family moved to a poor section of Houston. Her father went to work in a factory and eventually became pastor of the Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church. Her mother scrubbed floors for white families.         To Henry Louis Gates, the appointment of a black woman to the top job at Smith is "a major event in the history of American letters." Professor Gates, who regards Dr. Simmons as a mentor, said, "She's the Jackie Robinson of college presidents."         Ask Ruth Simmons how she did it, how she made her way from Grapeland to the provost's job at Spelman College to vice provost at Princeton University to the presidency of Smith, and she seems startled by the question. "I didn't make it happen," she said in an interview the other day in her wood-paneled office at Smith. "That's just the point."         It was her teachers at the segregated schools she attended, W. R. Banks Elementary in Grapeland and Phyllis Wheatley High in Houston, who made it happen, she said. "They thought I belonged in college," she said. "And they were convinced they would get me there. They protected me, especially after my mother died."         She was 15 when her mother lost her battle with kidney disease. "I had a remarkable mother," said Dr. Simmons, who is 50. "When she would do day's work, she would sometimes take me with her to white people's houses when I was a little girl. The thing I remember vividly is how good she was at what she did. She was very demanding in terms of her own work -- Do it well, do it thoroughly, whatever you do."         After graduation from high school, she went to Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans, where she majored in Romance languages.         "Vernell Lillie wrote to Dillard, which is where she had gone, and asked them to provide a scholarship for me," Dr. Simmons said.         Ms. Lillie, a professor of African studies at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview: "She was brilliant. I was very fortunate to be a part of her life."         The scholarship did not cover everything. "I didn't have enough money to buy clothes," said Dr. Simmons, who was elegantly dressed the other morning in a long, dark-green pleated skirt and matching jacket, with a double strand of pearls and small gold hoop earrings. "And I'll never forget one of my teachers asked me to come over to her house, and she went to her closet and she took enough clothes out for me to go to college."         Her family pitched in, too. "My brothers and sisters would send me what they could," she said. "They were all starting families. Sometimes it would be $5, or $10."         Her brother Wilford Stubblefield, who is 16 years older, was working at an oil refinery in Houston as a janitor, the only job open to a black man at the refinery in those days.         "We all helped her -- probably not as much as we should have," Wilford said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Houston. "She was the second one that had gone off to college. Naturally, we were proud."         Another brother, Clarence Stubblefield, who is 54 and a high school basketball coach in Houston, had gone to Prairie View College in Texas on a basketball scholarship.         Dr. Simmons said: "I'm not the brightest person in my family. I was very lucky. I came along at the right time."         Growing up in the segregated South, she said, she had no specific ambition, only a hunger to learn. "One really didn't aspire to do professional things," she said. "I think my mother must have thought that eventually perhaps I would get enough education to be self-sustaining and to do something comfortable, perhaps housework."         Instead, she earned an undergraduate degree from Dillard, and master's and doctorate degrees in Romance languages at Harvard. She became an assistant professor of French, and later an assistant dean at the University of New Orleans.         In the meantime, at age 22, she married Norbert Simmons, a lawyer and businessman. They had a son, Khari, now 22 and a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, and a daughter, Maya, 18, who plans to attend Spelman next year.         After the couple separated in the mid-1980's -- they were divorced in 1989 -- Dr. Simmons began her administrative rise at Princeton. She brought Ms. Morrison and Professor West to the Princeton faculty. She tried to persuade Professor Gates to join the faculty, too, he said.         There was one problem with Ms. Morrison's appointment: the faculty search committee wanted a resume. And Ms. Morrison, offended by the request, refused to submit one.         So Ruth Simmons wrote Toni Morrison's resume for her. "Here's my philosophy about life," said Dr. Simmons, who considers Ms. Morrison her best friend. "Don't dwell on insignificant things."         Ms. Morrison said in a telephone interview: "She's still a bit of a miracle as far as I'm concerned. She has an unusual combination of real politics and integrity, and this very keen sense of morals which does not interfere with her generosity and her wide spiritedness. She's extremely creative in terms of solving other people's problems. And she's a lot of fun."         For the 14-member presidential search committee at Smith, Dr. Simmons was the unanimous first choice. "We had a wish list of the qualities we wanted," said one member of the committee, Peter Rose, a sociology professor. "She seemed to fill them all. Race was not an issue."         Of Smith's 2,800 students, 86 are black. There are 15 black faculty members -- out of 300.         One goals, Dr. Simmons said, is to interest more black women in Smith. She hopes her presence will help. "If it's not a good place for African-American students," she said, "it's not a good place for me."         Her friend, Professor Gates, said he was already planning ahead. "I'm hoping Maggie and Liza Gates will go to Smith now," he said, referring to his teen-age daughters. "It never would have occurred to me before Ruth became president."         For now, her presence has electrified the campus. She walks everywhere. She invites students into her office to talk. She listens to them, they say.         Tigress Osborne, a black senior, said she returned to Smith last spring after taking some time off. "One of my friends said, 'You won't believe what's happened: we have a black president!' " Ms. Osborne said. "There's a moment when you think if Smith picked a black woman, how black is she? Is she going to be interested in us?"         She added, "But there's a real sense of her blackness. She also has a good handle on how to be not just the black president, on how not to cater to just black students."         Watching Dr. Simmons mingle at the senior tea last week, one senior, Kathryn Fields, who is white, said: "She's so cool. She's so young. She's new, she's exciting, she's going to make this school amazing."         At her inauguration, the new president will be carrying a Bible her mother gave her father on the day they were married.         "I know the board of trustees thinks I'm trying to live up to the standards they set for me, and that's O.K.," she said. But she is aiming toward the higher standard set for her by Fannie Stubblefield, who never had the chance to go beyond the seventh grade. "Every day that I'm here," Dr. Simmons said, "I try to be worthy of the kind of person my mother wanted me to be."       
         Annie Kriegel, a French ex-Communist who was a historian and analyst of Communism, died on Aug. 26 in a Paris hospital. She was 68 and lived in Paris.         She had cancer, said the French newspaper Le Figaro, which reported her death on Aug. 28.         Professor Kriegel had retired from academic work after teaching at the University of Paris-Nanterre from 1969 into the 1990's.         As a teen-ager, she was active in the Resistance against the Nazi occupation of her country. She became prominent in the postwar French Communist Party but resigned in 1957.         Her 1972 book, "The French Communists," was hailed in The New York Times Book review by an American historian of France, Robert O. Paxton of Columbia University, as "the most probing single work on the French Communist Party, and perhaps on any Western Communist party." She wrote more than a dozen books, beginning in 1964.         A British historian of France, Douglas Johnson, wrote in The Independent on Friday that Professor Kriegel was respected as an individual force among French intellectuals.         Professor Johnson -- whose French-born wife, Madeleine, roomed with Professor Kriegel in the 1940's -- said the explanation for her "remarkable career is to be found in her wartime experience" and gave this account:         "Coming from a Jewish-Alsatian family and having passed idyllic school days in the Marais district of Paris, she encountered the anti-Semitic legislation of the occupation and then the infamous roundup of Jews on 16 July 1942.         "As the men were forcibly separated from the women and children, she heard screams which she said contained all the pain that life and death provide. She sat on a bench and wept. 'It was on that bench that I left my childhood,' she afterwards said."         Then she escaped Paris and joined a Communist Resistance group. After the war she studied at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Sevres, held posts in teaching and related fields and wrote for Le Figaro.         Annie Becker Kriegel was born in Paris. Her marriage to Guy Besse ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband of 40 years, Dr. Arthur Kriegel; and four children, Maurice, Danielle, Irene and Emmanuel.       
         Gladys M. Dorman, a lawyer who served 20 years on the New York City Board of Higher Education, died on Thursday at her home in Bal Harbour, Fla. She was 84.         As a girl growing up in Flatbush, Miss Dorman, who continued to use her maiden name throughout her professional career, became well acquainted with the law.         Her father, Benjamin Dorman, a leading figure in the Democratic Party in Brooklyn, worked his way up through the court system to become chief clerk of the Surrogate's Court in Brooklyn, where Miss Dorman practiced as an estate planner and wills litigator for more than 30 years. She was a partner of Raphael & Dorman with her husband, Benjamin R. Raphael, a Brooklyn Law School classmate whom she married in 1939. He died in 1992.         For all the family precedent, Miss Dorman, who received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1931, intended an academic career. But after she obtained a master's degree in history from Columbia University in 1933, she switched to the law when a post she had been promised as an instructor at Brooklyn College evaporated in Depression economics.         She obtained her degree in 1936, and four years later was one of the first seven women elected to the Brooklyn Bar Association. In 1966, she became the first woman to serve as a trustee.         Miss Dorman's service on the Board of Higher Education, the governing body of the city colleges, began with an interim appointment by Mayor William O'Dwyer in 1949.         Miss Dorman was a member of the board's executive committee and chairwoman of the board's Brooklyn College administrative committee.         She is survived by two sons, both lawyers, Stephen M. Raphael of Brooklyn and Allan H. Raphael of Oak Park, Ill.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Mary M. Kaufman, a retired lawyer whose practice included cases involving Communism and Nazism, as well as defending the poor, died on Thursday at the Roosevelt division of the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 82 and lived on the West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaufman retired about 1980, after having worked in Manhattan for almost all her career. Some of her other cases involved antiwar activities. She practiced mainly without partners.         In 1951, she was in a Federal courtroom as a defense lawyer when Dashiell Hammett, the writer, and W. Alphaeus Hunton, secretary of the Council on African Affairs, were convicted of criminal contempt and sentenced to six months in prison.         She asked Judge Sylvester Ryan to release Mr. Hunton in her custody or set bail, but he refused.         Judge Ryan had found Mr. Hammett and Mr. Hunton guilty for refusing to name contributors to the bail fund of the Civil Rights Congress, which the Attorney General had designated as a Communist subversive front. Mrs. Kaufman's clients included the bail fund as well as Mr. Hunton.         In the preceding two years, the civil rights group had posted $500,000 or more bail for Communists accused of criminal conspiracy or involved in deportation cases, and it had forfeited more than $100,000 because of bail jumping.         In the 1940's, Mrs. Kaufman worked for the National War Labor and Wage Stabilization Boards, and she was a prosecutor at a war-crimes trial in Nuremberg.         She was born Mary Metlay in Atlanta, but grew up mainly in Brooklyn. After graduating from Brooklyn College, she received her law degree from St. John's University and was admitted to the bar in 1937. She became an original member of the National Lawyers Guild in that year.         Her marriage to Frederick Kaufman ended in divorce. Her second husband, Paul Albert, died last year.         Surviving are a son, Michael, of Beacon Falls, Conn.; two stepdaughters, Janice Albert of Rome and Marilyn Albert of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.       
         Mira Barer-Hopkins, a former deputy commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, died on Saturday at a Manhattan apartment she had been subletting while undergoing medical treatment. She was 44 and lived in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.         Dr. Barer-Hopkins, known professionally as Dr. Mira Barer, had pancreatic cancer and was in New York City for treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, The Miami Herald reported yesterday.         At her death, she was the director of the Broward County, Fla., Department of Natural Resource Protection, but she had not worked since January. She took the post in 1991.         Dr. Barer-Hopkins was with the New York Department of Environmental Protection from 1981 to 1991. She began as supervisor of the Office of Environmental Impact, which was responsible for assessing the impact of land-use proposals on wetlands, beach erosion, air, noise and water quality.         She went on to head the department's Hazardous Materials Bureau with the title of assistant commissioner. Later, she was deputy commissioner for environmental management.         She was a native New Yorker, born in Brooklyn, and received a Ph.D. in marine biology from City University.         She is survived by her husband, James M. Hopkins; her mother, Helen Barer of Cranbury, N.J., and her brother, Sol, of Westfield, N.J.       
         Lita Annenberg Hazen, a major philanthropist in medical research whose interests encompassed art, music and education, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was caused by complications from lung cancer, a grandson, Nicholas Polsky, said.         Mrs. Hazen had what her daughter, Cynthia Hazen Polsky, called "a great passion for family" and took a personal interest in the activities she supported. She was a friend of most of the scientists whose institutions she helped, and although she was rarely seen at the glittering social events favored by her peers, she had an active social life centered on the arts and science community.         "Medical discoveries were the most exciting and important things that she could imagine, and I don't remember her ever thinking differently or anything that competed with that," Mrs. Polsky said. "She always envisioned that someone would have a better answer."         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust played an important part in numerous medical and scientific programs on both coasts and made significant contributions to cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery and the Metropolitan Opera.         The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island was one of Mrs. Hazen's principal interests. Hazen Tower, a building at the laboratory, commemorates her participation as a founding donor of its Neuroscience Center.         "Lita Hazen was a wonderful patron of pure science, who enjoyed bright and unusual people who would say things that she wouldn't expect," said Dr. James Watson, the Nobel laureate who is director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. .         Dr. Richard A. Lerner, president of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif, said: "She, like Mary Lasker, was one of the great ladies of American science. These kinds of individuals play important roles in science, far beyond the simple ability to donate money. In fact, they become a magnet around which scientists gather."         Dr. Lerner added, "We are losing our 'great ladies of science,' " and he noted that with their death and with no such new individuals on the horizon, "there will not be much to replace them, and a whole culture that fostered science will come to an end."         The Hazen Trust made possible the purchase of land for a science park at the institute and also financed a chair in immunochemistry. A three-building complex at the institute, to be dedicated on Oct. 15, was named in honor of Mrs. Hazen.         Mrs. Hazen was the sixth of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, who founded Triangle Publications and whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, the Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television interests. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom donated considerable portions of their inherited wealth to public institutions. Her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to Great Britain, is a major benefactor of art institutions, and a sister, Enid Haupt of New York, has devoted much of her fortune to public gardens and horticultural institutions, as well as museums and libraries.         In 1963, Mrs. Hazen was a founding sponsor of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, served as a trustee of its medical center from 1976 and contributed, with her siblings, to the construction of the 33-story Annenberg Building at the center, devoted to medical care, education and research. She also provided support for a neuroendocrinology laboratory at the Mount Sinai Medical Center that was named after her and, from 1979 to 1985, a $100,000 annual award for excellence in clinical research. The award, also named for her and administered by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, was divided between the winner and a young medical scientist chosen by the winner.         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Trust, created in 1952, also established significant scholarships and professorships at Mount Sinai, including the Moses L. and Sadie C. Annenberg Professorship in Molecular Biology, the Annenberg Scholarships in Cardiology and the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professorship in Immunochemistry.         Two grants of $1 million each helped establish and finance the Neurosciences Institute and Neurosciences Research Foundation at Rockefeller University in New York. The grants enabled multidisciplinary groups of scientists from around the world to meet and discuss their work. An atrium garden at the university was named in her honor.         In 1980, she initiated a biomedical workshop program at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and a fellowship that paid for the participation of scientists, physicians and administrators. The workshops were also held at other venues, in Stockholm, Venice and at the University of California at Los Angeles and at San Francisco.         Dr. Martin Meyerson, a former president of the University of Pennsylvania who was chairman of the workshops for a decade, noted that she insured that participants ranged from Nobel laureates to junior scientists and that "she relished providing a bit of luxury to them, a good dinner, putting them up in pleasant places."         Dr. Elaine Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton University who was a longtime friend, said: "She had a remarkable mind, and had she been born in another generation, she might well have done something herself. She understood what research was about, even in its beginning and theoretical stage."         Mrs. Hazen was born in Milwaukee on Oct. 30, 1909, and attended the Calhoun School in New York. In 1936, she married Joseph H. Hazen, a lawyer, film producer, art collector and philanthropist at a double ceremony in which Mrs. Hazen's sister, Enid, was married to the investment banker Ira Haupt.         Mr. Hazen, a former vice president and director of Warner Brothers, wrote the contract between the studio and Edison Vitaphone that resulted in "The Jazz Singer," the first movie with sound. Later, he and Hal B. Wallis, the producer, became partners. Their company, Wallis-Hazen Productions, made films like "Come Back, Little Sheba," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" and "True Grit." During that period, the 1940's to 60's, Mrs. Hazen spent several months each year in Beverly Hills.         It was Mr. Hazen's admiration for Edward G. Robinson's collection of paintings that encouraged Mr. Hazen to become a collector and amass a considerable collection of 20th-century art, including work by Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh, Modigliani, Leger, Kandinsky, Braque and Picasso. The Joseph H. Hazen Foundation still contributes to a number of arts institutions.         "My mother's interest in art developed with her marriage to my father," Mrs. Polsky said. "My father was more passionate about art but my mother also loved museums and paintings. She was particularly interested in the Impressionists."         Mrs. Hazen's trust made sizable contributions to arts institutions, particularly the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In most cases, the trust provided the funds for purchases, among them two important South Indian bronzes, a 14th-century "Yashoda and Krishna" and an 11th-century "Shiva, Parvati and their son Skanda," for the museum's Irving Galleries of South and Southeast Asian Art.         Mrs. Hazen and her husband also established the Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratory in Oncology and Hematology, in memory of their other daughter, at the Marion Davies Hospital, a unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center. Mrs. Cherry died of lymphoma in 1965 at the age of 32.         Mr. Hazen died in 1994 at age 94, after 58 years of marriage. Mrs. Hazen is survived by Mrs. Polsky of Manhattan; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; a brother, Walter H. Annenberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif., and three sisters, Mrs. Haupt, Janet Hooker and Evelyn Hall of Manhattan.         Correction:  October 4, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about Lita Annenberg Hazen, a leading philanthropist in medical research, misstated her age in some editions. She was 85, not 86.       
         Judy Dearing, a costume designer for scores of musicals, dances and plays, as well as a dancer and choreographer, died on Saturday at New York Hospital.         She was 55 and lived in Manhattan. Her family said the cause of death was acute pneumonia.         Ms. Dearing began her career dancing with Miriam Makeba and acting with the Negro Ensemble Company. But she devoted much of the last 20 years to designing costumes for a wide range of theater arts. In 1985 she won an Obie for her World War II uniforms for Charles Fuller's drama "A Soldier's Play."         As a dancer, Ms. Dearing made her own costumes, a skill she said she had learned as a child. In 1976, she was hired by Oz Scott, the director of Ntozake Shange's "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf"; she was given $100 to create costumes for the show's seven performers.         Her penny-pinching solution was to buy a long bolt of inexpensive crepe-back satin from which she made seven dresses dyed seven different colors.         She went on to design costumes for "Checkmates," "The Legacy of Williams and Walker," two shows now on Broadway, "Swinging on a Star" and "Having Our Say," and a production of "Porgy and Bess" that is now on tour.         She also designed costumes for "Shimada," "Once on This Island" (for which she received a Tony nomination), "The Poison Tree," "What the Wine Sellers Buy," "Death and the King's Horsemen," "The Mighty Gents," and "Lamppost Reunion."         Her Off Broadway credits include "Moms," "Ma Rose," "Trick" and "Split Second."         For the New York Shakespeare Festival, her credits included "The Forbidden City," "Jonah," "The Dance" and "The Railroad."'         Her costumes for the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater included "Nubian Lady," "Inside" and "I See the Moon."         Woven through her highly colorful and original designs was a folkloric look. She used printed kente cloth, Dutch cotton prints, raw silk and chiffon with metallics. "A costume has to be natural," she said in an interview in 1990silk and chiffon with metallics. "A costume has to be natural," she said in an interview in 1990. "Everything has to be set up to look natural."         Ms. Dearing grew up in Manhattan and graduated from City College, where she majored in mathematics and science. She began her career in the theater as a dancer. She married John Parks, another dancer, and collaborated with him on a number of concerts. She also performed with the Sun Ock Lee Dance Company.         Ms. Dearing was also a professor of design at Howard University.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Aissatou Parks of Manhattan; her mother, Elizabeth Dearing of Tuskegee, Ala.; her father, Charles, of Manhattan; two sisters, Carole, of Tuskegee, and Bianca, of Manhattan; and two brothers, Charles, of Tuskegee, and Andre, of Manhattan.       
         Before she made her Metropolitan Opera debut last Saturday in the title role  of Bizet's "Carmen," Denyce Graves kept telling herself that the Met was simply  another opera house. After all, she had already sung the role at the Vienna State Opera, at the Bastille Opera in Paris and at Covent Garden, 21 productions in the last two years alone.         "I tried to think of this as just another engagement," she said recently, "but nobody would let me do that."         She was referring not only to managers and the news media, but also to her family, friends and former teachers from the tough southwest Washington neighborhood where she grew up, a gritty area near a sewage treatment center and an automobile impoundment lot. More than 50 of her relatives and former neighbors traveled to New York by chartered bus for her Met debut; some 50 more  came by train and car.         For years, most people at home saw Ms. Graves as "some sort of space alien,"  she said, what with her exotic notions of becoming an opera singer. But "a Met debut was something they understood," she said, and the tumultuous standing ovation she got on Saturday night "really clinched it for them." She sings the role again this afternoon and on Wednesday and next Saturday.         Ms. Graves knows that her personal story is the kind of inspirational saga Americans love: a television crew from "60 Minutes" covered her Met debut. "This was not just a move for myself, but for my people, my family," the 30-year-old mezzo-soprano said. "I realize now that what I say affects my family, so I've become more protective of their feelings, my mother's in particular. It's not just my story; it's hers."         Ms. Graves was the second of three children. Her father, an alcoholic, abusive man, left the family when her mother was pregnant with their third child. The children did not see him for again for 18 years, when he turned up, unannounced, at the high school graduation of Ms. Graves's younger sister. By then he had become a minister. They have not heard from him since.         Left alone with three children to raise, Ms. Graves's mother found work as a  clerk-typist at the University of the District of Columbia. (Today, Mrs. Dorothy Graves Kenner, her name from a second marriage, is registrar.) She was out of the house before the children were up, and gone most of the day. "When she got home, we had to have dinner ready," Ms. Graves said. "We did the cooking, dishwashing and cleaning in rotating one-week shifts."         Yet her mother provided a rich, if regimented, family life. Participation in  their fundamentalist Baptist church was mandatory. Ms. Graves sang in the choir  and helped out at Sunday school. At home, her mother dedicated each night of the week to some educational project: one night the children would present oral book reports or speak on assigned topics (like birds, flowers or geography). Thursday was music night, when the family performed gospel as an impromptu vocal group at churches and meeting halls. Popular music of any kind was banned in the house, though Ms. Graves listened to some illicit Michael Jackson on the radio when she was alone. "My mother worked so hard," Ms. Graves said. "She didn't want her babies to be lost to the streets, like so many."         At school, Ms. Graves's singing was encouraged by a strong-willed music teacher, Judith Grove. "I adored her," Ms. Graves said. "I thought she hung the  moon." Ms. Grove directed her to the Duke Ellington School for the Performing Arts, a public high school in Washington. She was accepted immediately. There, she received private voice lessons and attended her first opera: a dress rehearsal for Beethoven's "Fidelio," on a school expedition to the Kennedy Center.         After high school, Ms. Graves made great progress under Helen Hodam, a renowned voice teacher, first at Oberlin Conservatory, and then at the New England Conservatory. In Boston, she took side jobs to support herself: cleaning dormitories, working as an all-night hotel desk clerk. When she decided to enter the Metropolitan Opera Regional Auditions, she had all the makings of a finalist: a lustrous mezzo-soprano voice and a striking stage presence. But her  performance was charged with a special determination. "I had to win," she said.  "I was four months behind in my rent. I couldn't pay for the rented dress I was wearing." Ms. Graves won.         The pressure took its toll. After the competition, her voice failed her. The  problem later turned out to be a treatable thyroid condition. But her performance at the finals in New York City was "a disaster," Ms. Graves said. Demoralized, she quit singing and took a secretarial job.         Yet the word of her promise had spread. The Houston Grand Opera called to invite her to participate in its program for young artists. She declined. When they called twice more, her friends prevailed on her to accept. ("It was a sign, like something meant to be," she said.)         Since then, her success has come steadily. One of her big supporters is Placido Domingo, who sang Don Jose to her Carmen at Covent Garden. They first met in Houston when Ms. Graves sang Emilia in a production of Verdi's "Otello."  "What impressed me immediately about her, aside from her obvious vocal and physical beauty, was an aura of the dramatic about her," Mr. Domingo said recently.         "As Carmen," he continued, "she is so good that the world might want her exclusively for this role. That would be a shame, because she has very much to offer in other parts." In his capacity as future artistic director of the Washington Opera, Mr. Domingo has invited her to sing two other leading roles, which have not yet been announced.         In developing her approach to this signature role, Ms. Graves avoided listening to recordings of celebrated Carmens from the past. Moreover, she counts herself lucky to have done her first Carmen in a modern-dress production  at the Minnesota Opera.         "I didn't want to do a traditional Carmen," she said. "Carmen is an unapologetic modern woman, a woman of the 90's. She speaks constantly about her  freedom, but she is no whore. Her spirit is free. She is attracted to Don Jose precisely because he isn't interested. When she realizes she truly loves him, she becomes afraid and treats him badly. Love means losing your freedom. I think she is essentially a very sad person."         Vocally, she finds the role gratifying, but frustrating. Unlike the other characters, Carmen has no defining "stand-and-deliver aria," as Ms. Graves put it, which makes portraying her true character a challenge. "Carmen sings songs,  but these are set pieces involving other people," she said. Carmen's most famous song, the "Habanera," is a "dramatic miscalculation," according to Ms. Graves, wrongly inserted by Bizet into the score after the premiere at the insistence of the first Carmen, Celestine Galli-Marie. "It's an awkward introduction to Carmen," Ms. Graves said. "In the original version, she enters, sings her few insinuating lines, then leaves, like a black cat crossing the stage. That's much more in character."         Her recent performances include Adalgisa in "Norma" at Zurich, Giulietta in "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" at La Scala, and Dalila in a concert performance of "Samson et Dalila" with the Chicago Symphony under James Levine. She is looking  forward to performing Marguerite in Berlioz's "Damnation of Faust" in Houston and Bonn ("I adore that music"), and hopes someday to sing Blanche in one of her favorites, Poulenc's "Dialogues of the Carmelites."         The sudden attention has left Ms. Graves excited but unaffected. Greeting a visitor in her hotel suite, she curled up on the couch in an oversize sweatshirt and casually stirred gobs of honey into her tea with a dinner knife when no teaspoon was handy. As she relaxed next to her husband, David Perry, an importer of fine classical guitars, she seemed content with the way her life has turned out.         "Perhaps this should be the last interview about the past," Mr. Perry suggested. "From now on, the future will be the story." Ms. Graves nodded quietly.       
         Clelia Benjamin Delafield, a philanthropist and founding president of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, died on Tuesday in Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore. A former resident of New York City and Sarasota, Fla., she was 92 and had lived in Baltimore in recent years.         Mrs. Delafield became a member of the center's board in 1946 and remained a member of the Board of Overseers Emeriti at her death. Her family also donated its wooded estate in Riverdale, the Bronx, to Columbia University.         Mrs. Delafield is survived by two daughters, Clelia D. Carey and Cynthia Delafield, both of Baltimore; a son, Walter B., of New York City; two sisters, Mary B. Henderson of Hunter, N.Y., and Yolanda Jaeckel of Sarasota, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Her husband of 49 years, Edward C. Delafield, a banker, died in 1976.       
         Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher, the black honors graduate who needed a backhanded assist from the Supreme Court in 1948 to win admission to the University of Oklahoma law school, died on Wednesday at her home in Oklahoma City. She was 71  and had served for three years on the university's board of regents, the very body that had denied her admission on the basis of her race.         The cause of death was cancer, her daughter, Charlene Factory, said.         By the time Mrs. Fisher applied to the University of Oklahoma law school on  Jan. 14, 1946, the Supreme Court had long held that under the separate-but-equal doctrine, states that sponsored law schools for white students were required to  supply similar training for qualified black students.         Since Oklahoma had no law school for black students, it seemed obvious that the white law school would be required to admit the eminently qualified Mrs. Fisher. An honors graduate of Langston, a state-run black college, she had been  recruited by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to test the state's harsh segregation laws, which, among other things, imposed a fine on any teacher who taught a mixed-race class.         But Oklahoma argued that the state planned to open a black law school someday and kept Mrs. Fisher at bay for more than two years, until January 1948, when the Supreme Court rejected the state's arguments and ordered it to provide her with a legal education.         The court did not specifically order her admission to the university law school, and when Oklahoma tried to satisfy the court by instantly creating a black law school exclusively for Mrs. Fisher, the court turned down her follow-up appeal in February 1948. The court said her original petition had not  addressed the issue of whether the creation of a separate law school for black students would fulfill the state's obligations under the 14th Amendment.         Mrs. Fisher may not have won her immediate point before the Supreme Court, but the arguments raised by her lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, who had denounced the state action as a sham, had a powerful impact on the court as it picked its way  toward the landmark 1954 decision overturning the separate-but-equal doctrine.         And Mrs. Fisher's campaign, which had won wide backing from the state's college teachers and students, had changed the political climate in Oklahoma. With dozens of other black college graduates pressing for admission to Oklahoma  graduate schools, the state swiftly backed down.         Mrs. Fisher was admitted to the law school in June 1949, but under such harsh conditions that any of her fellow students who had not already rallied to her cause were soon won over. She was forced to sit in a raised chair apart from the other students, behind a sign reading "Colored." And she had to use a side door  to the cafeteria and sit at a table separated by a chain from the rest of the room; a uniformed guard was posted to prevent interracial mingling.         But when the guard was not there, Mrs. Fisher later recalled, white students  would climb under the chain to encourage her. "They said, 'Come on, Ada, we've been waiting for you.' "         After Mrs. Fisher graduated in 1951, she worked for a while as a lawyer. She  returned to the university to earn a master's degree in history in 1968, and she joined the faculty at Langston University.         When she was appointed to the seven-member board of regents in April 1992, Mrs. Fisher said she had come full circle.         Mrs. Fisher's survivors all live in Oklahoma City; her husband, Warren, died  several years ago. In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Fisher is survived by a son, Bruce; a sister, Helen Huggins; four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Wickes, a tart-tongued character actress whose long career on the stage  and in films extended from "The Man Who Came to Dinner" to the two "Sister Act"  movies, died on Sunday at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. She was 85.         For 50 years, Ms. Wickes was one of Hollywood's busiest supporting players. She specialized in sourness, or, more politely, acerbity, which she used to her  comic advantage in roles as housekeepers, spinsters, wicked stepmothers, nuns and back-talking secretaries. Her face was always familiar but her name often escaped moviegoing audiences. "They may not ask for my autograph," she said, "as long as they sign my paycheck."         Her signature role was in the original Broadway production, in 1939, of the  Moss Hart-George S. Kaufman comedy "The Man Who Came to Dinner." She was Miss Preen, the nurse who became the principal object of Monty Woolley's disdain: "Miss Bedpan," he called her. Ms. Wickes repeated the role opposite Woolley (as  Sheridan Whiteside) in the film version. Years later she was Miss Preen again in a television production, with Orson Welles as Whiteside.         In a career that spanned more than 50 movies, more than two dozen Broadway plays and musicals and 60 television shows, she mocked her own plain looks and her abrasive manner of speaking. Given the opportunity, she was able to demonstrate her acting range, appearing as Penelope Sycamore in "You Can't Take  It With You" at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco and as Mistress Quickly in Peter Coe's production of "Henry IV, Part 1" at the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn. In 1979, she was in a Broadway revival of "Oklahoma!" Last year she played Aunt March in Gillian Armstrong's movie of "Little Women."         Ms. Wickes, whose original name was Mary Isabelle Wickenhauser, was born and  reared in St Louis. After graduating from Washington University there, she began her theatrical career in 1935 at the Berkshire Playhouse in Stockbridge, Mass. She then moved to Broadway with Philip Barry's "Spring Dance," and in Kaufman and Edna Ferber's "Stage Door," the first of several Kaufman plays in which she  acted.  Kaufman later called her his favorite comedienne.         In movies, she frequently acted with Bette Davis ("The Man Who Came to Dinner," "June Bride" and "Now, Voyager"), Doris Day and Rosalind Russell. She was also in "Anna Lucasta," "White Christmas," "The Actress," "The Music Man" and "Postcards From the Edge," in which she played Meryl Streep's grandmother. In "Sister Act" and "Sister Act II," she was Sister Mary Lazarus.         She made her television debut as Mary Poppins and then acted in "Mrs. G. Goes to College" (a series with Gertrude Berg), "The Catbird Seat" by James Thurber,  and a Western version of "Cinderella" called "Cindy's Fella," starring James Stewart; naturally, Ms. Wickes was the stepmother. She also appeared in "I Love  Lucy" and other Lucille Ball series and in episodes of "Dennis the Menace," "The Father Dowling Mysteries," "Murder She Wrote" and many other television shows.         Her final performance was as the voice of a gargoyle in the forthcoming Walt  Disney animated feature "The Hunchback of Notre Dame."       
         Georgia Neese Clark Gray, whose signature -- as Georgia Neese Clark -- appeared on some $30 billion in paper money while she was the first woman to serve as Treasurer of the United States, died on Thursday at the Brewster Place retirement community in Topeka, Kan. She was 95.         President Harry S. Truman chose Mrs. Gray to be Treasurer in 1949, a year the Democratic Party promised a New Deal for women aspiring to high office. She had been a small-town Kansas banker and a Democratic National Committeewoman since 1936. Her confirmation by the Senate was unanimous.         As the nation's 29th Treasurer, she was in charge of all the bills and coins along with Government securities held in the vaults in Washington. The office is a division of the Treasury Department. When Dwight D. Eisenhower became President in 1953 he selected another woman to succeed her, Ivy Baker Priest, a Utah Republican.         Mrs. Gray was a highly visible figure in Democratic Party affairs, including its national conventions. She was an associate of Eleanor Roosevelt, with whom she often shared the speakers' platform.         After serving as a National Committeewoman for 28 years, Mrs. Gray resigned in 1964 to devote herself full time to banking and other business and farming interests.         Georgia Neese was born in Richland, a rural community of about 200 people 15 miles southeast of Topeka, where her father, Albert, had founded the Richland State Bank in 1892.         She received a bachelor's degree in economics from what is now Washburn University of Topeka in 1921. She then studied acting in New York and toured the country with stock companies for 10 years.         Her stage career ended when her father's health faltered and the arrival of talking pictures diminished the appeal of traveling stage troupes. By then she had married George M. Clark, her manager. They were divorced in the mid-1940's.         At her father's death in 1937 she became president of the bank; in 1964 she moved it to Topeka and renamed it the Capital City State Bank.         Her friend and mentor, Harry Truman, helped to dedicate the new bank. "Mrs. Gray is the only United States Treasurer since the Civil War who really worked at her job," he told the crowd. "She knows money affairs as well as any man, and anyone who brings their money here will know it is in charge of someone who knows how to take care of it."         Mrs. Gray was remarried in 1953 to Andrew J. Gray, a former New York and Washington newspaperman and press agent. He died last year. She is survived by a nephew, Ward Keller of Manhattan.       
         Lillian Nassau, the doyenne of New York antiques dealers and one of the first in America to see a market in Art Nouveau and Art Deco, died early yesterday at her home in New York. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Nassau held forth in a forest of Tiffany lamps in her two shops, first on Third Avenue and 56th Street and, from 1968 until her retirement in 1982, on East 57th Street. For more than 35 years, her galleries were gathering places for collectors and museum curators from around the world.         They came seeking the 20th-century decorative arts she stocked and the expertise she provided, both on the market and on the history of these objects. She was the first to handle the works of Louis Comfort Tiffany, and became his greatest champion in the revival that began in the mid-1950's and continues today. She paid $176 for her first leaded bronze-and-glass lamp by Tiffany in 1956; before her death Tiffany lamps were selling for more than $1 million.         She was also among the first to stock the works of the giants of early 20th-century European design: Rene Lalique's jewelry and glassware, Georg Jensen's silver, Emile Galle's vases and lamps and the furniture of Josef Hoffmann, Louis Majorelle and Carlo Bugatti.         In the 1970's Mrs. Nassau's clients included Catherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Barbra Streisand, Andy Warhol, Warner Leroy, all the Beatles and members of Led Zeppelin and Blood Sweat and Tears. Edgar J. Kaufmann Jr., the architectural historian, started collecting Tiffany flower-form vases there in the 1950's. And David Geffen bought most of his Tiffany lamps there in the 1970's, selling them in 1984 at Christie's in New York for two to five times what he had paid. Sydney and Frances Lewis of Richmond, who were Mrs. Nassau's customers from the 1960's until she retired, donated most of their Tiffany, Art Nouveau and Art Deco objects to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond..         And after Mrs. Nassau retired, no dealer took her place as the dominant merchant in the field. She remained a recognized authority, often consulted by curators and collectors.         Retirement was difficult for her at first, said her son, Paul, who took over the shop. "She wanted to keep running the business from home," he said. "But she was always available to talk, and until a few years ago, when she became ill, always gave me good advice."         Lillian Brinberg was born in Warsaw. She arrived with her family in New York when she was 2 years old. She attended public schools and went to Columbia University for a few years, hoping to become a newspaper reporter. Instead, she was married in 1920 to Harry Nassau; they were divorced in the late 1930's.         Mrs. Nassau became a dealer in 20th-century decorative arts in 1945, opening the shop on Third Avenue at 56th Street, her first. By then, she had spent a decade in the antiques business, buying and selling gold and jewelry door to door on Long Island, during the Depression. She also worked in a furniture store in Manhattan where she learned about antiques.         She often recalled that as she came into the business, dealers were taking unpopular Tiffany lamps and knocking out the glass flowers and trees, to sell the metal for junk. By the mid-1950's, the revival in Tiffany glass had begun, and Mrs. Nassau was in the vanguard of dealers handling this material.         Among her donations to institutions was a Tiffany mosaic mural that adds a glow to the courtyard of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She also gave the Metropolitan her favorite piece of jewelry, a glorious enameled necklace, made about 1900 by Lalique.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her husband Dr. Leo S. Palitz and a sister, Pauline Sorkin, all of New York; two grandchildren, and five great-grandsons.       
         Susan F. Glass, a highly particular public relations woman who made a career  being paid for advancing causes she believed in, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60, and until she went on medical leave at the end of 1994, she was a senior vice president of the Urban Development Corporation.         The cause was lung cancer, her friend Sandy Silverman said.         Whether she was writing speeches for Dore Schary at the Anti-Defamation League, editing Albert Shanker's newspaper columns for the United Federation of Teachers or, more recently, advancing her friend Mario M. Cuomo's economic development programs at the U.D.C., Ms. Glass pursued her work with a passion that seemed to go far beyond her professional obligations.         That, her friends say, was because Ms. Glass, a fierce supporter of Democratic politicians from Robert F. Kennedy to Mr. Cuomo, was such an intense  idealist that she made a point of working only for those institutions she deemed worthy of her passions.         Ms. Glass was born in Richmond Hill, Queens, graduated from Queens College and received a master's degree in English from New York University. She began her career at the old Long Island Press, working as women's news editor before shifting to public relations.         She is survived by a brother, Michael, of Miami.       
         Eleanor Aller Slatkin, a cellist admired in her own right and as part of a celebrated musical family, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         Ms. Aller was born in 1917 in New York. Her father, Gregory Aller, who was a cellist like his father, had immigrated from Russia. Ms. Aller performed in Carnegie Hall at the age of 12 and studied at the Juilliard School.         She played from 1939 to 1968 in the Warner Brothers studio orchestra. She met her husband, Felix Slatkin, a conductor and violinist and the concertmaster of the 20th Century-Fox studio orchestra, at a young artists' competition in the Hollywood Bowl; Mr. Slatkin won.         Their home, in Los Angeles, was a constant haunt of musicians and film stars ranging from Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky to Danny Kaye and Frank Sinatra. And their children went on to musical careers as well: Leonard Slatkin, now in his final season as music director of the St. Louis Symphony and soon to become music director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, and Frederick Zlotkin, a cellist in New York.         Together, Felix Slatkin and Ms. Aller anchored the renowned Hollywood String Quartet throughout its existence, from 1947 to 1961. The group was valued as much for its promotion of 20th-century music as for its compelling performances of classic repertory, and its recordings from the early LP era are still regarded highly.         "My first strong musical memory is of the Villa-Lobos Sixth Quartet, which my parents were rehearsing," Leonard Slatkin once said.         Ms. Aller remained active professionally after the death of her husband, in 1963. She was chairwoman of the string department at DePaul University in Chicago from 1968 to 1970.         She is survived by her sons and by two grandsons, Daniel Slatkin of Washington and Felix Zlotkin of New York.       
         Ruth Wilmanns Lidz, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, died on Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 85 and lived in Woodbridge, Conn.         A clinical professor since 1965, she had continued to work in the department, pursuing her interest in the psychotherapy of schizophrenia. She also remained an active member of the Western New England Psychoanalytic Society and the American Psychoanalytic Society.         She was born in Heidelberg, Germany, the daughter of Karl Wilmanns, a professor and director of Heidelberg University's psychiatry department. She left Germany shortly after the Hitler regime came to power and completed her medical education in Switzerland.         During World War II, she was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University before entering psychoanalytical practice in Baltimore and New Haven. At Yale, she became known for her work with schizophrenic and other seriously disturbed patients and for dealing with the emotional factors in adolescent pregnancies.         Dr. Lidz is survived by her husband of 56 years, Theodore Lidz, a Yale professor emeritus of psychiatry, and three sons, Victor, of Villanova, Pa., Charles, of Pittsburgh, and Jerome, of Eugene, Ore.       
         Frances Grant Bennett, wife of the late Senator Wallace F. Bennett and mother of Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, died on Friday in Salt Lake City. She was 96.         Mrs. Bennett was on the primary general board of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While in Washington, she was president of the Congressional Club, a group of Congressional wives.         Frances Bennett was born on Sept. 23, 1899, to Heber J. Grant, president of  the Mormon Church and Emily Wells Grant in Salt Lake City.         She graduated from the University of Utah, and also attended Radcliffe College in Boston. In 1922, she married Wallace Bennett, who served four terms in the United States Senate and retired in 1974. He died in 1993.         Mrs. Bennett is survived by five children, 29 grandchildren and 74 great-grandchildren.       
         Marguerite Young, the Indiana-born writer who became a darling of the avant-garde and inspired a devoted cult following even as she infuriated and confounded mainstream critics with a single gargantuan novel, died on Friday at  the home of a niece in Indianapolis. She was 87.         Miss Young, a longtime New School writing teacher who began her literary career as an award-winning poet and ended it as a critic, essayist and biographer, was a respected literary figure and cherished Greenwich Village eccentric well before Scribners published her one and only novel, "Miss MacIntosh, My Darling," in 1965.         Afterward she became a legend: the woman with the pageboy haircut who looked like W. H. Auden, wrote like James Joyce, strode through the Village in her signature serapes, had breakfast at Bigelow's with Richard Wright, got drunk at  the White Horse Tavern with Dylan Thomas, palled around with Truman Capote and Carson McCullers, kept a vast collection of dolls in her Bleecker Street apartment and regaled intimates with tales of her romantic conquests.         But for all her range, Miss Young drew a line. By her own account, she welcomed the advances of the poet Allen Tate but rebuffed those of Miss McCullers, telling her at Yaddo in 1946, "Well, Carson, if I could love any woman, it would be you."         Anyone who has not heard of Miss Young, nor read her magnum opus, "Miss MacIntosh, My Darling," need not feel ashamed. Surely one of the most widely unread books ever acclaimed, it has actually been read by comparatively few; by fewer still all the way through.         Indeed, even Miss Young's most ardent admirers (and her admirers, from Anais  Nin and Djuna Barnes to John Gardner, Anne Tyler and a prolific band of feminists, tend to be ardent) concede that the book, variously described as "a mammoth epic," "a massive fable" and "a work of stunning magnitude and beauty" (not to mention "hallucinatory," "ethereal" and "utterly stupefying"), is rather much to take in a single season. Too rich for a repast, it is better savored, they say, like a bedside dish of candy, one bite-sized bonbon at a time.         It is "Miss MacIntosh," sure enough, that the hero of Miss Tyler's "Accidental Tourist" carries with him to dip into for consolation from time to time.         It is a reflection of the book's decidedly mixed reception that while the daily review in The New York Times dismissed it with a sneer, Miss Young's friend, William Goyen, turned a Times Sunday review into a page-long paean.         Narrated by the aptly named Vera Cartwheel, who indulges in nonstop verbal and mental gymnastics during a 948-page bus ride from coastal New England to the heartland of America -- and the interior of the author's mind -- it describes the narrator's largely imaginary quest for the illusory truth about her childhood nursemaid, Miss MacIntosh, who is bald, single-breasted and may or may not have drowned when Miss Cartwheel was 14 years old.         Those who have merely read about "Miss MacIntosh" know it chiefly as a matter of length, from the 18 years it took to write to its very heft. At 1,198 pages and some three-quarters of a million words, it has been described as the longest novel in English ever published in a single volume; later editions, including a  facsimile reissue by Dalkey last year, have split it in two.         Miss Young, who was born in Indianapolis in 1908, was precocious. She wrote her first poems when she was 6, joined the Authors League at 11, published her first poem at Indiana University when she was 19, won first prize in a literary  contest at Butler University when she was 20 and published her first book of poems, "Prismatic Ground," at 28, in 1937, a year after receiving a master's in  Elizabethan and Jacobean literature from the University of Chicago.         Her most significant formative experiences at Chicago seem to have occurred outside the classroom, among them the friendships she struck up with Thornton Wilder, Gertrude Stein and other literary figures, but most notably her part-time job reading to a wealthy addict, Minna Weissenbach, a patron of Edna St. Vincent Millay. Miss Weissenbach and her astonishing flights of drug-induced fantasy inspired the famous "opium lady" in "Miss MacIntosh."         Although she shunned drugs, Miss Young was capable of some pretty astonishing mental flights of her own, both on and off the printed page. In her (more or less) real life, as she told Charles Ruas in an interview included in his "Conversations With American Writers" (Knopf, 1985), she would regularly startle her New School students by announcing that, say, Henry James, had suddenly arrived in the classroom.         And the Greenwich Village she inhabited was a far more interesting place than the one perceived by most:         "I see Emily Dickinson quite often," she told Mr. Ruas, "Virginia Woolf, and  Dickens. Poe, oh, all the time. I see him on misty nights at Sheridan Square when the rain's falling. He's going into a little cigar store to get a cigar. I  am on very close terms with Poe."         Miss Young, who taught at an Indianapolis high school and at the University of Iowa after Chicago, moved to New York in 1943 and burst on the literary scene two years later with the simultaneous publication of "Moderate Fable," which won the best poetry award from the National Academy of Arts and Letters, and "Angel in the Forest," a highly acclaimed account of successive utopian communities at New Harmony, Ind.         After the publication of "Miss MacIntosh," in 1965, she began writing "Harp Song for a Radical," a biography of Eugene V. Debs. Thirty years later the book  is yet to be published, but Victoria Wilson, an editor at Knopf, said yesterday  the "astonishing" work needs just a little more pruning.         It seems the manuscript Miss Young turned in was 2,500 pages long.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Anne E. Sullivan, a vice president at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, the New York publishing house, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 53 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         She died from internal injuries after being struck by a private bus on Friday afternoon at 23d Street and 10th Avenue, according to the publishing house.         At her death, Ms. Sullivan was the director of contracts and copyrights at the publishing house, overseeing its legal operations. She had spent 14 years with the company.         She was born in Bronxville, N.Y., and graduated from Newton College of the Sacred Heart, which has since merged with Boston College, and Fordham University Law School.         Ms. Sullivan is survived by her husband, Alan H. Bomser; her stepmother, Patricia Sullivan of Bronxville; a brother, Eugene Sullivan of Larchmont, N.Y.,  and two sisters, Jane Burke of Bronxville and Mary Tracy of Boston.       
         Martha Hill, a pioneer in American dance education who founded the American Dance Festival in addition to dance departments at Bennington College and the Juilliard School, died on Sunday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 94.         A tall, big-boned woman with an irreverent sense of humor and a no-nonsense approach to training modern dancers, Ms. Hill was of incalculable importance in  the development of modern dance in America. She came of age in the field when the art was taught, if at all, as an adjunct to college physical education courses. By the 1980's, when she retired from teaching, universities throughout  the nation offered undergraduate and graduate degrees in dance.         In her zeal to encourage and promote modern dance, Ms. Hill combined performances by leading creative figures with the dance divisions she established at college summer schools. She founded the Bennington School of the  Dance and its summer festival at Bennington College in Vermont in 1934and the Connecticut College School of the Dance in New London in 1948. The American Dance Festival (which moved to Duke University in Durham, N.C., in 1978) was founded by her at Connecticut College as an outgrowth of the Bennington program.         The festivals provided exposure and creative opportunities to most of the major modern-dance choreographers at crucial times in their young careers. Festivals at Bennington were a proving ground for Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Hanya Holm. Performances and classes at the festival offered much-needed early support to choreographers including Jose Limon, Alwin Nikolais, Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor and Alvin Ailey.         "A queer lot, these dancers," Ms. Hill, who doubled as a square dance caller  at parties at Bennington, wrote of the hectic summers in a 1950 article in The New York Times. "And yet, not queer. The first attribute of life is action. To dance is to be intensely alive."         At such festivals, she continued, students are exposed to the three fundamentals of dance education: technical training, watching great performers and participating in good talk. Her hope, she wrote, was that the young dancers  could come out of the experience "with an informed attitude toward dance where they no longer secretly use the 19th-century classification of dance that is 'graceful, ungraceful or disgraceful,' nor yet again fall victim to the old fundamentalist quarrel between the traditional ballet and the experimental modern dance, which is now only a tale with which the elders sometimes divert the young."         Ms. Hill, who was born in East Palestine, Ohio, came to dance through studies in music and the Dalcroze technique of rhythmic analysis. She received a bachelor's degree from Teachers College of Columbia University and a master's degree from New York University.         She performed with Graham from 1929 to 1931, but committed herself to dance education early on, joining the fledgling dance faculty at New York University in 1930. She became its director and established a graduate program there, leaving in 1951 to found the dance department at Juilliard, which she directed until 1985. She was associated with the Bennington summer school and festival from 1934 to 1942. In 1948, Ms. Hill re-created the school and festival in New London where they remained until 1978.         Ms. Hill never subscribed to the kind of specialization she helped to foster  in dance. She was determined to train performers at Juilliard, where she drew in leading ballet and modern-dance choreographers as teachers. But many of the students at the avant-garde Bennington sessions were gym teachers rather than professional dancers. "I have always said that dance is an art," Ms. Hill told Anna Kisselgoff, chief dance critic of The New York Times, in a interview in 1982. "Dance in education and dance in the theater are not different things. The degree of proficiency may vary but the aim is to do dance as dancing, and to teach it as dance."         Ms. Hill also taught and choreographed at the University of Chicago and Kansas State Teachers College in the 1920's and 30's, at the University of Oregon and in colleges throughout the nation. In Australia, she was a co-director of the choreographic conferences of the University of New South Wales in Sydney and the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne.         Ms. Hill was a consultant for the United States Office of Education and wrote the dance section in a teachers' manual in 1943. She was also the chairman of the advisory committee for modern-dance series at City Center in 1949. She received honorary degrees from Adelphi University, Bennington College, Mount Holyoke College and Towson State University. Other awards include the City of New York Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture, in 1984.         Ms. Hill was married to Thurston Davies, who died in 1961. She is survived by a brother, Lewis, of Lake Alfred, Fla., and a step-daughter, Judith Dilts, of San Jose, Calif.       
         Mary Beame, the wife of former Mayor Abraham D. Beame, died on Tuesday at the New York Medical Center. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Beame was married to the former New York Mayor, who served from 1974 to  1978, for almost 68 years. The two met as teen-agers at the University Settlement House, which provided social services for poor Lower East Side residents.         They married in 1928, and Mr. and Mrs. Beame lived in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, for more than four decades, until he became Mayor.         Active in charities, she formed the Jennie Levine Cancer League in memory of  a friend who had died of cancer. She was named Woman of the Year in 1973 by the  National Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Edmond, of Hamilton, Ontario, and Bernard, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Greenberg, a one-time New Jersey housewife who parlayed an unlikely  hit record by a teen-age group known as the Shirelles into an improbable career  as the proprietor of a leading independent label of the 1960's, died on Thursday at the Hackensack University Medical Center. She was 82, and lived in Teaneck, N.J.         As a pioneering woman in the male-dominated world of rhythm-and-blues, Mrs. Greenberg was, by her own later account, a triple anomaly: "a white woman who was in a black business and who couldn't carry a tune."         Maybe so, but she had a finely tuned ear for popular music, a keen eye for talent and a driving ambition, all of which became increasingly apparent in the  1960's.         In addition to a series of hits by the Shirelles, among them "Dedicated to the One I Love," "Tonight's the Night," and Mrs. Greenberg's own composition, "Soldier Boy," her Scepter label produced such 1960's standards as "Louie, Louie," by the Kingsmen; "Twist and Shout," by the Isley Brothers, and "Walk on  By," by Dionne Warwick, not to mention "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head," the  Burt Bacharach-Hal David song, sung by B. J. Thomas on the soundtrack of "Butch  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," which won an Academy Award in 1969.         Mrs. Greenberg traced her success to a day in 1957 when her 16-year-old daughter, Mary Jane, came home raving about the performance of four classmates at a Passaic High School assembly.         Their names were Shirley Alston, Addie Harris, Doris Kenner and Beverly Lee,  but they called themselves the Shirelles, and as soon as Mrs. Greenberg persuaded them to sing for her, she knew that their song, "I Met Him on a Sunday," had the makings of a hit.         A former Republican campaign worker who had translated her political skills into a job peddling songs for a local songwriters, Mrs. Greenberg, who had been  married to an accountant, had already become a familiar figure on Tin Pan Alley, hobnobbing with music-industry hopefuls at the old Turf restaurant on Broadway at 51st Street. She had also joined with two partners to form a label, Tiara Records.         The Tiara release of "I Met Him on a Sunday" was such an immediate success. Within months, Mrs.  Greenberg climbed so many radio-station stairs, sold so many records from the trunk of her car and created such demand that her company  could not handle the orders. So she sold the Shirelles' contract to Decca, an industry giant.         That might have been the end of her career, but, Decca, convinced that the Shirelles would be a one-hit phenomenon, returned the group to Mrs. Greenberg, who formed Scepter to replace Tiara.         Over the next decade, Scepter became an industry sensation as Mrs. Greenberg, whose company eventually occupied an entire floor of 1650 Broadway, repeatedly demonstrated her sure sense of talent.         This was never more evident than the day in 1962 when Mr. Bacharach played a  demonstration record of one of his songs for Mrs. Greenberg, and she told him that while she did not like the song she loved the singer.         The next day, Mr. Bacharach returned, saying he had a signed contract with the singer, a young woman named Dionne Warwick.         Partly because of the long line of hit Warwick releases that followed, Gulf & Western offered $6 million for Scepter in 1965, but Mrs. Greenberg declined to sell.         It was, she later said, a major mistake. Within a decade, as major labels came to dominate the distribution network, Scepter's success had faded, and by the time the company folded in 1977 Mrs. Greenberg had lost everything.         In recent years, Mrs. Greenberg had been cheered by Bette Midler's plans to make a movie of her life, but because Ms. Midler has been unable to secure the required rights from two of the three surviving Shirelles (Ms. Harris died in 1982), the project is dormant.         She is survived by her daughter, Mary Jane Goff of Upper Saddle River, N.J.;  a son, Stanley, of Los Angeles; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Sister Evelyn M. Schneider, a former chief executive of St. Vincent's Hospital and superior general of the Sisters of Charity, the order that founded  it 146 years ago, died on Sunday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 84.         Sister Evelyn's association with St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center spanned five decades. She joined the hospital as director of nutrition in 1945,  retired as president and chief executive officer in 1980 and continued as a volunteer until this year.         The medical center, which has served the people of Greenwich Village and Chelsea since 1849, is operated jointly by the New York congregation of the Sisters of Charity and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.         During Sister Evelyn's nine-year tenure as chief executive, St. Vincent's acquired the National Maritime Union headquarters at Seventh Avenue and 12th Street and made it over as the O'Toole Medical Services Building. The Coleman Pavilion and the Link Pavilion went up in place of outdated buildings, four other buildings underwent major renovations and an apartment building was bought to house residents and nurses.         In 1966, Sister Evelyn was elected to a five-year term as superior of the Sisters of Charity of New York, putting her in charge of 1,200 nuns in 87 schools, colleges, hospitals and child-care centers throughout the archdiocese.         She also played a role in helping her congregation adapt to the many changes  wrought by Vatican II, including an overhaul of its governance. She returned to  St. Vincent's in 1971 to become its president.         Sister Evelyn was also the first woman to be elected president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a position she filled for a year.         Born on Staten Island, Evelyn Schneider entered the Sisters of Charity upon graduating from high school in New Brighton and earned degrees in English from the College of Mount St. Vincent in Riverdale and in nutrition from Seton Hill College in Greensburg, Pa. She received a master's in institutional management from Columbia University.         Sister Evelyn is survived by two sisters, Sister Cecilia Schneider of Manhattan and Marie Schneider of Staten Island.       
         Kathleen Overmyer Elliott, a former vice president of Radcliffe College, died on Monday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. She was 85 and lived in Cambridge.         Mrs. Elliott had a 33-year career at the college, starting in 1943, and held  a variety of posts, including director of admissions and dean of students. She retired in 1976 as vice president, associate dean and senior tutor at South House, now Cabot House.         Beginning in 1953, she also lectured at Harvard University in the department of classics. She was a trustee of Beaver Country Day School in Chestnut Hill, Mass., and the Massachusetts General Hospital School of Nursing.         She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Ohio State University. After doing graduate work at the University of Chicago, she earned a Ph.D. in the classics at Radcliffe.         Widowed for 25 years, she left no immediate survivors.       
         Helen Duprey Bullock, a historian who specialized in preserving the nation's  architectural, romantic and culinary heritages, died on Nov. 1 at her home at the Thomas House retirement community in Washington. She was 90.         In a long and varied career, Mrs. Bullock maintained a singular focus. Whether working as an archivist in Colonial Williamsburg in the 1920's and 30's, cataloguing Thomas Jefferson's papers at the University of Virginia and the Library of Congress in the 1940's or serving as a historical architectural specialist and information officer at the National Trust for Historic Preservation in the 1950's, 60's and 70's, she kept her sights on early American history.         She also brought a certain homeyness to history. If others, for example, saw the elements of colonial history as a process that might begin with a Parliamentary affront and end in a fiery speech in the House of Burgesses, Mrs.  Bullock tended to see the process as something that might begin with sugar and eggs and end in a chess pie.         "History isn't just great political events," she said in 1955. "You can feel  it in fabrics, taste it in cooking and see it in architecture."         A historian with a distinctly open mind, Mrs. Bullock, a native of Oakland, Calif., and a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, was forever  making sharp detours into new and fertile realms.         There was the time in the 1920's, for example, when she was poring over 17th- and 18th-century letters searching for the odd mention of the color of a living  room wall or the hue of a kitchen ceiling in Colonial Williamsburg. But she became so distracted by references to colonial dishes and ingredients that she all but invented an entire new area of historical research with the publication  of her "Williamsburg Art of Cookery" in 1938.         Mrs. Bullock made another detour in the 1940's. While working on Jefferson's  papers, a chance discovery of a piece of music sent to him by Maria Cosway, a friend from his Paris days, led to her 1945 account of their well-documented flirtation, "My Head and My Heart."         She was best known, however, for her scholarly work on colonial recipes and food preparation. Widely regarded as the nation's leading authority on open-hearth cooking, she wrote widely in the field and served as a consultant to historical culinary projects like "The First Ladies Cookbook" and "The American  Heritage Cookbook."         Her Williamsburg cookbook became the bible for the preparation of food in Williamsburg exhibitions, at least until the 1980's, when it was discovered that Mrs. Bullock, an eminently practical woman, had taken certain liberties with the original recipes. Having discovered that 17th-century cooks, lacking ingredients like baking powder and vanilla, had often prepared dishes no discriminating 20th-century diner would eat, she sensibly adapted them to modern tastes and ingredients.         One that required no such adjustments was featured in "The American Heritage  Cookbook":         Starting with three eggs and three-quarters of a cup of sugar, plus a pinch of salt, two tablespoons of melted butter and the grated rind and juice of a lemon, beat the eggs, add the sugar and salt and keep beating until smooth. Then stir in the butter and the lemon rind and juice and pour into a nine-inch pie pan lined with pastry dough. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in a preheated 350-degree oven, or until the top is pale gold.         The resulting chess pie "is not a handsome pie," Mrs. Bullock once noted. Maybe not, but few would deny that history has rarely tasted better.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Louise Wolff Kahn, a patron of the arts and education in Dallas and elsewhere, died on Monday in the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. She was 85. She had lived in Dallas since 1937, but also kept a home in Manhattan, where she was born.         She graduated from Smith College, then pursued a career in advertising, retailing and interior design in New York before moving to Dallas. There, she worked at Neiman Marcus as the personal secretary to its president, Stanley Marcus, a boyhood friend of her husband-to-be, Edmund J. Kahn, who made a fortune in real estate, cotton and oil.         By the time of Mr. Kahn's death in 1984, the couple had given away $5 million, including $1 million each to their respective colleges, Smith and the University of Pennsylvania, and $1 million for the Dallas Public Library to buy  books. Since her husband's death, Mrs. Kahn had donated more than $15 million to the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, the Dallas Museum of Art, Southern Methodist University and other beneficiaries. Often she gave anonymously.         Having no children or other immediate survivors, Mrs. Kahn left the bulk of her estate, valued at more than $25 million, to the causes close to her heart. They included the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, said her accountant in Dallas, Sallie A. Scanlan.       
         Rebecca C. McGreevy, a senior vice president of public relations at the Estee Lauder Companies, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 62.         The cause of death was heart failure, a company spokeswoman said.         Mrs. McGreevy joined Estee Lauder, the cosmetics and perfume company, as a publicity director in 1966. She was promoted to vice president of public relations in 1971 and to senior vice president in 1981.         After graduating from Emory University in 1955, Mrs. McGreevy worked at the Georgia Motor Club, an automobile owners' group. She started in the publicity department at Elizabeth Arden in 1957, where she remained until she joined Estee Lauder. She received an M.B.A. from New York University in 1984.         Mrs. McGreevy is survived by her husband, Charles, of Manhattan, and her sister, Carol Donahoe of Denver.       
         Alice Miller Bregman, who edited and wrote about children's books, died last  Wednesday at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 54 and had lived in Manhattan for most of her life.         The cause was cancer, according to family members.         Until August of this year, Ms. Bregman was editorial director of Artists and Writers Guild Books, a line of picture books for children that she founded at the Western Publishing Company of Racine, Wis., in 1992.         She was a frequent reviewer and contributor to a number of publications about children's literature.         Previously, Ms. Bregman was president of Bask Press, a book packager and literary agency she founded in 1983, and a former senior editor at Warner Juvenile Books and at Bantam Doubleday Dell. She worked with the writers Judy Blume, Mercer Mayer, S. E. Hinton, Paula Danziger and Norma Fox Mazer, among others.         A native of New York, she graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., with a bachelor's degree in English in 1963 and from Columbia University with a  master's in early childhood education in 1964.         Her marriage to Eric Bregman ended in divorce in 1974.         She is survived by her mother, Ruth Miller of Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Porter Wesley, a librarian who played the primary role in building Howard University's collection of books and other materials for the study of black history and culture, died on Sunday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., at the home  of her daughter, where she had moved recently from Washington. She was 91.         Mrs. Wesley retired in 1973 as the curator of the Moorland-Spingarn Research  Center, a center for research involving documents about black history and kindred fields. The center is on the Howard campus in Washington.         She began acquiring books and other materials in 1930 and from then until 1973, the center's holdings grew to 180,000 items from 3,000. They include letters, manuscripts, pamphlets, books, oral-history materials and microfilms.         The centeris one of the world's largest repositories of materials for studying black history and culture, its current director, Dr. Thomas C. Battle,  said yesterday.         Over the years, Mrs. Wesley was also known by the surname Porter and the double surname Porter Wesley. Her 1971 book, "Early Negro Writings 1760-1837" was republished this fall, by Black Classic Press, with her name given as Dorothy Porter.         She began working at Howard in 1928 as a library cataloger and was named, in  1930, librarian of what was to become the Moorland-Spingarn center's collection. At the time, it was called the Moorland Foundation because it consisted chiefly  of a books donated by Dr. Jesse Moorland, a Howard trustee; in 1946 the book collection of Arthur B. Spingarn was added to it.         Mrs. Wesley's other writings include the books "North American Negro Poets: A Bibliographical Checklist" (1945), "Negro Protest Pamphlets" (1969) and "The Negro in the United States: A Selected Bibliography" (1970).         Mrs. Wesley, whose maiden name was Burnett, was born in Warrenton, Va., and reared in Montclair, N.J. She went received a bachelor's degree in 1928 from Howard and a master's degree in library science in 1932 from Columbia University.         Her first husband, James Amos Porter, who had headed Howard's fine arts department, died in 1970. She married Charles Harris Wesley, an authority on black history and former professor and dean at Howard, in 1979. He died in 1987.         Her survivors include her daughter, Constance Burnett Porter Uzelac of Fort Lauderdale.       
         Dr. Renata A. Calabresi, a clinical psychologist who was active in the anti-Fascist underground in Italy in the 1930's, died last Friday at her home in New Haven, Conn. She was 96.         Dr. Calabresi, who was born in Ferrara, received her Ph.D. from the University of Florence in 1923 and went to teach at the University of Rome. With her brother, Dr. Massimo E. Calabresi, she helped publish and distribute the leading underground newspaper of the Italian Resistance, Non Mollare (Don't Give Up) and was jailed for a time by the Mussolini Government.         She fled Italy and arrived in the United States in 1940, initially teaching  at the New School for Social Research and Hunter College. In 1947 she joined the Veterans Administration in Newark and worked as a clinical psychologist and coordinator for the training of future psychologists until her retirement in 1969.         Dr. Calabresi is survived by two nephews, Dr. Paul Calabresi of Barrington, R.I., and Judge Guido Calabresi of Woodbridge, Conn. Her brother, a former professor of medicine at Yale University, died in 1988.       
         Linda Sutter, a former journalist who developed the story line of the syndicated cartoon strip "Brenda Starr" in the early 1980's, died on Monday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 54.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         She wrote the Brenda Starr story line for Tribune Media Services of Chicago  from 1982 to 1985, taking over from the strip's creator, Dale Messick. During her tenure, she began the character's gradual update from a fantasy figure to a modern career woman, said Ramona Fradan, a collaborator.         Most recently, Ms. Sutter studied divinity at Harvard University, hoping to be ordained in the Episcopal Church. She had been on medical leave since her illness was diagnosed.         A native of Greenwich, Conn., she graduated from Vassar College in 1961 and started a career as a network radio producer at NBC. She also worked for Metromedia Channel 5 in New York and WINS.         Ms. Sutter is survived by her son, Joshua C. Empson of Greenwich; her parents, Clifford S. and Suzanne T. Sutter of Osterville, Mass.; three sisters,  Rebecca Breed of Greenwich, Tenney Auger of Portland, Me., and Michelle Hodgin of Los Angeles, and a brother, Samuel Sutter of Fall River, Mass.       
         Claire Tracy Townsend, a documentary film maker and the author of an expose on nursing homes, died on Tuesday at her parents' home in Los Angeles. She was 43 and lived in Ojai, Calif.         The cause was breast cancer, said her sister Joan.         Ms. Townsend was born in Manhattan and grew up in Locust Valley, L.I. She graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., and earned a bachelor's degree in English literature, magna cum laude, from Princeton University in 1974. In 1970, she and some classmates working with Ralph Nader, investigated abuses of the elderly in nursing homes in Washington. Their findings were published in 1971 as "Old Age: The Last Segregation," for which Ms. Townsend was editor and principal author.         After college, she worked in the film industry, becoming a vice president of  creative affairs at United Artists and 20th Century Fox. After earning a law degree from the Southwestern University of Law in 1990, she produced a video documentary, "The Spirit of Peace," about Peace Pilgrim, a woman who renounced all worldly goods and wandered across America preaching the cause of peace.         In addition to her sister Joan, of Crestone, Colo., she is survived by her parents, Robert and Joan Townsend, whose principal residence is Reno, Nev.; another sister, Jill, of Ojai; and two brothers, Robert, of Reno, and Jeffrey, of Hollywood Hills, Calif.       
         Louise Wolff Kahn, a patron of the arts and education in Dallas and elsewhere, died on Nov. 27 in the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. She was 85. She had lived in Dallas since 1937, but also kept a home in Manhattan, where she was born.         She graduated from Smith College, then pursued a career in advertising, retailing and interior design in New York before moving to Dallas. There, she worked at Neiman Marcus as the personal secretary to its president, Stanley Marcus, a boyhood friend of her husband-to-be, Edmund J.

Often she gave anonymously.         Having no children or other immediate survivors, Mrs. Kahn left the bulk of her estate, valued at more than $25 million, to the causes close to her heart. They included the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, said her accountant in Dallas, Sallie A. Scanlan.       
         Elizabeth Ball Holmes, a University of Hawaii speech professor who was one of the state's foremost experts on Hawaiian pidgin English, died on Dec. 17. She was 95.         Professor Holmes, also known as Elizabeth Carr, devoted most of her research  to the study of Hawaii's pidgin dialect, a combination of English, Hawaiian and  other languages.         In her book, "Da Kine Talk, from Pidgin to Standard English in Hawaii," she  contended that the language had evolved into a distinct regional dialect and could no longer be considered in its pidgin stage, the period when Asian immigrants learned a modicum of basic English from plantation bosses.       
         Gretchen Geber, a cello instructor whose students have gone on to play in major American orchestras, died on Saturday at her home in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81.         Mrs. Geber studied briefly at the University of Southern California and later taught there while pursuing studio work and performing.         Among her students are current members of symphonies in Los Angeles and New  Orleans, said her husband, Edwin, a retired cellist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Geber is survived by two sons, Stephen, the  principal cellist with the Cleveland Orchestra, and David, a cellist with the American String Quartet and chairman of the Manhattan School of Music's string department, and six grandchildren.       
         Helen Hill Miller, a prolific biographer and journalist, died on Tuesday at George Washington University Medical Center in Washington. She was 96, and had homes in Washington and Kitty Hawk, N.C.         Mrs. Miller wrote more than 20 books. Her biographies included "George Mason: Constitutionalist" (1938), "Captains From Devon: The Great Elizabethan Seafarers Who Won the World for England" and "Colonel Parke of Virginia: The Greatest Hector in Town" (1990). She also wrote six books on Greece and several works on  foreign policy.         Mrs. Miller was born in Highland Park, Ill. She received a bachelor's degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1921, a diploma in economics from Oxford University in 1922 and a doctorate in political science from the University of Chicago in 1928.         After working as a staff writer for the Agriculture Department in the late 1930's, she became a Washington correspondent for The Economist and Newsweek from 1940 to 1952. From 1958 to 1966, she was a contributing editor of The New Republic. She also contributed to Harper's Magazine and Esquire.         At the time of her death she had just completed a memoir, "Washington Observed."         She is survived by two sons, Andrew, of Washington, and Robert, of Elizabethtown, N.C., and nine grandchildren.       
         Rosalind K. Loring, a specialist in continuing education, adviser to Federal  agencies and university administrator, died on Dec. 18 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Over the years, Mrs. Loring was a consultant to the National Endowment for the Humanities, president of the Adult Education Association/ U.S.A. and a board member of the National University Extension Association. She retired in 1984 as associate provost for extended education at the University of Southern California.         She was born in Philadelphia and graduated in art and education from the University of California at Los Angeles, where she also earned a master's degree in adult education. In the late 1950's, U.C.L.A. engaged her to implement her ideas on improving the educational and professional status of women. To that end she developed programs of continuing education for women and similar ones to raise the educational levels of veterans.         Mrs. Loring is survived by her husband of more than 50 years, Murrel Loring;  a daughter, Sherry Loring-Warren of Los Angeles; a son, David, of Reno; a sister, Lois Mudrick of Los Angeles, and three grandsons.       
         Irene Corbally Kuhn, a journalist who traveled on five continents and wrote books as well as newspaper and magazine articles and columns, died yesterday at  the Briar Crest-Deaconess Nursing Home in Concord, Mass., where she had lived for the last year. She was 97 and had spent all of her earlier life, when she was not traveling, in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kuhn's many writings included a volume of memoirs, "Assigned to Adventure" (1938), which Augusta Tucker, writing in The New York Times Book Review, called "the story of an unafraid woman who has seen a lot of the world as a newspaper reporter" and added that it "has pace, it has interest, it has color, and the woman who wrote it has sense: a quality not consistently present  in the kiss-and-tell books of some of the male correspondents.".         Mrs. Kuhn was born in Greenwich Village and studied at Marymount College in  Tarrytown, N.Y., and at Columbia University. After reporting for The Syracuse Herald and working in Paris for The Chicago Tribune, she went to China in 1922 and became a reporter for the English-language Shanghai Evening News and then for the International News Service in Honolulu.         In 1926 she returned to New York City, joined The Daily News, and concentrated on feature writing. She spent a few years as a staff reporter for The Honolulu Star-Bulletin, and after returning briefly to The Daily News and working for other news organizations, in 1939 she joined the National Broadcasting Company, for which she reported and worked in other capacities until 1950.         In 1939, she was a founding member of the Overseas Press Club of New York.         After leaving NBC, she wrote a syndicated column and did other writing, including reminiscences that appeared in Gourmet magazine in the 1970's and 1980's.         Her husband, Bert L. Kuhn, also a journalist, died in 1926 after four years of marriage. She is survived by a daughter, Rene Kuhn Bryant of Lexington, Mass.; a granddaughter, and two great-granddaughters.       
         Roxie Roker, a star of the long-running CBS television series "The Jeffersons," died on Saturday, her publicity agent said. She was 66.         Her family, including her son, Lenny Kravitz, the rock guitarist and singer,  declined to release further details, said the publicity agent, Cynthia Snyder.         Ms. Roker was born in Miami. She grew up in Brooklyn, earned a drama degree  from Howard University in Washington and studied at the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-on-Avon, England. While holding an office job at NBC in New York in the 1960's, she appeared in Off Broadway shows, including Jean Genet's play "The Blacks." In 1967-68, she was a host of "Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant," a community-oriented show on WNEW-TV.         After resigning from NBC and turning full time to acting, Ms. Roker appeared  onstage with the Negro Ensemble Company in "Ododo" and "Rosalee Pritchet." She won an Obie Award, and was a 1974 Tony nominee for her performance as Mattie Williams in "The River Niger." Her other Off Broadway credits include "Behold! Cometh the Vanderkellans" (1971) and "Jamimma" (1972).         Ms. Roker moved to California when the producer Norman Lear cast her in "The  Jeffersons," a 1975 spinoff of his series "All in the Family." The new show moved Archie Bunker's black neighbors, the Jeffersons, from a blue-collar Queens neighborhood to a luxury apartment house in Manhattan.         The character played by Ms. Roker, Helen Willis, was a black woman with a white husband, Tom (Franklin Cover), television's first interracial couple. They were neighbors of George and Louise Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford), and the Willises' daughter eventually married the Jeffersons' son, Lionel. "The Jeffersons" ran for 10 years.         Ms. Roker later made guest appearances in other television series and specials and returned to the stage. She appeared in a stage production of "The Jeffersons" and toured with Mary Martin and Carol Channing in "Legends."         Her community work, including her role as a board member of the Interagency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect, earned her two citations from the Los Angeles City Council.         A marriage to Sy Kravitz, a former NBC executive, ended in divorce, said a spokesman for Virgin Records, their son's recording company.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her father, Albert Roker, and a granddaughter, Zoe.       
         Eleanor Brown Gambee, a horticulturist, writer and civic worker, died on Saturday at her home in Englewood, N.J. She was 91.         For five decades, Mrs. Gambee devoted her time and active support to the New  York Botanical Garden. As a lecturer and freelance writer, she discussed herbs and horticulture and contributed articles to horticultural journals and other publications.         She was a past vice president of the Planned Parenthood Association of Bergen County, president of the Herb Society of America and member of the editorial board of Vassar Alumnae Magazine.         Mrs. Gambee, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Vassar College and did postgraduate work at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. She  was a past trustee of the Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, the Social Service Federation of Englewood and other community organizations.         Mrs. Gambee is survived by three sons, Sumner, of San Pedro, Calif., Craig, of Nantucket, Mass., and Robert, of Rye, N.Y.; a daughter, Fay Gambee of Manhattan, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Her husband, A. Sumner Gambee, died in 1978.       
         Lois Moss Rothenberg, a benefactor of Jewish and other causes, died on Friday at New York University Hospital. She was 60 and had homes in Manhattan, Ventnor, N.J., and Boca Raton, Fla.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Rothenberg was born in Manhattan and graduated from Wellesley College,  whose alumni association she supported. She was a past president of the Jewish Family Service of Atlantic County and chairwoman of the Lion of Judah for the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. She was also a volunteer for Meals on Wheels in New York.         She is survived by her husband, Herbert, a son, John S., of Las Vegas, and a  daughter, Anne Rothenberg of Taunton, Mass.       
         Toni Cade Bambara, a writer and documentary film maker who was celebrated for her intricate use of Black English in fiction, died on Saturday at a hospital in Philadelphia. She was 56 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Karma Bene Bambara of Philadelphia.         In the early 1970's, Ms. Bambara was a major contributor to the emerging genre of contemporary black women's literature, along with the writers Toni Morrison and Alice Walker and others. Many of her stories focused on men and women living in black neighborhoods in big cities or small Southern towns -- as  one reviewer put it, "young women and men who formed their political convictions in the fury of the 60's and find themselves gasping for air in the torpor of the 70's, manicurists, singers and students struggling to trim the rhetoric of their wishes to the smaller, tighter fit of reality."         What critics found most striking about Ms. Bambara's fiction, though, were the structure and language she used. Rather than using traditional linear plots, she would often use flashbacks, stream of consciousness and interweavings of plot and subplot to tell a story. She would frequently weave black dialects into her prose, creating a unique, complex language that was widely admired by critics.         Ms. Bambara published one novel, "The Salt Eaters," in 1980. She also edited  several anthologies and wrote several short-story collections, including "Gorilla, My Love," published in 1972, and "The Sea Birds Are Still Alive," published in 1977. Reviewing "Gorilla, My Love" for The New York Times in 1972,  C.D.B. Bryan wrote that her stories were unusual because they addressed racial issues in a tone more thoughtful than angry.         "Toni Cade Bambara tells me more about being black through her quiet, proud,  silly, tender, hip, acute, loving stories than any amount of literary polemicizing could hope to do," Mr. Bryan wrote in the review. "She writes about love: a love for one's family, one's friends, one's race, one's neighborhood, and it is the sort of love that comes with maturity and inner peace."         Ms. Bambara was born in New York City, and growing up, she spent much of her  time in public libraries. Louis Massiah, a friend and colleague in Philadelphia, said that as a child, Ms. Bambara would often visit a Harlem branch of the New York Public Library, where she was inspired by two black poets: Gwendolyn Brooks, whose photograph hung there, and Langston Hughes, who she said would often come and talk to children there.         Ms. Bambara graduated from Queens College with a bachelor's degree in theater arts in 1959. In 1965, she received a master's degree in American studies from the City College of New York. She was an assistant professor of English at Rutgers University from 1969 to 1974, and she also held various teaching positions at Duke University, Atlanta University and Spelman College, among others.         From 1986 until this year, Ms. Bambara taught script writing at Scribe Video  Center in Philadelphia. Mr. Massiah said that during her tenure at the center, she helped start the careers of several black women film makers. She wrote and lectured frequently about film, stressing the importance of movies that dispel Hollywood stereotypes about blacks.         Over the last decade, Ms. Bambara also collaborated with Mr. Massiah on several television documentaries, including "The Bombing of Osage Avenue," about the police assault on Move headquarters in Philadelphia, and a biography of Cecil B. Moore, a prominent civil rights activist in Philadelphia. Her most recent project was a documentary about the life of W.E.B. Du Bois, which she worked on with Mr. Massiah and several others.         Throughout her life, Mr. Massiah said, Ms. Bambara fought for the rights of minorities, women, children and the homeless.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her mother, Helen Brehon of Queens, and a brother, Walter Cade of Queens.       
         Miriam Camps, who wrote about European unification and other topics and who had been a State Department official, died on Friday in a hospital near her home in Little Abingdon outside Cambridge, England. She was 78.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, Margaret Schwartz.         Mrs. Camps was born Miriam Camp in Lynn, Mass. She was the first woman to be vice chairman of the State Department's Planning Council, from 1968 to 1970.         After earning degrees at Mount Holyoke and Bryn Mawr colleges, she joined the State Department during World War II and went on to work at the United States Embassy in London. She worked for the State Department in Washington from 1947 to 1953, then resigned to marry William Anthony Camps, a classicist at Cambridge University.         Her many subsequent writings included the books "Britain the the European Community" (1964), "What Kind of Europe?" (1965) and "European Unification in the Sixties" (1966). She was active in a variety of organizations concerned with foreign affairs.         In addition to her husband and her sister, Margaret Schwartz of Endicott, N.Y., she is survived by a brother, Paul R. Camp of Orono, Maine.       
         Elaine Sulka, the director of the National Shakespeare Company and of the Cubiculo theater in New York City, died on Dec. 24 at her home in Manhattan. She was 61.         The cause was a heart attack, said Joanne Joseph, a friend.         Ms. Sulka trained in sociology and received a master's degree from Brown University before turning to theater. She studied acting with Jules Irving and Herbert Blau at the San Francisco Actors Workshop and with Paul Mann in New York. She performed in many regional theater productions and on and off Broadway through last summer, including Goneril to Morris Carnovsky's Lear at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn.; the title role in "Medea" at Circle in the Square; Olivia in "Twelfth Night" at the Globe Theater in San Diego, and a lead role in the Broadway production of Paddy Chayefsky's "Passion of Josef D." In recent years she toured in two one-woman productions, "Mothers" and "A Woman in Love -- With Shakespeare."         Ms. Sulka founded the National Shakespeare Company in 1963 with Philip Meister, her husband, with the aim of taking Shakespeare to schools and universities on bus tours throughout the country. In 1968, the couple founded the Cubiculo, a small, lively center for new theater, dance, film and poetry, in a brownstone in Clinton. The center, which included a 75-seat theater and a studio theater, was a popular and affordable place to experiment, with Ms. Sulka, tall, dark-eyed and stylishly exuberant, serving at times as the evening's hostess. The Cubiculo is the home of the National Shakespeare Company, which will continue under the direction of Greg Lombardo and Tom Trudgeon.         Mr. Meister died in 1982. Ms. Sulka is survived by her mother, Anna, of Maspeth, Queens; a daughter, Deirdre, of El Paso, Tex., and two sisters, Barbara Bonomi and Marie Schaefer. A memorial service is to be held on Jan. 21 at 6 P.M. at the Cubiculo, 414 West 51st Street.       
         Libby E. Sachar, who in 1946 was the first woman appointed a Superior Court judge in New Jersey, died on Dec. 28 at her home in Plainfield, N.J. She was 90.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her son, Judge Leonard Sachar of Scotch Plains, N.J.         Selected as a juvenile-domestic relations judge by Gov. Walter Edge and reappointed in 1951, she served in Union County for 10 years until she resumed her private law practice in Plainfield.         She was a 1924 graduate of the New York University School of Law and was an advocate of women's rights. In 1947, she was a member of the New Jersey Constitution Committee, which revised the state's Constitution.         In addition to her son, who is on the Superior Court bench in Union County, she is survived by a daughter, Naomi Margolies of Plainfield; a brother, Dr. Morton Bertin of Orlando, Fla., six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Cleo Rickman Fitch, an archeological researcher who specialized in Roman lamps, died on Sunday in her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         In 1962, she joined an excavation of the ancient town of Cosa, north of Rome, and continued her work into the 1980's.         The book "Cosa: The Lamps," which she wrote with Dr. Norma Goldman of Wayne State University, was issued last fall as part of the American Academy series through the University of Michigan Press.         She was born in Carlsbad, Tex., and received a bachelor's degree from Peabody College in Nashville.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. James Marston Fitch, the architectural historian and critic, and a brother, John Rickman of Chapel Hill, Tenn.       
         Gertrude Fogelson, a New York philanthropist and artist, died on Sunday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 92 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Fogelson was honorary chairwoman and a longtime benefactor of the Jewish Museum in Manhattan. She was a fellow of Brandeis University and a member of its creative arts committee.         She was a trustee of the Joe and Emily Lowe Foundation in Palm Beach, which supports Jewish and other charitable causes. The foundation last reported assets of $21 million and expenditures of $1.45 million in 1992.         Mrs. Fogelson, who was born in the Bronx, worked as a health-education teacher and stockbroker.         She is survived by her husband of 64 years, David, a retired corporate lawyer; a daughter, Ellen Liman of Manhattan; two sisters, Annette Bloch of Manhattan and Frances Epstein of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.       
         Dr. Barbara Jelavich, a prominent scholar of Eastern European history with a particular interest in the Balkan countries, died on Saturday at Bloomington Hospital in Bloomington, Ind. She was 71 and lived in Bloomington.         The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for Indiana University.         She was on the faculty of Indiana University from 1961 until she retired as distinguished professor emeritus of history in 1993. During that time, she was the author or co-author of 17 books about Russia, the Balkans, and the Ottoman and Hapsburg empires. Some were written with her husband, Charles, also a professor emeritus of history at Indiana.         Her areas of expertise included Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Yugoslavia.         Born Barbara Brightfield in Belleville, Ill., she grew up in Berkeley, Calif. She received three degrees in history from the University of California at Berkeley, including, in 1948, a Ph.D. She started her academic career at Berkeley as a junior research historian at the Institute of Slavic Studies and a lecturer in history.         She joined the Indiana faculty as a lecturer in 1961 and by 1967 was a full professor in the history department.         Among her works currently in print are "History of the Balkans: 18th and 19th Centuries" (Cambridge University Press, 1983); "History of the Balkans: 20th Century" (Cambridge, 1983); "Russia and the Formation of the Romanian Empire" (Cambridge, 1984); "Modern Austria: Empire and Republic" (Cambridge, 1987); "Russia and the Rumanian National Cause" (Archon reprint, 1974), and "Russia's Balkan Entanglements, 1806-1914" (Cambridge, 1991).         Besides her husband, survivors include two sons, Mark, of Maryville, Mo., and Peter, of Austin, Tex., and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Georgia B. Christopher, a professor of English at Emory University, died on Dec. 16 in DeKalb Medical Center in Decatur, Ga. She was 62 and lived in Decatur.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         She was the author of "Milton and the Science of the Saints" (Princeton University Press, 1983), for which she received the James Holly Hanford Award of the Milton Society of America. She also contributed frequently to journals of language and philology.         Born in Barnesville, Ga., she graduated from Agnes Scott College and earned her Ph.D. in English from Yale University. She taught at the University of North Carolina and the University of Richmond before joining the Emory faculty in 1981.         Dr. Christopher is survived by two brothers, John Christopher of Roswell, Ga., and Kent Christopher of Blairsville, Ga.       
         Crosby Newell Bonsall, the author and illustrator of more than 40 children's books, died on Jan. 10 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she lived. She was 74.         The cause was a stroke, said Barbara Phillips, her niece.         Ms. Bonsall began her career at an advertising agency, where she sold the rights to one of her drawings to a doll manufacturer. She then created a family of dolls, which were used as characters in her first book, "Tell Me Some More," which was published in 1961.         Although she began as an illustrator, she quickly turned to writing.  "Tell Me Some More," illustrated by Fritz Siebel, was published by Harper & Row as part of its I Can Read series, which is still in print. She wrote the text for the photographer Ylla's "I'll Show You Cats" (1964), an award-winning children's book.         She was born in Kew Gardens, Queens, and studied at the New York University School of Architecture and the American School of Design.         In addition to Ms. Phillips of Paterson, N.J., she is survived by her husband, George, and a sister, Marion Phillips of Manahawkin, N.J.       
         Suzanne Storrs Pincus, a community volunteer active in social services and the arts, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 60.         She died after a lengthy illness, her family said.         Mrs. Pincus was a director of the Citizens' Committee for Children, a board member and past president of the Auxiliary of Montefiore Medical Center and a founder of the Professional Committee of Elem-Youth in Distress in Israel.         She was a director of Women in Need, a nonprofit organization that seeks to keep homeless women and their children together, and a founder of its summer camp, Camp WIN. She also was a founder of the nonprofit Bronx Community Enterprises, a Montefiore spinoff to encourage local businesses.         She was born Suzanne Storrs Poulton in Provo, Utah, and studied speech and communication at the University of Utah.         She turned to community work 27 years ago, helping to develop methods of improving child care and encouraging self-help among the disadvantaged.         Mrs. Pincus was on the boards of the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, L.I., and the American Place Theater in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband, Lionel I. Pincus, chairman of E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company, a venture banking firm; two sons, Henry A. and Matthew S., both of Manhattan; and three brothers, Brent Poulton, of Medford, Ore., Kent Poulton, of San Francisco, and Michael Poulton, of Lausanne, Switzerland.       
         Lucy D. Manoff, for four decades a leader in cultural and educational institutions in Israel, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 81.         She died of complications of pulmonary and heart disease, said her son Robert K. Manoff of Pound Ridge, N.Y.         Among the institutions in which she held leadership posts were the Institute of Contemporary Jewry of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Vidal Sassoon Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism of the Hebrew University and the Committee on Manpower Opportunities in Israel. The latter group recruited American volunteer doctors to serve with the Israeli forces during the Six-Day War of 1967.         For more than 30 years, Mrs. Manoff was the American executive director for the Institute of Contemporary Jewry of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The institute was organized to study American historical ties to Israel and the contemporary Jewish experience worldwide.         Mrs. Manoff played a prominent role in developing curriculums for Jewish studies in American colleges and universities.         An early feminist, she was a founding member of the board of the Women's Campaign Fund, organized to promote the election of women to public office.         Mrs. Manoff was born in New York City and graduated from Hunter College.         She is survived by her husband of 52 years, Richard K. Manoff; another son, Dr. Gregory P. Manoff of Santa Fe, N.M.; a sister, Martha Deutscher of New York, and six grandchildren.       
         Irene S. Forrest, a biochemist who helped develop tests to trace whether psychiatric patients were taking their medication, died on Dec. 22 in her home in Menlo Park, Calif. She was 86.         The cause was complications from diabetes, said her daughter, Joan H. Armer of Menlo Park.         Together with her late husband, Fred M. Forrest, a psychiatrist, Dr. Forrest developed urine tests to detect drugs in the body, phenothiazines, used in the treatment of schizophrenia. The tests, called Forrest tests, also allow doctors to determine the amount of drugs taken and how they worked in the body.         Psychiatric patients are often reluctant to take drugs, doctors say, because it is a tacit admission that they are ill.         Born in Berlin, Dr. Forrest received her Ph.D. in biochemistry from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, where she studied under her father, Carl Neuberg, the director. From 1932 to 1936, she worked at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and at Istanbul University before emigrating to the United States.         After World War II she was reunited with her father and worked with him at New York University, the Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn and the New York Medical College until his death in 1956. In 1957, she joined the Veterans Administration Hospital in Brockton, Mass., to do research in psychopharmacology.         Dr. Forrest transferred to the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Palo Alto, Calif., in 1961. While there she also held research positions at either Stanford University or the University of San Francisco until her retirement in 1978.         Over her career, she had more more than 100 papers published.         In addition to her daughter, Dr. Forrest is survived by three grandchildren.       
         Blanche G. Etra, a lawyer and philanthropist who played an important role in the development of Yeshiva University, died on Wednesday in her home in Manhattan. She was 79.         The cause was leukemia, said a son, Donald, of Los Angeles.         The Etra family had long supported Yeshiva. Mrs. Etra expanded that role by helping to found, in 1953, the National Women's Division of Yeshiva's newly chartered Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She was its first president and became honorary president in 1962.         When the university founded the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in the mid-1970's, she was named to its Board of Directors and served as secretary from 1986 until her death. She also was the first woman to serve on the medical college's Board of Overseers.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. Etra graduated from Barnard College in 1935. In 1938, she received a law degree from Columbia University and began a private practice. After the death of her husband of 38 years, Harry, in 1977, she joined the law firm of Etra & Etra, where her partner was her brother-in-law, Max Etra, chairman of Yeshiva's board from 1953 to 1977.         Mrs. Etra was on the national Board of Directors for the United Jewish Appeal and served as a director of Seton Hill College in Greensburg, Pa., and the Brookdale Center of Hunter College.         Besides Donald, she is survived by two other sons, Aaron and Marshall, both of Manhattan; a sister, Helen Rachmil of Los Angeles; a brother, Morton Goldman of Manhattan, and six grandchildren. A fourth son, Jonathan, died in 1991.       
         Nora Dunfee, an actress who taught for many years in the graduate acting program of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, died on Dec. 23 at St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was complications after a brief illness, the university's press office reported in a statement.         Ms. Dunfee was born in Belmont, Ohio. She began her professional acting career at the Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Me. Her stage credits included "Madam, Will You Walk?" (1953), "The Midnight Caller" (1958), "The Visit" (1960), "The Last Days of Lincoln" (1961) and "Crowbar" (1990).         She also taught privately in New York and California and coached many actors over the years, including Julie Haydon, James Earl Jones, Raul Julia, Diane Keaton, Mel Gibson and Keanu Reeves. In theater, she was a vocal consultant for "The Real Thing," "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "A Lie of the Mind."         Ms. Dunfee also appeared in films, including "Lorenzo's Oil." Most recently, she was seen in "Forrest Gump," as the Southern Lady who sympathetically advises Tom Hanks at a bus stop.         Ms. Dunfee met her future husband, David Clarke, in an acting class. The couple appeared together in a number of stage productions, including "Portrait of a Lady," "The Visit" and "The Gin Game."         She is survived by her husband; two daughters, K. C. Ligon of New York City and Susan Bennett of Seattle, and two grandchildren.       
         Kathleen Tynan, a writer best known for her biography of her husband, the critic Kenneth Tynan, died yesterday at King Edward VII Hospital in London. She was 57 and lived in London.         The cause was cancer, said Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, a friend and the executor of Mrs. Tynan's estate.         Mrs. Tynan was a journalist, essayist and fiction writer whose works include the novel "The Summer Aeroplane" (1975) and the screenplay and novel titled "Agatha" (1979), a fictional speculation on the midlife disappearance of Agatha Christie.         But it was "The Life of Kenneth Tynan" (1987), an unflinching portrait of the influential English drama critic to whom she was married for 13 years, that was the high point of Mrs. Tynan's literary career. "It was such a weird thing, to write about your husband," she said at the time. "I was a passionate sleuth, torn between being the outsider and insider."         The book, however, was widely praised for its objectivity. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Benedict Nightingale described it as "almost frighteningly judicious," adding that Mrs. Tynan "somehow manages to fulfill, perhaps even surpass, the obligations of a good biographer."         The daughter of Matthew Halton, a Canadian journalist, Mrs. Tynan was reared in Canada and England and attended Oxford University. She worked as a researcher for Newsweek and as a reporter for The Observer and The Sunday Times in London. Her marriage to Mr. Tynan, her second, began in 1967 and lasted until his death, in 1980.         Mrs. Tynan was also the co-editor of "Profiles" (1990), selected essays by her husband, and the editor of "Kenneth Tynan: Letters," which came out in England last fall (Weidenfeld & Nicolson) and will be published in the United States by Random House in the spring.         She is survived by a daughter, Roxana, of Los Angeles, and a son, Matthew, of London, from her marriage to Mr. Tynan; her mother, Jean Halton of Ottawa, and a brother, David, of Washington.       
         Sylvia Bernstein Seaman, a writer and one of the last active members of the suffragist movement, died on Sunday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 94.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said. She published a book about that disease 30 years ago, "Always a Woman: What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer," the first by someone outside the medical profession. "It was considered daring at the time," she later said, "but it changed attitudes, I think."         She became a confirmed suffragist in high school and first marched for the right to vote as a student in 1915. While in college, she took part in the parades of August 1920 celebrating the 19th Amendment that secured women's suffrage nationwide.         In 1970, she was one of five veterans of 1920 chosen to lead the 50th anniversary parade on Fifth Avenue.         She was in the lead again in a 1980 march marking the 60th anniversary of victory. She made her final public appearance last August with an address on feminism and women in American history when the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women marked the 74th anniversary.         Sylvia Bernstein was born in Manhattan and graduated from Cornell University. She taught high school English in New York City before turning to writing.         With her Cornell roommate, Frances Schwartz, she wrote novels under the name Francis Sylvin. They chose a male pseudonym because they thought that female authors were not taken seriously.         In one novel, "Miracle Father" (1952), a couple produced a child by artificial insemination. It was republished in 1968 as "Test-Tube Father."         Mrs. Seaman underwent a radical mastectomy in 1955, an experience that led her to write "Always a Woman," published in 1965. It was a rarely discussed topic, which she also wrote about for magazines and newspapers.         In the 1970's, she resumed writing travel pieces and humor, including her last book, "How to Be a Jewish Grandmother" (1979). Travel was her avocation, and she visited more than 100 countries.         Her personal and professional papers are in the collection of the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Radcliffe College.         She is survived by her husband of 69 years, William Seaman; two sons, Gideon, of Manhattan and Jonathan, of Brooklyn, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Aylin Radomisli-Cates, a psychiatrist who was the wife of the producer Joseph Cates, died on Jan. 17 in a car accident outside her home in Bedford Hills, N.Y. She was 57.         After graduating from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, she became an assistant clinical professor at Cornell University Medical College. She entered the Army in 1992 as a lieutenant colonel to head the psychiatric service at Fort Sill, Okla. After two years in the Army, she returned to private practice, opening offices in Bedford Hills and Manhattan.         She was born in Istanbul, Turkey, and served for many years as a trustee of Roberts College, an English-language university there.         In 1987, she married Mr. Cates, a producer of Broadway shows and television programs. In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Nilufer Gulek, of Ankara, Turkey.       
         Dr. Mary Dwight B. McNair Scott, a biochemistry professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was a pioneer in the identification of the B complex of vitamins and their functions, died on Feb. 9 at the Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia, where she lived. She was 87.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Dr. Thomas F. McNair Scott.         In 1935, while she was completing work at Harvard University for a doctorate in biochemistry, she became one of the first women appointed to the faculty of the Harvard Medical School as a research associate.         She married the following year and moved to England with her husband where she did research on the biochemistry of diabetes at the University College Medical School in London.         From 1943 to 1946, while on the faculty of Wellesley College, she conducted studies identifying N-methyl nicotinamide in urine which contributed to the discovery of the B complex vitamin, niacin.         After her husband completed his wartime service in England, the couple settled in Philadelphia, where she went to work for the University of Pennsylvania's Children's Hospital. From 1954 to 1965 she was in the School of Medicine's research medicine and physiology departments. In 1965 Dr. Scott moved to the School of Veterinary Medicine and retired in 1972.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Robert, of Bern, Switzerland; a daughter, Carolyn Hoehn of Heidelberg, Germany; a sister, Helen Sutton Gulick of Sacramento, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Sister Ann Gillen, executive director of the Interreligious Task Force on Soviet Jewry from 1972 to 1987, died on Jan. 14 at the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus convent in Rosemont, Pa. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said Sister Gloria Coleman, a member of the order.         As the leader of the Interreligious Task Force, which was established in 1972 to press the Soviet Union to let Jews emigrate without restrictions, Sister Ann picketed Soviet embassies throughout the world and petitioned leaders in Washington and at the United Nations in New York.         In 1982 she was one of three human rights advocates who delivered a symbolic writ of habeas corpus to officials at the Soviet Embassy in Washington on behalf of Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet dissident and nuclear physicist then living in exile in central European Russia.         Sister Ann, who was born in Texas City, entered the Society of the Holy Child Jesus in 1940 and took her final vows in 1948. She studied at Fordham University and at the Regina Mundi Pontifical Institute in Rome, and received a master's degree in history from Villanova University.         She taught at several of the order's high schools around the country in the 1940's and 50's. She was dean of studies at Rosemont College from 1962 to 1964, and taught theology and scripture at Rosemont from 1964 to 1969.         Sister Ann was also executive director of the National Coalition of American Nuns in the 1970's and served several terms on the governing board of Common Cause, the public-affairs lobbying organization.       
         Dr. Gily Epstein Bard-Staroben, a plant scientist at the City University of New York for some 30 years, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. A longtime resident of Tuckahoe, N.Y., she was 70.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Dr. Bard specialized in plant succession, the natural changes in the vegetation of a site over time. She was an expert on secondary succession of woodlands, about which she wrote several papers.         She was born in Berlin and came as a child to the United States with her parents. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree in soil science from Cornell University and a doctorate in plant physiology from Rutgers University. She started teaching at Hunter in the 1950's and was also on the faculties of Lehman College and the CUNY Graduate Center.         Dr. Bard directed a doctoral program in plant sciences offered by the Graduate Center and the New York Botanical Garden. She retired from teaching about five years ago.         She was a past editor of the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, a botanical journal. She was a trustee of the Mianus River Gorge Reservation in Connecticut, and helped in the 1950's to save from development Mettler's Woods in New Brunswick, N.J., now the William L. Hutcheson Memorial Forest.         Dr. Bard is survived by her second husband, Irving Staroben of Stamford, Conn.; a son, Doron D. Bard of Gaithersburg; a sister, Nurie Relis of Manhattan, and a grandson. Her first husband, Seldon Bard, and a son, Etan R., died in a 1974 terrorist bombing of a Rome-bound T.W.A. airliner over the Agean Sea.       
         Ida Gertrude Krebs, whose lifelong interest in children with learning disabilities led her to found a school where she could implement a highly individual approach to such problems, died on Feb. 11 at Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. She was 86 and had lived in Lexington, Mass., until about three years ago.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her son, Roy R. Krebs Jr. of Alexandria.         Born in Fort Worth, a grand-niece of President Woodrow Wilson, she first offered help to the disadvantaged when, as a teen-ager, she tutored a neighbor who had been dismissed from school because of a learning disability. In 1968, she founded the Krebs School in Lexington, Mass., where more than 100 children with learning disabilities studied in classes of no more than eight pupils.         She employed unusual techniques to capture the children's interest. The school's pet dog was brought to class so students would learn to count by monitoring the wags of its tail. Division was taught with visits to the kitchen to slice carrots.         She was a member of the President's Council on Handicapped Children for more than 20 years and worked as a consultant to Governments in Canada, Colombia and Venezuela.         Trained as a nurse, she counseled veterans returning from World War II who had suffered battle trauma. After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education from Boston University, she tutored extensively in Cambridge, Mass., and then in Arlington, Mass., before establishing her own school.         Upon her retirement in 1986, the Krebs School was merged into the Cotting School, which offered a more comprehensive curriculum.         Her husband, Roy R. Krebs, died in the mid-1940's. In addition to her son, Roy Jr., she is survived by two sisters, Elizabeth Quinlan of San Clemente, Calif., and Dr. Ruth Briles of Sycamore, Ill.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Catherine H. Sweeney, a patron of the sciences and arts for whom the Sweeney Mountains of Antarctica were named, died on Jan. 25 at the Miami Heart Institute. She was 80 and lived in Coconut Grove, Fla.         The cause was heart failure, said her son-in-law, Eric Fraunfelter.         Mrs. Sweeney called herself "just a lady gardener," but her efforts on behalf of botany, exploration, education and the arts earned her such honors as a silver medal from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and an honorary doctorate from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., where she sent eight women from Sri Lanka to be educated at her expense.         She was also a trustee of the Congressionally chartered National Tropical Botanical Garden, the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Miami, the American Horticultural Society, the World Wildlife Fund and the Conservation Foundation. She was a member-at-large of the Garden Club of America and a founder of the Florida chapter of the Society of Women Geographers.         Among other enterprises, Mrs. Sweeney rescued and restored the eight-acre estate called The Kampong in Coconut Grove in 1963. She donated the property, the former residence of the plant explorer David Fairchild, to the National Tropical Botanical Garden as a refuge and retreat for horticulturalists.         After she helped finance the Norwegian explorers Finn and Jackie Ronne in an expedition to Antarctica in the late 1940's, the Ronnes named the Sweeney Mountains in her honor.         She was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in Rye, N.Y., and a life trustee and national board member of the Aspen Music Festival and School in Aspen, Colo.         Born Catherine Denkmann Hauberg, she was a granddaughter and grandniece of the two brothers who established the company that became the Weyerhauser lumber empire.         She was a graduate of Dana Hall in Wellesley, Mass., and of the University of Illinois. Her husband, Edward C. Sweeney, a former president of the Explorers Club, died in 1967.         Mrs. Sweeney is survived by her children, Edward Jr., of Black Forest, Colo.; Philip, of Amherst, Mass.; John, of Aspen, Colo.; Susie Kayyali of Coral Gables, Fla., and Harriet Fraunfelter of Washington; her brother, John Hauberg Jr. of Seattle; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Joan R. Cook, a former reporter and union leader at The New York Times who was a principal organizer of a successful 1974 sex-discrimination lawsuit against the newspaper, died Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, said her daughter, Jezebel, of Manhattan.         Ms. Cook was a reporter in metropolitan news when she retired from The Times in 1991.         In 1974, when women at The Times filed a class-action suit accusing it of discrimination, she was one of seven named plaintiffs. The case was settled in 1978 with cash payments and an affirmative-action plan.         She was elected head of the New York Newspaper Guild's Times unit in 1980, the first woman in the post.         Ms. Cook was born in Portland, Ore., and attended the University of California at Los Angeles. In 1940, she joined The Minneapolis Star-Journal and Tribune, working in classified advertising. In 1949, she moved to Paris, where she wrote a column for the Paris edition of The Herald Tribune. She joined The Times in Family/Style in 1959 and transferred to metropolitan news in 1972 as a New Jersey correspondent.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two other children, John Barlow of Winchester, England, and Joseph Cook of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Catherine, of Pearl River, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  February 18, 1995, Saturday         An obituary on Feb. 6 about Joan R. Cook, a former reporter and Newspaper Guild leader at The New York Times, referred incorrectly to women's history in the union leadership at The Times. Ms. Cook, who was elected in 1980 to head the guild's Times unit, was not the first woman to do so. The first was Jerre Smoot, in the 1940's.       
         Alison Frantz, one of the foremost archeological photographers of Greek sites and antiquities, died on Feb. 1 at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. She was 91.         Ms. Frantz died of injuries received on Jan. 27 when she was hit by a truck near her home in Princeton.         Ms. Frantz's interest in Greece began in her youth in Princeton and her interest in photography with the gift of a camera from her brother.         When she took over as the official photographer for the excavations in the Athenian agora, the civic center of the ancient city, she carried with her a Ph.D. in classics from Columbia University and an undergraduate degree in the same area from Smith College.         She first visited Greece as a fellow at the American Academy in Rome, after graduation from Smith in 1924.         After study at Princeton on the classical world of early Christendom and Byzantium, she returned to Greece with an appointment as a fellow of the American School. Five years later, she joined the archeological staff at the agora, and in 1939 was made its official photographer, a position she kept until 1964.         The assignment was interrupted by the war, during which she worked for the Office of Strategic Services as an adviser on Greece. After the war, she worked for three years for the State Department as a cultural attache in the American Embassy in Athens.         Ms. Frantz's photographs were used to illustrate a number of publications, including Gisela Richter's "Archaic Gravestones of Attica" (Phaidon, 1961); Bernard Ashmole's "Olympia: The Sculptures of the Temple of Zeus" (Phaidon, 1971), and Martin Robertson's "Parthenon Frieze" (Phaidon, 1975).         She also supplied photographs for Joseph Alsop's "From the Silent Earth: A Report on the Greek Bronze Age" (Harper & Row, 1964).         She was the author of "Church of the Holy Apostles" (American School of Classical Studies Press, 1971) and "The Athenian Agora, vol. XXIV, Late Antiquity, A.D. 267-700" (American School of Classical Studies Press, 1988).       
         Sidney Robertson Cowell, an ethnomusicologist, writer and the widow of the composer Henry Cowell, died on Thursday at her home in Shady, N.Y., said Sean Hartnett, her executor. She was 92.         In her extensive travels from 1937 to 1957, Mrs. Cowell recorded American, Finnish, Irish, Portuguese, Iranian and Turkish folk music, among other types. Her collection, housed in the Library of Congress, is among the most extensive ever gathered and includes some of the earliest documentation of ethnic music in the United States. It holds not only field recordings, but also correspondence, field notes, photographs, articles and other materials.         She was born in San Francisco in 1903 and received a bachelor of arts in philology and Romance languages from Stanford University in 1924. After graduating, she studied piano in Paris with the pianist and teacher Alfred Cortot.         In 1935-36, she directed the social music program at the Henry Street Settlement in New York City. The next year, she worked for the Resettlement Administration (renamed the Farm Security Administration) in Appalachia and the Ozarks, recording black American music in chain-gang road camps.         She met Cowell in 1927 as his piano student. They were married in 1941 and together they traveled as cultural ambassadors for the State Department, collecting music from around the world. After his death in 1965, she became one of the biggest champions of his music.         Mrs. Cowell was also a teacher and writer. She taught courses in American folk music at the University of Southern California, and was an author, with her husband, of "Charles Ives and His Music" (1955).         No immediate family members survive.       
         Elizabeth Dorothy Futas, the director of the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Library and Information Studies, died on Feb. 6 in Philadelphia. She was 50 and lived in Wakefield, R.I.         The cause has not been reported, according to the American Library Association in Chicago. Dr. Futas, a member of its governing council, was attending the association's midwinter meeting at the Pennsylvania Convention Center at the time.         Dr. Futas took up her duties at the university in Kingston, R.I., in 1986 and during the next decade helped to train a generation of reference and children's book librarians. She also revamped the programs of the library school and within two years helped it to secure accreditation.         She worked as a cataloguer for the Ford Foundation in New York and as a reference librarian at Queens College in the 1960's and 1970's. Before accepting the job at Rhode Island, she held faculty positions at Rutgers University, Emory University and the University of Washington in Seattle, among other institutions.         She was the author of four books on library science, including "Library Acquisition Policies and Procedures" (Oryx Press; 3d edition, 1994), and "The Library Forms Illustrated Handbook" (Neal-Schuman, 1984).         Born in Brooklyn, Dr. Futas was a political science graduate of Brooklyn College. She received a master's in librarian science at the University of Minnesota and a doctorate in information studies at Rutgers.         She is survived by her mother, Eleanor Futas of Manhattan, and a sister, Susan Wagner of Bethesda, Md.       
         Loyce Houlton, a leader in American regional dance and a choreographer whose works were performed by companies in the United States and Europe, died on Tuesday at United Hospital in St. Paul. She was 70 and lived in Minneapolis.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter, Lise Houlton Gilliland, a former member of American Ballet Theater and the Stuttgart Ballet.         Mrs. Houlton favored a rhapsodic choreographic style that combined ballet with various modern-dance techniques. She created more than 90 works, many of them to contemporary music, and her Minnesota Dance Theater became known for its experimental productions. Ballets by her have also been presented by Dance Theater of Harlem, the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Deutsche Oper Ballet of Berlin.         A tiny and perpetually restless woman, Mrs. Houlton liked to say to students: "Explode! Be voracious in space." Yet for the last two decades of her life, she was in chronic ill health. Undaunted, she once said in an interview that her illness had significantly changed her choreography. "I have more courage now," she declared.         Mrs. Houlton, a native of Duluth, Minn., studied dance at Carleton College and New York University and at several New York ballet and modern-dance schools. After settling in Minneapolis, she founded the Contemporary Dance Playhouse in 1962; seven years later, it was renamed Minnesota Dance Theater. Financial problems in 1986 forced the company to disband. But in the last few years, Mrs. Houlton had attempted to reorganize it, and last summer, it revived two of her important works: her version of Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring," and "Ancient Air," to music by George Crumb, an American composer she particularly admired.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Dr. William Houlton; three sons, Laif, Joel and Andrew, and four grandchildren, all of Minneapolis, and two sisters, Jewell Kraemer of Wausau, Wis., and Ardeth Becher of St. Paul.       
         Beverly Reitz, an interior designer known for her innovative use of light, died on Sunday in Hightstown, N.J., where she had lived since 1990.         She was 94 and had been a resident of Manhattan for much of her life. She also had a home in Ridgefield, Conn.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said Clint Wade of Manhattan, a longtime friend.         Mrs. Reitz worked mainly with residences, using light to create moods. But she also designed the Women's Faculty Lounge at Columbia University and helped in redesigning the Swiss Embassy in Washington.         She was twice president of the Decorators Club of New York.         Her husband, Harold A. Reitz, died in 1976. She is survived by a sister, Amy Nell Hayes, also of Hightstown.       
         Myra Pollack Sadker, a Washington educator and writer who charted sexual bias in the nation's classrooms, died on Saturday at Georgetown Medical Center. She was 52 and lived in Bethesda, Md.         The cause was complications from a bone marrow transplant for breast cancer, said a spokesman for American University, where she was a professor and former dean of the school of education.         Dr. Sadker's most recent work was "Failing at Fairness: How America's Schools Cheat Girls" (Scribners, 1994). It was written in collaboration with her husband, David M. Sadker, a fellow professor at American's school of education. The couple had first studied the subject of sexual bias when they were graduate students together.         With a decade's worth of research, "Failing at Fairness" sought to document that girls' educations were inferior to those of boys. The reason, the authors concluded, was the conscious or subconscious sexism of teachers who spend more time interacting with boys.         Teachers, according to the book, call on boys more, make more substantive comments on their work, and praise and goad them more. The result is that over time girls tend to lose self-esteem and do more poorly in standardized tests.         Dr. Sadker's research was widely reported in newspapers and magazines around the country. It also led to many invitations for her to appear on national television and radio programs.         Myra Pollack Sadker was born in Portland, Me., and graduated from Boston University. She received a master's degree at Harvard University and a doctorate in education at the University of Massachusetts. She taught at junior and senior high schools in Massachusetts and Thailand before joining the faculty of American University in 1973.         In graduate school, the Sadkers noticed that there seemed to be subtle differences in the education they received in the same classrooms and studying the same books. The experience started them in their career as a husband-and-wife team examining sexual bias in schools through research based on transcripts of classroom interactions, textbooks, surveys and polls.         Dr. Sadker was the author or co-author of six books and scores of articles on sexism, teacher education and children's books. Her work was recognized this year with the Eleanor Roosevelt Award of the American Association of University Women.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Sadker is survived by two daughters, Robin and Jacqueline; a brother, Dr. Murray Pollack of Potomac, Md., and her father, Louis Pollack of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Vivian Verdell Gordon, who wrote about feminism, black families and affirmative action and who was a professor of black studies at the State University at Albany, died on Wednesday at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. She was 60 and lived in Albany.         The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, said a friend, Lois Smith Owens.         She was the author of 10 books and several articles, a former chairwoman of the department of Africana studies at the university and a poet. Her collection "Dark Women and Others" (Lotus Press, 1983) was published under the name Satiafa.         Born in Washington, she received an undergraduate degree from Virginia State University in 1955, a master's degree in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1957 and a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Virginia in 1974.         In the 1960's, she worked in Washington for the Library of Congress and the House Committee on Education and Labor. She also worked with the Women's Christian Alliance Child Welfare Agency and the Upward Bound Project in California before she began teaching at the University of Virginia in 1971. She was head of the university's black studies program from 1974 to 1979.         Her book "Black Women, Feminism and Black Liberation" (Third World Press, 1985) described the conflict that black women face over the issues of feminism and racism.         Her marriage to Ronald Gordon ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Ronald Jr., of Atlanta; a brother, Thomas, and a daughter, Susan Akkad, both of New York City.       
         Berenice Bramson, a soprano who received critical acclaim throughout her career, died on Thursday at her home in Katonah, N.Y. She was 65.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bramson was a native of Omaha. She studied at the Juilliard School of Music and Columbia University before making her solo debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in 1953. In a review for The New York Times, Ross Parmenter wrote that Ms. Bramson had provided "an absorbing evening of music" and that she "sang with distinction."         Twenty years later, after another recital, Peter G. Davis wrote in The Times: "Very rarely does an unheralded singer stand comparison with international superstars. Berenice Bramson can match talents with any soprano recitalist before the public today."         Ms. Bramson made her operatic debut in 1976 as Lisa in Tchaikovsky's "Queens of Spades" with the Vancouver Opera Company. She also appeared with the New York Grand Opera and the Brooklyn Opera Company. For more than 40 years, she taught voice at her studio in Katonah and several colleges. She gave her last solo recital in New York at Weill Recital Hall in 1989.         She is survived by her husband, Alan; a daughter, Bobbe Dodge of Ossining, N.Y.; a son, Steven of Los Angeles, and two sisters, Belle Lipsett of Kensington, Calif., and Pearl Jacobson of Davis, Calif.       
         Dr. Lorella Margaret Jones, a science educator and physicist known for her work in theoretical high-energy physics, died on Feb. 9 in a nursing home in Champaign, Ill. She was 51 and lived in Urbana, Ill.         The cause was cancer, said colleagues at the physics department at the University of Illinois, where Dr. Jones was active as a professor of physics until a month ago.         Dr. Jones served as director of the university's computer-based Education Research Laboratory from 1992 until last year. Her research centered on the experimental results involving the force holding together nuclear particles and the little bundles of energy called quarks.         She was born in Toronto, the daughter of an astronomer and an industrial physicist. She earned a degree in mathematics at Harvard College and received her doctorate in physics at the California Institute of Technology.         Aside from research sabbaticals in Britain, Germany, Japan and Tasmania, she spent her academic career at the University of Illinois. She joined the faculty as an assistant professor in 1968 and became a tenured professor in 1978.         Her research resulted in 64 published papers. As a teacher, she also promoted the innovative use of computers in physics education and helped to develop computerized quizzes for elementary physics courses.         Dr. Jones is survived by her parents, Donald and Shirley Jones of Urbana, and a sister, Irene Jones of Livermore, Calif.       
         Isabel Wilder, a novelist and a sister of the author and playwright Thornton Wilder, died last Monday at her home in Hamden, Conn. She was 95.         Miss Wilder published three novels in the 1930's: "Mother and Four" (1933), "Heart Be Still" (1934) and "Let Winter Go" (1937). In later years, she contributed introductions to several of her brother's posthumously published works, including "The Alcestiad" (1977), "American Characteristics and Other Essays" (1979) and "The Journals of Thornton Wilder 1939-1961" (1985), selected and edited by Donald Gallup of Yale University.         In 1978, Miss Wilder provided funds to establish an annual prize through the Columbia University Translation Center for distinguished foreign translations of American literature. In 1993, the university renamed the center the Wilder Translation Center for Arts and Education.         She also established the Thornton Wilder endowed writing prize in 1987 for talented high school students around New Haven.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Norma Fields Furst, the president of Baltimore Hebrew University for the last three years, died on March 7 at her home in Wynnewood, Pa. She was 64.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         She was associated with Temple University from 1963 to 1983 in various positions, including full professor and finally dean of student affairs. She then was president of Harcum Junior College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., before joining Baltimore Hebrew in 1992.         She was active in many national and local organizations, including International B'nai B'rith/Hillel Commission, the Jewish Publication Society, and the American Association of University Women.         A native of Brooklyn, Dr. Furst was a graduate of Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree in education and a doctorate in educational psychology at Temple.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. M. Lawrence Furst; a son, Merrick, of Pittsburgh; a daughter, Laura F. Jacobs of Merion, Pa.; her mother, Anne Platzer of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.       
         Ludmilla B. Turkevich, an expert in Russian language and literature who was the first woman to teach at Princeton and then spent 18 years as chairwoman of the Russian department at Douglass College of Rutgers University, died on Friday at the Princeton Medical Center. She was 85 and lived at the Monroe retirement village in Jamesburg, N.J.         Her family said the cause of death was respiratory failure.         She had the academic credentials, including degrees from New York University and Bryn Mawr and a doctorate from Columbia. She had been speaking and reading Russian with an informed passion since she was a child and had added Spanish as a sub-specialty. And she had experience as a teacher at the University of Kansas and at Douglass College, in New Brunswick, N.J.         Yet if there had not been a war on in 1944, and if Princeton had not found itself without a single Russian teacher at a time when there was a sudden, almost panicky upsurge in interest in the Soviet Union, it is doubtful that the university would have allowed the former Ludmilla Buketoff of New Britain, Conn., to be more than a faculty wife, the bride of John Turkevich, a professor of chemistry.         Even after Princeton did allow her on the faculty in 1944, the university, which would wait a quarter-century more before admitting women as students, insisted on maintaining a certain distinction. During the 17 years Mrs. Turkevich taught Russian and Spanish literature and a popular course on the modern European novel, she was relegated to the position of lecturer, subject to annual contract renewals.         When Rutgers offered in 1961 to make her a full professor at Douglass, its women's division, she accepted, and spent the next 18 years dazzling students like her own daughter, Tamar Skvir, who recalled her mother yesterday as a mesmerizing lecturer who made Pushkin, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy come alive.         Professor Turkevich, who also held research positions at the Institute for Advanced Study and the Center for Theological Inquiry at Princeton and served as the president of the American Association of Teachers of Slavic and Eastern European Languages, wrote widely on Russian literature.         Her books include "Cervantes in Russia" (1950), "Masterpieces in Russian Literature" (1964) and "Spanish Literature in Russia and the Soviet Union 1735-1964" (1967).         She and her husband were also instrumental in the translation and publication of the "Guide to Russian Scientific Literature" in the 1940's and wrote the textbook "Russian for the Scientist" (1959).         Professor Turkevich also served as a specialist in American education at the United States exhibit in Moscow in 1959.         In addition to her husband and her daughter Tamar, she is survived by another daughter, Marina Naumann of Norwich, Vt., and four grandchildren.       
         Pauline Ames Plimpton, who had a late-blooming career as a writer that startled but not did not surprise her famous literary offspring, George Plimpton, died yesterday at her home in New York City. She was 93.         Her family said the cause was circulatory illness.         As the daughter, wife and mother of famous men, Mrs. Plimpton spent most of her life in the shadow of her father, Oakes Ames, the Harvard botanist; her husband, Francis T. P. Plimpton, the lawyer and diplomat, who died in 1983, and her son, George, the multifaceted editor of The Paris Review.         But at the age of 79, as her son put it yesterday, "she suddenly came out from underneath," and started writing books, concentrating, appropriately enough for a novice writer, on what she knew best: her family.         Among the eight books she turned out over the next dozen years was one about her father: "Oakes Ames, Jottings of a Harvard Botanist," (Botanical Museum of Harvard, 1979); one about her husband: "The Plimpton Papers, Law and Diplomacy" (University Press of America, 1985) and even one about her father-in-law, a wide-ranging literary collector: "A Collector's Recollections, George Arthur Plimpton" (Columbia University Library, 1992).         Mr. Plimpton said he had not been surprised at his mother's literary emergence.         "As a young girl," he said, "she kept wonderful diaries."         Mrs. Plimpton, a graduate of Smith College, also served on the boards of Planned Parenthood, the Institute for World Affairs and the Public Education Association.         In addition to George, she is survived by two other sons, Francis T. P. Plimpton Jr. of Ormond Beach, Fla. and Oakes A. Plimpton of Boston; a daughter, Sarah Plimpton of New York; a brother, Amyas Ames of Syosset, L.I., seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren.       
         Pauline Ames Plimpton, who had a late-blooming career as a writer that startled but not did not surprise her famous literary offspring, George Plimpton, died on Saturday at her home in New York City.

         Bernice Levy Rudnick, a philanthropist active with organizations in New York City and in Palm Beach, Fla., died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 and also lived in Palm Beach.         The cause was cancer, according to a spokeswoman for Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Yeshiva University, which her family had long supported.         She and her husband, Cecil N. Rudnick, financed laboratories for research on Alzheimer's disease at the medical school and a meditation chapel at the college's Jack D. Weiler Hospital in the Bronx. At her death, she was vice chairman of the board at Albert Einstein.         Mrs. Rudnick was born in Manhattan and graduated from Wellesley College, where she remained active in alumni programs.         In addition to her husband of 57 years, Mrs. Rudnick is survived by two sons, David, of Palm Beach, and Andrew, of Buffalo, and two grandchildren.       
         Mary Bingham, the matriarch of the Bingham newspaper empire, died suddenly in Louisville, Ky., on Tuesday evening. She was 90 and lived in Glenview, 15 minutes outside Louisville, on the family estate.         Mrs. Bingham, a philanthropist and civic leader and the widow of Barry Bingham Sr., was delivering a speech at a dinner in her honor when she collapsed. She was pronounced dead of cardiac arrest at Norton Hospital.         At the dinner at the Hyatt Regency hotel to raise money for the de Paul School in Louisville, Mrs. Bingham had been toasted by Gov. Brereton Jones; Jon Jory, artistic director of the Actors Theater of Louisville; other Kentucky dignitaries, and her daughter Eleanor Bingham Miller.         Before delivering her prepared speech, Mrs. Bingham said she was so flattered by the event that "the best thing would be for a big pink cloud to come down and take me away." She then spoke about the need for civic responsibility and asked for support of the Louisville Free Public Library.         In the part of her talk that remained undelivered, she quoted Pericles as saying that an Athenian "who did not acquaint himself with and took no part in public affairs was regarded not as unambitious, but as a man of no consequence whatever."         All her life, she was a most enthusiastic participant in public and cultural affairs. Governor Jones said that with Mrs. Bingham's death, "Kentucky has lost one of its most caring and productive citizens."         A distinguished, articulate woman, Mrs. Bingham was for more than 60 years a major presence on the Louisville scene. Mr. and Mrs. Bingham, always known as "the Binghams," were great hosts, especially at Kentucky Derby time, when their invitations were among the most coveted.         Together with Mr. Bingham, who died in 1988, Mrs. Bingham was a generous supporter of the arts and of educational and social programs. She was a strong environmentalist and also led a drive to send book mobiles to rural Kentucky.         After her husband died, she took over as the head of the family foundation, the Mary and Barry Bingham Sr. Fund, which gave $59 million to a wide variety of institutions. Last fall, the Actors Theater of Louisville opened the Bingham Theater. The beneficence of the Binghams is one reason Louisville is such a prosperous cultural community.         In 1986, a bitter family conflict engulfed the Binghams, leading to the sale of their media empire, the cornerstone of which was The Louisville Courier-Journal, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper known for its liberal politics and socially conscious positions. Barry Bingham Sr. had been publisher of the newspaper after his father, Robert Bingham, and, in turn, he had been succeeded by his son Barry Bingham Jr.         After Barry Bingham Jr. and his sisters, Eleanor and Sallie Bingham, were locked in a feud over control of the company, Barry Bingham Sr. decided to sell. The battle and the sale of the paper to the Gannett chain became front-page news throughout the country. Later, several books were written about the conflict and the family itself, including a memoir by Sallie that was critical of her parents.         Behind the scenes, Mrs. Bingham had been a force at the newspaper. She was a vice president and director and wrote editorials while her husband was overseas during World War II. For 26 years, until 1968, she was the editor of the book review section.         Mrs. Bingham was born Mary Caperton on Dec. 24, 1904, in Richmond, and as a young woman, she acted with Richmond's Little Theater. It was while she was a classics major at Radcliffe College that she met her husband, then a student at Harvard University. They were both involved in collegiate dramatics.         After graduating from Radcliffe in 1928, she spent a year studying in Greece on a fellowship. In 1931, she and Barry Bingham were married. They had five children, including two sons, Worth and Jonathan, who died in accidents.         The Binghams were active in Democratic politics and would, as Mrs. Bingham said, "get together with liberal friends on election night to listen to the results in sympathetic company."         When her son became publisher of the paper, he exchanged houses with his parents, as was the family tradition. The parents moved into the so-called Little House on the family estate, an Italianate villa where Mrs. Bingham continued to live after her husband's death.         In addition to her son and daughters, Mrs. Bingham is survived by six grandsons, four granddaughters and a great-granddaughter.       
         Maggie Kuhn, who called herself a little old woman and celebrated her forced retirement in 1970 by founding the Gray Panthers, died yesterday at the home she shared in Philadelphia with a like-minded coterie. She was 89.         "She died peacefully in her sleep," said her personal assistant, Sue Leary, who could not say which of Miss Kuhn's many ailments, from arthritis to osteoporosis, had caused her death.         For all Miss Kuhn's ailments, none had slowed her down. She spent the last 25 years leading people young and old in the fight against age discrimination and other forms of what she saw as social injustice and stereotypical thinking and just two weeks ago she had joined striking transit workers on their picket line.         Even so, there was some evidence that Miss Kuhn knew that the end was coming. Although she had made it her goal to live until her 90th birthday, in August, she had allowed her friends and admirers to celebrate it on April 1. And in a recent issue of the Gray Panthers' publication, The Network, she had lectured the organization's 40,000 members in 32 states on the need to prepare for the 21st century.         It was hardly the first time Miss Kuhn had been ahead of her time.         It was in 1970 that Miss Kuhn, who had worked 25 years for the United Presbyterian Church in New York, commuting daily from her home in Philadelphia, reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 and was forced to leave her job.         "They gave me a sewing machine," she once recalled, "but I never opened it. I was too busy."         Within months of her retirement, she joined several friends in founding an organization quickly dubbed the Gray Panthers, a name derived from the radical Black Panthers.         Despite the name and the initial emphasis on championing the elderly, as conceived by Miss Kuhn the organization knew no age boundaries. Its credo described it simply as an advocate for "fundamental social change that would eliminate injustice, discrimination and oppression in our present society."         For example, in addition to seeking a ban on mandatory retirement, which was eventually enacted into law, the group called for "publicly owned and democratically controlled" utilities.         No one who knew Miss Kuhn was surprised that in last year's health care debate her organization championed what was widely seen as the most radical of the various proposals: health insurance paid totally by the government, a position that had been on the Gray Panthers' official agenda since 1977.         A tiny woman who wore her hair in a prim bun that gave her the look of an ideal candidate to be helped across the street by a Boy Scout, Miss Kuhn, who detested the term "senior citizen," made no apologies for her looks or her age.         "I'm an old woman," she told The New York Times in 1972. "I have gray hair, many wrinkles and arthritis in both hands. And I celebrate my freedom from bureaucratic restraints that once held me."         Miss Kuhn, whose opposition to the war in Vietnam made her a hero to many young protesters, had a disarming argument in recruiting younger people to her cause: "Everyone of us is growing old."         Known as an inspirational speaker, Miss Kuhn was just as persuasive in private conversation, combining honey with the hammer.         "Forceful, yet gracious" is the way Miss Leary put it yesterday.         Miss Kuhn was a champion of social causes long before the Gray Panthers.         As she noted in her 1991 autobiography, "No Stone Unturned," (Ballantine) she was conceived in Memphis, where her father, a traveling district manage for Dunn & Bradstreet, was working at the time. But her mother, refusing to deliver a child into a racist society, insisted on returning to her home in Buffalo to give birth.         As a student at Flora Stone Mather College of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Miss Kuhn helped organize a college chapter of the League of Women Voters.         And in a succession of jobs as a manager of social programs for the Young Women's Christian Association in Cleveland, Philadelphia and Boston and in similar work with the Presbyterian Church in New York, Miss Kuhn took what were then unconventional positions on issues like peace and social justice.         Miss Kuhn, who could also be somewhat unconventional in her private life, attributed the fact that she had never married to "sheer luck."         According to her book, she had many love affairs, including one in her 70's with a student in his 20's. Miss Kuhn did not identify him, but Christina Long, who helped her with the book, said the man, now in his 40's, was at the recent birthday gala. "He seemed very proud of the romance," she said.         Miss Kuhn leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Marion Lounsbury Foster, who was for many years a social services administrator with the Disaster Staff of the American Red Cross, specializing in public and private emergencies, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, Conn.         She was 97 and a longtime resident of New York City.         Beginning in 1917, Mrs. Foster was for 40 years the director of the Home Service Department of the Red Cross's Brooklyn chapter, finding help in times of need for the families of men and women in the armed forces and aid for people in distress after floods, storms, train wrecks and much smaller crises.         In 1931, her office provided Easter dresses to wives of disabled World War I veterans. And in 1938, she directed case workers in aiding victims of a disastrous hurricane that struck Long Island, providing services and financial relief to thousands of families.         Mrs. Foster, who retired in 1957, was also a founder and treasurer of the Brooklyn Association for Mental Health.         She was born in New York City and graduated from the Brearley School, Columbia University and the New York School of Social Work.         Her husband, William Jenkins Foster, died in 1958. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Marion Burbank Stevens Rice, a noted teacher and producer of dance by the pioneering modern dancers Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, died on April 12 at the Highlands Long Term Care Center in Fitchburg, Mass.. She was 90 and lived in Ashby, Mass.         Mrs. Rice was known for the purity and vitality of her dancers and her dance restagings. She learned the Denishawn technique and most of the dances in the late 1920's and early 30's at the Braggiotti-Denishawn School of Dance in Boston, where she studied with Shawn and others. From 1929 through 1988, she was director of the Marion Rice Studio of the Dance in Fitchburg, Mass., and she continued to teach in the area after closing her school.         Mrs. Rice founded her own company, Marion Rice Denishawn Dancers, in the 1940's. The group gained widespread attention and critical praise in 1972 when it performed at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass. The company received even greater critical praise five years later when it performed in its New York City debut, featuring the 72-year-old Mrs. Rice in a St. Denis solo.         In 1980, Mrs. Rice was invited to stage her version of "Soaring," a 1920 dance created by St. Denis and Doris Humphry, for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montreal. The next year, the troupe participated in "The Early Years: American Modern Dance from 1900 through the 1930's," a festival organized by the State University of New York at Purchase. Mrs. Rice continued to teach until recently.         Mrs. Rice's husband, J. Parker Rice, died in 1965. She is survived by a daughter, Carolyn Brown of Millbrook, N.Y., a former lead dancer with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company; a son, J. Parker Rice Jr. of Ashburnham, Mass.; a sister, Elinor Stevens Cloutier of Ashburnham; three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Margaret Avery Rowell, a cellist who was one of the country's best-known teachers of the instrument, died on April 21 at Kaiser Medical Center in Oakland, Calif. She was 94 and lived in Berkeley, Calif.         The cause was pneumonia, said her daughter-in-law, Barbara Rowell.         Mrs. Rowell taught for 14 years at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and was on the faculties of the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, Mills College and San Francisco State University.         Among her former students are Paul Tobias, a faculty member of the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music, and Bonnie Hampton, the president of Chamber Music America and a member of the San Francisco Trio.         Her husband, Edward Z. Rowell, a speech and philosophy professor at the University of California, died in 1975. She is survived by a son, Galen, of Berkeley, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Holly Harp, the California designer who went from a Sunset Boulevard sensation to a darling of Fifth Avenue salons, died on Monday at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 55.         The cause of death was cancer, said her fiance, Mark Buchman.         Mrs. Harp, who captivated Hollywood with a rich hippie look in the 1960's and enthralled New York with soft clinging designs, was nominated for Coty awards two times.         But Mr. Buchman said on Friday in reporting her death that Mrs. Harp once described herself as a "counterculturalist," an apt description for a woman who began her career translating the clothes of the flower children into fashion for counterculture heroines.         When rock stars like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick began exchanging jeans for Mrs. Harp's fringed vests and tie-dyed velvet dresses, the Holly's Harp shop that she opened on Sunset Boulevard in 1968 became the center of a new style.         Her husband at the time, Jim, described the fashions, which included painted jersey, silk and chiffon dresses, and hip-hugger bell bottoms made from old draperies, as "somewhere between here and Mars."         Mrs. Harp came down to earth a bit after 1973, when she began selling to Fifth Avenue stores like Henri Bendel and Bergdorf Goodman, whose fourth-floor Holly Harp shop showed her latest collection of $1,500 evening dresses three weeks ago.         But for all their initial counterculture flamboyance, the designs from the beginning included soft flowing chiffon dresses. Mrs. Harp had a disarming explanation for how she achieved that soft romantic look. "I took the construction out," she said.         For all the comparative elegance of her sensuous body-hugging evening dresses, Mrs. Harp's designs always had an edge, sometimes literally. In 1977, when one bright red creation reminded her of a flame, she proceeded to enhance the effect, taking a blowtorch and charring the garment's edges.         "I'm not trying to do tasteful little uniforms," she said in 1988. "Being dressed in perfect taste is very aging."         Mrs. Harp, a size 6 who designed for her own 5-foot-4-inch frame, had no patience for the presumed restrictions of age. As she put it when she appeared at an interview at the age of 47 wearing a short lame dress with glitter hose: "I still have a sexy little girl in me that won't quit."         Mrs. Harp was born in Buffalo and studied design at North Texas State University, where she met and married Mr. Harp, an English instructor. Her boutique became such a success that he abandoned his academic career. They divorced in 1980, but remained business partners.         Surviving are a son, Tom, of Los Angeles; two sisters, Sarah Bozzola of Orange, Conn., and Elizabeth Horn of Buffalo, and a brother, Thomas Speller of Buffalo.       
         Vita R. Ostrander, a former president of the American Association of Retired Persons who helped make the health care system a major national issue a decade before last year's debate on overhauling it, died on Tuesday at Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta. She was 72 and lived in suburban Decatur.         Her family said she had a heart attack while recovering from back surgery.         Mrs. Ostrander was a member of the A.A.R.P.'s board from 1976 to 1988 and its president for two of those years, 1984-86. She had earned those unpaid positions through her volunteer work in Georgia as an advocate for the elderly, and during her dozen years on the board gained a reputation as an effective advocate both inside and outside the huge organization, which now claims 33 million members.         "She really brought us into health care," the current president, Eugene Lehrmann, said yesterday, recalling that she had often built support for her views even as she formed them, in informal chats with fellow board members.         When the association, under her prodding, spoke out in favor of fee controls and a combination of private insurance and Government subsidies to pay for prescription drugs and catastrophic illnesses, it was often Mrs. Ostrander who did the speaking.         In an organization that likes to precycle as well as recycle its executive talent, Mrs. Ostrander was a representative at news conferences during her two years as president-elect, testified at Congressional hearings during her two years as president and continued to speak out during her two years as "immediate past president," an official association position.         Not one to shrink from confrontation, she once told a meeting of the American Medical Association that high costs had created a form of rationing of health care. And when she served on a Federal advisory panel that made only a vague reference to a need for Government subsidies in a report stressing the role of private insurance in protecting Americans against catastrophic medical costs, Mrs. Ostrander issued a stinging dissent, chiding her fellow panelists for obscuring a need for Government participation.         A native of Utica, N.Y., where her father operated a bakery, Mrs. Ostrander, whose maiden name was Romano, received a nursing degree from the University of Buffalo and spent 10 years as a Red Cross executive before settling in Atlanta and becoming a full-time volunteer on issues involving the elderly.         She is survived by her husband, Gladding, a retired Red Cross executive; a daughter, Sylvia Lucas of Columbia, S.C., and three grandchildren.       
         Judith A. Goldman, who was long active in Jewish cultural, philanthropic and environmental causes, died yesterday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         The cause of death was cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Goldman was the president of the sisterhood of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue and the chairwoman of the book and author series of UJA-Federation of New York.         In 1977 she co-founded the Council for a Beautiful Israel, an environmental group, with Ora Herzog, a former First Lady of Israel.         Mrs. Goldman was also active in the women's division of the American Technion Society and the Yeshiva University women's organization.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jacob E. Goldman; a brother, Rabbi Burton Mehler of the Bronx; three sisters, Jean Kelman of Queens and Gloria Mehler and Mindella Lamm of Manhattan; three sons, Shalom L., of East Thetford, Vt., and Ari L. and Dov E., of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.         She is also survived by three stepchildren, Melvin Goldman of Chevy Chase, Md., Edith Goldman-Hoffman of Brookline, Mass., and Beth Goldman of Manhattan.         Correction:  May 3, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary on Sunday about Judith A. Goldman, who was long active in Jewish cultural and philanthropic causes, misspelled the given name of a former First Lady of Israel with whom she founded an environmental group. The former First Lady is Aura Herzog, not Ora.       
         Janet Mathews Fitchen, a cultural anthropologist who studied rural poverty in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 58.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         Dr. Fitchen brought the eye of an anthropologist and her profession's ethnographic methodology to the field of rural sociology. A professor of anthropology, she was the chairwoman of the department of anthropology at Ithaca College.         She wrote "Poverty in Rural America: A Case Study" (Westview, 1981), which surveyed pockets of poverty in the vast stretches of forests and fields of upstate New York. "I call it northern Appalachia," she told a reporter in 1984. "It is poverty that has been entrenched."         Her latest book was "Endangered Spaces, Enduring Places: Change, Identity and Survival in Rural America" (Westview, 1991). It chronicled the demographic, social, cultural, economic and agricultural changes transforming the Northeast. Both books are in print.         More recently, she researched poverty in other regions as an associate of the Western Rural Development Center in Corvallis, Ore. She had accepted a faculty appointment in the department of rural sociology at Cornell University and had planned to leave Ithaca College, where she had been a faculty member since 1977, at the end of the semester.         Dr. Fitchen was born in Manhattan but grew up on her family's dairy farm in Brewster, attending a one-room school.

         Ellen Hermanson, a crusader in the battle against breast cancer, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 42 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         The disease was diagnosed in Ms. Hermanson in 1989, six months after the birth of her only daughter, Leora. She became actively involved in breast cancer issues by organizing survivor groups and speaking at national conferences and regional workshops.         Last November, Ms. Hermanson delivered a paper on the struggle to live with cancer pain to the annual National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship assembly in Washington. It was at this assembly that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the United States Supreme Court spoke for the first time about her own experience with breast cancer.         In 1991, Ms. Hermanson helped found the Jewish Healing Center in New York, an organization that provides spiritual assistance to people coping with serious illnesses. As editor of the center's quarterly newsletter, The Out-Stretched Arm, Ms. Hermanson published articles on breast cancer, support groups and health-care workshops. The center now has offices in New York and San Francisco.         In 1992, Judith Kaye, Chief Judge of New York State, appointed Ms. Hermanson the first executive director of the Judges and Lawyers Breast Cancer Alert. The group promotes breast cancer awareness and provides education and legal services.         Ms. Hermanson was also an active member of the national board of the National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship, which provides support to cancer survivors, their friends and families and health care providers. She edited the coalition's quarterly newsletter, Networker.         Ms. Hermanson was most recently working on a project to let breast cancer survivors and their families communicate over the Internet. She was also editor of the Sloan-Kettering Annual Report.         Ms. Hermanson was born in Belmont, Mass., in 1952. She graduated from Connecticut College with honors in 1974 and received a master's degree in journalism from New York University in 1978.         She is survived by her husband, Hugo Mareno and her daughter of Manhattan; her parents, Harlow and Roslyn Hermanson of Belmont, and two sisters, Emily Hermanson Levin of Great Neck, L.I., and Julie Hermanson Ratner of New York City.         Correction:  April 13, 1995, Thursday         An obituary yesterday about Ellen Hermanson, an advocate for survivors of breast cancer, misspelled her husband's name. He is Hugo Moreno, not Mareno. The obituary also misstated her residence. She lived in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The article also misstated the name of a group whose board she served on. It is the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, not the National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship.
