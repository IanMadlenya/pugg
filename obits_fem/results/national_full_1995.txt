         Lola Flores, one of Spain's most popular singers and the star of many film musicals of the 1950's and 60's, died today at her home outside Madrid. She was 72.         She died after a long struggle with breast cancer, her family said.         Her body was transferred to the Villa Cultural Center here to lie in state, as thousands of mourners stood in line to pay their last respects.         Known as "Lola of Spain," or "The Pharaohness" after a role she played in one of her films, Miss Flores came to represent popular flamenco and Spanish folk singing for generations of Spaniards and millions of fans in Latin America. In a message of condolence to her family, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia said, "Spain has lost one of the greatest artists of this century."         Dolores Flores Ruiz was born in 1923 in the southwestern Andalusian town of Jerez de la Frontera. At age 10, she began to sing in local bars and taverns. She won national fame in the 1940's, singing with the popular flamenco artist Manolo Caracol, and landed her first film contract at 17.         She is best remembered for playing ethnic dancing and singing roles, and was often cast as a gypsy or a Mexican peasant. Her most famous films were "Estrella de la Sierra Morena" ("Star of Sierra Morena") of 1952 and "Maria de la O" (1958).         Miss Flores was convicted for tax fraud in 1991, fined 14 million pesetas ($112,000) and sentenced to 16 months in prison, but was released on probation. ("I don't understand about paperwork," she said in her own defense.) Last year the Spanish Government awarded her a gold medal for her life's work.         She is survived by her husband, Antonio Gonzalez, a gypsy flamenco guitarist; two daughters, and a son.       
         Atlanta Constance Sampson, a painter who had her first one-woman show in New York at the age of 91, died on Thursday at a nursing home in St. Ansgar, Iowa. She was 98 and lived in Toeterville, Iowa.         Miss Sampson was born on a farm in Lyle, Minn., where she began painting watercolors as a child. After earning a degree in art education from the University of Minnesota, she taught in the Detroit public schools and exhibited her watercolors of flowers, birds and city streets in group shows, mostly in and around Detroit. In 1952, she won first prize at the Chicago International Watercolor Show.         In 1954, she moved to New York City, where she studied at the Art Students League with Theodore Stamos. She also studied with Hans Hofmann in Provincetown, Mass. In the 1960's, she began making Color Field abstractions using acrylic and oils.         Miss Sampson was discovered in 1987 when Owen Ryan, a management consultant, saw one of her paintings in the window of a Lexington Avenue delicatessen and offered to buy it. The owner introduced him to the artist, who invited him to look at the hundreds of artworks that filled her tiny apartment on East 61st Street. She had been preparing her return to Iowa, discouraged by her decades of poverty and obscurity.         Mr. Ryan organized a comprehensive show of Miss Sampson's work that was presented at the National Arts Club in Manhattan in 1988. In 1992 an exhibition devoted to her life and work was held in the rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building in Washington. Later that year she was given a second show at the National Arts Club.         "It was just as necessary as eating or sleeping for me to paint," Miss Sampson said in a newspaper interview in 1988. "It was an obsession all my life."         She is survived by a sister, Myrtella Langrock of Toeterville.       
         Vivian Cadden, a New York writer and magazine editor, died on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cardiovascular disease, her family said.         A former senior editor of Redbook and McCall's magazines, she became the founding editor of Working Mother in 1978. She retired as its editor in 1990 but continued to write for the magazine.         She contributed to publications including Life, The Nation, Mademoiselle and Parents. Her articles often dealt with political matters, and she interviewed national and international figures.         She was born in the Bronx, graduated from Vassar College in 1938 and studied economics at Columbia University.         Her husband, Joseph E. Cadden, died in 1980. She is survived by two daughters, Joan, of Gambier, Ohio, and Wendy, of Falls Creek, N.M.; a son, Frank, of Manhattan; a brother, Bernard Liebman, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and one grandson.       
         Margaret Chase Smith, a flinty, independent Maine Republican who made history as the first woman to win election to both houses of Congress and the first whose name was advanced for the Presidency at a national convention, died yesterday at at her home in Skowhegan, Me. She was 97 years old.         A spokeswoman from the Margaret Chase Smith Library in Skowhegan said she had died of complications from a stroke eight days earlier that had left her in a coma.         A red rose was Mrs. Smith's trademark, a stalwart conscience, her beacon. She was known as the "conscience of the Senate."         In four terms in the House, from 1941 to 1949, then four in the Senate through 1975, Mrs. Smith won friends and earned foes across a wide political spectrum. She could number among her enemies such polar opposites as the Communist-hunting Joseph R. McCarthy and the leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita S. Khrushchev. The formidable Mr. McCarthy referred sneeringly to Mrs. Smith as a "Snow White," and Mr. Khrushchev saw her as "the devil in the disguise of a woman."         Mrs. Smith said her life in politics was her only life. "I have no family, no time-consuming hobbies," she said late in her Senate career. "I have only myself and my job as United States Senator."         But she also had a sense of humor.  In 1952, when asked by a reporter what she would do if she woke up one morning and found herself in the White House, she replied: "I'd go straight to Mrs. Truman and apologize. Then I'd go home."         Though Mrs. Smith seemed to many people a champion of women's rights, she said she did not regard herself as a feminist. "I was treated fairly in the Senate, not because of equal rights but because of seniority," she said in a 1975 interview.         In her dedication to her work, she answered 2,941 consecutive Senate roll-calls, a series broken only when she underwent a hip operation in 1968. In time, she became the ranking Republican on the Armed Services and Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committees, and served as well on the Appropriations Committee.         Never anything but a Republican, Mrs. Smith was hardly the dyed-in-the-wool variety. Party regulars could never take her vote for granted. She voted as she saw fit.         In the 1950's, Mrs. Smith alienated McCarthy by joining with six other Republican senators in making a "declaration of conscience" in which she took the measure of McCarthy's sensationalist, inquisitorial methods in trying to suppress Communism.  "I don't want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the four horseman of calumny -- fear, ignorance, bigotry and smear," Mrs. Smith said. McCarthy responded by referring to her and the six other senators as "Snow White and the Six Dwarfs."         Khrushchev was understandably restrained when Mrs. Smith, a consistent advocate of a strong military, criticized President John F. Kennedy because she thought he lacked the will to use nuclear weapons and concluded that such restraint weakened America's struggle against the Soviet Union. When Mr. Khrushchev heard of Mrs. Smith's stance, he said he thought it had beaten "all records of savagery."         But Mrs. Smith replied: "Mr. Khrushchev isn't really mad at me. I am not that important. He is angry because American officials have grown more firm since my speech."         Shortly before his assassination, President Kennedy called Mrs. Smith a "formidable political figure" against whom he would not like to campaign. The morning after his death, she went into the Senate chamber before it convened and laid a red rose on Kennedy's old desk.         As a member of Congress she supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, much to the dismay of her more conservative colleagues. Over the years, she angered fellow Republicans by supporting Federal aid to education in 1948, by voting against Lewis L. Strauss, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's nominee for Secretary of Commerce in 1959, and by opposing President Richard M. Nixon's unsuccessful nominees to the Supreme Court, Clement F. Haynsworth in 1969 and G. Harrold Carswell in 1970.         She was a strong supporter of civil rights and, again irritating some Republican colleagues, an early advocate of Government-financed medical care for the elderly.         Margaret Madeline Chase was born on Dec. 14, 1897, in Skowhegan on the Kennebec River in central Maine. Her father, George Emery Chase, was the town barber and her mother was the former Carrie Murray.         As the eldest of six children in a family of modest means, Margaret was expected to work -- and that she did even as a schoolgirl; she was skillful enough to shave her father's customers when he was busy or away from the shop.         After graduating from Skowhegan High School in 1916, she held jobs for which a college education was not always required: telephone operator, circulation manager for a weekly newspaper, grade-school teacher and eventually a woolen mill executive.         In 1930, at the age of 32, she married Clyde H. Smith, who was 22 years her senior and co-owner of the local newspaper. Mr. Smith, who was prominent in local Republican circles, ran for office and in 1937 was elected Representative from Maine's Second Congressional District.         In 1940, seriously ill after suffering a heart attack, Mr. Smith asked Maine voters to continue his policies by electing his wife to succeed him. After his death, she was chosen to fill his unexpired term in a special election and was elected in her own right later that year.         In 1948 Mrs. Smith entered the Republican senatorial primary and received more votes than her three male opponents combined. In the general election she easily defeated her Democratic rival, Dr. Adrian Scolten.         She said she considered taking her maiden name back after her husband's death, adding: "My name was Chase. It's a good New England name. I liked it. But legally I was Smith."         She quickly grew in stature as a senator and was mentioned as a Vice Presidential candidate in 1952 and again in 1968. In 1964 Mrs. Smith announced her candidacy for President and ran in the New Hampshire primary that year. She drew more than a dozen votes at the Republican National Convention, which was controlled by the conservative forces backing Barry Goldwater.         She seemed unstopable until 1972, when William D. Hathaway, a 48-year-old Democrat and former member of Congress, defeated her in her campaign for a fifth Senate term. She was 74 at the time and seemed increasingly frail, riding the Capitol corridors on a small yellow cart and carrying a cane. There were rumors that her health was fragile, but she remained robust for many years.         In her later years she was no less independent but grew weary and wary of militants.         In 1970, 20 years after she had denounced McCarthy's scare tactics, she said that those on the radical left who advocated violence were easily the equal to the menace she had perceived from the radical right two decades earlier. "We had a national sickness then from which we recovered," she said. "We have a national sickness now from which I pray we will recover."         But, true to form, she also attacked those in the Government who, she believed, had overreacted to the anti-war demonstrators.         Mrs. Smith did not remarry after the death of her husband. She is survived by a sister, Evelyn Williams of Skowhegan, and several nieces and nephews.       
         Ann M. Lingg, who wrote articles and books about music and musicians, died on Tuesday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Lingg, who was born in Austria and earned a doctoral degree in musicology in Vienna, moved to New York City in 1938. In the 1940's and 50's she wrote about music for a number of national magazines. She was also the author of several books about musicians, including "Mozart" (1946) and "Mephisto Waltz: The Story of Franz Liszt" (1951) and, for younger readers, "John Philip Sousa" (1955). She collaborated with Ruth Slenczynska, a pianist, on "Music at Your Fingertips" (1961), a book of practical advice for young musicians. She was also a frequent contributor to Opera News magazine and to Aria, a publication of the Metropolitan Opera Guild.         Ms. Lingg's husband, Erwin C. Lessner, died in 1959.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Alice Manheim Kaplan, an art collector and a leading supporter of the arts in New York City, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Mrs. Kaplan was involved with New York City civic groups and with many museums throughout her life. In 1982 she received the Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture.         She was born in Budapest in 1903, and two years later her family moved to New York City, where she grew up. She attended Teachers College of Columbia University but left school to marry in 1925. Years later, she resumed her studies and received a master's degree in art history from Columbia University when she was 63.         For 10 years, from 1967 to 1977, she was the president of the American Federation of the Arts, where she developed many traveling exhibitions and produced an educational film, "The Art of Seeing." She also served on many boards, including those of the Museum of American Folk Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.         She headed the advisory council for the department of art and archeology at Columbia University. She was also a member of the visiting committee of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University and served on visiting committees at the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was on a committee to save Cooper Union Museum, now the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum.         With her husband, J. M. Kaplan, a financier who founded the J. M. Kaplan Fund in 1945, she was instrumental in the campaign to save Carnegie Hall when it was threatened with demolition in 1960. She was married to Mr. Kaplan for 62 years, until his death in 1987.         Although she insisted throughout her life that she wasn't a collector, Mrs. Kaplan was known for her extraordinary eye and flair. She often bought artworks before the artists were discovered.         On one occasion, browsing through an antique shop, she spotted a neo-classical drawing and bought it for $200. When she returned home and began researching the drawing, she discovered it was a long-lost preliminary study for Jacques Louis David's "Oath of the Horatii," which hangs in the Louvre.         Mrs. Kaplan also bought works by artists like the American painter Ammi Phillips and the Austrian artist Egon Schiele before they were well known. She discovered Schiele's work quite by accident. When she got off the elevator of the Fuller Building on the wrong floor one afternoon, she spotted some drawings by the artist, which she promptly bought. "That's how the collection grew," she once said. "Often the result of chance and circumstance rather than a systematic approach."         Mrs. Kaplan was known for her great style as a hostess, entertaining at her homes in New York City and East Hampton, L.I. In her spare time she was also a portrait painter and pianist.         She is survived by two brothers, Paul E. Manheim of New York City and Frank J. Manheim of London; a sister, Louise Espy of Manhattan; three daughters, the former State Parks Commissioner Joan K. Davidson, Elizabeth K. Fonseca and Mary E. Kaplan, all of Manhattan; a son, Richard D. Kaplan of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Rochelle Pittman, whose legal battle in a tainted blood scandal led to a continuing national inquiry into the state of Canada's blood supplies, died Wednesday at her home in Toronto. She was 57.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said her son Tom Pittman.         Mrs. Pittman is credited with putting a human face on the struggle for redress waged by the more than 1,000 people in Canada who contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through tainted blood and blood products.         "She made a difference in a lot of people's lives," said her lawyer, Ken Arenson. "She got calls from perfect strangers asking her how to deal with this  or that problem."         Her husband, Ken Pittman, a store chain executive, died in 1990 of H.I.V.-related pneumonia without knowing he was infected. He had received a tainted transfusion after cardiac surgery at Toronto General Hospital in 1984.         Dr. Stanley Bain, the family doctor, knew that Mr. Pittman was infected, but  never told the couple because, as the doctor later testified, he feared the information would send Mr. Pittman into a depression. He also said he had mistakenly believed that the couple was no longer having sex.         Five months after her husband died, Mrs. Pittman, who had worked as a jewelry saleswoman in Toronto, was told she also had the virus.         At a news conference in January 1992 at the Ontario legislature, Mrs. Pittman, a tiny, stylish, retiring woman, announced the start of what became a rocky three-year legal battle for redress.         In March last year an Ontario judge awarded her $375,000 in compensation. Dr. Bain, a former President of the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons, was  held 40 percent liable. The Canadian Red Cross and Toronto General Hospital split the remaining amount equally.         In addition, the same institution Dr. Bain had headed found him guilty of misconduct and suspended him from the practice of medicine for two months.         In her decision, an Ontario judge, Susan Lang, wrote that had Mr. Pittman been told, he might have lived two more years and avoided infecting Mrs. Pittman.         For Canada it was a heart-wrenching story, followed in all its intricate twists on newspaper front pages and on national television. At a news conference at the time of the award, Mrs. Pittman observed that while she was happy with the judgment, "No amount of money can compensate me and my family for the loss of a husband and a father. Nor will it change the fact that I will likely experience the same fate."         Her son Tom said that over the last four to six weeks her health went into a  significant decline. "Last Thursday she announced she didn't want to fight any longer. She was determined to have the end come on quickly. But she lingered until Wednesday. The last day she was in a sort of coma."         He said she had been reconciled to the cruelty of her fate. "Anger and bitterness were there, but they didn't consume her in the end. She rose above that."         Mrs. Pittman is survived by her four children: Tom, of Toronto; Mrs. Kelly Blackwood of Kincardine, Ontario; Mark Pittman of Newmarket, Ontario; and Mrs. Kathy Fenton of Toronto; her mother, Mrs. Evelyn Borden, of Toronto; a sister, Mrs. Gail Stanzel of Toronto; and a brother, Dave Winaut, of Liverpool, Nova Scotia, and six grandchildren.       
         Claire Sterling, an American author and correspondent based in Italy, who was known for her writings on terrorism, assassination and crime, died yesterday in a hospital in Arezzo, Italy. She was 76 and lived in outside of Cortona, near Arezzo.         She had cancer of the colon, her husband said.         Mrs. Sterling was based in Italy for more than 30 years and traveled widely. Her most recent book, "Thieves' World: The Threat of the New Global Network of Organized Crime" (1994, Simon & Schuster), was praised by Stephen Handelman, of the Harriman Institute of Advanced Soviet Studies at Columbia University, as making "a significant contribution to post-cold-war debate" by affirming "that the growing interdependence among nation-states and financial institutions has made it easier for crime syndicates to cooperate across national boundaries."         In an earlier book, "Octopus: the Long Reach of the International Sicilian Mafia" (1990), she examined the Sicilian Mafia and charged gangster-chieftains based in Palermo with creating a multinational empire with the United States as its longtime main target.         In her 1984 book "The Time of the Assassins," Mrs. Sterling examined the attempt by a Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981. She contended that Mr. Agca had "come to Rome as a professional hit man, hired by a Bulgarian spy ring." She presented what she called "massive proof that the Soviet Union and its surrogates have provided the weapons, training and sanctuary for a worldwide terror network aimed at the destabilization of Western democratic society."         Mrs. Sterling's contention about a Bulgarian role in the attack was disputed, but writing in 1991, she maintained that Italian courts in 1988 had "expressed their moral certainty that Bulgaria's secret service was behind the papal shooting."         She also attracted wide attention with her 1981 book "The Terror Network," which traced connections among terrorist groups around the globe. William Abrahams, who edited the book for Holt, Rinehart & Winston, said that while she was writing it, the Italian Government posted a guard at her house to protect her.         A decade later, the New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis reported that William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence in the Reagan Administration, had held up a copy of "The Terror Network" before a group of official intelligence experts and had "said contemptuously that he had learned more from it than from all of them."         Mrs. Sterling's first book was "The Masaryk Case" (1969), about Jan Masaryk, the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister who was reported to have leaped to his death in 1948 from a window of his Prague apartment. She concluded that he had been killed by Soviet or Czechoslovak Stalinists to keep him from defecting to the West.         In her decades abroad, she also wrote articles for The New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, The Reporter magazine, Life, Reader's Digest, Harper's, The New Republic, The Washington Post, International Herald Tribune and The Financial Times.         Mrs. Sterling was born Claire Neikind in Queens, received a bachelor's degree in economics from Brooklyn College, and worked for a time as a union organizer among electrical workers.         In 1945 she received a master's degree from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, which awarded her a Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship.         She went on to work in Rome for what she described in a 1981 interview as "a fly-by-night American news agency." She learned Italian, and when the agency went out of business, she returned to the United States and joined the staff of The Reporter magazine, which began publication in early 1949.         Mrs. Sterling recalled that when she applied for the Reporter job, Max Ascoli, the magazine's Italian-born publisher and editor, said, "If anybody's going to write about Italy around here, it's me." So because of her union experience, she became the labor editor.         In 1951, she married Tom Sterling, a writer. She remembered that "Max Ascoli's wedding present to me was a six-month assignment in Rome."         Mrs. Sterling's six-month assignment lasted 17 years, ending only when The Reporter ceased publication in 1968. By then, the Sterlings were accustomed to life in Italy, where Mr. Sterling had written some of his more than a dozen books. So Mrs. Sterling, keeping Italy as her base, began writing her Masaryk book.         She is survived by her husband; a son, Luke, of Cortona; a daughter, Abigail Vazquez of San Francisco; two grandchildren, and a sister, Ethel Braun of Manhattan.       
         Claire K. Tholl, whose recommendation to preserve more than 200 stone houses led New Jersey and the Federal Government to include many of them on a list of protected historic buildings, died on Monday at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. She was 69 and lived in Upper Saddle River, N.J.         She suffered a lengthy illness, her family said.         Mrs. Tholl was trustee emeritus of the Bergen County Historical Society, a title created for her. She also had been a member of the county's Historic Site Advisory Board since 1969. It was for the board that she conducted a survey of sandstone structures dating as far back as the 1600's.         "The board decided that our stone houses were being threatened with demolition, so funding was acquired and she did the stone house survey in 1979 and 1980," Ruth Van Wagoner, director of the county Office of Cultural and Historic Affairs, said yesterday. "More than 200 were placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places, and about 190 were placed on the National Register."         Among the buildings shielded as a result of the survey by Mrs. Tholl was the 282-year-old Steuben House, a mansion of Bergen County sandstone in Dutch Colonial style in River Edge. The mansion was used as a headquarters by George Washington in 1780 and was given to Gen. Friedrich von Steuben as a reward after the Revolutionary War as a reward for being Washington's drillmaster. It was saved by the state from demolition in 1928 through eminent-domain proceedings.         A native of Hackensack, Claire Koch Tholl studied engineering and naval designing at Stevens Institute of Technology and graduated in architecture from Cooper Union in 1947.         She began her historic research in 1944, after working as a draftsman and in boat design, technical illustration and cartography. She later added architectural photography to her interests.         By 1960 she was studying old houses. She advised the restorers of Steuben House, Old Stone Church in Saddle River and Ringwood Manor in Ringwood, among many others.         She also was knowledgeable about early cooking methods and utensils and the kind of foods favored in the past, and the farms that produced them. For the Bicentennial year 1976 she wrote about the foods of the past in the introduction of an illustrated collection of regional and historic recipes.         Mrs. Tholl is survived by two daughters, Lisanne Fogel of Bellingham, Mass., and Andrea Dente of Vernon, N.J.; two sons, Robert, of Morristown, N.J., and James, of Queensbury, N.Y., and five grandchildren. Her husband, Edward, an architect, died in 1967.       
         Rema Hort Mann, a cable television executive, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 30.         The cause was stomach cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hort Mann was the licensing manager for Cablevision in Woodbury, L.I., handling market programming, licensing and negotiations for pay-per-view events. Previously, she was an independent consultant with National Economic Research Associates in White Plains and a senior consultant with Arthur Andersen & Co. in Manhattan.         She graduated from Tufts University in 1986 with a degree in computer science. In 1991, she received an M.B.A. in corporate strategic planning from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.         Mrs. Hort Mann is survived by her husband, Billy Mann; her parents, Susan and Michael Hort of Scarsdale, N.Y.; her grandparents, Dr. Selig and Blanche Strax of Queens; two brothers, Andrew and Peter, of Manhattan, and a sister, Shoshana, of Scarsdale.       
         May Sarton, poet, novelist and the strongest of individualists, died on Sunday at the York Hospital in York, Me., the town in which she had lived for many years. She was a stoical figure in American culture, writing about love, solitude and the search for self-knowledge. She was 83.         The cause of death was breast cancer, said Susan Sherman, a close friend and editor of her letters.         During a remarkably prolific career that stretched from early sonnets published in 1929 in Poetry magazine to "Coming Into Eighty" her latest collection of poems, in 1994, Ms. Sarton persistently followed her own path and was nurtured by an inner lyricism. She wrote more than 20 books of fiction and many works of nonfiction, including autobiographies and journals, a play and several screenplays. She was best known and most highly regarded as a poet.         Extremely popular on college campuses, she became a heroine to feminists. In 1965, when she revealed that she was a lesbian, she said she lost two jobs as a result. But as with so much in her life, she had no regrets.         In an interview with Enid Nemy in The New York Times in 1983, Ms. Sarton was described as "a commanding, no-nonsense figure with clear blue eyes and a shock of white hair," a woman who lived in "self-imposed loneliness" in a weathered clapboard house on the Maine coast. She had, it was said, a difficult life; her work has been virtually ignored by major critics and she gained her reputation primarily by word of mouth. The poet said, "Women have been my muse."         Recovering from a stroke, and while often in pain from other ailments, she continued to keep a journal, and in 1993 published "Encore: A Journal of the 80th Year." In it, she said, "I write poems, have always written them, to transcend the painfully personal and reach the universal." She added, "It's hard to say goodbye to journals, and if I live to be 85 I might resume one for the joy of it."         In The New York Times Book Review, the novelist Sheila Ballantyne, reviewing "Anger," Ms. Sarton's 1982 novel, wrote: "It is clear that May Sarton's best work, whatever its form, will endure well beyond the influence of particular reviews or current tastes. For in it she is an example: a seeker after truth with a kind of awesome energy for renewal, an ardent explorer of life's important questions. Her great strength is that when she achieves insight, one believes -- because one has witnessed the struggle that preceded the knowledge."         Ms. Sarton was born in Wondelgem in Belgium in 1914, as Eleanore Marie Sarton. Her father was a Belgian historian of science, her mother an English artist and designer. With the outbreak of World War I, the Sartons emigrated to England and, in 1916, to the United States, where her name was Anglicized to Eleanor May Sarton. As she later recalled in "I Knew a Phoenix: Sketches for an Autobiography," her mother carried with her from Belgium a copy of "Leaves of Grass," and passed on a love of poetry to her daughter.         In 1918, the Sartons settled in Cambridge, Mass. At Shady Hill School in Cambridge, the young woman explored her passion for poetry, and then fell into difficulty at high school because she objected to a teacher's statement that Ibsen was immoral. The fact that she did not go to college was, she said, "a great piece of luck; this way, I'm ignorant but I'm fresh." Stage-struck, she joined Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory Theater as an actress. After the company disbanded in the early 1930's, she founded the Apprentice Theater of the New School for Social Research. When her theater failed, she made frequent trips back to Europe, and continued to re-envision her experiences in poetry.         During the 1930's, two volumes of poetry, "Encounter in April" and "Inner Landscape," and a novel, "The Single Hound," established themes that were to occupy her for a lifetime: the many forms of love and the uniqueness of the individual. To support her art, she wrote book reviews and taught creative writing. Her second novel, "The Bridge of Years," published in 1946, was seemingly drawn from life, dealing with the effect of two world wars on a Belgian family. Many of her subsequent novels, including "The Small Room," "Crucial Conversations" and "A Reckoning," centered on women as protagonists. In these novels as well as in her poems, she confronted issues that foreshadowed feminist writing of subsequent decades.         For Ms. Sarton, poetry was her life's work. As she said: "When you're a poet, you're a poet first. When it comes, it's like an angel." Although she never had the full recognition attained by many of her peers, and never won a Pulitzer Prize or a National Book Award, her work generally received favorable reviews and she had a loyal readership. She was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and received 18 honorary degrees.         In "Encore," she admitted to being hypersensitive about criticism. As she once said, referring to a review of her novel, "A Reckoning," a bad review "is a drop of poison and slowly gets into the system, day by day." But nothing could discourage her from writing, not even a series of illnesses. Through her later years, she chronicled her life in journals. In "After the Stroke," a journal published in 1988, she wrote that she had discovered "for the first time perhaps what it takes to grow old," and, approaching 75, was determined to "recover and go on creating."         Speaking about the "rewards of a solitary life," she said, "Loneliness is most acutely felt with other people, for with others, even with a lover sometimes, we suffer from our differences -- differences of taste, temperament, mood." Quietly she waited for the moment to come "when the world falls away, and the self emerges again from the deep unconscious, bringing back all I have recently experienced to be explored and slowly understood, when I can converse again with my own hidden powers, and so grow, and so be renewed, till death do us part." Of Solitude, Mortality, Liberals, Friends and Fires  Fruit of Loneliness         Now for a little I have fed on loneliness         As on some strange fruit from a frost-touched vine --         Persimmon in its yellow comeliness,         Or pomegranate-juice color of wine,         The pucker-mouth crab apple, or late plum --         On fruit of loneliness I have been fed.         But now after short absence I am come         Back from felicity to the wine and bread.         For, being mortal, this luxurious heart         Would starve for you, my dear, I must admit,         If it were held another hour apart         From that food which alone can comfort it --         I am come home to you, for at the end         I find I cannot live without you, friend.         From "Words on the Wind" ("Encounter in April," Houghton-Mifflin, 1937)         I watched the psychic surgeon         Stern, skilled, adroit,         Cut deep into the heart         And yet not hurt. . . .         Old failures, old obsessions         Cut Away. . . .         From "Letter to a Psychiatrist"         Here in Maine it is a cold start to the new year as a tempestuous ocean throws up fountains of spray at the end of my field and its ice on the dirt roads where I walk Tamas, my dog. But the cold is not only in the weather -- after all, we expect that, and we are bundled up; the cold is in the heart. I cannot remember a year when I was more aware of suffering and need, more aware of the botch governments make of human lives, more aware of my own helplessness as though the fire in me had frozen at the center.         When Tamas comes in from the snow, he shakes himself, and this evening I tell myself, as the moon rises in a brief respite from storm, that I must find a way to shake myself out of the frozen mood and start the fire going again. Hard times tempt one to run for cover and hide, wait it out, give up trying to act in the face of gigantic problems no one of us is equipped to solve. The temptation is to withdraw.         But, I tell myself, that is not what being a liberal is all about, however put down and cast aside we may be at the moment. Anger lights the fire when I see some people hanging their heads, allowing themselves to be persuaded that government cannot concern itself with the poor, the disabled, the old, the children. We may have failed, but if so we failed because we did too little, not too much.         We have got to warm ourselves back to the certainty that it is only when we lose the connection between ourselves and other people that we begin to freeze up into despair. That connection has to be kept open whatever happens. It is kept open by letters, by unexpected encounters, or by simply contemplating the points of light here or there.         From "Winter Thoughts" (The New York Times, 1982)         "Music I heard with you was more than music." Exactly. And therefore music itself can only be heard alone. Solitude is the salt of personhood. It brings out the authentic flavor of every experience.         Loneliness is most acutely felt with other people, for with others, even with a lover sometimes, we suffer from our differences -- differences of taste, temperament, mood. Human intercourse often demands that we soften the edge of perception, or withdraw at the very instant of personal truth for fear of hurting, or of being inappropriately present, which is to say naked, in a social situation. Alone we can afford to be wholly whatever we are, and to feel whatever we feel absolutely.         From "Rewards of a Solitary Life" (The New York Times, 1990)       
         Roberta Church, an official in the Eisenhower and Nixon Administrations who was the first black woman to be elected to the Tennessee Republican State Executive Committee, died on Saturday at Baptist Memorial Hospital East in Memphis. She was 81 and lived in Memphis.         She had suffered a brief illness, said Ronald A. Walter, the co-author of one of her books.         Miss Church was the last survivor of a family of black Tennesseans who were prominent in business and Republican politics when few Southern blacks were active in either business or the party.         With her aunt, Annette E. Church, she wrote a biography of her grandfather and father, "The Robert R. Churches of Memphis: A Father and Son Who Achieved in Spite of Race" (Burke's, 1974). She also wrote, with Mr. Walter, "Nineteenth-Century Memphis Families of Color, 1850-1900" (Burke's; 2d ed., 1989).         Miss Church, whose full name was Sara Roberta Church, was born in Memphis and received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Northwestern University. Her grandfather, Robert R. Sr., founded Memphis's first black bank and was believed to be the first black millionaire in the South.         Her father was an early civil rights leader; in 1916 he formed the Lincoln League to register and organize voters, and in 1917 he founded Tennessee's first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         He died in 1952 while campaigning for a seat on the Republican State Executive Committee. Miss Church took over the campaign and was elected in his stead to represent Memphis and surrounding Shelby County.         In 1953 she was named by the Eisenhower Administration to promote equal employment opportunities as a Labor Department consultant. In 1961 she started a Civil Service career as an administrator of Federal-state programs in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, later the Department of Health and Human Services. She retired in 1982.         Miss Cook also served two terms under President Richard M. Nixon as a member of his Advisory Council on Adult Education.       
         Dr. Berta Vogel Scharrer, a pioneering biomedical scientist and founding faculty member of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University, died on Sunday at her home in the Bronx. She was 88.         Harvard University, conferring an honorary doctorate on Dr. Scharrer in 1982, said her "research journeys into the world of insects have profoundly affected the study of human physiology." The particular insect she had studied since 1937 was the South American cockroach.         Dr. Scharrer's specialty was neuroendocrinology, the study of the interaction between the nervous and endocrine systems. At her death, she was distinguished professor emeritus of anatomy and structural biology and of neuroscience at Einstein. She had been affiliated with the college since it was founded in 1955. She reached emeritus status in 1978 but continued her research until a few months ago.         In 1928, Dr. Ernst Scharrer, her future husband, working in Germany, discovered what he called gland-nerve cells in the hypothalamus of a fish's brain. From this, the Scharrers developed the concept of neurosecretion -- secretions from nerve cells -- that gave rise in the 1930's and early 1940's to neuroendocrinology as a new discipline.         Berta Vogel was born in Munich, Germany, and received a doctorate in biology from the University of Munich in 1930. She married Dr. Scharrer in 1934, and they remained a team at Einstein until his accidental drowning in 1965. Though not Jewish, the Scharrers left Germany in 1937 because of Hitler's policies.         Early in their collaboration, they decided on a comparative approach, dividing the animal kingdom so that he would study vertebrates and she invertebrates. They determined that certain principles found in an insect could explain certain things about mammalian systems, and vice versa.         Their discovery of neurosecretions took years to find acceptance, as their peers resisted the notion that neurons could dispatch neurohormonal, blood-borne signals, an activity previously associated only with the hormonal endocrine cells.         Once neuroendocrinology became established, Dr. Scharrer received many honorary degrees and other honors in the United States and in Europe. She was given the National Medal of Science at a White House ceremony in 1985.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Karl Vogel of Neustadt, Germany, and a sister, Lotte Vogel of Munich.       
         Saidye Rosner Bronfman, a philanthropist and widow of Samuel Bronfman, founder of the Seagram Company, died yesterday at her home in Montreal. She was 98.         At her death, she was honorary president of the Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Family Foundation, which supports a variety of charitable and community causes. A patron of the arts, she and her husband founded the Samuel Bronfman Collection of Canadian Art. She created a special fund for the Montreal Musem of Fine Arts to encourage young artists through the purchase of their work.         She was active in many organizations, including Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, the National Council of Jewish Women and the Organization for Rehabilitalation through Training.         Born in Plum Coulee, Manitoba, she studied at Havergal Ladies' College in Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba before marrying Mr. Bronfman in 1922. Two years later, the couple moved to Montreal, where Mr. Bronfman opened his first small distillery and built the company into a beverage and distilled spirits empire.         Mrs. Bronfman is survived by a daughter, Phyllis Barbara Lambert of Montreal; two sons, Edgar M. of Manhattan, the chairman of Seagram, and Charles R. of Montreal, co-chairman; 11 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1971.       
         Alice V. Keliher, whose experiences as a lightly trained teacher of ill-prepared first graders led her to become a renowned expert on early childhood education and a champion of giving children unreserved respect and affection, died on Tuesday at the Tucson Medical Center in Arizona. She was 92.         A longtime professor of education at New York University, Miss Keliher cherished her unofficial title as the "grandmother of day care."         In the 1930's, she conducted seminal research on childhood development with Arnold Gesell at Yale University. In the 1940's and 1950's, as a member of N.Y.U.'s faculty, she served on virtually every city, state and national conference devoted to children and wrote widely on the subject.         And in the 1960's, while winding down her wide-ranging academic career as a professor at Wheelock College in Boston, she became the Massachusetts regional training officer for Head Start, the Federal program designed to provide disadvantaged children with the preschool enrichment Miss Keliher had been preaching to parents and educators for decades.         Although she trained teachers at N.Y.U. from 1936 to 1960, World War II provided her with her major platform.         As director of child and youth services of the New York Office of Civilian Defense, and secretary of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia's Committee on the Wartime Care of Children, Miss Keliher helped make day care an accepted staple of American life.         Her campaign for day care may have made her a legitimate feminist heroine, but Miss Keliher, who also helped lessen the burden on mothers by spearheading the development of kindergarten and nursery school, made it clear that her focus was not women, but their children.         Instead of talking about what "working mothers need," she said in 1949, the emphasis should be on "what makes a good next generation for America."         A native of Washington who received her teacher's certificate after two years of training, Miss Keliher was only 20 when she became a teacher in 1923. After four years in the Washington school system, she decided she could serve children better by teaching their teachers how to teach.         Obtaining bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in three years at Teachers College at Columbia University, she joined Dr. Gesell in 1930. She secured the job with the renowned child psychologist, she later confided, because she was the only applicant who knew how to operate a movie camera, a skill needed in research based on close observation of minute changes in infant behavior.         For all her dedication to her work, Miss Keliher's abiding passion was opera, and for decades she was a fixture in the center of the first row of the first balcony at the Metropolitan Opera (at just over 5 feet tall, she needed an unobstructed view), where her frequent guest was Eleanor Roosevelt.         The two women, who became friends when Mrs. Roosevelt took an apartment in Miss Keliher's building near Washington Square Park, enjoyed trading favors: Mrs. Roosevelt let Miss Keliher take her N.Y.U. students on field trips to the Roosevelt estate at Hyde Park. Miss Keliher, who had the larger oven, let Mrs. Roosevelt roast her turkeys in her kitchen.         Miss Keliher also shared Mrs. Roosevelt's devotion to human rights.         In a little-known chapter of her life, her lawyer, J. Dan O'Neill, said yesterday, Miss Keliher helped several Jewish families escape from Germany and Austria in the late 1930's. Her lawyer said the enterprise was organized by the love of her life, a shadowy American intelligence agent whose death in World War II led Miss Keliher to vow to remain unmarried.         Miss Keliher later created a furor when she refused to attend an education conference at a club known to exclude Jews. And she was such an outspoken champion of women, including their need for birth-control devices, Mr. O'Neill said, that she became a virtual pariah to her own Roman Catholic Church.         For all her books, like "Life and Growth" and "A Critical Study of Homogenous Grouping," Miss Keliher stressed a single theme, one she summed up in 1955: "If I could say just one thing to parents, it would be simply that a child needs someone who believes in him no matter what he does."         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Joan L. Hafey, a retired vice president for the New York advertising agency Young & Rubicam who was active in public-service advertising campaigns, died July 24 at Tisch Hospital of New York University Medical Center. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan and Southbury, Conn.         The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, a spokesman for Young & Rubicam said.         After beginning her career at Ladies Home Journal, Ms. Hafey managed press relations for Magnavox. She moved to Young & Rubicam in 1969. Ms. Hafey represented the agency and was involved in the Ad Council's public-service campaigns for the United Negro College Fund and the National Urban League. She also did volunteer public relations work for Covenant House and the Y.W.C.A. in New York, of which she was a board member.         After retiring in 1992, Ms. Hafey served as vice president for the agency's foundation and as the editor of its alumni magazine.         Ms. Hafey was a native of Holyoke, Mass., and graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1949.       
         Carol Fox Sulzberger, the wife of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman of The New York Times Company, and an active volunteer with foundations and social-service organizations, died yesterday at her home in Southampton, L.I. She was 68.         The cause of her death was cancer.         Mrs. Sulzberger was a director of the New York City Police Foundation. At one time, she also served on the boards of the National Urban League, the New York Urban League, WAIF/International Social Service, the Girl Scouts of Greater New York and the Cooperative Education Association.         "She carried a very heavy schedule without talking a lot about it," a friend, Margaret Greenfield, said yesterday. "She did a lot of good works in a very quiet way."         Mrs. Greenfield and another friend of many years, Sydney Gruson, said friends would remember Mrs. Sulzberger as a woman who jealously guarded the time she spent with her family, her antiques hunting and her passion for the company and conversation of intimates. "She had a wry sense of humor," Mr. Gruson said. "And she was the most direct, honest woman I have ever known."         An avid reader of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger especially championed its coverage of fashion and the arts.         She was born in New York City, the daughter of Estelle and David Fox. Mr. Fox had been president of Jay Thorpe, a New York women's specialty store that has since closed.         Educated at the Dalton School, she was a graduate of Goddard College in Vermont. In her youth, she spent a number of years with her family in Paris.         In addition to her husband of 39 years, she is survived by two daughters, Cathy, of Chevy Chase, Md., and Cynthia, of New York City, and two stepchildren, Karen, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Arthur Jr., the publisher of The Times, and seven grandchildren.         A memorial service will be held at 3 P.M. on Tuesday at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family said that in lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the New York City Police Foundation at 345 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10105.       
         Fay Honey Knopp, an advocate of peace and civil rights who founded a Quaker ministry for men and women in prisons around the country, died on Thursday at her home in Shoreham, Vt. A former resident of Westport, Conn., she was 76.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, her family said in reporting her death this week.         A longtime Quaker minister to prisons, Mrs. Knopp retired two years ago as director of the Safer Society Program, which operates under the auspices of the New York State Council of Churches. The program, a national referral service for sex offenders seeking therapy, grew out of her visits to prison and the Prison Research Education Action Program she founded in 1976.         Under her leadership, an affiliated service, the Safer Society Press, produced about 20 books, research studies, manuals and training videos dealing with the treatment and prevention of sex-related crimes and intended for abusers and their victims.         Her affiliation with the Society of Friends dated to a peace demonstration in 1939. She became a Quaker in 1962 and was designated a "minister of record" to serve as a prison visitor throughout the Federal penitentiary system.         Over the years she also served as director of the New York Region of the American Friends Service Committee, projects director for the National Peace Education Division in Philadelphia and counselor to many conscientious objectors.         Prevention of sexual abuse was a major concern in her nearly 40 years of work with prisoners and, she said, she would be "tough with those guys."         "Society has let them off the hook by just locking them up," she told an interviewer in 1988. "I'm very up front with them. Yes, most of them were sexually abused as children, but that can't be an excuse to go out and abuse other people."         A native of Bridgeport, Conn., she studied at the Hartford Art School, the New School for Social Research and the University of California at Los Angeles.         She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Burton; a daughter, Prof. Sari Biklen of Syracuse; a son, State Representative Alex Knopp of Norwalk, Conn.; two sisters, Isabelle Yolen and Sylvia Wittenberg, both of Laguna Beach, Calif.; a brother, Leonard Irving of Fairfield, Conn., and four grandchildren.       
         Oveta Culp Hobby, the creator of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps in World War II, the first Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and a longtime executive at the recently closed Houston Post, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 90.         Mrs. Hobby, whose media holdings made her one of the nation's richest women, suffered a stroke in April, her family said.         She went from being a small-town lawyer's well-read daughter to being a regular on fashion magazines' lists of well-dressed women, with her trendy designer gowns and hats from Bergdorf Goodman. She took lessons that erased the drawl from her conversations about the Picasso paintings she collected or the Bartok concertos she heard at the Houston Symphony. She also reorganized the business department of The Houston Post from top to bottom, and she later developed a reputation as a hard-working administrator who prized efficiency in government.         But she was not one to demand the credit.         "Everything that ever happened to me fell in my lap," she once said. "And nothing in my life would have been possible without Governor."         "Governor" was William P. Hobby, an easy-going newspaperman who was the top elected official in Texas from 1917 to 1921; his most notable action as Governor was to call out the state militia to crush a dock strike.         He was hired as publisher of The Houston Post-Dispatch at about the same time that Miss Culp, a friend of Florence Sterling, whose millionaire brother owned the paper, got a job in the circulation department.         Mr. Hobby's first wife died a year later. A couple of years later, after Miss Culp lost a campaign for a seat in the State Legislature, they were seen socializing around Houston. In 1931, when she was 26 and he 53, they were married.         "Will, she'll embarrass you," one of her husband's friends warned. "She doesn't give a hang about clothes."         But she learned to; in the 1950's her name appeared regularly on the lists of best-dressed women. She also learned about newspapers. The Hobbys eventually acquired ownership of The Post and she worked as a book reviewer, copy editor and editorial writer.         Their first child, William P. Hobby Jr., was born on Mrs. Hobby's 27th birthday, and her daughter, Jessica, on her 32d. As the publisher's wife, she became president of the Texas League of Women Voters, a member of the board of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, a member of the Houston Symphony Orchestra Committee and regional chairman of the Mobilization for Human Needs, all before she was 35.         Mrs. Hobby was born on Jan. 19, 1905, in Killeen, Tex., the daughter of Isaac and Emma Hoover Culp. Her first name was an Indian word that her parents chose because it rhymed with with Juanita, the name of one of her sisters.         Oveta soon demonstrated her independent-mindedness. A temperance campaign swept Killeen when she was 5, and her Sunday school class was asked to sign a pledge. She politely refused. Her grandmother heard about her refusal and had a switch ready. Not until afterward did her grandmother ask why she had refused. "I did not sign because I did not know what that word means -- temperance," she said. Her grandmother apologized.         She was her father's favorite; at 10 she read the Congressional Record in his office, and when he won a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1919 she went with him to Austin.         She briefly attended Mary Hardin Baylor College at Belton, Tex. Miss Culp was soon on the state payroll, in a job codifying statutes for the State Banking Committee. In 1925, when she was 20, a year shy of being old enough to vote, she was appointed parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature. Later she wrote a handbook on parliamentary procedure, "Mr. Chairman," which was used as a textbook throughout the state.         "If I hadn't been parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature, other things would never have been sparked," she said later. "Twenty is a wonderful age for things to be sparked."         One of the things sparked by her duties in Austin was an interest in politics. The 1928 Democratic National Convention was held in Houston, and she worked on senatorial and mayoral campaigns. She later ran for a seat in the State Legislature. Her opponent whispered that she was "a parliamentarian and a Unitarian." She lost. It was the last time she ran for office.         Mrs. Hobby was in Washington in 1941 for a meeting at the Federal Communications Commission -- the family owned radio station KPRC-AM -- when Gen. David Searles asked her to organize a section on women's activities for the Army. The War Department had been receiving 10,000 letters a day from women who wanted to serve their country. But Mrs. Hobby turned him down, saying that she had a husband, two children and a job.         General Searles asked her to draw up an organization chart with recommendations on ways that women could serve, and she did. He repeated his request that she go to work in Washington. She repeated her refusal. Then she told her husband.         "You shouldn't have made him have to ask you a second time," Mr. Hobby reportedly said at the time. "Any thoughtful person knows that we are in this war, and that every one of us is going to have to do whatever we are called upon to do." Mrs. Hobby went to Washington.         Her job was completely new in American military history, and she had to write her own rules. The idea of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps -- the name was changed to Women's Army Corps in 1943 -- was not well received by male commanders. Sergeants had jeeps, but Mrs. Hobby, who held the rank of colonel, had to call for a car from the War Department motor pool.         Members of the WACs enlisted for noncombat duty as medical technicians, cartography clerks, secretaries and similar types of jobs in the United States and in every war theater. By the end of World War II, about 100,000 women had joined the WAC. The organization was dissolved in 1978.         Mrs. Hobby received the Distinguished Service Medal in January 1945 for outstanding service "without guidance or precedents in United States military history.         Back in Houston, she renewed her political contacts and expanded the circulation of The Post, where she was an executive vice president and a director of KPRC, which came to include not only the AM station but also FM and television outlets.         Although she considered herself a conservative Democrat, she backed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, a Republican, when he ran for President in 1948, and Dwight D. Eisenhower in his successful Presidential campaign in 1952.         In return for her support, Mrs. Hobby was appointed to succeed Oscar E. Ewing as head of the Federal Security Agency. Her post did not have full Cabinet status when she was sworn in, but it was soon elevated to that rank and its name was changed to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mrs. Hobby was the nation's second woman to hold a Cabinet post; the first, Frances Perkins, was Secretary of Labor under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945.         In 31 months in charge of the department, which had a $1.7 billion annual budget, she oversaw the development of nurses training programs and a hospital reinsurance plan. She was also involved in the announcement of the Salk polio vaccine, and was praised at the time for having the patience to hold the announcement until the vaccine had been properly tested.         When Mrs. Hobby resigned, Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey was so dismayed that he said, "What? The best man in the Cabinet?"         Mrs. Hobby's reason for leaving Washington was straightforward: "Nothing is as important as Governor."         Her husband had been ill, but he improved once she was back in Houston. For the next nine years, until his death in 1964, they worked out of adjacent offices at The Post or a single large room in their home.         Mrs. Hobby sold The Post to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company in 1983 for about $130 million. The paper changed hands again a few years later, and was finally closed earlier this year.         In 1992, H&C Communications Inc., another family enterprise, sold its five television stations. The sale left H&C with only one broadcast outlet, the Hobby's original station, KPRC-AM in Houston.         Besides her son, who was the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991 and was recently named chancellor of the University of Houston, and her daughter, Jessica Catto, of San Antonio, she is survived by a sister, Mrs. Loy Loving, of Weslaco, Tex., 8 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Gloria Chadwick, an international ski racing administrator who was especially dedicated to furthering women's cross-country competition, died on Sunday at her home in Lake Placid, N.Y. She was 63.         Her brother, Norman Chadwick of Mount Vernon, Wash., said she died of cancer.         In her youth, Miss Chadwick was a downhill ski racer on the United States A team. She had wanted to compete at the Olympic level, but a skiing accident in which she broke her leg sidelined that ambition.         Undaunted, she went on to make her mark in the sport through administrative undertakings, and in 1986, was inducted into the United States National Ski Hall of Fame in Ishpeming, Mich.         She had been director of the United States Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid since 1985, and was executive director of the United States Ski Association from 1961-68. She was also the first national coordinator for Nastar, a racing program for recreational skiers.         For the last decade, she focused her efforts on behalf of women in skiing as chairman of the International Ski Federation Subcommittee on Women's Cross-Country.         Miss Chadwick was born in Philadelphia, but her family moved to Lowell, Mass., when she was a toddler. As a teen-ager from a modest home, Miss Chadwick honed her Alpine skills by skiing regularly at nearby Cannon Mountain, N.H.         She received a bachelor's and master's degree in business from the now-defunct Staley College in Brookline, Mass., and later studied management at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif.         In a breakthrough for women in the ski industry, she was hired in 1971 by the Big Sky Resort near Bozeman, Mont., to be director of marketing, and later, a vice president.         From 1975 to 1983, she was president and general manager of Burke Mountain, Vt. In 1983, she became commissioner of economic development for the state of Vermont.         In 1985, Miss Chadwick opened the United States Olympic Education Center at Northern Michigan University in Marquette, Mich. Later that year, she also began supervising the $12 million modernization of the Lake Placid training center.         During the last two years, she was in charge of developing the ARCO United States Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Calif.         Miss Chadwick is survived by her brother.       
         Evelyn Wood, whose search for a way to improve the lives of troubled girls led to the development of speed reading techniques prescribed by Presidents and endorsed by multitudes, died on Saturday in Hospice Family Care in Tucson, Ariz. Mrs. Wood, who lived in Tucson, was 86.         The tiny, soft-spoken woman who gave her name to Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics liberated students, professionals and business people from the habits that shackled them to the average American's reading rate of 250 to 300 words a minute.         In courses that proliferated from coast to coast and spread overseas, they learned the methods that enabled them not only to read two to five times faster but also to better retain what they read.         "So many people are dubious about trying my method because they think they're liable to miss a lot," Mrs. Wood said in an interview a quarter of a century ago. "I say, which would you rather do: eat a dish of rice kernel by kernel or take a spoonful to get a good taste? My reading technique is actually comprehension by accumulation."         In years of research ignited by a professor who read her 80-page term paper at an astonishing rate while retaining its content, she found people from all walks of life who could read from 1,500 to 6,000 words a minute and sometimes more. And Mrs. Wood (who could herself read 2,700 words a minute), discovered that they shared several traits:         *They read down the page rather than left to right.         *They read groups of words or complete thoughts rather than one word at a time.         *They avoided involuntary rereading of material.         *Their reading efficiency was applicable to a variety of materials.         In time, President John F. Kennedy sent a dozen members of the White House staff to the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute in Washington. President Richard M. Nixon sent 35 high-ranking members of his Administration, and President Jimmy Carter followed suit.         Students learned to break the habits that slowed them, including saying words under their breath, or subvocalizing. And the hand or finger, sweeping down the page, was used to "pace" the eyes at increasingly faster speeds, while the reader was urged to concentrate not on single words but on groups of words -- sentences, clauses and the like -- that make up units of thought.         At one session, a college student devoured a sociology textbook at the rate of 14,000 words a minute. In another, 25 students were assigned to finish George Orwell's "Animal Farm" in 25 minutes, a feat that required a reading rate of 1,400 words a minute. Most finished in the allotted time, and most scored well on the comprehension test that followed.         There were few claims that extremely difficult or unfamiliar material could be mastered at accelerated rates. But it was clear that many people could be taught to read faster and more effectively.         "Speed is not most important, but only through speed do you get good comprehension," Mrs. Wood said.         It was a theory that Mrs. Wood began to develop during the late 1940's and early 1950's, when she was a teacher and girls' counselor at Jordan High School in Salt Lake City.         Dealing with underachievers with personality problems, Mrs. Wood realized that they had one thing in common. All were poor readers.         Mrs. Wood established the school's first remedial reading program and discovered that as the girls read better, their grades improved in every subject and they became better adjusted.         And she discovered one other thing: the faster the girls read, the better they read.         She began refining her techniques for faster reading.         The next breakthrough came when Mrs. Wood, who was born in 1909 in Logan, Utah, returned to the University of Utah. At the college where she had earned her bachelor's degree in English in 1929, she now pursued a master's degree in speech.         When she turned in her term paper to the head of the department, Dr. C. Lowell Lees, she recalled:         "I handed Dr. Lees a term paper and watched him flip through the 80 pages at a startling rate, grade the paper and hand it back. He appeared to be reading as fast as he could turn the pages. He knew the total content and was able to tell me not only what was in it, but also what was missing. Intrigued, I clocked him on other material and found he could read at a rate of 2,500 words a minute."         In 1958, when she was sent on a national promotional tour for "Reading Skills," a groundbreaking book on remedial reading written in collaboration with Marjorie Westcott Barrows of Jordan High, Mrs. Wood began asking everywhere, "Do you know anyone who can read fast?"         The answers led her to 53 people whose traits came to inform her teaching.         Later that summer, frustrated with her efforts to increase her own reading speed, she discovered the use of the hand as a pacer.         "Before I introduced that technique," she once told an interviewer, "only children in the early grades used their fingers on the printed pages to guide their reading. And then they were taught not to!"         In 1959, with her husband, Doug, Mrs. Wood established the first of her institutes, in Washington. In 1967, she sold the business. It has been owned since September 1993 by Pryor Resources, a business seminar training company in Kansas City, Kan.         Mrs. Wood continued to teach and was developing a remedial reading program for children when she suffered an incapacitating stroke in 1976.         Her husband died in 1987. She is survived by her daughter, Carol Davis Evans of Tucson; four grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.       
         Brigid Brophy, a novelist, critic, essayist and crusader for myriad causes ranging from better royalty payments for writers to better treatment for animals, died on Monday at a nursing home in Lincolnshire, England. She was 66 and had been suffering from multiple sclerosis for many years.         Miss Brophy was the author of 4 plays, 7 novels and 14 other books, but she is just as well known for her most successful campaign, for lending rights for authors. In 1979, her efforts resulted in a law that for the first time allowed authors to receive royalty payments from the British Government every time their books were checked out of a public library.         But Miss Brophy also campaigned -- even from her sickbed -- for the rights of women, of prisoners and of animals. She was a vice president of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, and no animal escaped her sympathy. She even became active in an anti-angling campaign, and at one point sent a letter to the fishing correspondent of The Daily Telegraph in which she compared anglers to "thugs who beat up old-age pensioners for fun" and quoted Lord Byron's remark that fishing was "the stupidest of pretended sports."         Brigid Antonia Brophy was born in 1929 in London, the only daughter of the Anglo-Irish novelist John Brophy. She was educated at St. Paul's Girls' School and later at Oxford, where she excelled as a scholar but was soon expelled because of drunken, raucous behavior. She was acting, she later wrote, "in the belief that I had more to learn by pursuing my personal life than from textual emendation, with the result that the authorities could put up with me for only just over a year.         "I came down at the age of 19 without a degree and with a consequent sense of nudity which I have never quite overcome."         In 1954, before she was even 30, she burst onto the literary scene when her novel "Hackenfeller's Ape," about an ape at the London Zoo and its increasingly close relationship to the professor observing its mating habits, won the Cheltenham Literary Festival First Prize for a first novel. Her novels are known for their imagination and acerbic wit, and include "The Snow Ball," in which the characters attend a ball dressed as figures from "Don Giovanni"; "Flesh," which she described as "an almost distressingly cold-blooded little story," and "In Transit," set, claustrophobically, in an airport transit lounge.         But she also developed a reputation as a sharp thinker and fierce intellectual who liked a good fight, and her nonfiction books tended to have provocative, often mischievous points of view. In 1967, for instance, she was one of the authors of "Fifty Works of English Literature We Could Do Without," an attack on a number of classic books including "Jane Eyre," which was likened by the authors to "gobbling a jar-full of school-girl stick-jaw." She also championed the writing of Ronald Firbank in "Prancing Novelist" (1973), subtitled "A Defense of Fiction in the Form of a Critical Biography in Praise of Ronald Firbank."         Miss Brophy, who spoke freely in her early years about her bisexuality and often referred to marriage as "an immoral institution," nonetheless married in 1954. Her husband, the art historian Michael Levey, shared her delight in literature and the arts. He became director of the National Gallery in 1973 and was knighted eight years later.         In a tribute to Miss Brophy in The Independent on Tuesday, her literary agent, Giles Gordon, described her as a "deeply shy, courteous woman" who wrote delightful thank-you letters and kept to rigorous standards in her work. "Woe betide the 'editor' who tried to rewrite her fastidious, logical, exact prose, change a colon to a semi-colon (or vice-versa), or try to spell 'show' other than 'shew,' slavish Shavian that Brophy was," Mr. Gordon wrote.         In 1979, Miss Brophy's physical problem was diagnosed as multiple sclerosis, which steadily worsened until she was housebound and had to use a wheelchair. She remained at home, looked after by paid companions, friends and her husband, who in 1987 quit his job to help care for her. But she continued to work with all the energy her illness would allow. In 1987 she published "Baroque 'n' Roll," a collection of essays in which she outlined, with lucidity and detail, the debilitating toll her condition had taken on her. Eventually, her condition deteriorated so badly that she had to move into the nursing home where she died.         She is survived by her husband and a daughter, Kate.       
         Dorothy Robinson Kidder, a philanthropist who founded a program to feed the homeless while continuing her family tradition of support for the arts, died of cancer on Monday at her home in Washington, her family said. She was 78.         Mrs. Kidder was a great-granddaughter of Eben D. Jordan, the founder of the Jordan Marsh department store company and The Boston Globe.         She was a major contributor to dance programs at the Kennedy Center, to the National Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She contributed to a number of charitable causes through the Hopeful Fund, which she founded to support programs and services for the homeless in Washington.         Born in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., Mrs. Kidder was raised in New York City and Paris. In 1938, she married Randolph Appleton Kidder, a member of the Foreign Service.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Kidder is survived by her son, Michael R. Kidder of New Hampshire, and five grandchildren.       
         Joanne Toor Cummings, a philanthropist and patron of the arts, died yesterday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, according to the family.         Mrs. Cummings and her husband, Nathan Cummings, the founder of the Consolidated Foods Corporation, who died in 1985, were longtime collectors. The Cummingses gave more than 600 pieces of pre-Columbian works to a gallery bearing his name at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Their apartment overlooking Fifth Avenue was filled with an array of sculpture by Giacometti and Manzu and paintings by Matisse, Gauguin and Degas.         They also made substantial contributions to the Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York Hospital, Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and other hospitals.         Mrs. Cummings was born in Chicago, the daughter of Harriet Toor and Harold Toor, former chairman of the United States Shoe Corporation.         She graduated in 1953 from Connecticut College, to which she and her husband donated the Joanne and Nathan Cummings Art Center and endowed a scholarship for needy students. She served as a trustee of the college from 1981 to 1991.         She also received a master's degree from Columbia University's School of International Relations. She was a member of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy for 19 years, and its senior vice president since 1991.         Mrs. Cummings was involved in a wide variety of philanthropies. She was a life governing member of the Chicago Art Institute and a patron of the American Ballet Theater, New York City Ballet, New York City Opera, Metropolitan Opera and Metropolitan Museum of Art.         She is survived by a sister, Suzanne Toor Karpas of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and Manhattan.       
         Annie Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, the younger of the two sisters whose wisdom and triumphs have been celebrated in a best-selling book and in the Broadway play "Having Our Say," died yesterday at her home in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. She was 104.         "She just took a couple of deep breaths and passed away," said Amy Hill Hearth, co-author of "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 years," the 1993 best-selling oral history. "And it's an important thing she died at home, in her bed, with her sister there. That's all she wanted."         Her 106-year-old sister, Sarah, known as Sadie, with whom she had lived for more than 100 years, seemed to handle her sister's death with the same strength that had carried her through a century.         "I'll just do the best I can," Sarah Delany told Ms. Hearth in an interview at her home. "I'll continue right on as if Bessie were here."         She added that for her sister, whose life was filled with many achievements, the last few years had been particularly special. "Bessie lived to be 104, and she lived her life the way she wanted to," she said. "And especially the last couple of years, she has been having a ball. Between the play and books, she has been having the time of her life. And she said you really couldn't ask for anything more."         The two sisters had lived so long and seen so much that to some it seemed they might live forever. Born a generation after the Civil War, they had triumphed over Jim Crow, worked in Harlem during its renaissance, borne witness to the feminist and civil rights movements and in recent years, become national celebrities.         Their award-winning memoir has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 19 months, sold more than 900,000 copies and been translated into four foreign languages. They were co-authors of a second book, "The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom" (Kodansha America, 1994) which has sold 160,000 copies. And in April their Mt. Vernon parlor was re-created on Broadway, in a dramatization that earned three Tony nominations.         Bessie Delany often marveled that the nation would be interested in what two elderly black women had to say. She wanted her life seen not so much as a story of blacks or of women, but of America.         The sisters' lives remained simple despite their celebrity. They rose early to eat a breakfast of oatmeal, went to bed after watching the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour on a black-and-white television and had no telephone. They relied mostly on each other for comfort and company. In more than a century, they lived apart for only a few months. And Sarah Delany said many times that it was for her baby sister that she had lived so long.         Annie Elizabeth Delany was born on Sept. 3, 1891, in Raleigh, N.C., the third child of a former slave who became the country's first black Episcopal bishop. Raised on the campus of St. Augustine's College, she and her siblings were well-educated, nurtured and sheltered from the harsher edges of American racism.         But she and her sister often spoke of the first time they were told to go to the back of the trolley car. And they remembered how the staff at the drugstore refused to serve them. Still, Bessie Delany was undaunted. Known as the feistier of the sisters, she was once almost lynched for speaking rudely to a "rebby boy." And she often told tales of how as a child she would sneak a sip from the forbidden side of the water fountain. 'I'd just take a drink of the white water," she said. "It didn't taste any different."         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1911 and worked as a teacher in North Carolina and Georgia to earn the money she needed to continue her education. The few months in 1912 that she and Sadie taught in different parts of the South was the only time they did not live together.         In 1917, the two sisters made their way to New York City. Bessie had planned to become a doctor but ultimately decided to go to dental school. She graduated from Columbia University in 1923 and became the second black woman to work as a dentist in New York.         Known as "Dr. Bessie, Harlem's colored woman dentist," Dr. Delany socialized with Cab Calloway, W. E. B. Du Bois and the doyennes of the Harlem Renaissance. But she treated many of Harlem's poor, and in 27 years of practice never raised her rates. It was $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling, from 1923 until the day she retired, in 1950.         Like her sister Sarah, the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school, she never married or had children. They referred to themselves as "Negro maiden ladies" and lived together in a Harlem apartment, in a Bronx cottage and finally in the Mt. Vernon home they bought in 1957.         With the death of their youngest sister, Laura, in 1993, they were the last survivors among their parents' children. When asked in a 1993 interview if she could account for her and her sister's longevity, Dr. Delany replied, "Honey, we never married; we never had husbands to worry us to death." As for mortality, she said, "I haven't been afraid to live, and I won't be afraid to die."         Recently Dr. Delany had become more frail, Ms. Hearth said. And in the time the two women knew each other, she often spoke about death, though with characteristic sass and humor. "She was worried she was too mean to get into heaven," Ms. Hearth remembered, laughing.         A funeral service is to be held on Thursday at 10:30 A.M. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. And before the curtain rises on "Having Our Say" tonight, there will be a brief tribute at the Booth Theater.         In addition to her sister, Dr. Delany is survived by 14 nieces and nephews.       
         Mary-Scott Welch, a writer and feminist leader who fostered the concept of networking to advance a woman's career, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 75.         The cause was cancer, said Hubert Pryor, her companion.         Ms. Welch wrote "Networking: The Great New Way for Women to Get Ahead" (Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1980) in an era when more women were competing for jobs traditionally dominated by men.         Networking, through individual contacts and professional organizations, became an important technique for women to get career advice and make connections. Such contacts also helped offset the competitive advantage men often enjoyed through their own "old boy" network.         Ms. Welch wrote books on varied topics, including wilderness trips, cooking, travel for teen-age girls and etiquette. She was also a freelance magazine writer whose work was published in Redbook, Esquire, Ladies Home Journal, Woman's Day, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Reader's Digest and Modern Maturity. Ms. Welch also worked as an editor at Pageant and Look magazines and was editor in chief of Homemaker's Digest.         She served on advisory boards for Cornell University's Institute for Women and Work and for the National Organization for Women. In the 1970's, she was the coordinator of NOW's Rape Prevention Committee in New York City.         Ms. Welch, who was known as Scotty, was born in Chicago. After graduating from the University of Illinois, she was in the first group of Waves commissioned by the Navy during World War II.         For most of her career, she lived in New York City. She was married to Barrett Welch, a marketing and advertising executive, from 1943 until his death in 1981.         Her survivors include a son, Farley, of Portland, Ore.; three daughters, Laurie Welch of Washington, Margaret Welch of Seattle, and Molly Welch of Greenfield, Mass., and five grandchildren.       
         Selma Burke, a sculptor of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920's and 30's, died on Tuesday in New Hope, Pa. She was 94.         Ms. Burke came to national attention in 1945 with a 2 1/2-by-3 1/2-foot bronze plaque commemorating President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Four Freedoms. She won the commission for it in a nationwide competition, and President Harry S. Truman spoke at the unveiling in September 1945 at the Recorder of Deeds Building in Washington.         Her other work included likenesses of Booker T. Washington, the abolitionist John Brown and President Calvin Coolidge. She taught art in Pittsburgh for 17 years and operated her Selma Burke Art Center there from 1972 to 1981.       
         Mary Alice Barney Kean, who was long prominent in the historical preservation field, died on Monday at her 223-year-old home, Liberty Hall in Union, N.J. She was 93.         At her death, Mrs. Kean (pronounced cane) was president of the Elizabethtown Historical Foundation in New Jersey. She became the first female trustee of the New-York Historical Society and remained a trustee from 1967 to 1984. Liberty Hall was built for her ancestor William Livingston, New Jersey's first Governor after the American Revolution.         From 1956 through 1960, she was the president general -- the ranking officer -- of the Colonial Dames of America, a Manhattan-based society whose members trace their ancestry to Colonial times. The Colonial Dames own the site on East 61st Street that includes what is now the Abigail Adams Smith Museum, which once stood on an estate owned by President John Adams's daughter Abigail and her husband.         In addition, Mrs. Kean was a governor of the New Jersey Historical Society, which gave her an award for her historic-preservation work. She was active in preservation projects as far afield as Virginia.         Over the years, she was also president of the New York Chapter of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, a directress general of the Society of Daughters of Holland Dames and a trustee of St. Bernard's School in Manhattan and of Cooper Union.         Mr. Kean died in 1949, at 60. He was president of the National State Bank, the Elizabethtown Consolidated Gas Company and the Elizabethtown Water Company, all in Elizabeth, N.J. Thomas H. Kean, the former Governor of New Jersey, is his nephew.         Mrs. Kean is survived by a daughter, Mary Alice Raynolds of Lander, Wyo.; two sons, John, of Vero Beach, Fla., and Stewart, of Union, N.J., 9 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Mary M. Kaufman, a retired lawyer whose practice included cases involving Communism and Nazism, as well as defending the poor, died on Thursday at the Roosevelt division of the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 82 and lived on the West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaufman retired about 1980, after having worked in Manhattan for almost all her career. Some of her other cases involved antiwar activities. She practiced mainly without partners.         In 1951, she was in a Federal courtroom as a defense lawyer when Dashiell Hammett, the writer, and W. Alphaeus Hunton, secretary of the Council on African Affairs, were convicted of criminal contempt and sentenced to six months in prison.         She asked Judge Sylvester Ryan to release Mr. Hunton in her custody or set bail, but he refused.         Judge Ryan had found Mr. Hammett and Mr. Hunton guilty for refusing to name contributors to the bail fund of the Civil Rights Congress, which the Attorney General had designated as a Communist subversive front. Mrs. Kaufman's clients included the bail fund as well as Mr. Hunton.         In the preceding two years, the civil rights group had posted $500,000 or more bail for Communists accused of criminal conspiracy or involved in deportation cases, and it had forfeited more than $100,000 because of bail jumping.         In the 1940's, Mrs. Kaufman worked for the National War Labor and Wage Stabilization Boards, and she was a prosecutor at a war-crimes trial in Nuremberg.         She was born Mary Metlay in Atlanta, but grew up mainly in Brooklyn. After graduating from Brooklyn College, she received her law degree from St. John's University and was admitted to the bar in 1937. She became an original member of the National Lawyers Guild in that year.         Her marriage to Frederick Kaufman ended in divorce. Her second husband, Paul Albert, died last year.         Surviving are a son, Michael, of Beacon Falls, Conn.; two stepdaughters, Janice Albert of Rome and Marilyn Albert of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.       
         Lita Annenberg Hazen, a major philanthropist in medical research whose interests encompassed art, music and education, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was caused by complications from lung cancer, a grandson, Nicholas Polsky, said.         Mrs. Hazen had what her daughter, Cynthia Hazen Polsky, called "a great passion for family" and took a personal interest in the activities she supported. She was a friend of most of the scientists whose institutions she helped, and although she was rarely seen at the glittering social events favored by her peers, she had an active social life centered on the arts and science community.         "Medical discoveries were the most exciting and important things that she could imagine, and I don't remember her ever thinking differently or anything that competed with that," Mrs. Polsky said. "She always envisioned that someone would have a better answer."         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust played an important part in numerous medical and scientific programs on both coasts and made significant contributions to cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery and the Metropolitan Opera.         The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island was one of Mrs. Hazen's principal interests. Hazen Tower, a building at the laboratory, commemorates her participation as a founding donor of its Neuroscience Center.         "Lita Hazen was a wonderful patron of pure science, who enjoyed bright and unusual people who would say things that she wouldn't expect," said Dr. James Watson, the Nobel laureate who is director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. .         Dr. Richard A. Lerner, president of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif, said: "She, like Mary Lasker, was one of the great ladies of American science. These kinds of individuals play important roles in science, far beyond the simple ability to donate money. In fact, they become a magnet around which scientists gather."         Dr. Lerner added, "We are losing our 'great ladies of science,' " and he noted that with their death and with no such new individuals on the horizon, "there will not be much to replace them, and a whole culture that fostered science will come to an end."         The Hazen Trust made possible the purchase of land for a science park at the institute and also financed a chair in immunochemistry. A three-building complex at the institute, to be dedicated on Oct. 15, was named in honor of Mrs. Hazen.         Mrs. Hazen was the sixth of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, who founded Triangle Publications and whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, the Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television interests. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom donated considerable portions of their inherited wealth to public institutions. Her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to Great Britain, is a major benefactor of art institutions, and a sister, Enid Haupt of New York, has devoted much of her fortune to public gardens and horticultural institutions, as well as museums and libraries.         In 1963, Mrs. Hazen was a founding sponsor of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, served as a trustee of its medical center from 1976 and contributed, with her siblings, to the construction of the 33-story Annenberg Building at the center, devoted to medical care, education and research. She also provided support for a neuroendocrinology laboratory at the Mount Sinai Medical Center that was named after her and, from 1979 to 1985, a $100,000 annual award for excellence in clinical research. The award, also named for her and administered by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, was divided between the winner and a young medical scientist chosen by the winner.         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Trust, created in 1952, also established significant scholarships and professorships at Mount Sinai, including the Moses L. and Sadie C. Annenberg Professorship in Molecular Biology, the Annenberg Scholarships in Cardiology and the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professorship in Immunochemistry.         Two grants of $1 million each helped establish and finance the Neurosciences Institute and Neurosciences Research Foundation at Rockefeller University in New York. The grants enabled multidisciplinary groups of scientists from around the world to meet and discuss their work. An atrium garden at the university was named in her honor.         In 1980, she initiated a biomedical workshop program at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and a fellowship that paid for the participation of scientists, physicians and administrators. The workshops were also held at other venues, in Stockholm, Venice and at the University of California at Los Angeles and at San Francisco.         Dr. Martin Meyerson, a former president of the University of Pennsylvania who was chairman of the workshops for a decade, noted that she insured that participants ranged from Nobel laureates to junior scientists and that "she relished providing a bit of luxury to them, a good dinner, putting them up in pleasant places."         Dr. Elaine Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton University who was a longtime friend, said: "She had a remarkable mind, and had she been born in another generation, she might well have done something herself. She understood what research was about, even in its beginning and theoretical stage."         Mrs. Hazen was born in Milwaukee on Oct. 30, 1909, and attended the Calhoun School in New York. In 1936, she married Joseph H. Hazen, a lawyer, film producer, art collector and philanthropist at a double ceremony in which Mrs. Hazen's sister, Enid, was married to the investment banker Ira Haupt.         Mr. Hazen, a former vice president and director of Warner Brothers, wrote the contract between the studio and Edison Vitaphone that resulted in "The Jazz Singer," the first movie with sound. Later, he and Hal B. Wallis, the producer, became partners. Their company, Wallis-Hazen Productions, made films like "Come Back, Little Sheba," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" and "True Grit." During that period, the 1940's to 60's, Mrs. Hazen spent several months each year in Beverly Hills.         It was Mr. Hazen's admiration for Edward G. Robinson's collection of paintings that encouraged Mr. Hazen to become a collector and amass a considerable collection of 20th-century art, including work by Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh, Modigliani, Leger, Kandinsky, Braque and Picasso. The Joseph H. Hazen Foundation still contributes to a number of arts institutions.         "My mother's interest in art developed with her marriage to my father," Mrs. Polsky said. "My father was more passionate about art but my mother also loved museums and paintings. She was particularly interested in the Impressionists."         Mrs. Hazen's trust made sizable contributions to arts institutions, particularly the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In most cases, the trust provided the funds for purchases, among them two important South Indian bronzes, a 14th-century "Yashoda and Krishna" and an 11th-century "Shiva, Parvati and their son Skanda," for the museum's Irving Galleries of South and Southeast Asian Art.         Mrs. Hazen and her husband also established the Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratory in Oncology and Hematology, in memory of their other daughter, at the Marion Davies Hospital, a unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center. Mrs. Cherry died of lymphoma in 1965 at the age of 32.         Mr. Hazen died in 1994 at age 94, after 58 years of marriage. Mrs. Hazen is survived by Mrs. Polsky of Manhattan; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; a brother, Walter H. Annenberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif., and three sisters, Mrs. Haupt, Janet Hooker and Evelyn Hall of Manhattan.         Correction:  October 4, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about Lita Annenberg Hazen, a leading philanthropist in medical research, misstated her age in some editions. She was 85, not 86.       
         Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher, the black honors graduate who needed a backhanded assist from the Supreme Court in 1948 to win admission to the University of Oklahoma law school, died on Wednesday at her home in Oklahoma City. She was 71  and had served for three years on the university's board of regents, the very body that had denied her admission on the basis of her race.         The cause of death was cancer, her daughter, Charlene Factory, said.         By the time Mrs. Fisher applied to the University of Oklahoma law school on  Jan. 14, 1946, the Supreme Court had long held that under the separate-but-equal doctrine, states that sponsored law schools for white students were required to  supply similar training for qualified black students.         Since Oklahoma had no law school for black students, it seemed obvious that the white law school would be required to admit the eminently qualified Mrs. Fisher. An honors graduate of Langston, a state-run black college, she had been  recruited by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to test the state's harsh segregation laws, which, among other things, imposed a fine on any teacher who taught a mixed-race class.         But Oklahoma argued that the state planned to open a black law school someday and kept Mrs. Fisher at bay for more than two years, until January 1948, when the Supreme Court rejected the state's arguments and ordered it to provide her with a legal education.         The court did not specifically order her admission to the university law school, and when Oklahoma tried to satisfy the court by instantly creating a black law school exclusively for Mrs. Fisher, the court turned down her follow-up appeal in February 1948. The court said her original petition had not  addressed the issue of whether the creation of a separate law school for black students would fulfill the state's obligations under the 14th Amendment.         Mrs. Fisher may not have won her immediate point before the Supreme Court, but the arguments raised by her lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, who had denounced the state action as a sham, had a powerful impact on the court as it picked its way  toward the landmark 1954 decision overturning the separate-but-equal doctrine.         And Mrs. Fisher's campaign, which had won wide backing from the state's college teachers and students, had changed the political climate in Oklahoma. With dozens of other black college graduates pressing for admission to Oklahoma  graduate schools, the state swiftly backed down.         Mrs. Fisher was admitted to the law school in June 1949, but under such harsh conditions that any of her fellow students who had not already rallied to her cause were soon won over. She was forced to sit in a raised chair apart from the other students, behind a sign reading "Colored." And she had to use a side door  to the cafeteria and sit at a table separated by a chain from the rest of the room; a uniformed guard was posted to prevent interracial mingling.         But when the guard was not there, Mrs. Fisher later recalled, white students  would climb under the chain to encourage her. "They said, 'Come on, Ada, we've been waiting for you.' "         After Mrs. Fisher graduated in 1951, she worked for a while as a lawyer. She  returned to the university to earn a master's degree in history in 1968, and she joined the faculty at Langston University.         When she was appointed to the seven-member board of regents in April 1992, Mrs. Fisher said she had come full circle.         Mrs. Fisher's survivors all live in Oklahoma City; her husband, Warren, died  several years ago. In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Fisher is survived by a son, Bruce; a sister, Helen Huggins; four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Marilyn J. Morheuser, the lawyer at the center of a 13-year court struggle to make New Jersey's school-financing system more equitable for the state's poorest districts, died on Sunday at her home in Newark. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, according to the Education Law Center, a Newark-based public-interest organization of which she had been executive director since 1979.         Ms. Morheuser was the agency's lead counsel for the plaintiffs in Abbott v.  Burke, a class-action suit brought in 1981 to challenge the state's Quality Education Act of 1980. Arguing on behalf of pupils of the poorest urban schools, the suit asserted that the state had inadequately responded to a State Supreme Court ruling on school financing in 1973. That ruling said that New Jersey's method of school financing violated the State Constitution by failing to guarantee parity between the poorest and the most affluent districts.         The court -- the state's highest -- agreed with the center, ruling in 1990 that the law was still unconstitutional because it did not meet the educational  needs of disadvantaged city children. It ordered that those needs be met.         The law center returned to court the next year, this time to obtain a compliance order, which the Supreme Court in Trenton handed down in 1994. In it, the judges decided that the state must increase the financing of the 30 poorest  districts to a level where their per-pupil outlays would equal the average of the wealthiest districts by fiscal year 1996-97.         The judges demanded that schools in hard-pressed cities like Newark, Camden and Paterson be provided preschool programs, health services and smaller class sizes. The state has the responsibility to provide them rather then leave it up  to the impoverished districts, they wrote.         Ms. Morheuser did not start her professional life at the bar; a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Webster College, she first was a nun. She spent 16 years teaching high school and college around the country, wherever her teaching Roman Catholic order, the Sisters of Loretto, sent her.         Being of a rather radical bent on social issues, she decided that she could achieve more on the outside. She quit the order in 1963 and became an advocate for racial equality in Milwaukee.         In 1973, she received her J.D. at the Rutgers-Newark School of Law. Before she joined the Newark law center she represented such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, the Urban League and the National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Her work attracted many honors, including a Special Achievement Award from the New Jersey Education Association in 1993, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Award from the National Education Association last year. Last May, she was cited as Woman of the Year in Education by the New Jersey League of Women Voters.         Ms. Morheuser is survived by a sister, Marie Casey of St. Louis.       
         Pamela Ann Shaw, who used her battle with AIDS to warn young people about the risks of unprotected sex, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 31  and lived in Greenwich Village.         The cause was AIDS-related lymphoma, her family said.         As a board member of Love Heals, the Alison Gertz Foundation for AIDS Education, she spoke to teen-agers across the country at forums and in classrooms. In May 1994, she received an "Extraordinary Voices" award from Mothers' Voices, a national AIDS awareness and advocacy organization. She also represented Mothers' Voices in Washington, where she met with members of Congress and President Clinton.         At the time of her diagnosis in 1991, Ms. Shaw was a fashion coordinator for  Polo Ralph Lauren. In 1993, she left her job to devote herself to speaking about AIDS. She also worked as a volunteer with Friends Indeed, a New York organization for people with AIDS.         Ms. Shaw graduated from Hunter College, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications. She is survived by her father, Donald H. Shaw, and stepmother, Carol Henning Shaw; her mother, Marijane Shaw, and her sisters, Victoria and Donaly, all of Manhattan.       
         Georgia Neese Clark Gray, whose signature -- as Georgia Neese Clark -- appeared on some $30 billion in paper money while she was the first woman to serve as Treasurer of the United States, died on Thursday at the Brewster Place retirement community in Topeka, Kan. She was 95.         President Harry S. Truman chose Mrs. Gray to be Treasurer in 1949, a year the Democratic Party promised a New Deal for women aspiring to high office. She had been a small-town Kansas banker and a Democratic National Committeewoman since 1936. Her confirmation by the Senate was unanimous.         As the nation's 29th Treasurer, she was in charge of all the bills and coins along with Government securities held in the vaults in Washington. The office is a division of the Treasury Department. When Dwight D. Eisenhower became President in 1953 he selected another woman to succeed her, Ivy Baker Priest, a Utah Republican.         Mrs. Gray was a highly visible figure in Democratic Party affairs, including its national conventions. She was an associate of Eleanor Roosevelt, with whom she often shared the speakers' platform.         After serving as a National Committeewoman for 28 years, Mrs. Gray resigned in 1964 to devote herself full time to banking and other business and farming interests.         Georgia Neese was born in Richland, a rural community of about 200 people 15 miles southeast of Topeka, where her father, Albert, had founded the Richland State Bank in 1892.         She received a bachelor's degree in economics from what is now Washburn University of Topeka in 1921. She then studied acting in New York and toured the country with stock companies for 10 years.         Her stage career ended when her father's health faltered and the arrival of talking pictures diminished the appeal of traveling stage troupes. By then she had married George M. Clark, her manager. They were divorced in the mid-1940's.         At her father's death in 1937 she became president of the bank; in 1964 she moved it to Topeka and renamed it the Capital City State Bank.         Her friend and mentor, Harry Truman, helped to dedicate the new bank. "Mrs. Gray is the only United States Treasurer since the Civil War who really worked at her job," he told the crowd. "She knows money affairs as well as any man, and anyone who brings their money here will know it is in charge of someone who knows how to take care of it."         Mrs. Gray was remarried in 1953 to Andrew J. Gray, a former New York and Washington newspaperman and press agent. He died last year. She is survived by a nephew, Ward Keller of Manhattan.       
         Eleanor Aller Slatkin, a cellist admired in her own right and as part of a celebrated musical family, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         Ms. Aller was born in 1917 in New York. Her father, Gregory Aller, who was a cellist like his father, had immigrated from Russia. Ms. Aller performed in Carnegie Hall at the age of 12 and studied at the Juilliard School.         She played from 1939 to 1968 in the Warner Brothers studio orchestra. She met her husband, Felix Slatkin, a conductor and violinist and the concertmaster of the 20th Century-Fox studio orchestra, at a young artists' competition in the Hollywood Bowl; Mr. Slatkin won.         Their home, in Los Angeles, was a constant haunt of musicians and film stars ranging from Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky to Danny Kaye and Frank Sinatra. And their children went on to musical careers as well: Leonard Slatkin, now in his final season as music director of the St. Louis Symphony and soon to become music director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, and Frederick Zlotkin, a cellist in New York.         Together, Felix Slatkin and Ms. Aller anchored the renowned Hollywood String Quartet throughout its existence, from 1947 to 1961. The group was valued as much for its promotion of 20th-century music as for its compelling performances of classic repertory, and its recordings from the early LP era are still regarded highly.         "My first strong musical memory is of the Villa-Lobos Sixth Quartet, which my parents were rehearsing," Leonard Slatkin once said.         Ms. Aller remained active professionally after the death of her husband, in 1963. She was chairwoman of the string department at DePaul University in Chicago from 1968 to 1970.         She is survived by her sons and by two grandsons, Daniel Slatkin of Washington and Felix Zlotkin of New York.       
         Marguerite Young, the Indiana-born writer who became a darling of the avant-garde and inspired a devoted cult following even as she infuriated and confounded mainstream critics with a single gargantuan novel, died on Friday at  the home of a niece in Indianapolis. She was 87.         Miss Young, a longtime New School writing teacher who began her literary career as an award-winning poet and ended it as a critic, essayist and biographer, was a respected literary figure and cherished Greenwich Village eccentric well before Scribners published her one and only novel, "Miss MacIntosh, My Darling," in 1965.         Afterward she became a legend: the woman with the pageboy haircut who looked like W. H. Auden, wrote like James Joyce, strode through the Village in her signature serapes, had breakfast at Bigelow's with Richard Wright, got drunk at  the White Horse Tavern with Dylan Thomas, palled around with Truman Capote and Carson McCullers, kept a vast collection of dolls in her Bleecker Street apartment and regaled intimates with tales of her romantic conquests.         But for all her range, Miss Young drew a line. By her own account, she welcomed the advances of the poet Allen Tate but rebuffed those of Miss McCullers, telling her at Yaddo in 1946, "Well, Carson, if I could love any woman, it would be you."         Anyone who has not heard of Miss Young, nor read her magnum opus, "Miss MacIntosh, My Darling," need not feel ashamed. Surely one of the most widely unread books ever acclaimed, it has actually been read by comparatively few; by fewer still all the way through.         Indeed, even Miss Young's most ardent admirers (and her admirers, from Anais  Nin and Djuna Barnes to John Gardner, Anne Tyler and a prolific band of feminists, tend to be ardent) concede that the book, variously described as "a mammoth epic," "a massive fable" and "a work of stunning magnitude and beauty" (not to mention "hallucinatory," "ethereal" and "utterly stupefying"), is rather much to take in a single season. Too rich for a repast, it is better savored, they say, like a bedside dish of candy, one bite-sized bonbon at a time.         It is "Miss MacIntosh," sure enough, that the hero of Miss Tyler's "Accidental Tourist" carries with him to dip into for consolation from time to time.         It is a reflection of the book's decidedly mixed reception that while the daily review in The New York Times dismissed it with a sneer, Miss Young's friend, William Goyen, turned a Times Sunday review into a page-long paean.         Narrated by the aptly named Vera Cartwheel, who indulges in nonstop verbal and mental gymnastics during a 948-page bus ride from coastal New England to the heartland of America -- and the interior of the author's mind -- it describes the narrator's largely imaginary quest for the illusory truth about her childhood nursemaid, Miss MacIntosh, who is bald, single-breasted and may or may not have drowned when Miss Cartwheel was 14 years old.         Those who have merely read about "Miss MacIntosh" know it chiefly as a matter of length, from the 18 years it took to write to its very heft. At 1,198 pages and some three-quarters of a million words, it has been described as the longest novel in English ever published in a single volume; later editions, including a  facsimile reissue by Dalkey last year, have split it in two.         Miss Young, who was born in Indianapolis in 1908, was precocious. She wrote her first poems when she was 6, joined the Authors League at 11, published her first poem at Indiana University when she was 19, won first prize in a literary  contest at Butler University when she was 20 and published her first book of poems, "Prismatic Ground," at 28, in 1937, a year after receiving a master's in  Elizabethan and Jacobean literature from the University of Chicago.         Her most significant formative experiences at Chicago seem to have occurred outside the classroom, among them the friendships she struck up with Thornton Wilder, Gertrude Stein and other literary figures, but most notably her part-time job reading to a wealthy addict, Minna Weissenbach, a patron of Edna St. Vincent Millay. Miss Weissenbach and her astonishing flights of drug-induced fantasy inspired the famous "opium lady" in "Miss MacIntosh."         Although she shunned drugs, Miss Young was capable of some pretty astonishing mental flights of her own, both on and off the printed page. In her (more or less) real life, as she told Charles Ruas in an interview included in his "Conversations With American Writers" (Knopf, 1985), she would regularly startle her New School students by announcing that, say, Henry James, had suddenly arrived in the classroom.         And the Greenwich Village she inhabited was a far more interesting place than the one perceived by most:         "I see Emily Dickinson quite often," she told Mr. Ruas, "Virginia Woolf, and  Dickens. Poe, oh, all the time. I see him on misty nights at Sheridan Square when the rain's falling. He's going into a little cigar store to get a cigar. I  am on very close terms with Poe."         Miss Young, who taught at an Indianapolis high school and at the University of Iowa after Chicago, moved to New York in 1943 and burst on the literary scene two years later with the simultaneous publication of "Moderate Fable," which won the best poetry award from the National Academy of Arts and Letters, and "Angel in the Forest," a highly acclaimed account of successive utopian communities at New Harmony, Ind.         After the publication of "Miss MacIntosh," in 1965, she began writing "Harp Song for a Radical," a biography of Eugene V. Debs. Thirty years later the book  is yet to be published, but Victoria Wilson, an editor at Knopf, said yesterday  the "astonishing" work needs just a little more pruning.         It seems the manuscript Miss Young turned in was 2,500 pages long.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Mary Beame, the wife of former Mayor Abraham D. Beame, died on Tuesday at the New York Medical Center. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Beame was married to the former New York Mayor, who served from 1974 to  1978, for almost 68 years. The two met as teen-agers at the University Settlement House, which provided social services for poor Lower East Side residents.         They married in 1928, and Mr. and Mrs. Beame lived in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, for more than four decades, until he became Mayor.         Active in charities, she formed the Jennie Levine Cancer League in memory of  a friend who had died of cancer. She was named Woman of the Year in 1973 by the  National Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Edmond, of Hamilton, Ontario, and Bernard, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Johnnie Tillmon Blackston, who encountered one officious welfare inspector too many and used her anger to help change the system, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 69.         Her family said the cause was diabetes.         Mrs. Blackston turned her rage over the indignities of a belittling system into a grass-roots movement that won widespread changes and helped make the plight of welfare mothers a feminist issue. And if she did nothing else, she proved that a single mother on welfare can be a woman to be reckoned with.         A sharecropper's daughter who was born in Scott, Ark., and never made it through high school, Mrs. Blackston was accustomed to running her own life. When things went bad in Arkansas, for example, she packed up her children, left her first husband behind and struck out for California in search of a better life.         Mrs. Blackston, who worked in a Los Angeles laundry to support her six children, was not prepared for what she had to endure when she eventually went on welfare, and the system was not prepared for her.         It was the early 1960's, a time, she soon found, when welfare inspectors routinely poked through recipients' refrigerators, demanded to know where they had got the money to buy television sets and staged midnight raids to make sure  they were not harboring men, a violation of the rules for women receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children.         When Mrs. Blackston, who had been a union shop steward, took offense at such  invasions of privacy, she sat down and sent anonymous letters to her neighbors at a Watts housing project, asking those on welfare to come to a protest meeting. More than 300 people showed up.         Within months in 1963, Mrs. Blackston and her friends founded Aid to Needy Children-Mothers Anonymous, linked up with other state groups and inspired the creation of the National Welfare Rights Organization. Over the next several years it successfully campaigned for improvements, removing many of the system's paternalistic trappings and establishing welfare as an enforceable right.         Along the way, Mrs. Blackston not only shaped the national welfare debate, but also changed the very terms of the argument, transforming what had been a concern far down the agenda of the civil rights movement into a compelling feminist issue.         Noting that the vast majority of welfare recipients were women and children and likening welfare to a "supersexist marriage," Mrs. Blackston was unsparing in her analysis in addresses to welfare mothers. As she once put it:         "You trade in 'a' man for 'The' Man. But you can't divorce him if he treats you bad. He can divorce you, of course -- cut you off -- any time he wants. But  in that case, 'he' keeps the kids, not you.         " 'The' Man runs everything. In ordinary marriage, sex is supposed to be for  your husband. On A.F.D.C. you're not supposed to have sex at all. You give up control of your body. It's a condition of aid. 'The' Man, the welfare system, controls your money. 'He' tells you what to buy and what not to buy, where to buy it and what things cost."         After serving as the national organization's executive director until a lack  of money forced it to close the Washington office in 1974, Mrs. Blackston returned to California, where she worked as a legislative aid and served on state and local committees concerned with welfare.         She is survived by her second husband, Harvey Blackston; six children, Marcia Evans of Riverside, Calif., Ronald, Auluavance, Josalyn and Tanya Tillmon of Los Angeles, and Caffie Tillmon of Stockton, Calif.; 20 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Hannah Hirschhorn Baumann, a former national vice president of the American Jewish Committee who was active in many charitable, cultural and religious organizations, died on Sunday at her home in Rye, N.Y. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, her son, James, said.         Mrs. Baumann was also a member of the national executive council of the American Jewish Committee and chairwoman of the organization's Westchester chapter. She was a fellow in perpetuity of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an active supporter of the 92d Street Y and Channel 13. She was also a patron of the United Medical Center in Portchester, N.Y., and a member of the board of the Community Synagogue of Rye.         Mrs. Baumann, who was born in Manhattan, was a daughter of Fred Hirschhorn, the founder and chief executive officer of the General Cigar Company, and the former Hannah deRothschild Sharps. Mrs. Baumann graduated in 1937 from Smith College with a bachelor of arts degree. She worked with the American Red Cross during World War II.         Her husband of 50 years, Jay S. Baumann, the president of Terminal Barber Shops and treasurer of Sierra Realty Corporation, died in 1991. In addition to their son, James S. Baumann of Manhattan, Mrs. Baumann is survived by a sister,  Susan Behrend of Philadelphia, and a brother, Fred Hirschhorn Jr. of Old Greenwich, Conn.       
         Ethel T. Chamberlain, who dedicated her life to the Salvation Army and served as national president of its women's organizations from 1974 to 1977, died on Wednesday at a Salvation Army retirement home in Asbury Park, N.J. She was 86.         From the time she attended an open air meeting as a 9-year-old in Malone, N.Y., Mrs. Chamberlain was devoted to the Salvation Army and its principles of service to others. She entered its training school in the Bronx at the age of 17 and spent her entire career with the religious and philanthropic organization.         An inspirational speaker who filled church pews in the 1950's, 60's, and 70's, starting in a time when women were rarely allowed at church pulpits, Mrs.  Chamberlain encouraged women to transcend sexual stereotypes. She served on the  National Board of Directors of Church Women United and was the keynote speaker at the first "International Year of the Woman" Conference in Mexico City in 1975.         Mrs. Chamberlain also organized and directed the Salvation Army's service program during World War II. Among her other jobs for the organization, she was  president of its women's organizations in the West Indies and Caribbean Territory and territorial president of its Women's Services in the southern states and Mexico.         Her husband, William E. Chamberlain, was the Salvation Army's national president.         Mrs. Chamberlain is survived by four daughters, Alice Baxendale of Clearwater, Fla., Jean C. Mosher of DeWitt, N.Y., Roberta C. Schofield of Cazenovia, N.Y., and Carol Appleby of Columbia, S.C.; 10 grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren, and two sisters, Helen Covell of Tucson, Ariz., and Erma Mowers of Syracuse, N.Y.

         Sister Evelyn M. Schneider, a former chief executive of St. Vincent's Hospital and superior general of the Sisters of Charity, the order that founded  it 146 years ago, died on Sunday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 84.         Sister Evelyn's association with St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center spanned five decades. She joined the hospital as director of nutrition in 1945,  retired as president and chief executive officer in 1980 and continued as a volunteer until this year.         The medical center, which has served the people of Greenwich Village and Chelsea since 1849, is operated jointly by the New York congregation of the Sisters of Charity and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.         During Sister Evelyn's nine-year tenure as chief executive, St. Vincent's acquired the National Maritime Union headquarters at Seventh Avenue and 12th Street and made it over as the O'Toole Medical Services Building. The Coleman Pavilion and the Link Pavilion went up in place of outdated buildings, four other buildings underwent major renovations and an apartment building was bought to house residents and nurses.         In 1966, Sister Evelyn was elected to a five-year term as superior of the Sisters of Charity of New York, putting her in charge of 1,200 nuns in 87 schools, colleges, hospitals and child-care centers throughout the archdiocese.         She also played a role in helping her congregation adapt to the many changes  wrought by Vatican II, including an overhaul of its governance. She returned to  St. Vincent's in 1971 to become its president.         Sister Evelyn was also the first woman to be elected president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a position she filled for a year.         Born on Staten Island, Evelyn Schneider entered the Sisters of Charity upon graduating from high school in New Brighton and earned degrees in English from the College of Mount St. Vincent in Riverdale and in nutrition from Seton Hill College in Greensburg, Pa. She received a master's in institutional management from Columbia University.         Sister Evelyn is survived by two sisters, Sister Cecilia Schneider of Manhattan and Marie Schneider of Staten Island.       
         Helen Duprey Bullock, a historian who specialized in preserving the nation's  architectural, romantic and culinary heritages, died on Nov. 1 at her home at the Thomas House retirement community in Washington. She was 90.         In a long and varied career, Mrs. Bullock maintained a singular focus. Whether working as an archivist in Colonial Williamsburg in the 1920's and 30's, cataloguing Thomas Jefferson's papers at the University of Virginia and the Library of Congress in the 1940's or serving as a historical architectural specialist and information officer at the National Trust for Historic Preservation in the 1950's, 60's and 70's, she kept her sights on early American history.         She also brought a certain homeyness to history. If others, for example, saw the elements of colonial history as a process that might begin with a Parliamentary affront and end in a fiery speech in the House of Burgesses, Mrs.  Bullock tended to see the process as something that might begin with sugar and eggs and end in a chess pie.         "History isn't just great political events," she said in 1955. "You can feel  it in fabrics, taste it in cooking and see it in architecture."         A historian with a distinctly open mind, Mrs. Bullock, a native of Oakland, Calif., and a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, was forever  making sharp detours into new and fertile realms.         There was the time in the 1920's, for example, when she was poring over 17th- and 18th-century letters searching for the odd mention of the color of a living  room wall or the hue of a kitchen ceiling in Colonial Williamsburg. But she became so distracted by references to colonial dishes and ingredients that she all but invented an entire new area of historical research with the publication  of her "Williamsburg Art of Cookery" in 1938.         Mrs. Bullock made another detour in the 1940's. While working on Jefferson's  papers, a chance discovery of a piece of music sent to him by Maria Cosway, a friend from his Paris days, led to her 1945 account of their well-documented flirtation, "My Head and My Heart."         She was best known, however, for her scholarly work on colonial recipes and food preparation. Widely regarded as the nation's leading authority on open-hearth cooking, she wrote widely in the field and served as a consultant to historical culinary projects like "The First Ladies Cookbook" and "The American  Heritage Cookbook."         Her Williamsburg cookbook became the bible for the preparation of food in Williamsburg exhibitions, at least until the 1980's, when it was discovered that Mrs. Bullock, an eminently practical woman, had taken certain liberties with the original recipes. Having discovered that 17th-century cooks, lacking ingredients like baking powder and vanilla, had often prepared dishes no discriminating 20th-century diner would eat, she sensibly adapted them to modern tastes and ingredients.         One that required no such adjustments was featured in "The American Heritage  Cookbook":         Starting with three eggs and three-quarters of a cup of sugar, plus a pinch of salt, two tablespoons of melted butter and the grated rind and juice of a lemon, beat the eggs, add the sugar and salt and keep beating until smooth. Then stir in the butter and the lemon rind and juice and pour into a nine-inch pie pan lined with pastry dough. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in a preheated 350-degree oven, or until the top is pale gold.         The resulting chess pie "is not a handsome pie," Mrs. Bullock once noted. Maybe not, but few would deny that history has rarely tasted better.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Evangeline Bruce, the widow of one of the most influential diplomats of the cold war and one of Washington's last grand hostesses, died on Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 77.         Mrs. Bruce -- whose husband, David K. E. Bruce, was the United States envoy to France, Germany, Britain, China and NATO before his death in 1977 -- was known for her legendary soirees at their Georgetown home, at once properly old-fashioned and glitteringly up to the minute. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis once sent her a note praising "the bright path you cut through an age where so few people have grace and imagination and the virtues of another time."         Mrs. Onassis added: "One was so proud as an American to think that other countries recognized you as our very best."         Mrs. Bruce's A-list guests were politicians, literati and celebrities whose names often turned up in newspaper articles, diplomatic cables or campaign-contribution reports: Katharine Graham, Vernon E. Jordan, David Brinkley, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington.         But despite her undisputed place at the center of Washington's social whirl for nearly 50 years, she shunned what she called the "H" word.         "Hostess -- that one I really resent," she once said. She was equally adamant that she did not preside over a salon.         "I don't think any gathering in Washington includes the main ingredients of a salon," she said in 1984. "The French would say that a salon is like- minded people getting together to converse on literature, art, history and politics. The tone has to be light, humorous, witty and, the more elusive the reference, the more prized. In Washington we don't go in for elusive statements. We are not particularly well-read and therefore even the deft allusions are lost."         Instead, Mrs. Bruce said, the talk in Washington tended to be "strictly nuts  and bolts."         "It is rare here to discuss things in conceptual or philosophical terms," she said. "I like living here better than anyplace else in the world, but the first  thing I notice when I leave to spend some time in Europe is the conversation, the variety, the nonphilistine approach."         A diplomat's daughter who had lived in a dozen countries before going to Radcliffe in 1937 to study Chinese history and French literature, Mrs. Bruce moved to London during World War II to work in the London office of the O.S.S.,  the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency. One day her boss began questioning her about the languages she spoke.         "I suppose you speak Italian," he said. She said yes.         "German." She nodded.         "French." Again, yes.         "Well, you certainly don't speak Japanese and Chinese," he said.         "Well," she said, "it happens that I do, sir, because my father was stationed in both countries."         With that, David K. E. Bruce invited her to lunch.         "I know it's a tired old cliche," Mrs. Bruce told Vanity Fair magazine, "but  we were partners in every sense of the word. For instance, from day one in Paris, David expected me to be solely responsible for all the diplomatic entertaining, which forced me to get over my shyness."         Her husband, who worked for every President from Harry S. Truman to Gerald R. Ford, was called out of retirement to head the American delegation at the Paris  peace talks on Vietnam in 1970, and again in 1973 to be chief of the United States mission to Beijing. There Mrs. Bruce learned to address Chinese as "comrade," except when speaking to two male servants who were addressed as "mister."         In China, Mrs. Bruce found that she had more time to herself than in earlier  postings. She spent some of it writing a book-length manuscript about the year 1795 in France.         She lined up a publisher but shelved the project until a couple of years ago, when she rewrote the manuscript as "Napoleon and Josephine: An Improbable Marriage." Its publication by Lisa Drew/Scribner earlier this year was met with  interest in some quarters, incredulity in others. William Doyle, in The New York Times Book Review, called it "an extremely readable account of their lives together, and an easy and attractive introduction to Napoleon and his private life" despite a number of errors of fact, date and sequence.         Mrs. Bruce started a Washington organization for runaways and abused teen-agers, the Sasha Bruce Youthwork Inc., in the 1970's. It was named for Mrs. Bruce's 28-year-old daughter, Alexandra, who was known as Sasha and was shot to  death on the family estate in Virginia in 1975. Her husband of three months was  later indicted. By then he had moved to Athens and, as a Greek national, he could not be extradited.         Mrs. Bruce is survived by two sons, David Jr. and Nicholas.       
         Nancy LaMott, a cabaret singer and recording artist whose unadorned, heartfelt interpretations of songs epitomized the best of what could be called an all-American style of traditional pop singing, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 43.         The cause was cancer, said her manager, Scott Barnes.         In the last two years, Ms. LaMott had achieved a national reputation, and her recently released fifth album, "Listen to My Heart" (Midder Music), recorded with the arranger Peter Matz, received critical acclaim. In a cabaret field typified by showy histrionics, Ms. LaMott was a singularly unaffected voice. She brought to everything she sang a clean, clear sense of line, impeccable enunciation and a deep understanding of how a good song could convey a lifetime's experience.         Ms. LaMott, born in Midland, Mich., was a self-taught musician who began singing with her father's band in her hometown. In the late 1970's, she moved to San Francisco, where she sang at the Plush Room and other local clubs. Arriving  in New York in the early 1980's, she worked as a cocktail waitress and a singer  at the Duplex and Don't Tell Mama. She also did demonstration records of theater songs by composers like Alan Menken, Marvin Hamlisch and Cy Coleman. In 1983, she was featured in the cabaret revue "It's Better With a Band," a show at Don't Tell Mama that featured the lyrics of David Zippel. The next year, she teamed up with Christopher Marlowe, who became her longtime accompanist and musical director.         In 1990, she met the composer David Friedman and his companion, Mr. Barnes, who became her manager. Together with Mr. Zippel they produced her first album,  "Beautiful Baby," in 1991. Four more recordings followed. For her second album,  "Come Rain or Come Shine: The Songs of Johnny Mercer" (1993), she was named best female vocalist by the Manhattan Association of Cabarets. The following year, her third album, "My Foolish Heart," was chosen record of the year by the same organization. Her fourth album, a holiday collection, "Just in Time for Christmas," was released a year ago.         Ms. LaMott was plagued with illness for much of her life. At 17, she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, an ulcerative intestinal disorder. An operation  in 1993 reversed many of her symptoms and allowed her recording and singing career to blossom. In addition to her recordings, she made television appearances on "Good Morning America," "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee," "Today" and "The Charles Grodin Show."         She is survived by her husband, Peter Zapp, an actor whom she married on her  deathbed; by her parents, Judy and Jack LaMott, and three brothers and three sisters.       
         Madge Sinclair, an actress who appeared on television and in film, died on Wednesday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 57.         She had had leukemia for 13 years, said an ABC spokeswoman, Julian Myers.         Ms. Sinclair, who played Bell in the 1977 ABC mini-series "Roots," was born  in Kingston, Jamaica. She was a schoolteacher until she moved to New York City at the age of 30.         Her early credits included the role of Clytemnestra in the New York Shakespeare Festival production of "The Wedding of Iphigenia" in 1971. She made  her film debut in 1974, opposite Jon Voight in "Conrack."         She received five nominations for Emmy Awards, and won for her work in the critically acclaimed "Gabriel's Fire," which ran on ABC from 1990-92. She played the owner of a cafe frequented by the title character, a former convict played by James Earl Jones.         She also appeared on the television shows "Grandpa Goes to Washington," "Trapper John, M.D.," "Me and the Boys" and "Look Away."         Her most recent movie work was as the voice of the Lion Queen in "The Lion King" (1994), and she played Eddie Murphy's mother in "Coming to America" (1988).         She was the recipient of several awards, including the Order of Distinction bestowed by the Prime Minister of Jamaica and two Image Awards from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Ms. Sinclair also appearing in seven plays at the Los Angeles Theater Center  and in "Division Street" at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.         She is survived by her husband, Dean Compton, her sons, her mother and a sister.       
         Rosalind K. Loring, a specialist in continuing education, adviser to Federal  agencies and university administrator, died on Dec. 18 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Over the years, Mrs. Loring was a consultant to the National Endowment for the Humanities, president of the Adult Education Association/ U.S.A. and a board member of the National University Extension Association. She retired in 1984 as associate provost for extended education at the University of Southern California.         She was born in Philadelphia and graduated in art and education from the University of California at Los Angeles, where she also earned a master's degree in adult education. In the late 1950's, U.C.L.A. engaged her to implement her ideas on improving the educational and professional status of women. To that end she developed programs of continuing education for women and similar ones to raise the educational levels of veterans.         Mrs. Loring is survived by her husband of more than 50 years, Murrel Loring;  a daughter, Sherry Loring-Warren of Los Angeles; a son, David, of Reno; a sister, Lois Mudrick of Los Angeles, and three grandsons.       
         Irene Corbally Kuhn, a journalist who traveled on five continents and wrote books as well as newspaper and magazine articles and columns, died yesterday at  the Briar Crest-Deaconess Nursing Home in Concord, Mass., where she had lived for the last year. She was 97 and had spent all of her earlier life, when she was not traveling, in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kuhn's many writings included a volume of memoirs, "Assigned to Adventure" (1938), which Augusta Tucker, writing in The New York Times Book Review, called "the story of an unafraid woman who has seen a lot of the world as a newspaper reporter" and added that it "has pace, it has interest, it has color, and the woman who wrote it has sense: a quality not consistently present  in the kiss-and-tell books of some of the male correspondents.".         Mrs. Kuhn was born in Greenwich Village and studied at Marymount College in  Tarrytown, N.Y., and at Columbia University. After reporting for The Syracuse Herald and working in Paris for The Chicago Tribune, she went to China in 1922 and became a reporter for the English-language Shanghai Evening News and then for the International News Service in Honolulu.         In 1926 she returned to New York City, joined The Daily News, and concentrated on feature writing. She spent a few years as a staff reporter for The Honolulu Star-Bulletin, and after returning briefly to The Daily News and working for other news organizations, in 1939 she joined the National Broadcasting Company, for which she reported and worked in other capacities until 1950.         In 1939, she was a founding member of the Overseas Press Club of New York.         After leaving NBC, she wrote a syndicated column and did other writing, including reminiscences that appeared in Gourmet magazine in the 1970's and 1980's.         Her husband, Bert L. Kuhn, also a journalist, died in 1926 after four years of marriage. She is survived by a daughter, Rene Kuhn Bryant of Lexington, Mass.; a granddaughter, and two great-granddaughters.       
         Elaine Sulka, the director of the National Shakespeare Company and of the Cubiculo theater in New York City, died on Dec. 24 at her home in Manhattan. She was 61.         The cause was a heart attack, said Joanne Joseph, a friend.         Ms. Sulka trained in sociology and received a master's degree from Brown University before turning to theater. She studied acting with Jules Irving and Herbert Blau at the San Francisco Actors Workshop and with Paul Mann in New York. She performed in many regional theater productions and on and off Broadway through last summer, including Goneril to Morris Carnovsky's Lear at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn.; the title role in "Medea" at Circle in the Square; Olivia in "Twelfth Night" at the Globe Theater in San Diego, and a lead role in the Broadway production of Paddy Chayefsky's "Passion of Josef D." In recent years she toured in two one-woman productions, "Mothers" and "A Woman in Love -- With Shakespeare."         Ms. Sulka founded the National Shakespeare Company in 1963 with Philip Meister, her husband, with the aim of taking Shakespeare to schools and universities on bus tours throughout the country. In 1968, the couple founded the Cubiculo, a small, lively center for new theater, dance, film and poetry, in a brownstone in Clinton. The center, which included a 75-seat theater and a studio theater, was a popular and affordable place to experiment, with Ms. Sulka, tall, dark-eyed and stylishly exuberant, serving at times as the evening's hostess. The Cubiculo is the home of the National Shakespeare Company, which will continue under the direction of Greg Lombardo and Tom Trudgeon.         Mr. Meister died in 1982. Ms. Sulka is survived by her mother, Anna, of Maspeth, Queens; a daughter, Deirdre, of El Paso, Tex., and two sisters, Barbara Bonomi and Marie Schaefer. A memorial service is to be held on Jan. 21 at 6 P.M. at the Cubiculo, 414 West 51st Street.       
         Nancy Kelly, an award-winning stage actress who also appeared in scores of films, died on Jan. 2 at her home in Bel Air, Calif. She was 73.         The cause was diabetes-related illness, her family said when they reported her death yesterday.         Ms. Kelly started as a child model and successful child movie actress. Hard work found its reward in the universal acclaim she received during the 1954-55 Broadway season when she appeared in Maxwell Anderson's play "The Bad Seed."         She played a mother who realizes that her daughter (Patty McCormack) is a murderous psychotic and tries to atone for her crimes. Her performance won her a Tony Award.         Walter Kerr, writing in The New York Herald Tribune, remarked: "Though Miss Kelly has done attractive work on Broadway before, she has never really prepared us for the brilliance of the present portrait." Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times that Ms. Kelly "never forgets that she is not playing a figure in a melodrama, but a human character tortured beyond human endurance."         Ms. Kelly and Ms. McCormack re-created their characters in the film version, which opened to more mixed reviews in 1956.         Nancy Kelly was born in Lowell, Mass., to a New York ticket broker and an artist's model; the family moved to New York shortly after her birth. She was regularly employed as a child model and took part in dramatic productions while attending the Bentley School for Girls.         As a child she appeared in some 50 Hollywood movies and from 1938 in leading roles. Broadway began to pay attention when she portrayed Blossom in Rachel Crothers's play "Susan and God" in 1937. She also won praise for her work in Clifford Odets's play "The Big Knife" (1949), and Wolcott Gibbs's "Season in the Sun" (1950).         She was less successful in comedy as the lead in "A Mighty Man Is He" (1960), in which she played a beleaguered wife. Over the years Ms. Kelly was also seen in Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and "Box-Mao-Box; Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung." She last performed in the 1970's, appearing onstage in Los Angeles and with the national touring company of Neil Simon's "Gingerbread Lady."         Her film credits included "Jesse James" (1939), "Stanley and Livingstone" (1939), "To the Shores of Tripoli" (1942), "Woman in Bondage" (1944) and "Crowded Paradise" (1956).         Ms. Kelly's three marriages ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Kelly Caro Rosenberg, of Howell, N.J., and three granddaughters.       
         Dr. Barbara Jelavich, a prominent scholar of Eastern European history with a particular interest in the Balkan countries, died on Saturday at Bloomington Hospital in Bloomington, Ind. She was 71 and lived in Bloomington.         The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for Indiana University.         She was on the faculty of Indiana University from 1961 until she retired as distinguished professor emeritus of history in 1993. During that time, she was the author or co-author of 17 books about Russia, the Balkans, and the Ottoman and Hapsburg empires. Some were written with her husband, Charles, also a professor emeritus of history at Indiana.         Her areas of expertise included Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Yugoslavia.         Born Barbara Brightfield in Belleville, Ill., she grew up in Berkeley, Calif. She received three degrees in history from the University of California at Berkeley, including, in 1948, a Ph.D. She started her academic career at Berkeley as a junior research historian at the Institute of Slavic Studies and a lecturer in history.         She joined the Indiana faculty as a lecturer in 1961 and by 1967 was a full professor in the history department.         Among her works currently in print are "History of the Balkans: 18th and 19th Centuries" (Cambridge University Press, 1983); "History of the Balkans: 20th Century" (Cambridge, 1983); "Russia and the Formation of the Romanian Empire" (Cambridge, 1984); "Modern Austria: Empire and Republic" (Cambridge, 1987); "Russia and the Rumanian National Cause" (Archon reprint, 1974), and "Russia's Balkan Entanglements, 1806-1914" (Cambridge, 1991).         Besides her husband, survivors include two sons, Mark, of Maryville, Mo., and Peter, of Austin, Tex., and two grandchildren.       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. She was 104.         Surrounded by family members at her rambling, white-shingled seaside home on Cape Cod, she died of complications from pneumonia at 5:30 P.M., her son, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said. She had been in a wheelchair, partly paralyzed and mostly silent, since 1984, when she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes.         "Mother passed away peacefully today," Senator Kennedy said last night. "She had a long and extraordinary life, and we loved her deeply. To all of us in the Kennedy and Fitzgerald families, she was the most beautiful rose of all."         President Clinton extended his condolences last night. "Very few Americans have endured as much personal sacrifice for their country as Rose Kennedy," the President said. "She played an extraordinary role in the life of an extraordinary family. Hillary and I extend our deep-felt sympathy to the Kennedy family."         Funeral arrangements were incomplete last night.         In recent years, Mrs. Kennedy, a devout Roman Catholic who often said she drew on her faith to cope with sorrows, had remained out of the public eye that followed her nearly all her life. She spent her time reciting the rosary daily, attending Mass celebrated by a priest in her living room on Sundays and sitting on a porch overlooking Nantucket Sound on sunny weekends while her children and grandchildren paid visits and regaled her with their latest adventures.         They were the twilight years of a life she once described as a series of agonies and ecstasies, a life born into fortune and politics, wed to ambition, graced by the exhilaration of a son in the White House and others on Capitol Hill, but touched by violent death, illness, scandal and other adversities. Tragedy Intrudes On a Privileged Life         Raised in Boston, the daughter of John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, a Boston mayor and Massachusetts Congressman, the young Rose Fitzgerald knew a life most only dream of -- private schools, debutante balls, summers on Cape Cod, winters in Palm Beach, trips to Europe and Asia, and hosts of suitors entranced by her young Irish charm and directness.         She was married at 24 to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the son of a saloon keeper, and a dynamo who amassed holdings in banking, real estate, liquor, films and Wall Street that grew to an estimated $500 million. Despite controversy over his wealth and isolationist views, he was posted to the Court of St. James's as Ambassador to Britain from 1938 to 1941.         There were meetings with kings, presidents and popes, and the satisfaction of children on the national stage, in Congress and in the White House. Although hers was a supporting role, her erect bearing, careful grooming and tireless work in her sons' campaigns, made her a figure of public interest in her own right.         She was not a powerful public speaker, but family members called her expert at gauging her audiences. On a single evening, they said, she could don a head scarf and mingle with workmen's wives at a stop in a blue-collar neighborhood, then rush off to campaign at a country club, changing in the back seat of a car into a mink coat and stylish shoes. It was a whirl that led to many successes.         But sorrow intruded time and again. Four of her nine children died in their prime. President Kennedy was slain by an assassin in Dallas in 1963. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot by another assassin in Los Angeles during the 1968 Presidential campaign. Her eldest son, Joseph Jr., a Navy pilot, was killed when his plane exploded over the English Channel on a mission in World War II. And a daughter, Kathleen, died in a plane crash in 1948.         Her eldest daughter, Rosemary, was diagnosed as mentally retarded and has lived in a nursing home for 40 years. In 1969, a car driven by Senator Edward Kennedy ran off a bridge on Martha's Vineyard and a young aide, Mary Jo Kopechne, was killed. Later that year, Mrs. Kennedy's husband, who had suffered a stroke in 1961 that left him an invalid, also died.         For Mrs. Kennedy, who had 30 grandchildren and 41 great-grandchildren, the sorrows continued in recent years. A grandson, David, the son of Robert, was found dead in a Florida hotel room in 1985, the victim, officials said, of an apparent overdose of cocaine and Demerol. And Mrs. Kennedy's former daughter-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, died of cancer last May.         Four years ago, at celebrations marking her 100th birthday, Senator Kennedy, her last surviving son, told 400 family members and friends, "In the chaos of our household, she was the quiet at the center of the storm, the anchor of our family, the safe harbor to which we always came."         There were many books that explored the Kennedys and their conduct, and most touched on Rose Kennedy. "J.F.K.: Reckless Youth," by Nigel Hamilton (Random House, 1992), called the President's mother a chilly, remote woman, obsessed with religion, personal hygiene and designer clothing, and incapable of giving her children the affection they craved.         The assertions prompted a blistering response, published on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, by four of her children: Senator Kennedy, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Patricia Kennedy Lawford and Jean Kennedy Smith. "We categorically reject the misjudgments, mischaracterizations, insinuations and outright falsehoods about our family relationships portrayed in the book," they wrote.         "Our parents gave us love, support and encouragement throughout their lives. Contrary to the malicious portrayal in this book, they were devoted and caring parents who lavished affection and attention on all of us."         "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys," by Doris Kearns (Simon & Schuster, 1987), also said that Rose and Joseph Kennedy were less than ideal parents, that Mrs. Kennedy eventually became the more remote and even withdrew from her husband into the isolated comfort of her religion, because of "the complicatedly intense relationship she had experienced with her father so many years before."         In her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974), Mrs. Kennedy said that she had devoted herself to her children and that there had been many satisfactions in her role. "What greater aspiration and challenge are there for a mother than the hope of raising a great son or daughter?" she wrote, and called motherhood "a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession." Early Introduction To Political Life         Rose Fitzgerald was born in Boston on July 22, 1890, the oldest of six children of an exuberant politician and his wife, the former Josephine Mary Hannon. After serving in the Massachusetts Legislature and the United States House of Representatives, her father became Mayor of Boston in 1906.         Her mother was a quiet woman who disliked the limelight, and Rose tasted politics early, parading through the streets with her father and attending public gatherings where the beer and the blarney flowed like the lilt of brogue. He introduced her to Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, and to his wealthy, influential friends.         She graduated with honors from Dorchester High School at 15, and wanted to enter Wellesley College, but her parents thought she was too young and enrolled her at the Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart in Purchase, N.Y. She was also sent to Blumenthal Academy, a finishing school run by German nuns, in the Netherlands, where girls majored in French and German.         The Irish were still being snubbed by the Boston Brahmins in those days, and despite her stylish education and attractive, self-assured manner, she was blackballed from the Junior League. She shrugged off the slight and formed her own group, the Ace of Clubs.         There were many suitors, including Sir Thomas Lipton, a tea merchant and yachtsman. But she chose Joseph Kennedy, a political lieutenant of her father. Mr. Fitzgerald did not particularly like Mr. Kennedy. He was too brash and early in the courtship, was made unwelcome in the Fitzgerald house.         But he proposed on the sidewalk outside, and Rose made it clear that she was going to marry him, with or without her father's permission. Mr. Fitzgerald grudgingly blessed the marriage, which took place on Oct. 7, 1914. Soon, Mr. Kennedy gained control of the Columbia Trust Company in Boston and, at 25, became the youngest bank president in the country.         Moving into real estate and liquor interests, he also made fortunes on Wall Street and in Hollywood films. And there were many rumors of infidelity with socialites and movie stars, notably the actress Gloria Swanson.         Meantime, his wife stayed home on Beale Street in Brookline, near Boston, giving birth to and raising her children. Joseph Jr. was born in 1915, followed by John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean and Edward.         In 1938, Mrs. Kennedy accompanied her husband to the Court of St. James's and was formally welcomed by King George VI. By 1941, the Kennedys were back in the United States.         Mrs. Kennedy took Rosemary, then 22, to several specialists to determine why she had been "slow" since birth. The diagnosis was mental retardation. She was placed in a home in Wisconsin, where she still lives. According to Ms. Kearns's book, she was also given a lobotomy upon orders of her father. Three years later, Mrs. Kennedy's oldest son, Joseph Jr., was killed in the war.         After the war, as John's political career began, Mrs. Kennedy took to the campaign trail with extraordinary zest and considerable effectiveness, speaking at women's functions and shaking hands and chatting at rallies and other functions.         Acquaintances recalled that she was remarkably frank in her conversations with voters and reporters, sometimes even embarrassingly so. Once when there were complaints that large amounts of Kennedy money were being spent on a race, she told a reporter, "It's our money, and we're free to spend it any way we please." An Inauguration Of a Son         The high point of her life, perhaps, was the inauguration of her son John as the 35th President of the United States on Jan. 20, 1961. The gown she wore to his Inaugural Ball was the one she wore when she was introduced to King George VI 20 years earlier.         Her son Robert was appointed Attorney General, and Edward was elected to fill John's unexpired Senate term. Mrs. Kennedy continued to travel widely, appearing with her sons. Her other children were not in the center of public life, although Eunice married Sargent Shriver, who became director of the Peace Corps and the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee in 1972, Jean was named the Ambassador to Ireland by President Clinton, and Patricia married the actor Peter Lawford, who died in 1984.         Her grandchildren include the son and daughter of President Kennedy, John F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who has been active in family interests, including the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. Another grandchild, William Kennedy Smith, was in the news in 1991 when a Florida woman accused him of rape at the Kennedy estate in Palm Beach; he was later acquitted.         Several of her grandchildren have followed the family tradition of entering politics. Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Robert's oldest son, became a United States representative from Massachusetts in 1986, replacing the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill, who retired.         Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Robert's oldest child, was elected Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in 1994; Patrick Kennedy, one of Edward's sons, was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1994 after serving as a Rhode Island state legislator. And Mark Shriver, the son of Eunice, was elected in 1994 to the Maryland House of Delegates.         In 1985, the City of Boston dedicated a one-acre rose garden to Mrs. Kennedy. "I'm one of the most fortunate people in the world," she told an interviewer. "Even though my life has been scarred by tragedy, I have never lost this feeling. God has held us all in his hand."       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. She was 104.         Surrounded by family members at her rambling, white-shingled seaside home on Cape Cod, she died of complications from pneumonia at 5:30 P.M., her son, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said. She had been in a wheelchair, partly paralyzed and mostly silent, since 1984, when she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes.         Mother passed away peacefully today," Senator Kennedy said last night. "She had a long and extraordinary life, and we loved her deeply. To all of us in the Kennedy and Fitzgerald families, she was the most beautiful rose of all."         President Clinton extended his condolences last night. "Very few Americans have endured as much personal sacrifice for their country as Rose Kennedy," the President said. "She played an extraordinary role in the life of an extraordinary family. Hillary and I extend our deep-felt sympathy to the Kennedy family."         Funeral arrangements were incomplete last night.         In recent years, Mrs. Kennedy, a devout Roman Catholic who often said she drew on her faith to cope with sorrows, had remained out of the public eye that followed her nearly all her life. She spent her time reciting the rosary daily, attending Mass celebrated by a priest in her living room on Sundays and sitting on a porch overlooking Nantucket Sound on sunny weekends while her children and grandchildren paid visits and regaled her with their latest adventures.         They were the twilight years of a life she once described as a series of agonies and ecstasies, a life born into fortune and politics, wed to ambition, graced by the exhilaration of a son in the White House and others on Capitol Hill, but touched by violent death, illness, scandal and other adversities.         Tragedy Intrudes On a Privileged Life         Raised in Boston, the daughter of John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, a Boston mayor and Massachusetts Congressman, the young Rose Fitzgerald knew a life most only dream of -- private schools, debutante balls, summers on Cape Cod, winters in Palm Beach, trips to Europe and Asia, and hosts of suitors entranced by her young Irish charm and directness.         She was married at 24 to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the son of a saloon keeper, and a dynamo who amassed holdings in banking, real estate, liquor, films and Wall Street that grew to an estimated $500 million. Despite controversy over his wealth and isolationist views, he was posted to the Court of St. James's as Ambassador to Britain from 1938 to 1941.         There were meetings with kings, presidents and popes, and the satisfaction of children on the national stage, in Congress and in the White House.

Correction:  March 17, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Jan. 23 of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy misstated both the name and the location of the school from which she graduated in 1910. At that time, it was known as the Academy of the Sacred Heart, not Manhattanville College, and it was located in Manhattanville, N.Y., not Purchase. A recent letter from a reader pointed out the error.       
         Anne D. Campbell, an official of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 50 and had homes in Washington and Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, according to Steve Selby, a Washington business associate.         Mrs. Campbell, a longtime resident of Shrewsbury, N.J., rose to prominence in the state party in the 1970's. She was serving her fourth term on the National Committee's executive committee in Washington. She joined that panel more than 10 years ago and was the co-chairwoman of the party's rules and bylaws committee for the last several years.         Born in Brownsville, Tex., she grew up in New York City, attended Monmouth College and entered national politics in 1972. She was a past vice chairman of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee and in 1977 became the first woman to be elected president of the National Association of State Chairmen. She also held senior posts on the staff of Gov.  Brendan T. Byrne of New Jersey and was an adviser to Senator Bill Bradley in his successful campaigns.         She was the political director at the Democratic National Convention in 1988, as well as director of candidate and Congressional relations at the 1992 national convention.         Mrs. Campbell was a partner in the legislative consulting firm of Campbell, Falk & Selby in Washington, which she founded in 1988.         She is survived by her husband of 30 years, George Campbell; a daughter, Heather, of Santa Fe, N.M.; and two sons, James, also of Santa Fe, and Nial, of Manhattan.       
         Blanche G. Etra, a lawyer and philanthropist who played an important role in the development of Yeshiva University, died on Wednesday in her home in Manhattan. She was 79.         The cause was leukemia, said a son, Donald, of Los Angeles.         The Etra family had long supported Yeshiva. Mrs. Etra expanded that role by helping to found, in 1953, the National Women's Division of Yeshiva's newly chartered Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She was its first president and became honorary president in 1962.         When the university founded the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in the mid-1970's, she was named to its Board of Directors and served as secretary from 1986 until her death. She also was the first woman to serve on the medical college's Board of Overseers.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. Etra graduated from Barnard College in 1935. In 1938, she received a law degree from Columbia University and began a private practice. After the death of her husband of 38 years, Harry, in 1977, she joined the law firm of Etra & Etra, where her partner was her brother-in-law, Max Etra, chairman of Yeshiva's board from 1953 to 1977.         Mrs. Etra was on the national Board of Directors for the United Jewish Appeal and served as a director of Seton Hill College in Greensburg, Pa., and the Brookdale Center of Hunter College.         Besides Donald, she is survived by two other sons, Aaron and Marshall, both of Manhattan; a sister, Helen Rachmil of Los Angeles; a brother, Morton Goldman of Manhattan, and six grandchildren. A fourth son, Jonathan, died in 1991.       
         Sylvia Bernstein Seaman, a writer and one of the last active members of the suffragist movement, died on Sunday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 94.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said. She published a book about that disease 30 years ago, "Always a Woman: What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer," the first by someone outside the medical profession. "It was considered daring at the time," she later said, "but it changed attitudes, I think."         She became a confirmed suffragist in high school and first marched for the right to vote as a student in 1915. While in college, she took part in the parades of August 1920 celebrating the 19th Amendment that secured women's suffrage nationwide.         In 1970, she was one of five veterans of 1920 chosen to lead the 50th anniversary parade on Fifth Avenue.         She was in the lead again in a 1980 march marking the 60th anniversary of victory. She made her final public appearance last August with an address on feminism and women in American history when the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women marked the 74th anniversary.         Sylvia Bernstein was born in Manhattan and graduated from Cornell University. She taught high school English in New York City before turning to writing.         With her Cornell roommate, Frances Schwartz, she wrote novels under the name Francis Sylvin. They chose a male pseudonym because they thought that female authors were not taken seriously.         In one novel, "Miracle Father" (1952), a couple produced a child by artificial insemination. It was republished in 1968 as "Test-Tube Father."         Mrs. Seaman underwent a radical mastectomy in 1955, an experience that led her to write "Always a Woman," published in 1965. It was a rarely discussed topic, which she also wrote about for magazines and newspapers.         In the 1970's, she resumed writing travel pieces and humor, including her last book, "How to Be a Jewish Grandmother" (1979). Travel was her avocation, and she visited more than 100 countries.         Her personal and professional papers are in the collection of the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Radcliffe College.         She is survived by her husband of 69 years, William Seaman; two sons, Gideon, of Manhattan and Jonathan, of Brooklyn, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Millicent Hirsh Lang, a Bronx native who became a top-ranked women's tennis player in the 1930's and 1940's, died at a hospice in Boca Raton, Fla., on Friday. She was 78 and lived most of her life in Great Neck, L.I.         She died of a stroke, said her husband, Nathaniel Lang.         Mrs. Lang began playing tennis when she was 8 years old on public courts in the Bronx. She won her first public tournament at age 11. As a junior player, she captured three titles in the 1930's and at age 16 won the singles and doubles trophies at the United States Ladies Tennis Association National Indoors Tournament in 1933.         By the time she was 19, Mrs. Lang was a veteran on the women's tennis circuit. In the early 1940's, she was ranked 14th in United States women's singles and No. 1 in the Eastern states. In her later years, she played a prominent role in the Eastern Tennis Association.         She is survived by her husband; her daughters, Geraldine Jacobs of Woodstock, N.Y., Sarah Cleary of Warwick, N.Y., and Elizabeth Marino of Great Neck, and seven grandchildren.       
         Margaret Wade, who coached Delta State to three national championships in six seasons in the 1970's and in 1986 became the first woman named to the Basketball Hall of Fame, died yesterday at the Bolivar County Hospital in Cleveland, Miss. She was 82.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         A native of Cleveland, Miss Wade was a star on the Delta State team there in the late 1920's before barnstorming with a semipro team known as the Tupelo Red Wings.         Long before her college triumphs, Miss Wade had earned a reputation as a formidable coach on the high school level. In 21 years at Cleveland High School, she led the team to a 453-89-6 record. It was achieved, one of her former players said yesterday, by a combination of inspiring her players' devotion and working them to distraction.         "She all but killed us doing calisthenics," said Sue King.         After her high school career, Miss Wade joined Delta State, initially as a physical education instructor. The school had dropped women's basketball in 1932 as unsuitably rough for proper young ladies, but when college officials decided to revive it in 1973, Miss Wade was the obvious choice to coach.         Over the next six seasons her teams compiled a 157-23 record, won three national championships and set a record of 51 consecutive victories, from 1974 to 1976.         During her final season, 1978-79, the annual Wade Trophy was established to honor the outstanding college player.         She is survived by a brother, Broughton Wade.       
         Ada Lublin Goldberg, for many years an advocate for the poor and homeless on Long Island, died Sunday at Hospice-by-the Sea in Boca Raton, Fla. A resident of North Bellmore, L.I., she was 67.         The cause was renal failure stemming from kidney cancer, said her son, Lawrence A. Goldberg.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. Goldberg became active in the League of Women Voters 40 years ago when she joined its Nassau County chapter. At her death, she was the chapter's director of social policy.         In conjunction with her work for the league, she served on the board of the Health and Welfare Council of Nassau County, a coalition of social-welfare agencies and service organizations serving the poor. She received the council's Community Service Award last year.         She also served on the executive board of the Nassau / Suffolk Coalition for a National Health Care Plan. In addition, she was active in the Child Care Council of Nassau County and the Nassau / Suffolk Coalition for the Homeless.         Besides her son, a resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Goldberg is survived by her husband, Stanley; a daughter, Helene of New Haven; two brothers, Howard Lublin of Manhattan and Seldon Lublin of Newburgh, N.Y., and a granddaughter.       
         Sister Ann Gillen, executive director of the Interreligious Task Force on Soviet Jewry from 1972 to 1987, died on Jan. 14 at the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus convent in Rosemont, Pa. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said Sister Gloria Coleman, a member of the order.         As the leader of the Interreligious Task Force, which was established in 1972 to press the Soviet Union to let Jews emigrate without restrictions, Sister Ann picketed Soviet embassies throughout the world and petitioned leaders in Washington and at the United Nations in New York.         In 1982 she was one of three human rights advocates who delivered a symbolic writ of habeas corpus to officials at the Soviet Embassy in Washington on behalf of Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet dissident and nuclear physicist then living in exile in central European Russia.         Sister Ann, who was born in Texas City, entered the Society of the Holy Child Jesus in 1940 and took her final vows in 1948. She studied at Fordham University and at the Regina Mundi Pontifical Institute in Rome, and received a master's degree in history from Villanova University.         She taught at several of the order's high schools around the country in the 1940's and 50's. She was dean of studies at Rosemont College from 1962 to 1964, and taught theology and scripture at Rosemont from 1964 to 1969.         Sister Ann was also executive director of the National Coalition of American Nuns in the 1970's and served several terms on the governing board of Common Cause, the public-affairs lobbying organization.       
         Catherine H. Sweeney, a patron of the sciences and arts for whom the Sweeney Mountains of Antarctica were named, died on Jan. 25 at the Miami Heart Institute. She was 80 and lived in Coconut Grove, Fla.         The cause was heart failure, said her son-in-law, Eric Fraunfelter.         Mrs. Sweeney called herself "just a lady gardener," but her efforts on behalf of botany, exploration, education and the arts earned her such honors as a silver medal from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and an honorary doctorate from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., where she sent eight women from Sri Lanka to be educated at her expense.         She was also a trustee of the Congressionally chartered National Tropical Botanical Garden, the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Miami, the American Horticultural Society, the World Wildlife Fund and the Conservation Foundation. She was a member-at-large of the Garden Club of America and a founder of the Florida chapter of the Society of Women Geographers.         Among other enterprises, Mrs. Sweeney rescued and restored the eight-acre estate called The Kampong in Coconut Grove in 1963. She donated the property, the former residence of the plant explorer David Fairchild, to the National Tropical Botanical Garden as a refuge and retreat for horticulturalists.         After she helped finance the Norwegian explorers Finn and Jackie Ronne in an expedition to Antarctica in the late 1940's, the Ronnes named the Sweeney Mountains in her honor.         She was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in Rye, N.Y., and a life trustee and national board member of the Aspen Music Festival and School in Aspen, Colo.         Born Catherine Denkmann Hauberg, she was a granddaughter and grandniece of the two brothers who established the company that became the Weyerhauser lumber empire.         She was a graduate of Dana Hall in Wellesley, Mass., and of the University of Illinois. Her husband, Edward C. Sweeney, a former president of the Explorers Club, died in 1967.         Mrs. Sweeney is survived by her children, Edward Jr., of Black Forest, Colo.; Philip, of Amherst, Mass.; John, of Aspen, Colo.; Susie Kayyali of Coral Gables, Fla., and Harriet Fraunfelter of Washington; her brother, John Hauberg Jr. of Seattle; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Myra Pollack Sadker, a Washington educator and writer who charted sexual bias in the nation's classrooms, died on Saturday at Georgetown Medical Center. She was 52 and lived in Bethesda, Md.         The cause was complications from a bone marrow transplant for breast cancer, said a spokesman for American University, where she was a professor and former dean of the school of education.         Dr. Sadker's most recent work was "Failing at Fairness: How America's Schools Cheat Girls" (Scribners, 1994). It was written in collaboration with her husband, David M. Sadker, a fellow professor at American's school of education. The couple had first studied the subject of sexual bias when they were graduate students together.         With a decade's worth of research, "Failing at Fairness" sought to document that girls' educations were inferior to those of boys. The reason, the authors concluded, was the conscious or subconscious sexism of teachers who spend more time interacting with boys.         Teachers, according to the book, call on boys more, make more substantive comments on their work, and praise and goad them more. The result is that over time girls tend to lose self-esteem and do more poorly in standardized tests.         Dr. Sadker's research was widely reported in newspapers and magazines around the country. It also led to many invitations for her to appear on national television and radio programs.         Myra Pollack Sadker was born in Portland, Me., and graduated from Boston University. She received a master's degree at Harvard University and a doctorate in education at the University of Massachusetts. She taught at junior and senior high schools in Massachusetts and Thailand before joining the faculty of American University in 1973.         In graduate school, the Sadkers noticed that there seemed to be subtle differences in the education they received in the same classrooms and studying the same books. The experience started them in their career as a husband-and-wife team examining sexual bias in schools through research based on transcripts of classroom interactions, textbooks, surveys and polls.         Dr. Sadker was the author or co-author of six books and scores of articles on sexism, teacher education and children's books. Her work was recognized this year with the Eleanor Roosevelt Award of the American Association of University Women.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Sadker is survived by two daughters, Robin and Jacqueline; a brother, Dr. Murray Pollack of Potomac, Md., and her father, Louis Pollack of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Margery Mastbaum Solomon, one of America's leading bridge players, died on Saturday at her home in Elkins Park, Pa. She was 86.         The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, said her daughter Norma Brunswick of Rydal, Pa.         Mrs. Solomon, who was always known as Peggy, represented the United States in several international bridge competitions. In 1972, she was a member of the American team that finished third in the World Team Olympiad.         Her most important success was a victory in the National Board-a-Match Teams, now called the Reisinger Teams, in 1944. She won nine other national titles in the Mixed Teams in 1949, 1950 and 1959; the Women's Teams in 1948, 1953, 1954, 1961 and 1967, and the Women's Pairs in 1960. Her 14 second-place results included all three major national team championships, the Spingold Knockout in 1944, the Board-a-Match in 1953 and the Vanderbilt Knockout in 1954. In 1944 she became the 33d person, and only the third woman, to reach the rank of life master.         Mrs. Solomon was a member of a prominent Philadelphia family. Her father, Jules Mastbaum, a real estate investor who owned a chain of movie theaters, bought many Rodin sculptures in France and built a museum to house them. The Rodin Museum was presented to the City of Philadelphia and opened in 1927 shortly after his death.         Her second husband, Charles Solomon, a former president of the American Contract Bridge League and the World Bridge Federation, died in 1975. She was previously married to Benjamin Golder, a Pennsylvania member of the House of Representatives for 12 years who also headed the national bridge organization; Mr. Golder died in 1946.         In addition to Mrs. Brunswick, Mrs. Solomon is survived by a sister, Lisa Dickson of Beverly Hills, Calif.; another daughter, Joan Ash of Elkins Park; eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Barbara Mercati, who was active in cultural, charitable and volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. Mrs. Mercati, who also lived in Vineyard Haven, Mass., on Martha's Vineyard, was 87.         The cause of death was cancer, said her son George.         Mrs. Mercati served as a member of the national council of the Metropolitan Opera, a director of the English Speaking Union and in many capacities with Recording for the Blind, including vice president of its board and director emeritus, a post she held at her death.         Mrs. Mercati was the widow of the Baron Antonio d'Almeida, who died in 1947; of the investment banker, diplomat and philanthropist Paul Felix Warburg, who died in 1965, and of Count Leonardo Mercati, who died in 1974. She was also the mother of the conductor and musicologist Antonio de Almeida.         Mrs. Mercati, the former Barbara Tapper, was born in 1907 in Pasadena, Calif., and spent her childhood in Highland Park, Ill.         Besides her sons George, of Selvole, Italy, and Antonio, of St. Remy de Provence, France, Mrs. Mercati is survived by her son Louis d'Almeida of Manhattan, five grandchildren and a great-grandchild. Other survivors include 5 stepdaughters, 14 step-grandchildren and 5 step-great grandchildren.       
         Norma Fields Furst, the president of Baltimore Hebrew University for the last three years, died on March 7 at her home in Wynnewood, Pa. She was 64.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         She was associated with Temple University from 1963 to 1983 in various positions, including full professor and finally dean of student affairs. She then was president of Harcum Junior College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., before joining Baltimore Hebrew in 1992.         She was active in many national and local organizations, including International B'nai B'rith/Hillel Commission, the Jewish Publication Society, and the American Association of University Women.         A native of Brooklyn, Dr. Furst was a graduate of Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree in education and a doctorate in educational psychology at Temple.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. M. Lawrence Furst; a son, Merrick, of Pittsburgh; a daughter, Laura F. Jacobs of Merion, Pa.; her mother, Anne Platzer of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.       
         Pearl Rainwater Twyne, an animal rights advocate in the Washington area who helped draw national attention to the plight of the Tennessee Walking Horse, died last Friday in St. Alphonsus Hospital in Boise, Idaho. Mrs. Twyne, a longtime resident of Great Falls, Va., moved to Boise in 1993. She was 90.         Over the years, horses became her special concern. She led demonstrations against the exhibition of Tennessee Walking Horses, which were trained to prance in an exaggerated, high-stepping gait, sometimes through the use of caustic chemicals or heavy chains.         In 1964, when she attended the Carolina Walking Horse Celebration in Raleigh, N.C., with a veterinarian, a lawyer and two police officers to look for evidence of mistreatment, she was threatened by spectators and forced to flee.         Eventually, testimony by Mrs. Twyne and others before Congress led to the Horse Protection Act of 1970, a Federal law that bars abusive training techniques.         Mrs. Twyne was transformed from a lover of animals to an animal rights activist in the early 1940's when she called the authorities in her town to tend to a stray dog that had collapsed near her house on a hot summer day. When an attendant arrived, he threw the dog in the trunk of his car, slammed it shut and drove away.         Appalled, she and a few friends founded the Arlington Animal Welfare League in 1944. She was its president until 1967, and helped found the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies in 1959. She also was instrumental in establishing the Humane Society of Fairfax County.         Mrs. Twyne, a native of Joplin, Mo., moved to Washington in the 1920's and worked in the Department of Agriculture.         Her husband, Patrick Murray Twyne, died in 1967. She is survived by a sister, Ruth Kennedy of Boise.       
         Vita R. Ostrander, a former president of the American Association of Retired Persons who helped make the health care system a major national issue a decade before last year's debate on overhauling it, died on Tuesday at Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta. She was 72 and lived in suburban Decatur.         Her family said she had a heart attack while recovering from back surgery.         Mrs. Ostrander was a member of the A.A.R.P.'s board from 1976 to 1988 and its president for two of those years, 1984-86. She had earned those unpaid positions through her volunteer work in Georgia as an advocate for the elderly, and during her dozen years on the board gained a reputation as an effective advocate both inside and outside the huge organization, which now claims 33 million members.         "She really brought us into health care," the current president, Eugene Lehrmann, said yesterday, recalling that she had often built support for her views even as she formed them, in informal chats with fellow board members.         When the association, under her prodding, spoke out in favor of fee controls and a combination of private insurance and Government subsidies to pay for prescription drugs and catastrophic illnesses, it was often Mrs. Ostrander who did the speaking.         In an organization that likes to precycle as well as recycle its executive talent, Mrs. Ostrander was a representative at news conferences during her two years as president-elect, testified at Congressional hearings during her two years as president and continued to speak out during her two years as "immediate past president," an official association position.         Not one to shrink from confrontation, she once told a meeting of the American Medical Association that high costs had created a form of rationing of health care. And when she served on a Federal advisory panel that made only a vague reference to a need for Government subsidies in a report stressing the role of private insurance in protecting Americans against catastrophic medical costs, Mrs. Ostrander issued a stinging dissent, chiding her fellow panelists for obscuring a need for Government participation.         A native of Utica, N.Y., where her father operated a bakery, Mrs. Ostrander, whose maiden name was Romano, received a nursing degree from the University of Buffalo and spent 10 years as a Red Cross executive before settling in Atlanta and becoming a full-time volunteer on issues involving the elderly.         She is survived by her husband, Gladding, a retired Red Cross executive; a daughter, Sylvia Lucas of Columbia, S.C., and three grandchildren.       
         Ellen Hermanson, a crusader in the battle against breast cancer, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 42 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         The disease was diagnosed in Ms. Hermanson in 1989, six months after the birth of her only daughter, Leora. She became actively involved in breast cancer issues by organizing survivor groups and speaking at national conferences and regional workshops.         Last November, Ms. Hermanson delivered a paper on the struggle to live with cancer pain to the annual National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship assembly in Washington. It was at this assembly that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the United States Supreme Court spoke for the first time about her own experience with breast cancer.         In 1991, Ms. Hermanson helped found the Jewish Healing Center in New York, an organization that provides spiritual assistance to people coping with serious illnesses. As editor of the center's quarterly newsletter, The Out-Stretched Arm, Ms. Hermanson published articles on breast cancer, support groups and health-care workshops. The center now has offices in New York and San Francisco.         In 1992, Judith Kaye, Chief Judge of New York State, appointed Ms. Hermanson the first executive director of the Judges and Lawyers Breast Cancer Alert. The group promotes breast cancer awareness and provides education and legal services.         Ms. Hermanson was also an active member of the national board of the National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship, which provides support to cancer survivors, their friends and families and health care providers. She edited the coalition's quarterly newsletter, Networker.         Ms. Hermanson was most recently working on a project to let breast cancer survivors and their families communicate over the Internet. She was also editor of the Sloan-Kettering Annual Report.         Ms. Hermanson was born in Belmont, Mass., in 1952. She graduated from Connecticut College with honors in 1974 and received a master's degree in journalism from New York University in 1978.         She is survived by her husband, Hugo Mareno and her daughter of Manhattan; her parents, Harlow and Roslyn Hermanson of Belmont, and two sisters, Emily Hermanson Levin of Great Neck, L.I., and Julie Hermanson Ratner of New York City.         Correction:  April 13, 1995, Thursday         An obituary yesterday about Ellen Hermanson, an advocate for survivors of breast cancer, misspelled her husband's name. He is Hugo Moreno, not Mareno. The obituary also misstated her residence. She lived in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The article also misstated the name of a group whose board she served on. It is the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, not the National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship.
