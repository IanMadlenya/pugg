         Nancy Claster, who entertained and educated a generation of children as Miss Nancy, the prototypical teacher on television's ''Romper Room,'' died on Friday at her home in Baltimore. She was 82.         Her daughter, Sally Bell, who succeeded her in managing the Romper Room production company, said the cause was cancer.         For millions of children born, weaned, potty trained and sent off to school between the days of radio's ''Uncle Don'' and the advent of ''Sesame Street'' on television in 1969, ''Romper Room'' was the ultimate baby sitter in a box, created to fill a perceived need for better children's programming.         And its presiding spirit was Mrs. Claster, who was pressed into service by her husband as a substitute for an ailing teacher, two months after the live show went on the air in  Baltimore in February 1953.         Not only did she serve as Miss Nancy in the studio-classroom that was her on-air preserve, she also created and wrote many ''Romper Room'' segments and trained the Miss Nancys, Miss Marys, Miss Mollys and Miss Louises who were her counterparts on franchised versions of the show around the country.         ''The core of her curriculum was really the belief that 'Romper Room' was for the children at home,'' Mrs. Bell said, ''and that everything that the children saw on television, whether it was just plain fun or educational -- and a lot of 'Romper Room' was educational -- should be set up so that children at home could participate.         ''If children on television were walking on a balance beam for hand-eye coordination, the children at home were shown how to use a string on the floor, so they didn't have to be kids who had to buy equipment to participate. Everybody could be part of 'Romper Room,' and everybody could have fun and learn from it.''         With its games and lessons, the show was an instant success. By the end of its first week -- a week when a toddler announced on camera: ''I have to go potty! And I'm doing it right now'' -- ''Romper Room'' received 1,100 applications to appear on the show. By the late 1950's, some 160 cities were broadcasting their own versions.         The show, which ran in markets around the country until September 1994, when new production ceased, can still be seen on tape on KTVU in San Francisco.         ''Romper Room'' was home-grown television in the days before videotape, a show that brought preschoolers into a studio furnished as a kindergarten and let the cameras roll.         Songs, games and health lessons helped ready children for the first grade. Animals were brought in from the zoo. To allay children's fear of the doctor, Miss Nancy got genuine polio shots on the air. Preschoolers were taught by people in gold and black fake-fur bee costumes to Do-Bee a milk drinker and Don't-Bee a spoilsport.         Each broadcast ended with the Magic Mirror, a piece of glittery plastic through which the teacher ''saw'' children at home.         Hundreds of children submitted their names and hoped to hear them when the teacher said: ''Romper stomper bomper boo/Tell me, tell me, tell me do/Magic Mirror, tell me today/ Did all my friends have fun at play?/I see Donnie and Leslie and Peter and Rhonda.''         It was perhaps inevitable that a little girl was watching at home, naked in a bathtub, when Miss Sally said she saw her in the Magic Mirror. The girl fled, hid beneath her bed, stayed there for hours and still remembered the episode 30 years later.         Born in Baltimore, Mrs. Claster was the oldest of three children of L. Edwin Goldman, the managing partner of a law firm, and the former Rita Strauss, who passed on her sense of fun to the future Miss Nancy.         Mrs. Claster was educated at the Park School, a private school in Baltimore, before attending Goucher College in Towson, Md., where she studied English and early-childhood education and graduated in 1937 with a bachelor of arts degree.         In 1938, she married Bertram Claster, then managing a beauty supply sales company. By the 1940's, at the Hippodrome theater in Baltimore, he was producing variety shows with stars like Gene Autry, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Rosemary Clooney, Jerry Lewis, Frank Sinatra and Rudy Vallee.         When television came along, he produced some local variety shows; being farsighted, he realized that the days of shows like those at the Hippodrome were numbered. He produced game and variety shows, from ''Bowling for Dollars'' to ''Teen Canteen.''         But dissatisfied with what he could see of morning programs for children, he created ''Romper Room.''         When cancer forced Mrs. Claster to step aside as Miss Nancy in 1964, she continued to oversee the training of ''Romper Room'' teachers, created different segments of the show and helped her husband sell the show to stations in markets around the country.         Their production company, Romper Room Inc., was bought by Hasbro Inc., in 1969. The Clasters retired in 1975. Mr. Claster died in 1984. Today, their son, John, and Mrs. Bell, as president and executive vice president, respectively, continue to manage the company, now Claster Television Inc.         Besides Mr. Claster of Los Angeles and Mrs. Bell, of Baltimore, Mrs. Claster is survived by another daughter, Candace Claster; a brother, Robert Goldman, and a sister, Sue Baker, all of Baltimore, and four grandchilden.         After retirement, Mrs. Claster spent a good deal of her time reading to and playing with the children at the Maryland School for the Blind in Baltimore.         ''They knew her as Miss Nancy,'' Mrs. Bell said.       
         Jeanne Calment, born a year before Alexander Graham Bell patented his telephone and 14 years before Alexandre Gustave Eiffel built his tower, died today in a nursing home in Arles. At 122, she was the oldest person whose age had been verified by official documents.         Jean-Marie Robine, a public health researcher who is one of the authors of a book about Mrs. Calment, said she had been in good health, though almost blind and deaf, as recently as a month ago.         The French, who celebrated her as the doyenne of humanity, had their own theories about why she lived so long, noting that she used to eat more than two pounds of chocolate a week and treat her skin with olive oil, rode a bicycle until she was 100, and only quit smoking five years ago.         Longevity ran in the family; Mrs. Calment's mother lived until she was 86 and her father until he was 93. But Mr. Robine said her great strength was her unflappability.         ''I think she was someone who, constitutionally and biologically speaking, was immune to stress,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''She once said, 'If you can't do anything about it, don't worry about it.' ''         Jeanne Louise Calment's claim to fame is the Feb. 21, 1875, listing in the birth register in Arles, the southern French city where she began her days and ended them.         She was 12 or 13 when she saw Vincent Van Gogh in Arles, and she said later that he was ''very ugly, ungracious, impolite, sick -- I forgive him, they called him loco.''         She married a cousin, Fernand Nicolas Calment, in 1896. As the prosperous owner of a store in Arles, he was able to support her in style, and she never had to work. She played tennis, took up roller skating, bicycling and swimming and took great pleasure in joining the hunting parties he organized. She also studied the piano and enjoyed the opera.         Her husband, 46 when World War I broke out, was too old for military service. His business survived the Depression, but a dessert of spoiled preserved cherries killed him, but not his wife, in 1942.         They had one child, a daughter, Yvonne, whose marriage to Joseph Billot produced a single child, Frederic Billot, in 1926. Eight years later, Yvonne died of pneumonia, and Mrs. Calment raised her grandson in the family home. He became a medical doctor and died before her, in an automobile accident in 1960.         Mrs. Calment rode a bicycle until she was 100 and walked all over Arles to thank those who congratulated her on her birthday that year.         At age 110 her increasing frailty forced her to move into a nursing home. ''She complained about the food in the nursing home, which was sort of like baby food,'' Mr. Robine said today. ''She said it always tasted the same.''         At the age of 115, she fell and fractured two bones, and her memory began to fail. But she retained a tart wit. ''When you're 117, you see if you remember everything!'' she rebuked an interviewer five years ago. When somebody took leave by telling her, ''Until next year, perhaps,'' she retorted: ''I don't see why not! You don't look so bad to me.''         By the time she turned 122, she was so hard of hearing that it was difficult to communicate with her.         The name of the person who has taken Mrs. Calment's place as oldest living human was a topic of considerable international confusion today. Philip Littlemore of the Guinness Book of World Records in London said the oldest known person whose date of birth was as well documented as Mrs. Calment's was Lucy Askew, a British woman who turned 104 last Sept. 8. But several others may also have claim to the title, including at least one in the United States.         Mrs. Calment left no heirs. She also outlived Andre-Francois Raffray, a lawyer who 32 years ago, when she was merely 90, bought the apartment she used to live in on a contingency contract. He would pay her 2,500 francs (now about $400) a month until she died, and then the apartment would become his.         Mr. Raffray died a year ago at 77, after paying Mrs. Calment more than $180,000, better than double the apartment's market value. His family was still paying when she died.         ''In life, one sometimes makes bad deals,'' Mrs. Calment said.         Mr. Raffray's widow, Huguette, told French radio tonight: ''She was a personality. My husband had very good relations with Mrs. Calment.''         Michel Vauzelle, the Mayor of Arles, said: ''She was Jeanne the Arlesienne, one whose picture went around the world. But above all, she was the living memory of our city.''         She may be most famous in France for her many bons mots. One of them was: ''I've never had but one wrinkle, and I'm sitting on it.''       
         Janet Good, a longtime civil rights worker who cooperated with Dr. Jack Kevorkian to help terminally ill people die, ended her own life yesterday in her home in suburban Detroit. She was 73.         Mrs. Good had suffered from pancreatic cancer and said she hoped not to die as her mother had, slowly and in great pain. As it was, Mrs. Good confounded her doctors, who had expected her illness to take her life by early 1996.         ''My time, obviously, is not quite here,'' she said in an interview late last year. Yesterday, she decided it was, said a person familiar with her decision and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         At a news conference in Southfield, Mich., Dr. Kevorkian's lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, asked the authorities not to pry into the circumstances of Mrs. Good's death.         And while Mr. Fieger declined to confirm that Dr. Kevorkian was present when she died, he said, ''Janet Good is no more the victim of a homicide than anyone else who has died in association and in the presence of Dr. Kevorkian.''         In recent years, Dr. Kevorkian has become well known for assisting in dozens of suicides. He has been tried but acquitted several times, and Mrs. Good became his top assistant, helping him screen those seeking help to die and consoling their survivors.         She said she was proud to have been indicted in late 1996 on charges of assisting in a suicide. ''I was almost offended when I wasn't charged last time,'' she said. The indictment was later dropped because of her deteriorating health.         Dr. Kevorkian's name was hardly known in 1989, when Mrs. Good started the right to die movement in Michigan by founding a chapter of the Hemlock Society in her living room. The chapter now has several hundred members.         In June 1990, Dr. Kevorkian asked her if he could use her house for the very first assisted suicide.         Although she agreed at first, she later declined after conferring with her husband, Ray, a retired Detroit police commander who thought the deed might be illegal.         ''The doctor called me every name in the book,'' Mrs. Good recalled later.         But they mended their differences, and in May 1996, after her husband had changed his mind, she allowed Dr. Kevorkian to use her home to help end a life.         After her own illness was diagnosed, she said her belief in a right to die had come naturally, in part because of her mother's suffering. ''I have worked for civil rights and women's rights and human rights for many years, and this seemed to me just another right we should have,'' she said.         A native of Detroit, Mrs. Good worked for the State of Michigan, processing unemployment claims.         In the 1970's, she led a successful drive to make sexual harassment illegal in the state, a triumph that won her election to the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.         She was also honored by the Log Cabin Society, a gay Republican group, for consoling AIDS patients and their families.         Survivors include her husband of 55 years; a son, Michael, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a daughter, Marjorie Helmling, and a sister, Margaret Moran, both of Detroit; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Her oldest daughter, Donna Ungar, died in 1995.       
         Laura Margolis, who helped rescue thousands of Jews fleeing persecution during World War II, died on Sept. 9 at the home of a nephew, James A. Margolis, in Brookline, Mass. She was 93 and lived in Brookline.         Born in Istanbul, where her father was a doctor to the Sultan of Turkey, Ms. Margolis came to the United States with her family in 1907. She worked with Settlement House helping immigrants in Buffalo, N.Y., and for Jewish Social Services in Cleveland before becoming the first female field agent of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in 1937.         The J.D.C., the American relief and rehabilitation agency for Jews, first sent her to Cuba to help the refugees fleeing Europe who were not being permitted to come directly to the United States. She tried to find a port of entry for a ship, the St. Louis, carrying Jews, but it was forced to return to Europe.         In 1939, she was sent to Shanghai, where tens of thousands of fleeing Jews found refuge.         When the United States entered the war in 1941, the Japanese, who occupied Shanghai, held Ms. Margolis as an enemy alien. She was released three years later in an exchange of prisoners.         In 1944, she went to England and Sweden to help direct the Joint Distribution Committee's refugee programs, and then became the first female director of the organization's operations in France.         In 1950, she married Marc Jarblum, a French journalist. They moved to Israel in 1953, and she was director of the agency's Malben Homes for the aged and the handicapped there.         After her husband died in 1983, she returned to the United States.       
         Katherine B. Oettinger, an authority on the care and upbringing of children, who was head of the Federal agency for the care of handicapped and underprivileged children, died on Monday in Carmel, Calif. She was 94.         Appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1957 as chief of the Children's Bureau in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Dr. Oettinger served four administrations. When the bureau was abolished in 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her deputy assistant secretary for family planning and population. She retired from Government service in 1970 when the post was abolished in the Nixon Administration.         As an expert on retarded children, Dr. Oettinger expounded the view that such children could often be cared for in the home, and should be, though in an earlier time they were routinely sent to institutions. She was also intent on educating the nation about the difficult period of adjustment facing most parents of retarded children.         ''Some parents still blame themselves when they discover their child is retarded,'' she said, and then go from doctor to doctor looking for a ''cure,'' rather than counseling that will help them teach their children to learn to function with some degree of success.         Young parents, she said, particularly need help in evaluating whether the child can best be cared for at home, as 95 percent were by the 1960's, or in an institution. If the decision is the home, she said, careful parental training is needed in precise ways of giving consistent directions, for example, in using patterns of speech that the child can easily understand.         Dr. Oettinger received many awards and was called one of the nation's ''true heroines'' by Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. After she left the Government, she traveled the world as a consultant on population control and family planning and wrote articles for social science journals and a well-received book, with Elizabeth C. Mooney, ''Not My Daughter: Facing Up to Adolescent Pregnancy'' (Prentice-Hall, 1979).         A native of Nyack, N.Y., she graduated from Smith College in 1925 with a degree in sociology and earned a master's degree in social work there.         Starting her career as a social worker in St. Paul, she moved to the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan, and then on to train nurses in the care of the handicapped in Scranton, Pa.         Her husband, Malcolm H. Oettinger, whom she married in 1930, died in 1963. She is survived by two sons, Malcolm Jr., of Chapel Hill, N.C., and John. B, of Los Angeles.         After her work in Scranton, she became director of community services in the Pennsylvania welfare department, working to improve mental health clinics and the training of welfare workers and ministers. She became the dean of the School of Social Work at Boston University in 1954.         ''You'll never get rich as a social worker,'' she told her students. ''But the satisfaction comes from helping humanity -- it's a wonderful field.''       
         Dorothy Kingsley, a leading screenwriter in Hollywood in the 1940's and 50's, died on Sept. 26 at the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, in Monterey, Calif. She was 87 and lived in Carmel.         Miss Kingsley wrote screenplays for more than 25 movies, specializing in musicals and comedies. Under contract to MGM, she wrote a series of films for Esther Williams, including ''Bathing Beauty,'' ''Neptune's Daughter'' (both co-starring Red Skelton) and ''Jupiter's Darling.'' She later wrote, by herself or in collaboration, the film adaptations of the Broadway musicals ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' ''Pal Joey'' and ''Can-Can,'' and was the co-author of ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.''         In the days when Hollywood was importing famous authors and playwrights to write screenplays, Miss Kingsley was one of many women who became studio stalwarts, moving swiftly from one picture to another. She was known as a script doctor or fixer, who could be called in on a moment's notice to solve a screenplay problem, sometimes without receiving screen credit.         ''Kingsley is a vanished breed: the studio utility player,'' said Pat McGilligan in ''Backstory 2,'' his collection of interviews with highly regarded screenwriters. ''But her ability to rethink a scene or to provide an appropriate snapper in a situation was much needed and much admired in the assembly-line days.'' Her stature among her peers, he added, ''is evidenced by a string of Academy Award and Writers Guild co-writing nominations for her scripts.''         In the interview with Mr. McGilligan, Miss Kingsley said: ''I never think of myself as a real writer. I only wrote because I needed the money. I had no desire to express myself or anything.''         But she became known as someone who could write or rewrite almost any kind of movie. As a baseball fan, she wrote ''Angels in the Outfield'' in the 1950's and received screenplay credit when the movie was remade in 1994. She also did the screenplay for ''Green Mansions.''         Outspoken and with a nimble wit, she was often instrumental behind the scenes. It was partly through her efforts that Frank Sinatra agreed to play the title role in ''Pal Joey.'' She  urged Cole Porter to insert ''From This Moment On'' into the score for the movie of ''Kiss Me, Kate.''         Miss Kingsley was born in New York City. Her father, Walter J. Kingsley, was a writer and Broadway press agent, and her mother, Alma Hanlon, was an actress in silent movies. When her parents divorced, she moved with her mother to Grosse Pointe, Mich.         In the late 1930's, she began her career in Los Angeles as a comedy writer on radio for Bob Hope and Edgar Bergen. Then she was hired by Arthur Freed and was one of the writers, uncredited, on ''Girl Crazy'' in 1943. That led to her role as a writer of Esther Williams swimming movies. ''Finally,'' she said, ''I ran out of ways to get her in the water.''         In 1967, after working on the screenplays for ''The Valley of the Dolls'' and ''Half a Sixpence,'' she retired from films. She and her husband, William Durney, established the Durney Vineyard, a major California producer of wine. Her husband died in 1989.         She is survived by two sons, Terry Kingsley-Smith, a novelist and playwright, and Michael Durney, both of Carmel; two daughters, Susan Durney Mickelson of Lake Oswego, Ore., and Christine Armanasco of Carmel, and nine grandchildren.       
         Dawn Steel, the first woman to head a major movie studio and who played a prominent role advancing other women to top jobs in Hollywood, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center here. She was 51 and lived in Los Angeles.         Charles Roven, Ms. Steel's husband, a film producer, said Ms. Steel had been suffering from a malignant brain tumor.         ''When I got the call 21 months ago from the doctor about Dawn's condition,'' said Mr. Roven, ''I was told that 97 percent of the people who had this die within the first six months. It goes to show what spirit she had.''         Ms. Steel, who came to Hollywood in the 1970's to take a merchandising job at Paramount, rose quickly to become president of production at that studio, where she oversaw development of such films as ''Flashdance,'' ''Footloose,'' ''Top Gun,'' ''The Untouchables,'' ''Fatal Attraction'' and ''The Accused.'' She became the first woman to head a major studio when she held the top job at Columbia Studios from October 1987 until January 1991. During her reign, the studio's films included ''Awakenings,'' ''Flatliners,'' ''Ghostbusters 2'' and ''Casualties of War.''         Ms. Steel produced several movies in recent years, among them ''Cool Runnings,'' a highly successful comedy about a Jamaican bobsled team. She and Mr. Roven have produced ''Fallen,'' starring Denzel Washington, and ''City of Angels,'' with Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage, both to be released next year.         Ms. Steel's career and life were marked by a powerful, even outsize, personality that helped her succeed in a business dominated by men.  ''She was highly opinionated, extremely self-confident, had a fantastic sense of humor and was someone of enormous style and taste,'' said Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the partners of Dreamworks SKG, and an early mentor of Ms. Steel's at Paramount, along with Michael Eisner and Barry Diller. He added, ''Maybe under the facade she was scared and intimidated by it all, but I didn't see a scintilla of that.''         Nora Ephron, the writer, who was given her first directorial job by Ms. Steel, said: ''Dawn certainly wasn't the first woman to become powerful in Hollywood, but she was the first woman to understand that part of her responsibility was to make sure that eventually there were lots of other powerful women. She hired women as executives, women as producers and directors, women as marketing people.         ''The situation we have today, with a huge number of women in powerful positions, is largely because of Dawn Steel,'' said Ms. Ephron.         Ms. Steel was one of President Clinton's earliest supporters in Hollywood. In the last year, Mr. Clinton had phoned her several times, and Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Ms. Steel at her home in the Coldwater Canyon area of Los Angeles.         Characteristically, Ms. Steel often laughed with friends when recalling her first meeting with Mr. Clinton.         ''You're not as bad as I thought you'd be,'' Mr. Clinton told her.         Ms. Steel's skill as an executive was sometimes overshadowed by a reputation for an abrasive, take-no-prisoners style. She was called Steel Dawn and the Tank. ''It hurt me deeply, this reputation as tough, hard, mean,'' she said in 1993, following the publication of her autobiography ''They Can Kill You, but They Can't Eat You: Lessons From the Front.'' She added: ''It was very painful, it came from guys who wanted to kill me. In some ways I was curt because there's an unbelievable amount to accomplish in a day.''         ''Look, I'm not Mary Poppins,'' she said at another point, ''but I think I functioned with integrity.''         The films that Ms. Steel most enjoyed seeing and making -- such as ''Flashdance,'' about a female welder who wants to dance, and ''Cool Runnings'' -- were personal to her. These are stories of outsiders with outlandish ambitions who overcome numerous obstacles to get what they want. ''She had a formula for many of her movies that carried a simple truth: You want something, you work incredibly hard, you get it,'' said Lucy Fisher, vice chairwoman of the Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group, and a close friends.         Although Ms. Steel often said that she was just ''an ordinary middle-class girl from New York,'' the story of her life was far from ordinary and, like those of many other wealthy and successful moguls in Hollywood, self-invented.         She was born in the Bronx on Aug. 19, 1946, and grew up in Manhattan and ''in a crummy neighborhood on the wrong side of the tracks'' in Great Neck, N.Y., according to her autobiography. Her father, Nat, was a zipper salesman to the military who had a nervous breakdown when she was a child; her mother, Lillian, was a formidable businesswoman compelled to work to support the family. (The family's name was originally Spielberg, but her father changed it to Steel to reflect his prowess as a semiprofessional weight lifter).         Ms. Steel ran out of money after a year at Boston University, and attended New York University's School of Commerce for two years, studying marketing. By 1968 Ms. Steel was working as a receptionist in the garment district and soon found a low-level marketing job at Penthouse magazine devising X-rated products. (She initially told her parents she was working at Mademoiselle.)         Answering phones at Penthouse, Ms. Steel noticed that amaryllis plants took on a phallic look just before blooming. As she recalled, she hired an artist to exaggerate the effect and wrote her own copy for the ad: ''Grow your own . . . All it takes is $6.98 and a lot of love.'' The plant was so popular that Penthouse could not keep it in stock.         Ms. Steel's tenacity, and flair for theatrics, was made evident in 1975 while she was traveling through Europe looking for gimmicky gift ideas. She came up with the notion of poking fun at the Gucci label by stamping it on toilet paper. She solicited orders from boutiques and formed her own company, Oh Dawn! Inc., she said, ''because when I said I was in the toilet-paper business, people would say, 'Oh Dawn!' ''         Soon enough, the Gucci family sued her for copyright infringement. Sid Davidoff, a lawyer and former administrative assistant to Mayor John V. Lindsay, agreed to take her case even though, he later recalled, she ''didn't have a dime, she was living by her wits.'' Mr. Davidoff, building a First Amendment defense, made sure the New York tabloids heard about the case, which was quickly headlined ''the toilet-paper caper'' and led to an editorial cartoon showing the Gucci family as Goliath and poor Dawn Steel as David. The case was settled out of court.         By 1978, Ms. Steel had ended a 10-month marriage, sold her business to her ex-husband and asked Mr. Davidoff to place a call to his friend Mr. Katzenberg about a marketing job for her at Paramount. She was hired and quickly impressed her bosses.         Asked in 1993 why men like Mr. Eisner and Mr. Katzenberg had rapidly advanced her career, Ms. Steel replied: ''One was that I was funny. I wasn't heavy furniture. I made them laugh and entertained them. And the other thing was that I could identify a good idea. Not a lot of people can do that. That was my gift.''         She was once compared to a tank by the producer Dan Melnick. ''She would just lower her head and charge through all the red tape and bureaucracy,'' he said. ''She's the most determined woman in the business.''         Her early advocacy of ''Flashdance'' (1983), an unlikely blue-collar musical that turned into a huge hit grossing $95 million in the United States, solidified her position at Paramount. ''Flashdance'' was followed by ''Footloose,'' another hit.         By 1985, Paramount's president, Ned Tanen, appointed Ms. Steel president of production, making her one of the highest-ranking female executives in Hollywood. She had already developed a celebrity persona that made photographers take as many pictures of her at a premiere as a movie actress. She prided herself on her crown of leonine hair -- Ms. Ephron once introduced ''Dawn Steel and her hair'' at an awards luncheon for women -- and her romantic relationships with such figures as the actor Richard Gere and Martin Scorsese, the director.         Ms. Steel's dismissal from Paramount remains one of the more unusual in recent Hollywood history. Having married Mr. Roven in 1985, she was in the hospital after the birth of her only child, Rebecca, in March 1987, when she learned that Frank Mancuso, chairman of Paramount, and Mr. Tanen, chairman of the Motion Picture Group, had ousted her. Exactly why they did was unclear.         As Ms. Steel told Playboy years later, her husband walked into the hospital room with a newspaper under his arm and said, ''I don't know how to tell you this, babe, but you got fired while you were in labor.'' Ms. Steel said. ''I remember thinking, 'I will not cry, I will not let them make me cry.' ''         In addition to her husband and daughter, she is survived by a brother, Larry, of Manhattan.         Within six months of her ouster at Paramount, Ms. Steel was offered the job of running Columbia Studios, which was owned by Coca-Cola. Lynda Obst, a producer who was given her early producing jobs by Ms. Steel, said that one of the personal high points of her tenure at Columbia was the decision to restore and reissue the David Lean classic ''Lawrence of Arabia.'' ''It was something that she was extraordinarily proud of,'' said Ms. Obst.         Ms. Steel left the job in 1991, following Sony's purchase of the studio. Her settlement was reportedly in excess of $6 million.         Ms. Steel, in reviewing her career a few years ago, recalled that her commitment to helping women in Hollywood was a slow one. ''I must tell you, I did feel threatened by other women in those early years,'' she said. ''I was so busy climbing up this ladder, staying above the water. If there was only room for one woman in a room, I wanted to be her. I'm not proud of it. I certainly don't feel that way now. It was an absolute evolution for me.''       
         Simone Duvalier, who rose from a childhood of poverty and abandonment to become the wife of one Haitian dictator, mother of another and a power in her own right, died of undisclosed causes in a clinic outside Paris on Friday. She was in her mid-80's and had lived in France since being forced into exile almost 12 years ago.         During the nearly 30 years that her husband, Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier, and son, Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier, dominated the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere through a combination of brutality, intimidation and guile, Simone Duvalier was often regarded as a power behind the throne. Because of her acquired status, her reputation for vanity and her imperious bearing, ordinary Haitians often referred to her sarcastically as ''Mama Doc.''         Mrs. Duvalier's influence probably reached its peak after the death of her husband in 1971, when her son, still a teen-ager, succeeded his father as Haiti's ''President for Life.'' She relished the title of First Lady and the power it conferred, and was said by associates to deeply resent having to relinquish that role after Jean-Claude Duvalier married Michele Bennett in a lavish wedding ceremony in 1981.         Like her rapacious husband, who systematically looted Haiti's treasury during his years in power, Mrs. Duvalier was reported to be a voodoo adept, and inspired dread among Haiti's poor and illiterate masses. Nevertheless, she cultivated the image of a benefactor, dispensing charity to inhabitants of ''Cite Simone,'' a ''planned settlement'' named for her that is known today as ''Cite Soleil'' and is perhaps the most miserable slum in Latin America.         Mrs. Duvalier's own origins, however, were exceedingly humble. Born Simone Ovide, she was the illegitimate daughter of a well-known mulatto merchant and scholar, Jules Faine, and one of the maids in his household, giving her a socially dubious lineage that in her later years she sought to conceal.         Though Mrs. Duvalier was never willing to disclose her precise date of birth, she is believed to have been born about 1913 near the southern Haitian town of Leogane. At an early age, however, her mother gave her up, and she spent much of her childhood in an orphanage in Petionville, an upper-class suburb in the hills above Port-au-Prince.         Because some members of the local elite took an interest in the institution, the wards of the orphanage were encouraged to acquire some sort of vocational skill, a phenomenon unusual in Haiti at that time. As a result, Simone Ovide was trained as a nurse's aide, and was working in that capacity when she met and was soon being courted by a young doctor named Francois Duvalier.         Then as now, Haitians fortunate enough to enter a profession ordinarily would not marry beneath their class. But Simone Ovide's light skin, good looks, unusual height and haughty demeanor were apparently enough to overcome any social handicaps, and the couple married just after Christmas in 1939.         As Francois Duvalier rose through the Haitian bureaucracy, becoming Minister of Public Health and Labor in 1949 and winning election to the presidency in 1957, Simone was right beside him. Throughout his 14 years in office, she zealously guarded access to her husband and developed and promoted her own coterie of palace favorites.         ''She had a lot of power, but it wasn't an idyllic marriage,'' said Bernard Diederich, author of a biography of Francois Duvalier. ''The old dictator and his wife were often at odds over family matters.''         During her son's years in power, Simone Duvalier's taste for luxury, exceeded only by that of Michele Bennett, grew even more pronounced, and corruption markedly increased. A tense relationship with her daughter-in-law encouraged Jean-Claude to build lavish palaces and weekend retreats, and Mrs. Duvalier was the moving force behind the construction of an elaborate mausoleum for her husband, today a museum, where she, too, planned to be buried.         But when her son was ousted from power in February 1986, Mrs. Duvalier joined him and his wife in exile, first in the French Alps and then in Paris. She was rarely seen in public from that point on, and was reported by old acquaintances in Port-au-Prince to be pining for Haiti and eager to return to her homeland when political conditions allowed.         In recent years, after Jean-Claude's bitter divorce from Michele, Mrs. Duvalier was again said to be with her son in France, amid widespread reports they were living in a state of virtual poverty.         Such speculation is sure to be fed by the decision to cremate Mrs. Duvalier's body, a procedure that believers in voodoo normally seek to avoid, rather than incur the cost of a burial plot.
