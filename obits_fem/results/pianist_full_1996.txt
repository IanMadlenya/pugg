         Helen Keane, a manager and producer who was one of the few women on the business side of jazz, died at Cabrini Hospice in New York on Monday. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, her son Timothy Wood said.         Ms. Keane is best known for her business relationship with the pianist Bill  Evans, whom she represented from 1963 until his death in 1980. Their partnership helped make him one of jazz's biggest draws. She produced his recordings for many years and just recently finished "But Beautiful," an album taken from several of Mr. Evans's live concerts and featuring the saxophonist Stan Getz.         She also worked with the guitarist Kenny Burrell, the trumpeter Art Farmer and the saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera during the 1970's and 80's. She was involved in the careers of the pianists JoAnne Brackeen and Keith McDonald, along with the all-women group Alive.         Ms. Keane had an interest in promoting female singers, and during the last several decades she worked with Sylvia Sims and Morgana King.  She also produced records for Chris Connor and Carole Sloane.         Ms. Keane began her career in the 1950's as an artists-and-repertory scout for MCA and CBS. She played an important role in the early careers of several singers and entertainers, among them Harry Belafonte, Carol Burnett and Don Knotts.         In addition to Mr. Wood of San Francisco, she is survived by another son, Christopher Rudolf of Portland, Ore.       
         Camilla de Leon, a dance composer and accompanist in the 1930's and 40's, died on April 3 at Middlesex Hospital in Middletown, Conn. She was 80, and lived in Middletown.         Ms. de Leon accompanied classes at the Martha Graham studio and composed for  choreographers including Pearl Primus, with whom she worked into the 1970's, and Katherine Dunham, Pearl Lang and Jean Erdman. As the only white member of the Primus troupe, Ms. de Leon frequently had to get meals and restroom keys surreptitiously for Primus's black dancers when the company toured in the South.         Ms. de Leon also worked in the musical theater. She was rehearsal pianist for the original production of "South Pacific" and musical director for "You're  a Good Man, Charlie Brown." She taught voice and piano at Wesleyan University from 1972 to her death.         She is survived by two daughters, Inara de Leon of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Winona de Leon of Monterey, Calif.; three sons, Noel, of Odense, Denmark; Michael, of Garberville, Calif., and Emile, of Middletown, and two sisters, Maude Merrill of Manhattan and Irene Novak of Westport, Conn.       
         Ella Fitzgerald, whose sweet, silvery voice and endlessly inventive vocal improvisations made her the most celebrated jazz singer of her generation, died  yesterday at home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 79.         She had been suffering from diabetes and its eyesight and circulatory system  complications for many years. In 1993, both of her legs were amputated below the knees.         A pre-eminent American singer who brought a classic sense of musical proportion and balance to everything she touched, Miss Fitzgerald won the sobriquet "first lady of song" and earned the unqualified admiration of most of  her peers. Musicians from Bing Crosby to Benny Goodman, when asked to name their favorite singer, cited Ella Fitzgerald.         "Man, woman or child, Ella is the greatest," Crosby once said. Mel Torme hailed her as having "the best ear of any singer ever." Until the 1970's, when physical problems began to impinge on her perfect technique, this hefty, unglamorous woman seemed to loom as an immutable creative force in a musical world where everything else was crumbling.         In a career that spanned six decades, Miss Fitzgerald stood above the emotional fray of the scores of popular standards she performed. Stylistically she was the polar opposite of her equally legendary peer, Billie Holiday, who conveyed a wounded vulnerability. Even when handed a sad song, Miss Fitzgerald communicated a wistful, sweet-natured compassion for the heartache she described.         Where Holiday and Frank Sinatra lived out the dramas they sang about, Miss Fitzgerald, viewing them from afar, seemed to understand and forgive all. Her apparent equanimity and her clear pronunciation, which transcended race, ethnicity, class and age, made her a voice of profound reassurance and hope.         Over the decades, Miss Fitzgerald performed with big bands, symphony orchestras and small jazz groups. Her repertory encompassed show tunes, jazz songs, novelties (like her first major hit, "A-Tisket A-Tasket," recorded in 1938), bossa nova, and even opera ("Porgy and Bess" excerpts, recorded with Louis Armstrong). At her jazziest, her material became a springboard for ever-changing, ebullient vocal inventions, delivered in a sweet, girlish voice that could leap, slide or growl anywhere within a range of nearly three octaves.         Great Diction And Vocal Agility         Miss Fitzgerald was renowned both for her delicately rendered ballads and her pyrotechnical displays of scat improvisation. (The jazz historian Barry Ulanov traced the term be-bop to her spontaneous interpolation of the word "re-bop" in  her 1939 recording of "T'Ain't What You Do, It's the Way That You Do It.") She was sometimes criticized for a lack of bluesiness and emotional depth. But her perfect intonation, vocal acrobatics, clear diction and endless store of melodic improvisations -- all driven by powerful rhythmic undercurrents -- brought her nearly universal acclaim.         During her long career, Miss Fitzgerald recorded with Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Louis Armstrong. Her series of "Songbook" albums, celebrating such songwriters as Cole Porter, Harold Arlen, the Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart and Duke Ellington, helped to elevate the work of the best American songwriters to a stature widely recognized as art song.         "I never knew how good our songs were," Ira Gershwin once said, "until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them."         Although most biographies give her birth date as 1918, her birth certificate  and school records show her to have been born a year earlier, on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Va. She was the product of a common-law marriage between William Fitzgerald and Temperance Williams Fitzgerald. The couple separated within a year of her birth, and with her mother and a Portuguese immigrant named Joseph Da Silva, she moved to Yonkers.         As a child, Miss Fitzgerald dreamed of being a dancer. But she also sang and  was attracted to the recordings of Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and the Boswell  Sisters, in particular the group's lead singer, Connee Boswell.         "My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it," she  recalled many years later. "I tried so hard to sound just like her."         As a teen-ager, Miss Fitzgerald developed a dance routine with a friend, Charles Gulliver, which they performed in local clubs. Then in 1932, her mother  died suddenly, and she went to live with an aunt in Harlem.         On Nov. 21, 1934, she made her stage debut in an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater, singing two songs, "The Object of My Affection" and "Judy," in the style of Connee Boswell. She won first prize.         Around this time, she also caught the attention of Chick Webb, the band leader and drummer, who was reluctant to sign her to a contract because she was  gawky and unkempt, a "diamond in the rough," as the band leader Mario Bauza later remembered. But the audience's reaction to her performances persuaded him  to offer her a job, and during the Webb band's residency at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem her reputation blossomed.         "I thought my singing was pretty much hollering," she recalled many years later, "but Webb didn't."         A Novelty Song Made Her a Star         Miss Fitzgerald made her first recording in 1935 ("Love and Kisses," with Chick Webb), and had her first hit with "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," a song she helped  write, adapting the lyric, she later explained, from "that old drop-the-handkerchief game I played from 6 to 7 years old on up." The record became a popular sensation and made her a star. After Webb died in 1939, the young singer was the band's nominal leader until mid-1942, when it broke up. Between her recording debut in 1935 and the demise of the band seven years later, Miss Fitzgerald recorded almost 150 sides, the majority of them novelties and disposable pop fluff.         During this period, she married Benjamin Kornegay, a shipyard worker and petty thief with a criminal record. The marriage ended in annulment after two years. The singer was 30 when she fell in love with the bassist Ray Brown while  they were on tour with Dizzy Gillespie's band. They were married in December 1947, set up housekeeping in East Elmhurst, Queens, and adopted the son of Miss  Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances. They named the boy Ray Jr. While Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on her career, her son was cared for by her aunt Virginia.         The marriage eventually became a casualty of conflicting career schedules, and the couple were divorced in 1953, although they continued to work together.  In 1957, there were reports in the Scandinavian press that she had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a Norwegian impresario. Miss Fitzgerald is survived by Ray Brown Jr. and a grandchild.         As early as 1942 and 43, Miss Fitzgerald began to be influenced by the experiments of such be-bop instrumentalists as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. She incorporated elements of be-bop rhythm and harmony into her singing, and while on tour with the Gillespie band in 1946 she embraced the music wholeheartedly.         A year earlier, she had recorded what would become one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade, a version of "Flying Home" in which she indulged extensively in the phonetic improvisation known as scat. Where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness.         Two years later, when Decca released her sensational be-bop version of "Lady  Be Good," Downbeat magazine proclaimed her "as great a master of bop as she has  been of swing."         These achievements were among the high points of a recording career that found Miss Fitzgerald recording in all manner of pop settings. Between 1935 and  1955 she recorded for Decca Records. Under the commercially astute supervision of the producer Milt Gabler, she was teamed with the vocal group the Ink Spots for several hits, including the million-selling "I'm Making Believe" and "Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall." She also scored commercially with novelty duets  recorded with Louis Jordan, the most popular of which was "Stone Cold Dead in the Market."         A Huge Change Of Direction         Dictated largely by the fads of the moment, Miss Fitzgerald's pre-1955 pop recording career was an artistically mixed bag and stood distinct from her work  as a swing and jazz singer in nightclubs. One of the artistic high points of the Decca years was a 10-inch long-playing record, "Ella Sings Gershwin," which she  recorded with the pianist Ellis Larkins in 1950.         Miss Fitzgerald's life changed when Norman Granz, the impresario of the popular Jazz at the Philharmonic series, invited her to join the touring jam sessions in 1949 and later became her manager. One of her most popular numbers,  "How High the Moon," evolved into the unofficial signature tune of the series.         Their relationship quickly developed into one of the most productive artist-manager partnerships in the history of jazz. When Miss Fitzgerald's contract with Decca expired, she became the first artist Mr. Granz signed to his new Verve label. It was under his supervision that she undertook the series of landmark "Songbook" albums that brought her voice to a large nonjazz audience.         "I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be-bop," she later recalled. "I thought be-bop was 'it,' and that all I had to do was go someplace  and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman came along, and he felt that I should do other things, so he produced 'The Cole Porter Songbook' with me. It was a turning point in my life."         "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook" became the prototype for a series of anthologies recorded over more than a decade and focusing on individual composers or composing teams, blending familiar standards and lesser-known, usually first-rate songs.         Backed by various studio orchestras, she also interpreted the work of Irving  Berlin, Harold Arlen, Duke Ellington, the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer  and Rodgers and Hart. "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbook," a 53-song, 5-LP collection recorded with the arranger and conductor Nelson Riddle in 1959, is widely regarded as the greatest of the collections.         These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing  the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.         From 1956 through the mid-1960's, Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on material that was almost consistently commensurate with her artistry, and her career soared. She made her first feature-film appearance in "Pete Kelly's Blues," in 1955, and in 1957 presented her own concert at the Hollywood Bowl. In April 1958 she gave a Carnegie Hall concert with Duke Ellington to celebrate the release of her four-disk set, "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook."         A workhorse who toured from 40 to 45 weeks of each year, Miss Fitzgerald showed the first signs of fatigue when she nearly collapsed on the stage during a concert in Munich in 1965. Five years earlier, Mr. Granz had sold Verve records to MGM, and when her contract came up for renewal in 1966, she was not re-signed to the label, but Mr. Granz moved her to Capitol, where her producer,  Dave Dexter, promised to give her "a totally different sound." These albums, which included a religious record, an album of country music and a Christmas collection, found her groping insecurely for a new pop identity.         Signed briefly to Reprise Records, Miss Fitzgerald tried singing contemporary hits by the Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Marvin Gaye, but rock and soul proved almost as uncongenial to her style as had country.         Basie, Sinatra And Symphonies         She returned to jazz full time when Mr. Granz founded his label Pablo in 1973. Among her many Pablo recordings are four duet albums with the guitarist Joe Pass, made from 1973 to 1986, and another songbook album devoted to the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim. She also began performing regularly with symphony orchestras, and in 1974 she teamed with Frank Sinatra and Count Basie for a two-week concert engagement at the Uris Theater in New York that grossed more than a million dollars.         From the early 1970's, Miss Fitzgerald began to have eyesight problems complicated by diabetes, and in 1986 she had heart surgery, but she returned to  the concert stage the next year. Despite ill health, she continued to perform at least once month into the early 1990's. Although her quality of voice slowly deteriorated from the early 1970's, even at the end of her career, her singing retained a remarkable rhythmic acuity.         Offstage, Miss Fitzgerald lived a quiet, self-protective life in a 13-room house in Beverly Hills. Her social life involved a small circle of old friends,  including members of the Count Basie and Duke Ellington orchestras, and other singers, including over the years Carmen McRae, Sarah Vaughan and Peggy Lee.         A model of abstemious self-discipline, she shunned cigarettes and liquor. She was also a person of few words. Shy and extremely sensitive to criticism, she preferred to let Mr. Granz do most of the talking for her.         Asked once how she felt about being "a legend," she replied: "I don't think I noticed it at first. But when Norman Granz and I began recording the 'Songbook'  series in the mid-50's, it just seemed that more people began to like my singing. The awards I started winning didn't make me feel important, but they made me realize people loved me. And then kids started calling me 'Ella' -- half of them never even mentioned 'Ella Fitzgerald' -- just 'Ella.' "         She amassed countless awards and commendations, including honorary doctorates at Yale and Dartmouth, the National Medal of Arts, and 13 Grammy Awards, including one in 1967 for Lifetime Achievement. In 1979 she was given a Kennedy  Center Award for her lifetime in the performing arts.         Accepting an honorary doctorate of music at Yale, she commented with her characteristic modesty, "Not bad for someone who only studied music to get that  half-credit in high school."         Fitzgerald for Home Listening         Ella Fitzgerald was one of the most prolific recording artists in jazz. These are some of her best albums:         "Ella Fitzgerald: 75th-Birthday Celebration" (Decca Jazz). A two-disk, 39-song collection, it includes the cream of the singer's pop output recorded for Decca between 1938 and 1955.         "Pure Ella" (Decca Jazz). These 20 songs recorded in the 1950's with the pianist Ellis Larkins exemplify elegant simplicity and ideal teamwork.         "Ella and Louis" (Verve). In this 1956 collaboration with Louis Armstrong, two titans meet playfully.         "Like Someone in Love" (Verve). This lush collection of 19 ballads recorded in 1957 with Frank DeVol's orchestra is her most romantic album.         "Mack the Knife: The Complete Ella in Berlin" (Verve). This classic live album was recorded in 1960 when the singer was at the height of her powers.         "The Intimate Ella" (Verve). Originally released in 1960 under the title "Ella Fitzgerald Sings Songs From the Soundtrack of 'Let No Man Write My Epitaph,' " the collection of 13 ballads recorded with the pianist Paul Smith is a neglected masterpiece.         "The Complete Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks" (Verve). Taken together, these 16 disks, recorded between 1956 and 1964, constitute the singer's crowning achievement. The tributes to Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer can also be purchased individually. Although the Cole Porter collection,  which was the first, is the most famous, it is not the best. The 53-song Gershwin album, recorded with Nelson Riddle's orchestra, is the artistic peak.         "Ella and Basie: On the Sunny Side of the Street" (Verve). A swinging powerhouse, released in 1963.         "Fitzgerald and Pass . . . Again" (Pablo). The best joint recording by two beautifully matched jazz classicists.         "Fine and Mellow" (Pablo). A wonderful swinging album from 1974, recorded with an all-star small ensemble.         Correction:  June 20, 1996, Thursday         An obituary on Sunday about Ella Fitzgerald misidentified the first feature film in which she appeared. It was "Ride 'Em Cowboy" in 1942, not "Pete Kelly's  Blues" in 1955.       
         Lillian Clark, a singer who performed with many stars of the big-band era and helped preserve the work of her husband, the composer and arranger Sy Oliver, died on Tuesday at her home in New York City. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, according to a statement from the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, of which she was national treasurer.         Ms. Clark, whose original name was Autilia Ventimiglia, was born in Scranton, Pa. She studied at the Juilliard School, intending to become a classical pianist. But when one of the Clark Sisters left that popular singing group in the 1940's, she auditioned, got the job and changed her name.         She met her future husband when the group was performing on Tommy Dorsey's radio show on WOR. After Mr. Oliver died in 1988, she catalogued his music, most of which she donated to New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and to the Smithsonian Institution.         Ms. Clark appeared on Perry Como's television show in the 1950's and recorded with Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Tommy Dorsey and Louis Armstrong. She was also one of the original Ray Charles Singers and sang with other groups, including the Ray Conniff Singers and the Norman Luboff Choir.         She is survived by a son, Jeffry James Oliver of New York City, and a brother, Sal Ventimiglia.       
         Louise Talma, a composer whose music combined a Neo-Classical spareness, clarity and lyricism with the structural rigorousness of the 12-tone school, died on Tuesday at Yaddo, the artists' colony near Saratoga Springs, N.Y., where she was composing a song cycle with chamber accompaniment. She was 89 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Talma's opera, ''The Alcestiad,'' a collaboration with Thornton Wilder, became the first work by an American woman to be presented by a major European opera company when it had its premiere at the Frankfurt Opera in 1962. In 1974, she became the first female composer to be elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.         A prolific composer who was especially adept at text setting, Ms. Talma wrote dozens of song cycles and choral works on both sacred and secular subjects. She also created a catalogue of colorfully scored chamber works and piano pieces, several of which have been recorded, most notably on a 1987 collection of her works on the CRI label, and on an earlier recording made by the Musical Heritage Society. These include ''Four-Handed Fun'' (1939), a light-spirited piano duet, as well as a set of sharp-edged bagatelles (1955) and the hauntingly beautiful ''Ambient Air'' (1983), a set of vivid evocations of nature for flute, violin, cello and piano.         Louise Juliette Talma was born in Arcachon, France, on Oct. 31, 1906, to American parents who were both professional musicians. She grew up in New York City, and studied chemistry at Columbia University while at the same time studying the piano and composition at the Institute of Musical Art, the predecessor of the Juilliard School. She also earned a music degree at New York University and a master of arts degree at Columbia.         As a student, she won prizes both as a pianist and for her compositions, and her ambition at first was to be a pianist. Between 1926 and 1935, she spent her summers studying with Isidore Philipp in France. In 1928, however, she began studying composition with Nadia Boulanger in Fontainebleau, and by 1935, Boulanger persuaded her to devote herself fully to composition. She continued her formal studies with Boulanger until 1939, and later became the first American to teach at Fontainebleau.         Boulanger's influence can be seen in the carefully etched Neo-Classicism of Ms. Talma's earliest works. In the early 1950's, she began using 12-tone techniques, principally as a way of creating themes rather than as an escape from conventional tonality. Yet lyricism and a sense of a tonal center remained crucial elements of her work, as did an approach to instrumental coloration that alluded to the styles of Ravel and Messiaen and often seemed to have more in common with the French style than with contemporary American works.         Ms. Talma taught at the Manhattan School of Music in the late 1920's, and at Hunter College for more than 50 years. She wrote ''Harmony for the College Student'' and was the co-author, with Robert Levin and James S. Harris, of ''Functional Harmony.'' She was a board member of the League of Composers, the International Society for Contemporary Music, the Fontainebleau Arts Association and the American Music Center.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Vera Brodsky Lawrence, a pianist, editor and historian of American music whose research helped bring the works of Scott Joplin and Louis Moreau Gottschalk to the attention of contemporary performers, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         Mrs. Lawrence was best known for ''The Collected Works of Scott Joplin,'' which restored to print much of that composer's long unavailable music. The edition, published in 1971, was a catalyst in the ragtime revival of the mid-1970's. She was an artistic consultant to the Houston Grand Opera in 1975 when it staged Joplin's opera, ''Treemonisha,'' and to Deutsche Grammophon when it recorded the production the same year.         Mrs. Lawrence also published ''The Piano Music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk'' (1969), the first collected edition of an American composer's works, and ''The Wa-Wan Press, 1901-1911,'' a five-volume reprint of Arthur Farwell's pioneering American music series. Her ''Music for Patriots, Politicians and Presidents'' (1975) explored the relationship between politics and music during the 18th and 19th centuries.         Her most recent project was ''Strong on Music,'' a series that explored the musical world of 19th-century New York through the eyes of the lawyer and diarist George Templeton Strong. The first volume, ''Resonances,'' was published in 1991. A second, ''Reverberations,'' followed in 1995. Mrs. Lawrence left a third volume nearly completed.         Music history was actually Mrs. Lawrence's second career; she did not begin to devote herself fully to it until 1965, when she gave up a 40-year career as a concert pianist. She was born in Norfolk, Va., in 1909, and attended the Juilliard School, where she was a student of Josef and Rosina Lhevinne, Rubin Goldmark and Bernard Wagenaar.         Mrs. Lawrence made her debut in 1925, and performed regularly in new music concerts and with chamber groups. She was a staff pianist at CBS radio from 1939 to 1946. In 1944, she married Theodore Lawrence, an engineer for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He died in 1964.         During her years as a performer, Mrs. Lawrence taught at the Juilliard School and the Curtis Institute of Music. In 1967, she became the administrator of the publications program of the Contemporary Music Project, which sent 73 composers to 77 secondary school systems around the country.         In 1969, Mrs. Lawrence compiled and edited a library of 500 works composed as part of the project.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Genia Robinor, a pianist and teacher, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 95 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Robinor was a well-known piano teacher whose pupils included Andre Watts. She taught at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, the Settlement Music School in Philadelphia and the Third Street Music School in New York City.         She was born in Odessa, Russia, and was a graduate of that city's Imperial Conservatory. After immigrating to the United States, she attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she earned her degree. She appeared with a number of orchestras, including the Phildelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Rebecca LaBrecque, a pianist who championed new music and new ways of using the keyboard in a classical concert setting, died on Sunday at Calpary Hospital  in the Bronx. She was 45 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a series of brain tumors, Ms. LaBrecque's sister, Sandra T. Parsons, said.         Beginning in the mid-1970's, Ms. LaBrecque was heard regularly in New York concert halls playing contemporary works as both soloist and chamber player. A musician who was able to quickly assimilate difficult music and perform it persuasively, Ms. LaBrecque was regularly called upon to perform in composer retrospectives. She commissioned more than 60 works, and revived many neglected  20th-century scores.         One of these was the Roger Sessions Piano Concerto, which Ms. LaBrecque performed with the American Composers Orchestra in 1984. It had been performed only twice since Sessions composed it in 1958. In the same concert, she gave the premieres of concertos composed for her by Joseph Manieri and Daniel Brewbaker.  In 1988 she revived Henry Cowell's 1929 Piano Concerto for a performance with the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center.         Ms. LaBrecque's connection with the music of Sessions went beyond the concerto. With the composer supervising, she recorded all of his Piano Sonatas.  Her recordings also included the works of Frank Martin and David Froom.         One of Ms. LaBrecque's most unusual performances was a 1986 recital at Merkin Concert Hall in which she simultaneously played the piano and a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer. The program was devoted to works she commissioned for the occasion, insisting that the composers write for both instruments.         Ms. LaBrecque was born in Torrington, Conn., on April 28, 1950, and studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and at the State University at Stony Brook.         In addition to Ms. Parsons, of Harwinton, Conn., Ms. LaBrecque is survived by her father, Maurice, of San Diego, and four other sisters: Natalie Marghuardt of San Diego, Mary Louise Cassidy of Naugatuck, Conn., Penny Kindt of Seattle and Florence Fancett of Michigan.       
         Lady Caroline Blackwood, a writer of wry, macabre novels and essays, and a beguiling Anglo-Irish aristocrat who married the painter Lucian Freud and the poet Robert Lowell, died yesterday in the Mayfair Hotel in Manhattan, where she  stayed the last few weeks while she was ill. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Ivana Lowell.         She published nine books and was best known and much admired in Britain. Among her works was "The Stepdaughter," a short epistolary novel about an abusive woman abandoned by her husband and left with his hideous daughter. Another novel, "The Fate of Mary Rose," was about an increasingly deranged mother's fatal obsession with her daughter's safety.         Her most recent book, "The Last of the Duchess," was an eccentric, Kafkaesque account of her vain attempt to visit the ailing Duchess of Windsor. It revolved  mostly around the Duchess's powerful lawyer, Suzanne Blum, portrayed in the book as obsessed with her client to the point of erotic fantasy.         British critics noted the "brilliant irony" and "rather brilliant bitchiness" of her writing, comparing it with the work of Muriel Spark and Iris Murdoch, among others. In her prose and in person, she exhibited a razor-sharp wit and offbeat sensibility. A dramatic woman, delicately built, intense and vulnerable, she was a famous beauty in her youth, and in later years remained striking for her extraordinary eyes, which Mr. Freud made into giant spheres in his hypnotic  portraits.         One portrait played a curious role in her life, as she related in an interview last year. During the 1950's, when she and Mr. Freud were living in Paris, "Lucian got a call out of nowhere from a mistress of Picasso's who asked  him if he could come round and paint her," she said. "The woman wanted to make Picasso jealous. Lucian very politely said maybe he could paint her portrait later, but not now because he happened to be in the midst of doing his wife's portrait."         That picture, she said, was "Girl in Bed," a work that years later also figured in the death of Robert Lowell, her third husband. Their marriage was in  tatters when, the story goes, Lowell left her in Ireland and flew to New York City. When his taxi arrived at his apartment on West 67th Street, the driver found Lowell slumped over. A doorman summoned Elizabeth Hardwick, the writer and editor, whom Lowell had left to marry Lady Caroline; she happened to live in the same apartment house. Ms. Hardwick opened the taxi door to be confronted with her former husband's corpse. He was clutching "Girl in Bed."         Lady Caroli'e moved amo'g several worlds: from the insular Anglo-Irish upper  classes, which she largely rejected for the smart set of postwar England and then for the liberal intelligentsia of New York City in the 1960's and 70's. During much of the last 35 years, she lived in the United States, splitting her time in recent years between an apartment in Manhattan and a house in Sag Harbor, L.I., that once belonged to President Chester A. Arthur.         Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood was born in London on July 16, 1931.  She was descended on her father's side from the great 18th-century dramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan and was a Guinness on her mother's side. (She liked to joke that she found stout undrinkable.) She grew up in the ancestral stone mansion, Clandeboye, in County Down in Northern Ireland.         Her great-grandfather, Lord Dufferin, was an eminent Victorian rumored to have been Disraeli's illegitimate son. Queen Victoria made him Viceroy of India, where he used to sit on his throne, fanned by peacock feathers. "Kipling loved my great-grandfather and wrote lots of very bad poems to him," Lady Caroline said. "He had a fatal effect on poets."         Her mother, Maureen, the Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, is a flamboyant figure in London who, according to one newspaper account, gave a black eye to Sir Oswald Mosley, the English Fascist, after he made a pass at her in Antibes.  Her father, Basil, the Marquess, was a friend of Evelyn Waugh and part of the circle described in "Brideshead Revisited." He was killed in Burma during World  War II, when Caroline was 12.         Like other women of her class, she skipped college; she moved to London and worked for Claud Cockburn, the influential left-wing journalist. She recalled meeting Mr. Freud at that time at a party memorable because the painter Francis  Bacon caused a row when he hooted down Princess Margaret, who had just started singing "Let's Do It." She and Mr. Freud then became part of the group that included Bacon, Cyril Connolly and the other artists and writers who gathered nightly to drink at the Gargoyle and Colony Clubs.         When her marriage to Mr. Freud ended in 1956, she installed herself at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. She got a tiny part in the television series "Have Gun Will Travel." Stephen Spender asked her to write an article for Encounter magazine about California beatniks, and it was ' sendup that launched  her writing career.         She next moved to New York and married Israel Citkowitz, an American composer and pianist, and a student of Aaron Copland, 20 years her senior. They were divorced in 1972, when she married Lowell, but they remained close.         During the next years she endured a series of Job-like catastrophes: the death of Citkowitz; Lowell's crippling manic depression and early death; the death from AIDS of her brother, Sheridan, to whom she was very close; the death of her eldest daughter, Natalya, after a drug overdose, and her own bout with cervical cancer, for which she had an operation that left her in constant pain.         Throughout, she maintained her dark humor and creatively transformed her experiences into her novels and essays. "I think it's partly Irish," she once explained. "Irish people are very funny but have this tragic sense.         "As Cal wrote," she added, referring to Lowell, "if there's light at the end  of the tunnel, it's the light of the oncoming train."         In addition to her daughter Ivana, of Manhattan, she is survived by her mother, of London; a sister, Lady Perdita Blackwood, of Ulster; another daughter, Evgenia Citkowitz of Los Angeles, and a son, Sheridan Lowell of Manhattan.
