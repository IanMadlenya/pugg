Mrs. Hasebroock served as president of the organization, which has members in 41 countries, including 500,000 in the United States, from 1964 to 1966.         In the late 1960's she received South Korea's highest citizen award, the Public Welfare Medal, for the federation's support for Shin-ai Village, a 50-home settlement for Korean War widows and their children. The federation had provided the aid at Mrs. Hasebroock's behest.         She is survived by a son, Robert of Lincoln; three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
        Marjorie Schuyler Van Ness, the first woman to be appointed to the New Jersey Board of Agriculture, died on Saturday at her horse farm in Raritan Township in Hunterdon County. She was 75 years old.         Marjorie Schuyler Van Ness, the first woman to be appointed to the New Jersey Board of Agriculture, died on Saturday at her horse farm in Raritan Township in Hunterdon County. She was 75 years old.         An outstanding horsewoman, Mrs. Van Ness and her late husband, Eugene, a retired New York banker, ran the 17-acre Hope Farm in Annandale for many years, raising horses, herefords and growing hay, wheat and grain. Her husband died in 1977.         She was named to the state agricultural board in 1971 by Gov. William Cahill. She received a distinguished service citation from the board in 1977, and a gold medallion from the New Jersey Agricultural Society for her years of service to agriculture.         Mrs. Van Ness was a founder and past president of the American Saddlebred Horse Association of New Jersey, and past president of the New Jersey Horse Council.         She is survived by a son, Philip, of Clinton Township, N.J.; two daughters, Marjorie Wismer of Bricktown, N.J., and Joan, of Raritan Township; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
        India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         Mrs. Edwards was unanimously elected to the national committee in 1950. She was first associated with the committee as a volunteer in the 1944 Presidential campaign. From 1945 to 1947 she was executive secretary of the women's division, which she served as associate director before becoming the committee's vice chairwoman.         Mrs. Edwards remained active in the Democratic Party for more than 30 years, through several generations of Democratic politicians, including Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.         For 22 years before she became active in politics she was on the staff of The Chicago Tribune, where she was society editor and woman's editor. She left the paper to marry her third husband, Herbert T. Edwards, a State Department official, and moved to Washington in 1942. Mr. Edwards died in the late 1970's.         Campaigning With Truman         Mrs. Edwards accompanied Mr. Truman, her political hero, on his 1948 campaign tour, where she repeatedly expressed her confidence in his victory at the polls.         At one point the President turned to her and sighed. ''India,'' he said, ''sometimes I think there are only two people who believe I will win. You and me.'' ''That's enough,'' she replied. Largely because of Mrs. Edwards's influence, Mr. Truman appointed more women to top jobs than any preceding President. Among them were Eugenia Anderson as Ambassador to Denmark, Perle Mesta as Minister to Luxembourg, Ruth Bryan Rohde as an alternate delegate to the United Nations and Georgia Neese Clark as Treasurer of the United States.         Explaining how she worked to increase the number of women in Federal jobs, Mrs. Edwards recalled: ''Sometimes I felt like a ghoul. I'd read the obits, and as soon as a man had died, I'd rush over to the White House and suggest a woman to replace him.''         Mrs. Edwards, who was named for her mother and her grandmother, was born in Chicago and grew up in Nashville. Her memoirs, ''Pulling No Punches,'' were published by G. P. Putnam's in 1977.         Mrs. Edward's daughter, India Moffett Williams, died in 1979, and her son, John Holbrook Moffett, died in World War II. She is survived by five grandchildren.

        Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Miss Stanwyck's press agent, Larry Kleno, said she died shortly before 5 P.M. at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, where she had been admitted about a week ago.         The actress played a rich mix of characterizations in 82 films but developed a distinctive image as a gutsy, self-reliant and self-assured woman whose husky voice and cool exterior usually masked a warm heart.         She was a tough-talking but tender-souled mother in ''Stella Dallas'' (1937), a slang-slinging showgirl in ''Ball of Fire'' (1941), a lurid blonde who orchestrates her husband's murder in ''Double Indemnity'' (1944) and a bedridden neurotic who learns from telephone quirks that she is marked for murder in ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' (1948).         Miss Stanwyck was nominated for best-actress Academy Awards for all four of those performances but won none. However, in 1982 the Motion Picture Academy awarded her an honorary Oscar for being ''an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress and one of the great ladies of Hollywood.'' A year earlier, she became the eighth person, and second woman, to be honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center for career-long excellence.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).         Some of Her Other Films         Other memorable Stanwyck films were ''The Bitter Tea of General Yen,'' which opened Radio City Music Hall in 1933, ''Annie Oakley'' (1935), ''Banjo on My Knee'' (1936), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Union Pacific'' (1939), ''Golden Boy'' (1939), ''Remember the Night'' (1940), ''The Great Man's Lady'' (1942), ''Lady of Burlesque'' (1943), ''Clash by Night'' (1952) and ''Titanic'' (1953).         The actress commanded increasingly higher salaries in the 1930's and early '40's, and in 1944 the Government listed her as the nation's highest-paid woman, earning $400,000.         From the mid-1950's on, she lent distinction to a string of otherwise lackluster movies. Turning to televison, she made many guest appearances and then starred in an anthology series, ''The Barbara Stanwyck Show,'' in 1960-61, and the highly popular series ''The Big Valley,'' in which she portrayed a frontier rancher from 1965 to 1969. The two series won her two Emmies and a cluster of other awards.         The actress's take-charge, down-to-earth screen image mirrored her childhood as Ruby Stevens, born into a poor family of Scottish-Irish descent in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn on July 16, 1907.         When she was 4 years old, her mother was killed when a drunken stranger pushed her off a moving streetcar. The loss devasted her father, a bricklayer, who deserted his five children. They never saw him again.         Left School at Age 13         Young Ruby, who had to board with family friends, sought solace by seeing as many movies as her pennies allowed. At the age of 13, she had to leave school to earn a living. She started as a wrapper in a department store and worked in other low-paying clerical jobs while studying dancing with a vaudevillian friend of her family.         At 15, Ruby entered show business as a chorus girl, first dancing in speakeasies and soon advancing to Broadway and touring stints in the Ziegfeld Follies and other revues. At 18, she won a leading role as a cabaret dancer in a melodrama, ''The Noose,'' which ran on Broadway for nine months. The program introduced her as Barbara Stanwyck, a glamorous name inspired by a theatrical poster: ''Jane Stanwyck in 'Barbara Frietchie.' ''         In 1927, at the age of 20, she won a leading role in the Broadway play ''Burlesque.'' She received good notices, played the part for two years and won nonexclusive contracts with Columbia Pictures and Warner Brothers.         Her first important movie role was classic Stanwyck - a shallow adventuress redeemed by love in a 1930 melodrama, ''Ladies of Leisure,'' directed by a youthful Frank Capra.         'Beloved by All' Involved         Mr. Capra, who also directed her in four later movies, wrote in his 1971 autobography, ''The Name Above the Title,'' that she was unique in not requiring rehearsals because she ''gave her all the first time she tried a scene.'' Her dedication, he wrote, made her ''beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras.''         Miss Stanwyck was also the favorite of Cecil B. De Mille, who wrote, ''I have never worked with an actress who was more cooperative, less temperamental and a better workman, to use my term of highest compliment.'' '' She was also the favorite leading lady of William Holden, Henry Fonda and Robert Preston.         Friends and colleagues described the actress as modest, generous and outspoken, and co-workers fondly called her ''Missy.'' If a cameraman she worked with decades earlier was having financial problems, she invariably gave him enough money to ease his troubles. She repeatedly refused to use a double and was seriously injured several times.         Miss Stanwyck's hair began silvering in her mid-40's, but she refused to dye it, just as she refused to conceal her age. In a 1981 interview at her longtime Beverly Hills home, she offered this advice:         ''You have to know when you've had your hour, your place in the sun. To be old is death here. I think it's kind of silly. Be glad you're healthy. Be glad you can get out of bed on your own.''         Even in her 70's Miss Stanwyck began every day by walking half a mile on an uphill treadmill that dominated her bedroom.         Praise for 'Thorn Birds'         In the early 1970's the actress became semi-reclusive. But in 1983 she appeared in a television mini-series, ''The Thorn Birds.'' Of her performance as a wealthy Australian who lusts after a young priest, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times concluded, ''When it comes to the big moments, she demonstrates the kind of disarming toughness that made her a major movie star.''         Miss Stanwyck was married twice, to the comedian Frank Fay from 1928 to 1935, and to the actor Robert Taylor from 1939 to 1951. With Mr. Fay, she adopted a son, Dion Anthony Fay. In 1981 she said of her second divorce:         ''Losing somebody you love by death or divorce is hard. But if they decide they want to be free, there's nothing to battle for. You have to let go. Bob and I didn't stay friends. We became friends again. Time does take care of things.''         In 1965, Miss Stanwyck and Mr. Taylor co-starred in her last movie, ''The Night Walker.'' Four years later, he died of lung cancer.

And, in 1987, her colleagues and admirers added their tributes to her independent spirit and professionalism as she received the 15th annual life achievement award of the American Film Institute.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).

Miss Fitler, who was an equestrian, figured in news reports in 1974 and 1975 because of her friendship with Michael Wilson, a 29-year-old former bartender.         Mr. Wilson said the two were engaged, but that has been disputed in Miss Fitler's family. At one point, retainers at her house summoned the police to eject Mr. Wilson, the son of a Welsh coal miner.         A granddaughter of a Mayor of Philadelphia, Edwin H.

She was 91 years old and lived in Manhattan.         With her husband, the late Donald Slesinger, a psychologist, Mrs. Slesinger founded Camp Tree Tops in Lake Placid, N.Y., in the early 1920's. The Slesingers gave up management of the camp in the early 1930's, and the camp was later sold.         Mrs. Slesinger, a graduate of Wellesley College, also taught at the Cherry Lawn School in Darien, Conn., in the 1920's. More recently, she was artist-in-residence at the James Lenox House in Manhattan.         She is survived by a son, Jonathan A., of Mountain View, Calif.; a daughter, Joanna Caproni of Manhattan; a sister, M. Helen Burnard of Nashua, N.H.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

        Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Sulzberger nurtured and bridged the generations of the family that has controlled The Times since 1896, when her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it as a small and ailing property. She played an important role in selecting the succeeding publishers -her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.         From all of them, Mrs. Sulzberger gained a unique view of the great events and personalities of the 20th century and of the paper's growth in covering them. To all of them, she conveyed the traditions of The Times and its dedication to serious journalism, to good taste and to progressive values.         Mrs. Sulzberger also served the paper as a director and as a trustee for the stock left by her father. And she strove to preserve the family ties among her 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.         At her request, cremation and interment will be private. A public memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or to Mrs. Sulzberger's alma mater, Barnard College.         Besides cherishing the values of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger read the paper diligently and regularly, but only modestly offered the editors ideas and news tips. She also wrote droll letters to the editor on issues great and small, asking that they be thrown out if judged foolish, or published with only a pseudonym, usually the name of a dead relative or friend.         Devotion to the Parks         A woman of energy, social conscience and impish humor, Mrs. Sulzberger pursued a variety of other interests, notably those devoted to parks and the environment, to Barnard, education and libraries, and to the welfare of animals.         She once inspired a series of articles that demonstrated the public's low interest and competence in history, a series that won The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1944 and provoked curriculum changes in many states. She also encouraged the paper to develop its potential as a classroom aid to teachers, which helped to make it the most widely circulated daily newspaper in schools and colleges.         Mrs. Sulzberger's own history of her experiences, a largely anecdotal memoir as told to her granddaughter Susan W. Dryfoos, was privately printed for friends and family in 1979 and then published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1981 under the title ''Iphigene.''         In a foreword, the historian Barbara W. Tuchman said of Mrs. Sulzberger, ''She is high-class in every way a woman can function - in devotion to family, in strong social conscience, in elegance of person and winning ways that gain her ends, in alert intelligence and irreverent humor, in energy and unfailing curiosity, in friendship and a welcoming home.''         Quiet but Decided Influence         Throughout her life, Mrs. Sulzberger had a quiet but decided influence on The Times. Perhaps the first time was at the age of 13, when her father discovered that she was using her weekly allowance to buy newspapers that carried comics. Mr. Ochs relented in his own opposition and decided to publish a Timesian strip, called ''The Roosevelt Bears.'' It ran for only six months, in 1906; Iphigene pronounced it boring.         When her husband was publisher, Mrs. Sulzberger's influence on The Times went beyond encouraging wider news coverage, to advocating divergent editorial views. She disagreed with Mr. Sulzberger by siding with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War against the Franco forces, by favoring statehood for Israel to provide a home for displaced European Jews and by preferring Adlai E. Stevenson instead of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for President.         When The Times endorsed Eisenhower in 1952, Mrs. Sulzberger told her husband she would vote for the general ''out of love for you and loyalty to The Times.'' But in 1956 she deserted the newspaper's position and voted for Stevenson.         ''I felt I had discharged my obligation to the paper four years earlier,'' she explained in her memoirs.         Encouraged by her parents to be curious and undogmatic about the world around her, Mrs. Sulzberger cultivated a well-stocked mind. She read and traveled extensively all her life, from the time her parents took her with them on their first grand tour of Europe when she was 8 years old.         One of her most joyous trips was a three-week visit to China in 1973, an experience she considered a high point of her life. Her 81st birthday fell during her stay in Beijing, where her Chinese hosts insisted on giving a banquet in her honor. She was also received by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who expressed his regard for Mrs. Sulzberger by inviting her to dinner and by talking with her at length about China and world issues.         She was the matriarch of the family and, according to one of her children, ''the glue that held us all together.'' When she was nearing 80, she began spending several days annually with grandchildren at schools in the Boston area, an effort to understand the outlook and life style of young people.         Chess for Central Park         Although Mrs. Sulzberger's major interests were her family and The Times, she embraced a number of civic and educational institutions. In 1928 she joined the Park Association, a volunteer group devoted to improving the city's parks. She became its president in 1934 and held the office until 1950, when she was elected chairman. She gave up that post in 1957 but kept her active membership.         Two results of her work for the parks particularly pleased her: getting the financier Bernard M. Baruch to contribute a chess and checkers house to Central Park and helping to restore Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx.         In 1976 Mrs. Sulzberger received the annual award of the Parks Council - a citizens' group into which the Park Association had merged - for her continuing work on environmental issues. In particular the award cited a work-study program she had founded in Central Park several years earlier, which was duplicated in other parks.         Four years later Mrs. Sulzberger was named honorary chairman of the newly formed Central Park Conservancy, a group of private citizens who raise funds for Central Park. She also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Barnard College and the gold medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences for distinguished service to humanity.         At the Jewish Theological Seminary she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1968 for her work in public, philanthropic and educational activities.         Another of Mrs. Sulzberger's avocations involved the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Her zeal reflected the delight she took in gardening and in flowers. She was a keen supporter of the institution's program to train student gardeners in cooperation with nearby Christopher Columbus High School. The garden honored her in 1965 with its distinguished service award.         Mrs. Sulzberger was also active in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she backed programs to train young people in restoring furniture and paintings.         Educational opportunity for youth was the thread that bound together Mrs. Sulzberger's ''outside'' interests.         The chief example of this was Barnard College, on whose board she sat from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. Her happiest achievement in this work was gathering funds for a library. The building, called the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960. The alumnae citation in 1972 spoke of ''excellence and service, intelligence and old-fashioned hard work.''         Columbia University, at its 1951 commencement, gave Mrs. Sulzberger a Doctor of Laws degree, citing her as the ''distinguished daughter of a distinguished father'' and praising her civic involvement as well as her role at The Times.         In addition to her occupation with Barnard affairs, she served at various times as a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which gave her an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1973, and of the University of Chattanooga. She was on the committee for the Dictionary of American Biography and on the advisory committee for publication of the works of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University project.         Honor From a Black College         She was also on the boards of the Cedar Knolls School (where she had once worked) and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and on the board of managers of Inwood House, a home for unmarried mothers.         Mrs. Sulzberger had been a director of Yaddo, a colony for artists and writers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that inherited a block of Times stock. In addition, she was involved with the State Communities Aid Association, the National Urban League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the New York Girl Scout Council. The council at one time met at her home because it could not find a suitable interracial gathering place.         In January 1978, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Bishop College of Dallas, then the largest predominantly black private college in the Southwest, and was commended for having been the largest single private donor in the history of the United Negro College Fund. ''She has contributed more than $35,000 a year in the past decade,'' the citation said.         Later that year Mrs. Sulzberger, a prime mover in setting up a program that let high school students alternate classroom studies with store and business jobs, received an award from the New York City Board of Education; it cited her as ''an outstanding friend of cooperative education.''         Amid these activities she found time to be interested in polar explorations, an interest shared with her husband. One result was Adm. Richard E. Byrd's naming of a body of water Sulzberger Bay; it is in Antarctica, off Marie Byrd Land. Its cold blue surface reflects a mountain, Mount Iphigene.         A Rabbi's Granddaughter         Born on Sept. 19, 1892, Iphigene Bertha Ochs grew up as the only child of Adolph S. and Iphigenia Wise Ochs. Her father was then proprietor of The Chattanooga Times, a growing Tennessee newspaper. Her mother was the daughter of Isaac Mayer Wise, rabbi of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati and founder of American Reform Judaism.         Iphigene's classical name, often shortened by her family to Iffy or If, proved a boon. Anyone who met her could forever greet her by name. ''Who could ever forget a name like Iphigene?'' she once asked.         On Aug. 13, 1896, Mr. Ochs bought the faltering New York Times, and soon the family moved from Chattanooga to New York. The child was educated at home until she was 8, when she was sent to Dr. Sachs's School for Girls. Her schooling at home, which Mrs. Sulzberger later called ''rather haphazard,'' nonetheless gave her a good grounding in history and literature.         When she learned to read, she said, her parents supplied her with ''one-syllable history books on Rome and Greece and France and the United States,'' along with fiction. Her mother also took her regularly to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and to the theater.         Mr. Ochs introduced his daughter to other worlds - the pleasures of walking, the mysteries of the newspaper business and delight in the ideas of other people.         ''Unquestionably, the high point of my week was Sunday, when my father stayed home and took me to Central Park,'' Mrs. Sulzberger said of her girlhood. ''He was a great walker. I learned to enjoy it, too.''         These walks were for fun and education. One of their Sunday trips was to the cemetery in the tiny Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx. Mr. Ochs walked his daughter to the grave of the poet for whom the park was named and pointed to the tombstone inscription composed by Fitz-Greene Halleck for his friend in 1820:         Green be the turf above thee         Friend of my better days!         None knew thee but to love thee,         Nor named thee but to praise.         Mr. Ochs told Iphigene that he wanted the last two lines placed on his gravestone. The request was quite premature: Mr. Ochs lived until 1935. But his daughter then complied with the wish.         Mr. Ochs also took her to the newspaper office. ''What I remember best about The Times of those days was its composing room, where they were very nice and let me push buttons,'' she recalled much later. When she was older, she was often a guest at luncheons her father gave for figures in business, the professions or politics.         'Are You Sure of Your Facts?'         At home, Mr. Ochs was an indulgent yet perfectionist father. He strove to help his daughter buttress her opinions with facts. ''He always used to say to me: 'What is your authority? Where did you read it? Are you sure of your facts?' '' Mrs. Sulzberger recalled. Her father persuaded her to memorize a passage from Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography'' that described how Franklin had cultivated humility by avoiding dogmatic statements.         ''I think this helped me form the habit of qualifying my remarks; it's become almost second nature,'' she said in later years, ''and I've endeavored to hand this wisdom on to my children and grandchildren.''         Young Iphigene took to travel. Starting in 1900, she made trips every year with her parents, either to Europe or in the United States. These were usually planned learning experiences, adjuncts to school and college.         Her attendance at Dr. Sachs's School was followed by four years at the Benjamin-Dean School, from which, in 1910, she entered Barnard. ''I discovered that learning could be a joy,'' she recounted of her years on the Morningside Heights campus. ''I was absolutely happy.''         In her school years she worked in the Henry Street Settlement, the Jewish Big Sisters Program and the Cedar Knolls School for disturbed children, experiences that contributed to a lifelong social awareness.         At Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course in the School of Journalism at Columbia. But Mr. Ochs held that a newspaper office was no place for women, especially not for his daughter, of whom he felt protective.         Publisher Gets a Son-in-Law         At college she ''very casually'' met Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the son of a cotton merchant; later she was reintroduced to him by her cousin Julius Ochs Adler, with whom Mr. Sulzberger was in military training at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The couple fell in love during Mr. Sulzberger's visits to the Ochs home on Lake George, but Mr. Sulzberger was obliged to propose twice before he was accepted - the successful occasion taking place, as she recalled with a twinkle, ''on the grounds of the local lunatic asylum'' in Spartanburg, S.C. He was stationed nearby as an Army lieutenant.         They were married at her parents' home in New York on Nov. 17, 1917, while Mr. Sulzberger was on a 10-day leave. Although Mr. Ochs first had reservations about his daughter's choice, ''within a few years his devotion to Arthur became boundless,'' she said.         World War I ended just as Mr. Sulzberger was to be sent abroad. So the couple settled in New York, where Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times.         The early years of Mrs. Sulzberger's marriage were given to making a home and rearing her children - Marian, born in 1918; Ruth, in 1921; Judith, in 1923, and Arthur Ochs, who was born in 1926. With her family well started, she began to take an active role in education and philanthropy.         Offstage Figure at Paper         In 1935, after the death of her father, Mrs. Sulzberger became a trustee under his will along with her husband and her cousin Julius Ochs Adler; her husband was elected president and publisher of The Times.         As the publisher's wife, Mrs. Sulzberger shared her husband's concerns and problems but remained steadfastly an offstage figure in the operation of the paper.         Her memoirs note, though, that at least one news beat - a scoop - came about ''because I had made eyes at a handsome young man in journalism school'' back in 1912 at Columbia. The man was Hollington Tong, who eventually became China's Ambassador to the United States.         The beat, on Aug. 23, 1944, was an account by James Reston of secret decisions by four major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China - on the future structure of the United Nations, including the concept of veto power in the Security Council.         Years later Mrs. Sulzberger revealed that the documents had come from the Chinese delegation, and Mr. Reston confirmed that they had been provided by a young diplomat, Joseph Ku, as a result of Mrs. Sulzberger's friendship with Ambassador Tong.         During World War II, she became director of special events for The Times, working with the promotion department. In this job, she furthered programs to assist the war effort, civilian defense, conservation and the use of The Times in schools and colleges.         Among other things, Mrs. Sulzberger suggested supplements and booklets for students on the war and on world affairs. She instituted forums for young people, which became a weekly event broadcast by WQXR, the radio station of The Times, and were later carried on television. She was also a tireless hostess at lectures that staff members of The Times gave for teachers, and she had a hand in Musical Talent in Our Schools, a project aimed at stimulating student musicians.         After the war, Mrs. Sulzberger quietly phased herself out of her Times job. Her children began to marry and establish homes of their own. Grandchildren were born. This all drew on her sense of family.         At the same time, she wanted to devote more attention to domestic concerns, including gardening. Before 1949, the Sulzbergers had a country home, called Hillandale, in White Plains. They sold it and bought a house near Stamford, Conn., which they also named Hillandale.         A Change of Generations         In 1957, the process of shifting daily management of The Times to younger shoulders began. Mr. Sulzberger, who had been president and publisher for 22 years, turned his presidency over to Orvil E. Dryfoos, then 44, husband of the Sulzbergers' daughter Marian. A next step was taken in 1961, when Mr. Sulzberger gave the publisher's post to Mr. Dryfoos and became chairman. He kept that position until his death, on Dec. 11, 1968.         Enfeebled by a stroke in his last years, Mr. Sulzberger relied almost completely on his wife as his contact with the world.         Meanwhile, in the spring of 1963, after a long newspaper strike in New York, Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the youngest Sulzberger child and the only son, was named president and publisher.         Along with her son, Mrs. Sulzberger's three other children are now directors of the Times Company - Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.         Mrs. Sulzberger herself was a director of the Times Company from 1917 until 1973, when she became a director emeritus. She was among those who voted to alter the company structure fundamentally, granting limited voting rights to the Class A stock and listing it on the American Stock Exchange. At her death she was a trustee of the stock trust established by her father that exercised effective control of the enterprise.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Sulzberger continued to live mostly in New York, at 1115 Fifth Avenue, staying in touch with her growing family and carrying on community and educational pursuits. She still traveled, went to the theater, ballet and concerts, and spent weekends in Stamford.         In 1982, when she turned 90, there were a number of celebrations. One was given by Barnard to honor her many contributions. Another was held at the New York Botanical Garden, where 165 friends and relatives put on skits, sang songs and poured forth affection.         Barbara Tuchman, in the foreword to ''Iphigene,'' notes that Mrs. Sulzberger was appointed by her father to the board of The Times when she was in her 20's and had the longest connection of anyone with the paper.         ''Through her, the continuity of family control from father to husband to son-in-law to son has been maintained for over 60 years and, through her, it will be passed on to the next generation - her grandchildren,'' Mrs. Tuchman wrote.         ''Through Iphigene's steady companionship and interest in their lives, her influence makes itself felt and will endure at the paper after the source is gone.''

        Rosamond Lehmann, whose novels of love, betrayal and family rivalries were critically acclaimed, died in her home here on Monday, her family announced today. She was 89 years old.         Rosamond Lehmann, whose novels of love, betrayal and family rivalries were critically acclaimed, died in her home here on Monday, her family announced today. She was 89 years old.         Miss Lehmann's first novel, ''Dusty Answer,'' won immediate fame for the young author when it was published in 1927. The novel, about a girl's development from childhood to maturity, was praised for its candor, wit and psychological insight as well as for its lyrical, sensuous writing.         She followed this with ''A Note of Music'' in 1930, ''Invitation to the Waltz'' in 1932, ''The Weather in the Streets'' in 1936, ''The Ballad and the Source'' in 1944 and ''The Gypsy's Baby,'' a collection of short stories, in 1946.         Two Sisters, One Lover         Her next book was ''The Echoing Grove,'' about the relationship between two sisters and the man who is the husband of one and the lover of the other.         With shifts of time and approach, the same incidents in the book are seen through the eyes of different people.         The book was written after the bitter breakup of Miss Lehmann's love affair with the poet Cecil Day Lewis, and critics said it carried clear traces of that time in her life.         The soft-voiced author grew up in a large, comfortable home at Bourne End on the Thames near London. She was educated at Cambridge University.         Married 2 Future Lords         She met her first husband, Walter Runciman, who was later to become Lord Runciman, at Cambridge University. They married in 1923 and were divorced in 1928.         Later in 1928, she married Wogan Philipps, the eldest son of the first Lord Milford, the shipping magnate. They had two children, Hugo and Sally. That marriage ended in divorce in 1944.         Her grief over the death of her daughter from polio led her to spiritualism for a time. For many of her later years she was vice president of the privately financed College of Psychic Studies in London.         Toward the end of Miss Lehmann's life, the Virago Press, which specializes in works by women, republished many of her novels, introducing her work to a new generation of readers.         Queen Elizabeth II awarded Miss Lehmann the Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1982.         She is survived by her son, Hugo.

Who are these people. . . . Who pollutes the air? Who cuts down the trees, builds houses on the stripped hillsides? Who poisons the sheep, shoots the deer, oils the beaches, dams and rivers, dries up the swamps, concretes the counyrysides?''

''The book encapsulates the best qualities of her work,'' said The Times of London, which went on to list ''a crystal-clear style of storytelling, a respect for the innocence and intelligence of the young reader, a serious treatment of supernatural phenomena, a regard for all natural life and a belief that a man-centered conception of the world is false and crippling.''         In 1970, Mrs. Boston described her professional objectives thus: ''To remind adults of joy, now considered obsolete - and to encourage children to use and trust their senses for themselves at first hand - their ears, eyes and noses, their fingers and the soles of their feet, their skins and their breathing, their muscular joy and rhythms and heartbeats, their instinctive loves and pity and their awe of the unknown.''         An Early Foe of Pollution         The former Lucy Maria Wood was born on Dec. 10, 1892, in Southport, Lancashire, into a devout Methodist family. Her father was an engineer. She attended Somerville College at Oxford for a year and left to serve as a nurse in France in World War I. She married Harold Boston, then an officer in the Royal Flying Corps. They settled in Cheshire, where she became an early campaigner against industrial pollution.         The couple were divorced in 1935, and Mrs. Boston studied painting on the Continent until she returned home in early 1939, on the eve of World War II. It was then that she bought the crumbling 12th-century manor, which she soon transformed into one of the oldest habitable homes in England.         Surviving, besides her son, are two granddaughters and two stepgrandsons.

Her mother, a professional soprano, gave her singing lessons when she was a child, and she later studied at the Royal Manchester College of Music.         She made her operatic debut in 1960, singing Second Boy in ''Die Zauberflote'' by Mozart at Glyndebourne in southern England. In 1963 she scored her first major success, as Countess Adele in Rossini's ''Count Ory.''

        Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         She had been suffering from cancer, said her son, Timothy.         Known as Lois Moran throughout her career, she made her first film, in France, at the age of 14 and gained fame the next year when she starred with Ronald Colman in Samuel Goldwyn's ''Stella Dallas.''         In her film career of more than two dozen movies, Miss Moran combined an artist's versatility with romantic appeal. F. Scott Fitzgerald was said to have based the character Rosemary on her when he wrote ''Tender Is the Night.''         By the age of 20, she had already made four movies for Fox Studios, where she was under long-term contract. But she played leading roles for other studios as well, among them parts in ''Padlocked,'' ''Reckless Lady,'' ''The Road to Mandalay,'' ''Don't Marry,'' ''Mammy'' and ''The Men in Her Life.''         In the early 1930's, after studying singing, she moved to musicals, making her Broadway debut in ''This Is New York.'' She was the leading woman in George Kaufman's satire ''Of Thee I Sing'' and also starred for four years in ''Let 'Em Eat Cake.''         But in 1935, after marrying Col. Clarence M. Young, an Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Miss Moran slowed the pace of her career. She retired permanently in 1954 after co-starring with Robert Preston in the television series ''Waterfront.''         Miss Moran was born in Pittsburgh but, while still an infant, moved to Paris with her mother, a physician's widow. There she joined the Paris Opera Corps de Ballet, where she was spotted by a director who cast her in a movie.         She returned to the United States and starred as Belle Bennett's daughter in ''Stella Dallas.'' After that film's success, the offers poured in. She did one or two films at each of the major studios before signing her long-term contract with Fox.         For some time after her retirement, she and her husband lived and traveled throughout the country. But when Mr. Young retired as a vice president of Pan American World Airways more than 20 years ago, the couple moved permanently to Sedona.         Miss Moran's only immediate survivor is her son, who lives in Sedona.

        Berenice Robinson Morris, a composer, teacher and editor, died on Friday in Mount Vernon Hospital. She was 81 years old and lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         Berenice Robinson Morris, a composer, teacher and editor, died on Friday in Mount Vernon Hospital. She was 81 years old and lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         Mrs. Morris's son Jeffrey Brandon Morris said she died after a brief illness.         Mrs. Morris studied composition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and the Juilliard Graduate School in New York. Her works include instrumental, chamber, symphonic and choral works, as well as Jewish liturgical music.

        Laura Perls, a founder of the Gestalt school of psychotherapy, died Friday in Pforzheim, West Germany. She was 84 years old.         Laura Perls, a founder of the Gestalt school of psychotherapy, died Friday in Pforzheim, West Germany. She was 84 years old.         She died of complications from a thyroid condition, said Daniel Rosenblatt, a Gestalt therapist in Manhattan who was a close friend.         In the late 1940's and 1950's, Mrs. Perls collaborated with her husband, Fritz Perls, to develop the theory and technique of Gestalt therapy. The therapy is an eclectic blend borrowing from such sources as the work of Freud and Wilhelm Reich, psychodrama, existentialism and a German theory of perception of the 1930's called gestalt.         Fritz Perls, a psychiatrist, was the better-known and more flamboyant of the pair, acting as teacher in residence at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, Calif., during the 1960's heyday of the human potential movement it expounded, and traveling the world to train therapists. He died in 1970.         A Turn to the Present         But among many Gestalt therapists, Laura Perls was seen as the mainstay of the movement, heading the major Gestalt training institute in New York City for almost 40 years, and an unacknowledged contributor to the early books by her husband that formulated the approach.         Gestalt therapy was one of the first psychotherapies to break with the traditional methods of psychoanalysis, which focused on the traumas of early life, and turn the focus on a person's emotions and perceptions at the present.         While the method met with intense opposition and criticism from analysts in its early days, Gestalt therapy is now recognized as a major approach to treating emotional problems, and its methods are widely employed even among therapists of other schools.         Some techniques that Gestalt therapists use derive from theater and movement. For instance, the therapy holds that each element in a patient's dream symbolizes an aspect of the self. In one technique, someone who dreamed about talking to a cigar-smoking conductor on a train might enact being, in turn, the cigar, the conductor and even the train.         Laura Perls, whose given name was Lore Posner, was born in 1905, the daughter of a prosperous merchant, in Pforzheim. She had returned to her birthplace earlier this year to be near her daughter, Renate Perls.         Studied With Theologians         As a student in Germany, Mrs. Perls took courses with the theologians Paul Tillich and Martin Buber and studied the work of the psychologists who had formed a new gestalt school, though not a method of treatment. These psychologists included Kurt Goldstein. A student of movement and dance as well as an accomplished pianist, Mrs. Perls became a psychoanalyst in Germany.         But she shared with her husband a dissatisfaction with Freudian orthodoxy that led them to the innovations that developed into Gestalt therapy. Many of the early developments have been attributed to her, including having the patient sit up and face the therapist rather than lying down as is traditional in psychoanalysis.         Laura and Fritz Perls met as students in Frankfurt and were married in 1930. They left Germany for South Africa in 1933 to escape the rise of fascism. Coming to America in 1948, they settled in New York City, where they founded the New York Institute for Gestalt Therapy in 1952. Mrs. Perls headed the institute until recent years.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Perls is survived by a son, Dr. Stephen R. Perls, a psychologist in Albuquerque, N.M.; a brother, Robert Posner, of Providence, R.I.; four grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.

In 1983 she was named Woman of the Year by a coalition of 33 Westchester women's groups.         Ms. Stein was a founder of the Westchester chapter of the National Organization for Women in the early 1970's and started its divorce committee, which lobbied for legislation leading to the equitable distribution laws of 1980.         A widow, Ms. Stein is survived by a son, Richard, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., and a daughter, Nancy Tunis of Rye Brook, N.Y., and two grandchildren.

Olive Ann Burns, whose illness with lymphoma prompted her to write the 1984 novel ''Cold Sassy Tree,'' died on Wednesday. She was 65 years old and lived in Atlanta.         Ms. Burns died of heart failure, said a spokesman for Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta.         Set in a small town in Georgia in 1906, her novel centers on a scandal that erupts when a crusty old man marries a young Yankee milliner just weeks after his first wife's death. As seen through the eyes of a teen-age boy, the May-December relationship develops from a marriage of convenience to one of deep love and trust.         A TV Movie         ''Cold Sassy Tree'' became a Book-of-the-Month Club alternate selection in 1984 and was made into a movie broadcast on the TNT cable network in October. It featured Faye Dunaway and Richard Widmark as the couple and Neil Patrick Harris as the boy.         Ms. Burns decided to write the novel moments after a doctor diagnosed her disease in 1975, her brother, William H. Burns of Atlanta, said yesterday. ''She told me she thought: 'I've got to do something,' '' he said. '' 'I can't just sit home.' ''         ''She had always wanted to write a book,'' Mr. Burns said, adding that their father had been a storyteller and that Ms. Burns had been taking copious notes of his tales, some of which inspired ''Cold Sassy Tree.'' She was writing a sequel at her death, he said.         Ms. Burns and her husband, Andrew Sparks, wrote for Atlanta Weekly, a Sunday magazine once operated by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. She was a freelance writer and also wrote an advice column for The Constitution under the pen name Amy Larkin. Her husband, who also had lymphoma, died of heart failure last year.         Ms. Burns majored in journalism and graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1946.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by a son, John A. Sparks of Colorado Springs, Colo.; a daughter, Becky Sparks of Atlanta, and two sisters, Margaret Turn of Bushkill, Pa., and Jean LeGrand of Conyers, Ga.

In France she met Jane Addams, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and first president of the women's league, whose example inspired Mrs. Olmsted to work for peace.         Her husband, Allen Olmsted, a Pennsylvania judge who was a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, died in 1976.

All her British film roles were of American women; the British labor office at the time prohibited a foreigner playing a role that could be filled by a British citizen.         From the 1940's through the 1960's Miss Seegar appeared in American plays including ''At War With the Army'' with Gary Merrill, directed by Mr. Stone on Broadway in 1949, and Sheridan's ''School for Scandal'' with Patricia Neal in 1953 and ''Ernest in Love,'' a musical based on Oscar Wilde's ''The Importance of Being Earnest'' in 1960, both off Broadway.         Mrs. Wilson on Television         On radio Miss Seegar played several roles over six years in her husband's popular serial, ''The Aldrich Family.'' On television she played Mrs. Wilson in ''Dennis the Menace,'' the cookie-baking wife of the curmudgeon next door.         For nearly 25 years Miss Seegar toured under the auspices of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the American College Theater Festival and the United States Army. In 1983 she and Mr. Stone produced and staged ''Sweet Land,'' a pageant celebrating the 300th anniversary of their Bucks County community that enlisted the talents of 300 of their neighbors.         Miss Seegar was born in Greentown, Ind., attended school in London and Paris, went to Hollywood High and graduated with honors in drama from Los Angeles Community College.         In addition to Mr. Stone, she is survived by their son Joseph, of Newtown; a daughter, Francine, of Wallingford, England; two sisters, Dorothy Hatch of Washington and Miriam Whelan of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.       
        Margaret B. Mark, a leader in the Girl Scouts of America and in social work organizations, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         Margaret B. Mark, a leader in the Girl Scouts of America and in social work organizations, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         Mrs. Mark died of multiple sclerosis, a spokesman for the family said.         She was formerly a member of the national board of the Girl Scouts of America, chairwoman of its committee on public information and co-chairwoman of its committee on religious policy.         Active in civic affairs, she was on the founding board of the Tennessee School of Social Work, and was president of the Tennessee Conference of Social Work and of the Women's Civic Forum. She was vice president of the Manhattan chapter of the Industrial Home for the Blind.         Mrs. Mark took part in three White House Conferences on Children and Youth, the most recent in 1950, and was a member of the executive committee for the White House Conference on the Family in 1948. The Margaret Mark Educational Evaluation Program at Teachers College of Columbia University was established in her honor.         She was born in Chicago and was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and the University of Chicago School of Social Work.         She was the widow of Dr. Julius Mark, former senior rabbi of Congregation Emanu-El in Manhattan, who died in 1977.         She is survived by a son, Dr. James Mark of Palo Alto Calif., a daughter, Margaret Heller of Madison, N.J.; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
        Ines Mendoza de Munoz, the widow of Luis Munoz Marin, the longtime Governor of Puerto Rico, died Monday at a hospital in Rio Piedras, a suburb of San Juan. She was 82 years old and lived in San Juan.         Ines Mendoza de Munoz, the widow of Luis Munoz Marin, the longtime Governor of Puerto Rico, died Monday at a hospital in Rio Piedras, a suburb of San Juan. She was 82 years old and lived in San Juan.         Officials of the Commonwealth said she died of a heart attack.         Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon declared an official three-day period of mourning and ordered flags at public sites to be flown at half-staff.         Known widely and affectionately as Dona Ines, Mrs. Munoz was Puerto Rico's First Lady for the 16 years her husband was Governor. She was an early adherent to his Popular Democratic Party and married him in 1940. She was an active adviser to her husband and helped him begin ''Operation Bootstrap,'' the economic program that revitalized the Commonwealth's economy.         A 1927 graduate of a school of education that is now part of the University of Puerto Rico and of Columbia University in 1931, she also had distinguished career as a schoolteacher.         She is survived by two children from an earlier marriage, a son, Rafael Palacios and a daughter, Carmen Palacios de Ramirez, both of San Juan; two daughters from her second marriage, Senator Victoria Munoz Mendoza of San Juan and Viviana Munoz Mendoza of Boston; 14 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, had accompanied her to the hospital.         The singer left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had a fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in-promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century by the languorous sexuality of her throaty voice as well as by the directness of her personality. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical ''Hello Dolly!,'' which she played on Broadway from 1967 to 1969.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' Miss Bailey once remarked in attempting to describe herself. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune.''         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.''         Criticism on All-Black Casting         Miss Bailey was equally straightforward with those who criticized her because the cast of her ''Hello, Dolly!'' was all black. ''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job? What is good for the Negro? What is good for the Negro is good for everyman. Every man has a place in this world, but no man has a right to designate that place.''         Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''         Part Indian Ancestry         Pearl Mae Bailey was born on March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Va., the youngest of four children of black and Creek Indian ancestry. Miss Bailey's parents were divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried and moved to Philadelphia.         Her only brother, Willie, was a tap-dancing protege of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and performed for a time as Bill Bailey. He once chased her from the theater where he was rehearsing, and to get back at him, Miss Bailey, at 15, entered an amateur contest. She sang ''Poor Butterfly'' and ''Talk of the Town'' and did a tap dance, and won first prize.         For several winters she worked for $15 a week and tips as a singer and dancer in small clubs in the coal-mining section of Pennsylvania. One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.''         Won Award in 1946         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.'' She won the Donaldson Award as the most promising new performer of 1946 for her performance. Later Broadway roles included ''Arms and the Girl,'' ''Bless You All'' and ''House of Flowers.''         In addition to ''Carmen Jones'' and ''Porgy and Bess,'' she appeared in the films ''Variety Girl,'' ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''Father's Day,'' ''That Certain Feeling'' and ''St. Louis Blues.''         From 1946 on she was a top attraction in night clubs and variety houses and on television in the United States and Britain. Her act changed relatively little from year to year, and always retained some early successes, including ''From Mouton to Muskrat to Mink'' -a perennial favorite.         Miss Bailey's received a special Tony Award in 1968 for her performance in ''Helly, Dolly!''         Besides Mr. Bellson, Miss Bailey is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee, both of Los Angeles, and by two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, both of Philadelphia.         Correction:  August 25, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary of Pearl Bailey in some editions last Saturday and some on Sunday referred incompletely to her co-stars in the Broadway musical ''Hello, Dolly!,'' and a correction in this space on Tuesday misidentified the actor with whom she first performed the role. Cab Calloway starred with Miss Bailey in a 1967 staging of the musical, and Billy Daniels appeared with her in a 1975 revival.

A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         In a stage career that began in 1933 when she won first prize at an amateur night in Philadelphia and reached a peak with her 1967 starring role on Broadway in an all-black version of the musical ''Hello, Dolly!'' with Cab Calloway, Miss Bailey said she thought of herself as a singer and not an actress.         'I Tell Stories to Music'         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' she told an interviewer some years ago. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune. I laugh at people who call me an actress.''         Her trademark was a warm, lusty singing voice accompanied by an easy smile and elegant gestures that charmed audiences and translated smoothly from the nightclub stage and Broadway to film and television.         On stage her ample figure, often swathed in fur and sparkling with rhinestones and jewels, was a magnet for audience attention as she tossed off a ballad in throwaway style.         ''I've lost one of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life,'' Mr. Calloway said after learning of Miss Bailey's death. ''I've lost a co-worker and a wonderful person.''         Carol Channing, who had created the role of Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical three years before Miss Bailey undertook the part, said: ''The entertainment world has lost one of its most creative performers of our time. Her talent was unique and enduring.''         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, to whom she was married for 38 years and who went with her to the hospital on Friday, said simply, ''I've lost my best friend.''         The singer had left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint.

        Mary Shaw Shorb, a microbiologist whose research led to the discovery of vitamin B12 in 1947, died Saturday at Greater Laurel-Beltsville Hospital in Maryland.         Mary Shaw Shorb, a microbiologist whose research led to the discovery of vitamin B12 in 1947, died Saturday at Greater Laurel-Beltsville Hospital in Maryland.         She was 83 years old and lived in Beltsville. The hospital said she died of a kidney ailment.         Dr. Shorb, a research professor emerita of poultry husbandry at the University of Maryland, was working at the Maryland Agricultural Experimental Station in the mid-1940's in search of a microorganism that would be useful in treating pernicious anemia, a disease that was fatal until the 1920's, when a liver extract was developed to treat it.         Bacterium Discovered         Since the extract had to be injected in a costly and painful process, scientists sought an alternative. Dr. Shorb found a bacterium, Lactobacillus lactis Dorner, that was present in tomato juice and liver extract, making possible the creation of the vitamin.         Securing an unpaid research position at the University of Maryland, she worked with scientists of Merck & Company to develop the substance that was marketed as vitamin B12.         In 1949 she was made a research professor at the university, a post she held until she retired in 1972.         Dr. Shorb, a native of Wahpeton, N.D., held a bachelor's degree from the College of Idaho and a doctorate in immunology from Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, where she was a researcher from 1929 to 1932.         After taking time off to raise a family, she returned to research in 1942 with the Agriculture Department's Bureau of Human Nutrition and later with the Dairy Industry Bureau. In 1946 she was given the research position at the University of Maryland.         Dr. Shorb is survived by her husband, Doyf; a son, Alan, who lives in Japan; two daughters, Carole Shorb and Barbara Breeden, both of Beltsville; a sister, Margaret Brownfield of Boise, Idaho; seven grandchldren, and 14 great-grandchildren.       
        Mary Whitcomb DeGrange, the director of the Federal Music Project in New York City, which taught thousands of people during the Depression, died on Wednesday at the National Orthopedic Hospital in Alexandria, Va. She was 90 years old and had lived in Greenwich Village for more than 60 years.         Mary Whitcomb DeGrange, the director of the Federal Music Project in New York City, which taught thousands of people during the Depression, died on Wednesday at the National Orthopedic Hospital in Alexandria, Va. She was 90 years old and had lived in Greenwich Village for more than 60 years.         She died of brain tumors, her son, Richard F. Whitcomb, said.         Mrs. DeGrange, a graduate of Northwestern University, taught at the Greenwich House Music School in the Village and was later an editor of music texts for Prentice-Hall, Silver Burdette and Columbia University.         Her first husband was Robert A. Whitcomb, a writer, and her second husband was Leonard DeGrange, a portrait painter.         Surviving, besides her son, Richard, of Potomac, Md., are four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
        Flora Staal Hartog, who founded F. Staal, the Fifth Avenue jewelry store, 50 years ago and ran it until she retired in 1983, died yesterday at her home in Forest Hills, Queens. She was 87 years old.         Flora Staal Hartog, who founded F. Staal, the Fifth Avenue jewelry store, 50 years ago and ran it until she retired in 1983, died yesterday at her home in Forest Hills, Queens. She was 87 years old.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hartog came to New York from her native Amsterdam in 1940. With her husband, Jacob, and their two sons, she escaped three days after the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940 and soon reached the United States by way of England.         She was the daughter of Abraham Staal, a prominent antiques dealer in Amsterdam. Her store, established a few months after her arrival in New York, originally sold china and silver but evolved later into a retail jewelry business. After several decades on Fifth Avenue the store recently moved to East 57th Street and is now run by her son Albert, of Chester, N.J. Her husband went into the food business and became chairman of Hartog Foods International.         She is also survived by another son, Jack, of Manhattan; four grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.

Mary Papajohn Haris, vice president of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan. She was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her son Konstantine said.         Mrs. Haris joined the Advertising Bureau in 1986 and was responsible for its national travel, tobacco and political advertising accounts. Before that, she was vice president of the American Standards Testing Bureau and from 1969 to 1984 directed marketing strategies for the MRC Television Network's teleconference system.         She was a graduate of Marymount Manhattan College and Columbia University.         She is survived by two sons, Konstantine and Alexander, as well as her mother, Alice Papajohn.       
        Martha Dodd Stern, an American author who in the 1930's and 1940's wrote popular books about Nazi Germany and later fled behind the Iron Curtain when she and her wealthy husband, Alfred K.

Stern, were accused of being Soviet spies, died on Aug. 10 in Prague, friends reported. She was 82 years old and had lived in the Czechoslovak capital for more than three decades.         Victor Rabinowitz, a New York lawyer who received word of Mrs. Stern's death, said that although the cause of her death was not reported, she had recently suffered an intestinal blockage.         Martha Dodd came to public attention in 1939 when her first book, ''Through Embassy Eyes,'' was published. It told of her four years in Berlin beginning in 1933 when her father, William E. Dodd, was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as Ambassador to Germany after Adolf Hitler's rise to power.         Then in her 20's, she was at first favorably impressed by the new leaders of Nazi Germany but her later disillusionment was reflected in her book.         In 1938, a year after her return to the United States, she married Mr. Stern, a former chairman of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York who had inherited through an earlier marriage part of the fortune of Julius Rosenwald, the Chicago philanthropist.         In 1941, after her father's death and nine months before the United States entered World War II, Mrs. Stern and her brother, William E. Dodd Jr., published the Ambassador's diaries. Critics said that by failing to edit the comments of Germans who were opposed to Hitler they endangered the anti-Nazi underground.         Subject of McCarthy Investigation         In the last days of the war Mrs. Stern published ''Sowing the Wind,'' a novel that dealt with the moral degradation of Germans under the Nazi hierarchy.         In the early 1950's she and Mr. Stern became persistent targets of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy in his anti-Communist investigations. The couple moved to Mexico City in 1953, and four years later Boris Morros, an American counterspy, testified to the House Committee on Un-American Activities that the Sternses were part of a Soviet spy network.         When they were indicted on espionage charges in 1957, the couple fled to Prague, where they settled. They later traveled to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries and to Cuba but never returned to the United States. Mrs. Stern did translations of books and articles. Mr. Stern died four years ago at the age of 88.         Mrs. Stern is survived by a son, Robert, who lives in Prague.

        Marya Mannes, an author, journalist and critic, died Thursday at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. She was 85 years old.         Marya Mannes, an author, journalist and critic, died Thursday at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. She was 85 years old.         Her son, David R. J. Blow, said she had died after suffering a series of strokes this week at the hospital, a geriatric facility that she entered in March. She had lived in various residences for the elderly, mainly in California, since 1983, after residing most of her earlier life in Manhattan.         The versatile Ms. Mannes was a social critic and a critic of radio, television and theater. She worked as a staff writer for the magazine The Reporter from 1952 to 1963. Her writing there included articles, essays and reviews. She even wrote satirical verse, under the pen name ''Sec.''         She did much writing over the years for The New Yorker and for other publications ranging from McCalls to The New York Times, and was the author of several books.         More Than Outspoken         Ms. Mannes's 1958 collection of essays - largely from The Reporter -was contentiously titled ''More in Anger: Some Opinions, Uncensored and Unteleprompted.'' William du Bois, reviewing it in The New York Times, said that ''to call these pages outspoken is putting things mildly.'' The book, he continued, ''is guaranteed to shock you into awareness of its author as an original thinker.''         ''Whether she is writing of the Rheingold girls or the boys in Washington,'' he observed, ''of social-minded mothers and their child victims, of the world of Miltown or the think-room at the United Nations, of the 'half-people' of our automotive age or the heirs of Senator McCarthy, she hews to the line and lets the quips fall where they may.''         For some years, Ms. Mannes was seen often on television, but she was a champion of the written word. In a speech to a gathering of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, she once said, ''No picture on a screen can ever be an adequate substitute for the reporting of a trained observer and an honest writer.''         Marya Mannes was born on Nov. 14, 1904, on the West Side of Manhattan. Her parents were David Mannes and the former Clara Damrosch - founders of the Mannes College of Music.         She grew up in Manhattan, graduating in 1923 from Miss Veltin's School for Girls. Instead of going to college, she went to Europe for two years and studied sculpture, mainly in England.         She went on to do varied writing - including a play, ''Cafe,'' that failed on Broadway in 1930. From 1933 to 1936, she worked for Vogue magazine, as an associate editor and later as feature editor.         Wartime Analyst         During part of World War II, she was an intelligence analyst with the Office of Strategic Services. After the war, she did much free-lance writing in addition to her work on The Reporter. Over the decades, 329 articles with her byline were published - 275 of them in The Reporter.         In later years she appeared on various televison programs. The Times television critic Jack Gould wrote in 1961 that ''her sustained acerbity is one of the attractive adornments of contemporary criticism.'' She also lectured across the country.         Her books include ''Out of My Time'' (1971), an autobiography; ''Message From a Stranger'' (1948) and ''They'' (1968) - both novels - and ''Subverse: Rhymes for Our Times'' (1959), a volume of satiric verse.         She was also a co-author of ''Uncoupling: The Art of Coming Apart'' (1972), a book about divorce. ''The Best of Marya Mannes,'' an anthology of her writing edited by Robert Mottley, was published in 1986.         In 1958 she won the George Polk Memorial Award, one of many honors given for her writing.         Her three marriages - to the set designer Jo Melziener, to Richard A. Blow, an artist, and to Christopher Clarkson, a representative of British companies - ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, who lives in San Francisco.

She died of congestive heart failure, her son Thomas said.         Mrs. Streeter, an energetic civic volunteer before and after the war, earned a commercial pilot's license in 1942 at the age of 46. The next year, she was appointed to head the women Marines.         She retired from the Marines as a colonel at the end of the war and was awarded the Legion of Merit.         When the women Marines were formed, they joined other female reserve service arms like the WAVES, for the Navy, and the WACs, for the Army.         Their total enrollment was 250,000, of which the women Marines constituted 23,000 by the war's end. The men in service numbered 12 million.         Mrs. Streeter, who was born in Brookline, Mass., moved to Morristown in 1922. She attended Bryn Mawr College for two years.         Among the organizations in which she was active before the war were the New Jersey State Relief Council, the New Jersey Commission on Interstate Cooperation, the New Jersey Board of Children's Guardians and the New Jersey State Historical Sites Council.

Daisy Wilson Cave, the last known Confederate widow of the Civil War, died Saturday at a nursing home here. She was estimated to have been 97 to 105 years old.         Mrs. Cave was in her 20's when she married Henry Benjamin Cave, then a 75-year-old veteran of the South Carolina Cavalry's Third Regiment.         At her funeral Tuesday, members of the South Carolina Sons of Confederate Veterans, dressed in Confederate uniforms and carrying flags of the Confederacy and the United States, led the procession and fired a salute.         More than a dozen United Daughters of the Confederacy attended the service.         Newspapers have described her as the last surviving Confederate widow.         Reticent About the War         In an interview last year, Mrs. Cave said her husband, who died in 1930, spoke little of his time as a soldier.         ''He always said it was just too bad,'' she said. ''He'd been through it one time and that was all there was to it.''         South Carolina records show that Mrs. Cave's husband was born in 1844 and enlisted in the Confederate Army in 1862. He had two wives before marrying Daisy Cave. The couple had one son, Benjamin Cave, who died in September.         Mrs. Cave is survived by grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.       
        Delphine Seyrig, an actress and feminist whose celebrity stemmed from her first film performance, in ''Last Year at Marienbad'' in 1961, died on Monday in Paris. She was 58 years old.         Delphine Seyrig, an actress and feminist whose celebrity stemmed from her first film performance, in ''Last Year at Marienbad'' in 1961, died on Monday in Paris. She was 58 years old.         Miss Seyrig died in a hospital after a long illness, The Associated Press reported.         After her debut in ''Marienbad,'' directed by Alain Resnais, Miss Seyrig appeared in more than 30 films for many of Europe's foremost directors. Among her credits are Joseph Losey's ''Accident'' (1967), Francois Truffaut's ''Stolen Kisses'' (1968) and Luis Bunuel's ''Milky Way'' (1969) and ''Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'' (1972).         She also acted in ''The Day of the Jackal'' (1973), ''A Doll's House'' (1973), ''The Black Windmill'' (1974) and ''I Sent a Letter to My Love'' (1981).         By the mid-1970's, Miss Seyrig had become an active feminist.         ''The theater and films,'' she said at the time, ''are very far from women's consciousness about themselves.''         Seeking to correct that situation, she began working with female directors. In 1975, she starred in ''India Song,'' written and directed by Marguerite Duras. In 1976, she made ''Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,'' directed by Chantal Akerman.         Miss Seyrig, who began her acting career in the theater, performed on the European stage in ''The Lover'' by Harold Pinter; in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ''Bitter Tears of Petra van Kant,'' and in Beckett's ''Play.'' She appeared on Broadway in 1972 in ''The Little Black Book.''         Miss Seyrig's marriage to the artist Jack Youngerman ended in divorce. She is survived by a son.       
        Hortense Hirsch, a volunteer for social-welfare, educational and civic organizations and a trustee of Mount Sinai Medical Center for more than half a century, died on Tuesday at her suite in the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan. She was 103 years old. During a career as a volunteer that began in the early years of the century, she was active in many organizations, including the Welfare and Health Council, now the Community Council of Greater New York; the National Urban League and the American Red         Hortense Hirsch, a volunteer for social-welfare, educational and civic organizations and a trustee of Mount Sinai Medical Center for more than half a century, died on Tuesday at her suite in the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan. She was 103 years old. During a career as a volunteer that began in the early years of the century, she was active in many organizations, including the Welfare and Health Council, now the Community Council of Greater New York; the National Urban League and the American Red Cross.         On her 80th birthday in 1967, Mount Sinai was joined by the United Hospital Fund, the United Jewish Appeal, the New York Association for New Americans, the Play Schools Association, the New York City Y.W.C.A., the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the Smith College Club of New York - all of which Mrs. Hirsch served for long periods as an officer, director, trustee or founder -in paying special tribute to her.         She contributed money as well as her time, benefiting institutions like Smith College, from which she graduated in 1907 at the age of 19; Northwestern University Law School, from which her father, Levy Mayer, graduated, and Princeton, where she endowed scholarships in memory of her husband, Walter A. Hirsch, a lawyer, who died in 1938, and their son, Lawrence, who died in 1960.         'I Do What I Can'         Mrs. Hirsch also worked on behalf of many political candidates and frequently wrote to legislators on issues about which she or her organizations were concerned.         Seven years ago, when she was 96 years old and still active as a Mount Sinai trustee, a post she assumed in 1932, Mrs. Hirsch was asked why she had worked so long as a volunteer.         ''I never know how I'm going to feel tomorrow,'' she said. ''But I do what I can when I can. This work is still very important to me.''         She was born in Chicago and came to New York to stay in 1909, when she married Mr. Hirsch. She spoke French, Italian and German, and the couple traveled extensively around the world.         Throughout her life Mrs. Hirsch had a flair for the unconventional. As an undergraduate at Smith, she managed to have her own horse and buggy by persuading a farmer to board the animal and keep her secret from the college authorities.         Honored by Smith College         At Smith, she was a member of the executive committee for many years. In 1968, she was awarded the Smith College Medal, given to those who ''exemplify in their lives and service to their community or to the college the true purpose of liberal arts education.''         In 1940, two years after her husband's death and in the year in which both her daughter and her son left home to marry, Mrs. Hirsch took a suite at the Pierre for six months, to give herself time to decide where to live permanently. She never moved, bought her suite when the Pierre went cooperative and at her death was the Pierre's longest-term resident.         She is survived by her daughter, Carol Kridel of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.

In addition to her son David, she is survived by her son Jeremy, of Philadelphia; a brother, Clair Maxwell of Orlando, Fla.; a sister, Hope Tate, of Oxford, Mich., and two grandsons.       
         Joan Brown, an artist and professor of art at the University of California at Berkeley, was killed on Friday in an accident in Proddatura, India. She was 52 years old and lived in San Francisco.         The accident occurred while Ms. Brown, who in recent years was known for her use of imagery from ancient cultures, was installing her work in a reflecting pool at the new Heritage Museum, still under construction at Proddatura. Colleagues at the University of California said a concrete turret from a balcony collapsed and fell on her.         Starting out in the mid-1960's as a figurative painter in the thickly pigmented style of the so-called second-generation Bay Area artists, Ms. Brown gradually lightened her mode of painting and concentrated on imagery drawn from her personal life. A long-distance swimmer who regarded the sport as a means of meditation, she at this time used many images of swimmers in her art. Student of World Cultures         In the early 1970's she began traveling, informally studying world cultures. She drew inspiration for her work from the Egyptian and Hindu religions, and she made obelisks adorned with decorative patterns incorporating symbolic animal and human forms. In recent years, because of political and moral objections to the sale of art, she became involved in public art projects and made an effort to withdraw her work from the market.         Born and brought up in San Francisco, Ms. Brown attended the California School of Fine Arts -- later to become the San Francisco Art Institute -- from 1956 to 1960, and later received a master's degree in fine arts there, in 1962. In 1974 she joined the department of art at Berkeley, where, said Christopher Brown, the chairman of the department, she consistently won the highest rating as a teacher from faculty members and students.         Ms. Brown is survived by her husband, Michael Hebel, and a son, Noel Neri.       
        Sonia Yuspeh, an advertising and marketing consultant, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Sonia Yuspeh, an advertising and marketing consultant, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Yuspeh was president of Sonia Yuspeh Inc., an advertising and marketing firm she started in Manhattan in 1983. Before that, she was a senior vice president and director of research and planning at J. Walter Thompson, which she joined in 1972 as a vice president. She became a senior vice president a year later and was named to the board in 1981.         Before joining J. Walter Thompson, she had been with Grey Advertising, D'Arcy Advertsing and the Marplan division of Interpublic. She was a graduate of Syracuse University and Cornell University and was a past president of the American Marketing Association's New York chapter.         She is survived by her husband, Michel; a son, Leonid, of Rome, Pa.; a daughter, Denise Hidalgo of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
        Ruth Wittenberg, who led fights to preserve historic buildings in Greenwich Village, including the Jefferson Market Courthouse, died in her sleep on Monday at her home on West 10th Street, where she had lived for 65 years. She was 91 years old.         Ruth Wittenberg, who led fights to preserve historic buildings in Greenwich Village, including the Jefferson Market Courthouse, died in her sleep on Monday at her home on West 10th Street, where she had lived for 65 years. She was 91 years old.         Mrs. Wittenberg was a familiar figure at City Hall and in other forums where she pleaded the case for preservation and against what she and her neighbors considered invasive development. She was a major force in gaining designation of the Greenwich Village Historic District two decades ago.         ''I'm kind of a landmark myself,'' Mrs. Wittenberg said in 1977 when, at the age of 79, she was honored for her many civic campaigns. She served on what is now Community Board 2 for almost four decades, having been appointed in 1951 to its predecessor, the Community Council for the Greenwich Village area, by the Manhattan Borough President, Robert F. Wagner. For many years she was chairwoman of the board's landmarks committee.         Board Meetings in Hospital         She was active in board affairs until shortly before her death. A small, energetic woman, she broke a hip in 1975 in a fall while walking on the Avenue of the Americas. Board 2's landmark committee meetings were held in her hospital room until she recovered, and in the years after that, she attended Board of Estimate and Planning Commission sessions in a wheelchair.         Born into a politically active family, she said one of her earliest memories was sitting on the knee of Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist leader.         Mrs. Wittenberg was born in Brooklyn and attended Hunter College and Barnard before quitting to help support her family by working as a demographer for the Bell Telephone Company, predicting population trends for expansion of telephone service.         Jailed as a Suffragist         As a suffragist before women won the right to vote, she was twice jailed. She marched in 1965 in Selma, Ala., in a civil rights demonstration with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..         Not all her battles were victories. She led Village residents in an unsuccessful fight against New York University's plan to construct the 12-story-high Elmer A. Bobst Library on Washington Square South, which residents regarded as too bulky for the site.         Her most conspicuous victory was for demolition of the Women's House of Detention on Greenwich Avenue at Christopher Street and conversion of the site into a community garden, together with preservation of the adjacent Jefferson Market Courthouse, now a branch public library.         Mrs. Wittenberg's husband, Philip, to whom she was married in 1919, died three years ago. She is survived by a daughter, Susanna Berger of New Rochelle, N.Y.; a son, Jonathan, of Tuckahoe, N.Y., five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Rosemarie R. Schoeffer, founder of the Rosemarie de Paris chocolate shops, died yesterday in New York Hospital. She was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her son Peter said.         She opened her first chocolate shop in Paris in 1928 at the age of 18. Two years later she came to the United States and opened Rosemarie de Paris in the St. Regis Hotel building, making her own chocolate on a stove behind a curtain in the back of the shop.         By the late 1940's, Ms. Schoeffer was running 13 Rosemarie de Paris shops in cities across the country, including Palm Beach, Fla., Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Her chocolates were considered to be of the finest quality, and very expensive.         She liked to tell how during World War II, a serviceman dropped into her Manhattan tearoom-sweetshop and asked what the difference was between her chocolates at $9 a pound and those at $5 a pound. "Four dollars," she said, feeling sorry for the man in uniform, who turned out to be Alfred Vanderbilt.         In 1947, she divorced her first husband and married a Manhattan financier, Fred Schoeffer. She decided then to close down her chocolate shops, and after that only made truffles occasionally at home for the family.         Born Rosemarie Eugenie Roggemans in Brussels, she eloped with a Belgian, Georges Binon. They went to Paris, where she learned her trade by working in a chocolate shop.         In addition to her son Peter, of Alford, Mass., she is survived by another son, Ralph G.. of Cape Coral, Fla.       
         Princess Mahine Banou Qajar, a member of the ruling family of Iran in the mid-1920's, died on Saturday at D'Huys Hospital in Paris. She was 90 years old and lived in Paris.         She died of heart failure, her granddaughter-in-law, Monica Gerard-Sharp, said in London.         Princess Mahine was born Sept. 15, 1900, at the Golestan Palace in Teheran. In 1922, she married Crown Prince Mohammed Hassan, whose father was deposed in 1925 by Shah Riza Pahlevi. She remained in Iran through the reign of the son of Shah Riza Pahlevi, Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, and left in 1980 after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini came to power.         She is survived by a daughter, Princess Guity Afrouz Wambold of Durham, N.H.; three grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters.       
         Christina Ellis Gruber, editor and associate publisher of Earnshaw's Publications Inc., a group of trade publications for children's products, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 43 years old and lived in Greenvale, L.I.         She died of breast cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         Ms. Gruber was instrumental in the redesign of Earnshaw's Magazine and the introduction of Plus Sizes. She had been a senior editor of Lebar Friedman Publications.         She is survived by her husband, Shelly; a daughter, Monica Meyer and a son, Kenneth Meyer, both of Greenvale; her parents, Bolling and Marguerite Ellis of Troy, N.Y.; a sister, Victoria Pelinski of Ballston Lake, N.Y., and two stepdaughters, Alexis and Jessica Gruber of Canton, Ohio.       
         Mildred Riorden Blake, a former New York advertising writer who was a founder of the World Federalists, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Williamstown, Mass. She was 93 years old and lived in Williamstown.         Mrs. Blake was active in civic and political circles, in particular the World Federalists, founded in 1938. She represented Friends of the Earth, an organization concerned with the environment, at the United Nations in the 1960's.         She was a writer for Young & Rubicam Inc., a New York advertising agency, for 18 years.         Her second husband, William Paul Blake, died in 1962.         She is survived by her son from a former marriage, Shane Edwin Riorden of Williamstown; a brother, Stanton Mighell of Aurora, Ill.; three grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Bishop, past president and a board member of the New York chapter of the United Nations Association, which promotes the United Nations, died on Wednesday at the home of her son Arthur Lipper 3d in White Plains. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Bishop, a native New Yorker, was associated with the United Nations Association for 40 years. She was also a board member of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the World Youth Forum, the New York Council on Alcoholism and the Institute for Mediterranean Affairs.         Besides her son Arthur, Mrs. Bishop, a widow, is survived by another son, A. Michael Lipper of Summit, N.J.; two stepdaughters, Susan Lipper and Randa Bishop, both of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Elisabeth H. Woodburn, one of the country's best-known dealers in rare books on horticulture, died yesterday at her home in Hopewell, N.J. She was 78 years old.         Mrs. Woodburn died of a heart attack, family members said.         Mrs. Woodburn once described herself as a "lifelong gardener." She said she derived the name of her book dealership, Booknoll Farm, "from the fact that in 1950 I moved the horses and sheep out of the old barn and converted it to make room for me and my 13,000 books on gardening."         In 1983, her collection included the first herbal produced in this hemisphere, an Aztec document from 1550, and the first herbal written in English, a two-volume set published in 1739.         By 1985, she said her collection was up to 14,000 volumes, even though she had just sold her substantial library of wine books. But she kept a section on grape-growing in her catalogue of horticulture literature.         Mrs. Woodburn was a founding member and a former president of the Antiquarian Booksellers of America, and a founding member of the Council of Botanical and Horticultural Libraries. She was also co-chairwoman of the Library Advisory Committee of the New York Botanical Garden.         She is survived by her husband, Keith C. Robertson; two daughters, Hope E. Robertson of Stockton, N.J., and Christina H. Robertson of Philadelphia; a son, Jeffrey K. Robertson of Hopewell, and her brother, Peter Hexter of Newtown, Pa.       
         Mary Martin, America's favorite leading lady of musical comedy, as Ens. Nellie Forbush in "South Pacific," Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" or the title role in "Peter Pan," died Saturday afternoon at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 76 years old.         She died of cancer, said Richard Grant, who handles publicity for the actress's son, Larry Hagman. Miss Martin, who had been hospitalized recently at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, returned home last Tuesday.         More than any of her peers, she was what she played and she incarnated the songs that she sang. Miss Martin was "a cockeyed optimist" and she was also the eternal child imagined by James M. Barrie. Approaching 70, she was still saying, "I can't help thinking I'm 19." On stage, at least figuratively, she never stopped flying. Echoes of Poetry         In reviewing her performance in "South Pacific," Kenneth Tynan said that she reminded him of something Aldous Huxley wrote about the minor Caroline poets: "They spoke in their natural voices and it was poetry." While Ethel Merman was an entire brass section and Carol Channing was a parade, Miss Martin remained natural and exactingly true to life -- and it was poetry.         Her voice was never the strongest instrument. She was not beautiful (though she could be radiant). Through determination, pluck, charm, self-mocking humor and a profound sense of self, everything converged to create an exhilarating theater artist.         For 50 years Miss Martin projected the vitality of someone who loved her work and knew precisely how to make other people share in her happiness. As Elia Kazan, who directed her in her first Broadway starring role in "One Touch of Venus," said in his autobiography, she was "full of the love of being loved." Specialized in Long Runs         Although she made a number of films, she was devoted to the theater. She starred in relatively few Broadway shows, but the work was valuable; one could regard the actress herself as being the heyday of the Broadway musical.         She specialized in long runs and was known for not missing performances. In his autobiography, Richard Rodgers called her "an extraordinary trouper," adding, "In all the years I've known her, I have never seen her give a performance that was anything less than the best that was in her." She did have, he said, one unusual trait: "She cannot utter even the mildest form of profanity." The "strongest expression" he ever heard her use was "He's a son-of-a-bear."         If there had been a darker side to Miss Martin, she certainly kept it hidden from her public, which never failed to think of her as joyful. In her private life, she endured tragedies (including her husband's death) and on stage was prone to suffer accidents, but she never let anything interfere with the sheer delight of her performance.  A Thousand Shampoos         Repeatedly she set herself challenges, many of them physical. It was at her suggestion that Nellie Forbush literally washed that man "right out-a my hair," which meant that she shampooed her hair on stage for 1,000 performances. Originally she had planned to sing another song in "South Pacific" while cartwheeling across the stage -- until she cartwheeled right into the orchestra pit. It was also her idea to sing a song standing on her head in "Jennie," one of her less successful musicals. In rehearsal at the age of 63 in the Aleksei Arbuzov play "Do You Turn Somersaults?," she turned somersaults on stage until she fell from a revolving platform and was grounded by her doctors.         In her autobiography, "My Heart Belongs," she declared that of all her characters Peter Pan was indisputably her favorite, for a very simple reason: "Everyone else loves Peter so." She added, "Neverland is the way I would like real life to be: timeless, free, mischievous, filled with gaiety, tenderness and magic."         The key to her first Broadway success, in 1938 in the Cole Porter musical, "Leave It to Me," was her innate ability to combine innocence and insouciance. In that show she sang "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," a vintage Porter song in which almost every word has a double meaning. She played against the lines, which made them even funnier, and she did a striptease as if she was hanging up the laundry. It was often said about that song that Miss Martin did not know what she was singing until Sophie Tucker, who was also in the cast, explained the worldly, witty lyrics to her. The actress was never to lose that inbred sense of ingenuousness.  An Early Flight, A Crash Landing         From the first, Mary Virginia Martin was self-propelled. She was born in Weatherford, Tex., on Dec. 1, 1913 (although some reports placed the date one year later), the younger daughter of Preston Martin, a lawyer, and Juanita Presley Martin, a violin teacher. As one of a trio of little girls dressed as bellhops, she sang on a bandstand outside her father's courtroom. When she was 5, she sang "When Apples Grow on the Lilac Trees" at a fireman's ball. Once she tried to fly -- from the roof of a garage, without the mechanical assistance she would have later as Peter Pan -- and broke her collarbone.         Frequently she sang in churches and at clubs, and learned about show business by watching movies and imitating singers and dancers. As a young woman, she appeared with her best friend, Bessie Mae Sue Ella Yaeger, in amateur theatricals and later wondered why she had become a star and Bessie Mae had not. She decided it was because "I react to an audience.         "Give me 4 people and I'm         on         . Give me 400 and I'm a hundred times more on."         As a tribute to Bessie Mae -- and for good luck -- she worked her friend's name into many of her scripts, on stage and in films.         In her book Miss Martin recalled that Weatherford was famous for its watermelons. Long after she became a star, a sign was erected on the courthouse lawn: "Weatherford, Texas, home of watermelons and Mary Martin." Her observation: "I never got top billing in my hometown."         Nevertheless she had, she was convinced, a very happy childhood. Her parents sent her to Ward Belmont, a finishing school in Nashville. At 16, she married Benjamin Hagman, a Weatherford accountant and later a lawyer. They had one child, Larry Martin Hagman, who -- as the world knows -- became famous as J. R. on television's "Dallas."  Dancing Her Way To Hollywood         The actress's first marriage lasted only a few years, and the teen-age bride brought up her son as if he were her younger brother. Miss Martin was soon caught up in her career. At 18, she opened the Mary Hagman School of Dance in Weatherford, then went to Hollywood to study dancing and to search for a way to enter the movies. For several years she went back and forth between the two states and between teaching and performing.         The dancing school flourished (until it was destroyed by fire) while her performing career took several divergent paths. In Texas she sang on radio; in California she sang and danced in nightclubs. One evening she performed in a Sunday night talent show at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Singing "The Weekend of a Private Secretary" and an operatic number entitled "Il Bacio" in her own syncopated version, she created a sensation. To her astonishment, people stood on chairs and tables and shouted bravo. Jack Benny, who was in the audience, later told her that it was one of the most exciting moments he could remember. "In 10 minutes," she said, "my life had changed."         Another member of the audience was Lawrence Schwab, a producer who took charge of her career. In answer to the frequent question, what causes a big break, she said: "Work. Work and work and work; be ready when the break comes." As she wrote in her autobiography, "All my life I have felt guilty if I didn't use any talent I have as fully as I could."         Under Mr. Schwab's aegis, she came to New York and auditioned to fill a suddenly vacant supporting role in the forthcoming Broadway musical "Leave It to Me." The unknown actress strode into a suite in the Ritz Towers and announced that she was going to sing four songs, adding, "If I can't sing all four, I'd rather not sing." As she recalled in her book, "A man reclining on a couch said, very mildly, 'Carry on, on all fours.' " She later discovered that the philosophical man on the couch was Cole Porter, the composer of the show. Bella Spewack, co-author of the book with her husband, Sam Spewack, asked Miss Martin if she had ever been on the New York stage. She admitted that she had not, and when Mrs. Spewack asked her why she thought she could do it, she answered boldly, "Try me."         In the audition, she was called upon to read her character's dialogue. She shouted the first line, "I'd like to renew my subscription" (meaning she would like to continue having a love affair). Her straightforward, self-confident delivery brought down the house. Should she get the part, Mr. Spewack told her, she should never change the reading of the line. Throughout her career her art was founded on such intuition.  A First Casting Much Against Type         She so captivated Porter and his collaborators that she was signed, despite the fact -- or rather because of the fact -- that she was cast against type: the innocent country girl playing a kept woman, and singing a striptease showstopper, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy." Fifty years later, in 1988, as a great-grandmother, she was still singing "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," at a celebration honoring Cole Porter. In May 1990 she was scheduled to sing the song again at the 75th anniversary celebration of the Shubert Theater in New Haven, but canceled her appearance because of illness.         Her overnight success on Broadway on Nov. 9, 1938 put her on the cover of Life magazine and drew the attention of Hollywood. Under contract to Paramount, she appeared in a series of forgettable roles in forgettable films, including "The Great Victor Herbert," "Rhythm on the River," "Love Thy Neighbor," "New York Town," "Birth of the Blues," "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," "Happy Go Lucky" and "True to Life."         There was one positive result of her Hollywood experience. She met and married Richard Halliday, a story editor at Paramount. He also became her producer and closest professional adviser and the father of their daughter, Heller Halliday. If she had remained in Hollywood, she might have disappeared into the studio system, but wisdom prevailed and she returned to New York, where she became a Broadway star and remained one for the next four decades.         Her first starring role was in "One Touch of Venus," written by Kurt Weill, Ogden Nash and S. J. Perelman. To combat his wife's hesitancy about playing the title goddess, a role originally conceived for Marlene Dietrich, Mr. Halliday took her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and showed her the many interpretations of Venus in painting and sculpture. As the "Venus of Ozone Heights," who comes to life and steps down from her pedestal, she had her customary winsomeness, singing her signature song, "That's Him," simply sitting in a chair facing the audience.  The Bumpy Road To 'South Pacific'         After "One Touch of Venus," she starred in the musical "Lute Song" and in London in Noel Coward's "Pacific 1860" and toured for a year in Irving Berlin's "Annie Get Your Gun." Though Ethel Merman had played the title character, Annie Oakley, in the original production, the role -- along with the song, "Doin' What Comes Naturally" -- seemed made to measure for Miss Martin. As always, she was undeterred by the fact that she was succeeding another star (which she also did later when she took Carol Channing's "Hello, Dolly!" on tour of military bases in Vietnam).         In 1948, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d offered her the central role in "South Pacific." She was hesitant for two reasons. Disliking hospitals, she was not anxious to play the role of a nurse, and she felt insecure because her leading man would be an opera star, Ezio Pinza. When it was decided that the two would not be asked to sing a duet, she accepted the offer. Nellie Forbush, singing "Cockeyed Optimist," "Honey Bun," "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out-a My Hair" and, especially, "I'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy," became one of her greatest successes.         "South Pacific" was followed in 1954 by "Peter Pan" (her daughter was also in the cast) which she performed on Broadway and on television, live and then on tape, complete with her celebrated aerial ballet. The Broadway production ran for only 152 performances. It was largely through the taped television version (which was recently released on videocassette) that she became so identified with the role.         "Peter Pan" was an exact meeting of actress and character. As Miss Martin said, "I cannot even remember a day when I didn't want to be Peter." For years she had dreams of flying, all of which stopped just before the first television presentation of the show. Trying to explain the end of those dreams, she said, "Perhaps it was because I had experienced at last the joy of really flying." She could become almost mystical whenever she spoke about the experience, as in her statement: "I discovered I was happier in the air than on the ground. I probably always will be."  Another Character, Another Classic         In 1959, Rodgers and Hammerstein went to her again to ask her to play Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music." Though her own background could not have been more dissimilar from that of her real-life model, she -- and the audience -- felt the kinship. As she said, "We both have the same drive, utter determination." During her two years in the role, she missed only one performance.         Of her three Broadway triumphs only "Peter Pan" was to be recorded for posterity -- in the television version.In the case of both "South Pacific" and "The Sound of Music," other actresses played her role on screen (Mitzi Gaynor was Nellie and Julie Andrews was Maria von Trapp.) This meant that, except for her television appearances, especially one dynamic evening teamed with Ethel Merman, her most noteworthy performances existed only on the stage and on records.         As one sign of her own fallibility she often pointed to the fact that while accepting "South Pacific," "Peter Pan" and "The Sound of Music," she turned down the chance to be in "Oklahoma!", "Kiss Me Kate" and "My Fair Lady."         Among her other Broadway shows were the two-character musical "I Do I Do" and "Jennie." Occasionally she acted in dramas -- in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth," which she and Helen Hayes took on tour, and in "Do You Turn Somersaults?"         She and her husband owned a ranch in Brazil, Nossa Fazenda (Our Farm), next to a home owned by her friend Janet Gaynor. The Hallidays used the ranch as a vacation retreat. After her husband died in 1973, Miss Martin worked less but never fully retired. In 1981 she was a host on "Over Easy," a public television series about aging. In 1982 she was in a taxicab accident in San Francisco that took the life of her close friend Ben Washer and severely injured Miss Martin, Miss Gaynor and Miss Gaynor's husband, Paul Gregory. In 1986, fully recovered, she returned to the theater in a dramatic role, co-starring with Carol Channing in James Kirkwood's "Legends." Each portrayed an aging actress. "Legends" toured but never came to New York.         In 1989, Miss Martin returned to New York for a tribute to the television work of Richard Rodgers and to see "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," which reprised "I'm Flying" from "Peter Pan." Several months later, the 1960 television version of "Peter Pan" was shown again, with great success. Later, an illness precipitated her withdrawal from "Grovers Corners," Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's musical version of "Our Town," in which she was scheduled to play the Stage Manager. In 1989 she received a Kennedy Center Award, given annually at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Famous First Line One More Time         Some years ago she participated in a birthday tribute to Richard Rodgers at the Imperial Theater, where, decades before, she had made her Broadway debut in "Leave It to Me." For days, she worried about what she would say. When the time came, in characteristic fashion, she improvised. She walked on stage and said as loudly as she could, "I would like to renew my subscription." When she wrote about this moment in her autobiography, she commented, "That's what I would like to say, now and forever, to all audiences everywhere." Mary Martin's lifetime renewal was gratefully accepted.         Miss Martin is survived by her son, her daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York at a later date.       
         Carrol Joy, an educator and author, died on Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 52 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of a brain tumor, said her brother, Skip Federber, of Los Angeles.         Dr. Joy, who had a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley, wrote books about ways to attack world hunger and was a consultant to CARE and other humanitarian organizations. She had been on the faculty of St. Mary's College in San Francisco and also wrote books on developmental education, including "Believing Is Seeing," published by the American Forum for Global Education.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by a son, Scott Grabo of Arlington, Va., and a daughter, Carrie Grabo of Woodbury, Vt.; her mother, Pearle Carroll of Las Vegas, and two grandchildren.       
         Mae D. Silbergeld, a technical manager for contractors in the space program, died last Thursday at Bethesda Naval Hospital. She was 66 years old and lived in Garrett Park, Md.         She died of cardiac arrest, her family said.         Ms. Silbergeld was with the ST Systems Corporation since 1983 and before that with Computer Sciences Corporation for 13 years, managing work under contract to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.         She was a graduate of the University of Dayton and received a master's degree from the University of Illinois. She taught physics at Illinois and at North Carolina State University and did research at Stanford University and with the United States Public Health Service.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Sam Silbergeld; three daughters, Sandra, of Rockville, Md., Dr. Janet Silbergeld and Dr. Nancy Jecker, both of Seattle; a son, Dr. Danie Silbergeld, of Seattle; her mother, Jennie Driscoll, of Beavercreek, Ohio; two sisters, Ruth Hallman, of Beavercreek and Julie Stockman, of Dayton, Ohio; two brothers, Dr. Glenn Driscoll, of Fresno, Calif., and Carl Driscoll, of Lathrup Village, Mich., and two grandchildren.       
         Miriam M. Comer, a founder of two community agencies in Great Neck, L.I., died on Monday at a nursing home there. She was 86 years old.         Mrs. Comer, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, died of respiratory failure, her son, Charles, of Port Washington, L.I., said.         In the early 1950's, Mrs. Comer was a founder of what is now the United Community Fund of Great Neck and the United Neighborhood Activities Center, an after-school program for poor children that is no longer operating.         A widow, she is survived by a second son, Harry, of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; four daughters, Miriam Mayer of South Orange, N.J., Carolyn Comer of Port Washington, Marguerite Jansen of Appleton, Wis., and Janet Bryars of Papillion, Neb.; a brother, Robert Hoffman of Coconut Creek, Fla; 13 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.       
         Carol Sobieski, a film and television writer who was widely praised for her sensitive characterizations in original or adapted works, died on Sunday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 51 years old.         She died of amyloidosis, a blood plasma disease, the Writers Guild of America said.         Mrs. Sobieski's film credits include the scripts for John Huston's 1982 version of the Broadway musical "Annie," "Casey's Shadow" (1978), "Sylvester" (1984) and "Winter People" (1988).         Three of her television scripts won awards from the Writers Guild of America: "The Neon Ceiling" (1971), about a woman and her daughter, who stop at a desert diner and meet its alcoholic manager; "Sunshine" (1973), about a dying young woman who leaves audio tapes for the 3-year-old daughter who might otherwise forget her, and a sequel, "Christmas Sunshine" (1977). Emmy Nominations and a Prize         "Plain Speaking," Mrs. Sobieski's 1976 adaptation of Merle Miller's book about Harry S. Truman, won Emmy nominations for best script and best program, and a best-actor award for Ed Flanders.         Carol O'Brien Sobieski was born in Chicago and grew up in Amarillo, Tex. She graduated with honors from Smith College and earned a master's degree from Trinity College in Dublin.         She moved to Los Angeles in 1964. Among the movies she wrote for television are "Amelia Earhart (1976)," "The Women's Room (1980)," "Where the Ladies Go (1980)" and "The Bourne Identity (1988)." In writing "Amelia Earhart" she drew on her own experiences as a licensed pilot, and in "Casey's Shadow" and "Sylvester" on her longtime involvement with horses as a trainer, rider and teacher.         Mrs. Sobieski is survived by her husband, James; two daughters, Emmy, of Seattle, and Mona, of Santa Monica; a son, Jamie, of Stockton, Calif., and a sister, Wendy Marsh of Amarillo.       
         Anya Seton, the author of several popular historical and biographical novels, two of which were made into successful films, died on Thursday at her home in Old Greenwich, Conn. She was 86 years old.         She had been ill for several years and died of heart failure, a daughter, Pamela Cottier Forcey, said.         Miss Seton developed a devoted following from the 1940's to the 1970's for her carefully researched and evocative works, two of which, "Dragonwyck" and "Foxfire," were made into successful films. She won critical praise for her attention to the language and life style of the periods she wrote about, but she was frequently faulted for reworking familiar ground.  A First Book at 37         The daughter of a celebrated English author, artist and naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton, and an American writer of travel books, Grace Gallatin, Miss Seton did not produce her first successful book until she was 37 years old. She had married the first of her two husbands when she was 18 and raised three children before turning seriously to writing.         She began selling short stories to newspapers -- her first brought her a check for $5 -- and in the late 1930's became interested in the story of Aaron Burr's daughter, Theodosia, a celebrated beauty of her time who died mysteriously.         Miss Seton decided to apply a fictional treatment to the woman's life and the result was "My Theodosia," published in 1941 and well received by critics and the public.         "Dragonwyck," her second published novel, gained international recognition. A Gothic tale set along the Hudson River in the 1840's, it was serialized by the Ladies' Home Journal, selected by the Dollar Book Club, translated into nine languages and made into a film starring Vincent Price as a feudal overlord who tyrannizes his tenant farmers, kills his wife and takes up with a distant relative, played by Gene Tierney. Role for Vincent Price         The film, released in 1946, was adapted by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and was his first directorial effort; it established him as a major force in movies and set a villainous style for Mr. Price that he was to repeat many times.         That year Miss Seton followed with "The Turquoise," a novel of the American Southwest in the 1890's, inspired by visits to her father's ranch in New Mexico. Two years later came "The Hearth and the Eagle," set in Marblehead on the Massachusetts coast.         For each of her books, Miss Seton spent a good deal of time getting to know the locale about which she was writing.         "It is impossible for me to describe or 'feel' any place to which I have not been," she once said. "I am inspired by places." "Dragonwyck," "The Turquoise," "The Hearth and the Eagle" and "Foxfire," the latter set in an Arizona ghost town and made into a 1955 film starring Jane Russell and Jeff Chandler, all resulted from visits to places which, Miss Seton said, "suddenly became meaningful." Dark Romances         But her favorite books were her biographical novels. Besides "My Theodosia" these included "Katherine" (1954), the story of the mistress of John of Gaunt; "The Winthrop Woman" (1958), about the niece and daughter-in-law of John Winthrop, Governor of Massachusetts, and "Devil Water" (1962), "Avalon" (1965) and "Green Darkness" (1973), all of which take place in England and tell of dark romances.         Miss Seton was born in Manhattan and raised in Cos Cob, Conn., where her family had an estate. She was christened Ann, but a family friend, a Sioux chief, gave her the Indian name Anutika, which her family adapted to Anya. She traveled extensively with her parents; by the time she was 13 she had crossed the Atlantic eight times. She had private tutors much of the time but graduated from the Spence School.         Miss Seton was twice married and divorced. Her son, Seton Cottier, died in 1979. She is survived by Mrs. Forcey, who lives in Manhattan, and another daughter, Clemency Chase Coggins of Auburndale, Mass.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Edith Schaffer Phillips, a former official of the American Broadcasting Company, died on Friday at her home in Lake Worth, Fla. She was 82 years old.         She had suffered from Parkinson's disease for more than three years, said her son, Jonathan, of Manhattan.         Mrs. Phillips was one of few women working in corporate law when she began her legal career, all of which was spent working for ABC and its predecessor, Paramount Pictures. Among her associates were Adolph Zucker, Charles deHilles and Stanton Griffith.         When Paramount Pictures lost its subsidiaries in antitrust actions, Mrs. Schaffer joined what was to become ABC. She was an officer of ABC, as well as an officer and director of several of its subsidiaries, including ABC Films, Paramount Records and Westminster Records. She retired in 1967.         She was a native New Yorker and a 1930 graduate of St. John's Law School.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her husband, D. John Phillips; a daughter, Lynn Raglione of Manhattan, and two brothers, Al and Irving, both of Sarasota. Fla.       
         Rosalind Solon Buchman, an accounting professor at New York City Technical College, died on Wednesday while visiting friends in Washington. She was 60 years old and lived in Brooklyn Heights.         Tom Carroll, dean of human resources and labor relations at the college, said that she died in her sleep.         She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree from New York University. She also studied at Columbia Teachers College.         She is survived by her husband, George; a daughter, Deborah, and a son, Barry, both of Brooklyn Heights, and a sister, Babette Hollister of Queens.       
         Vijay Lakshmi Pandit, an Indian independence fighter, diplomat and politician, and the first woman to serve as President of the United Nations General Assembly, died today in the northern town of Dehra Dun. She was 90 years old.         Mrs. Pandit, the sister of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the virtual chief of one of Asia's most important political dynasties, which included Mr. Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, who was Prime Minister for 13 years, and Mrs. Gandhi's son Rajiv, who succeeded his mother in 1984 and served until 1989.         President Ramaswami Venkataraman described Mrs. Pandit today as a "luminous strand in the tapestry of India's freedom struggle." "Distinctive in her elegance, courage and dedication, Mrs. Pandit was an asset to the national movement," he continued.         Frail with age and ailing for some time, Mrs. Pandit had not been poltically active for several years. She moved from New Delhi to Dehra Dun in 1970. But in 1977, outraged by the authoritarian state of emergency imposed from 1975 to 1977 by Indira Gandhi, she campaigned actively against her niece. A popular revolt led to electoral defeat for Mrs. Gandhi, who reportedly never forgave her aunt for her outspoken role.  Ambassador to Moscow         Mrs. Gandhi and Mrs. Pandit were also cool to each other because of what Mrs. Gandhi viewed as her aunt's condescension toward her mother. Kamala Nehru, Mrs. Gandhi's mother, came from a middle-class Kashmiri Brahmin family and married into the rich, aristocratic Nehru family. Accounts of the time say that she never quite adjusted to the change in lifestyle and was often lonely.         Mrs. Pandit, whose husband died in the 1940's, took part in the Indian freedom movement and was arrested several times by the British colonial authorities.         Her brother appointed her as Ambassador to Moscow when India became independent in 1947. She then held a succession of high positions, including ambassadorships to the United States and Britain and, in 1953, presidency of the United Nations General Assembly. She also led the Indian mission to the United Nations.         At home, she was elected a lawmaker two times and served as Governor of the western state of Maharashtra. She retired from public life in 1970 but later served as the Indian representative to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.         She is survived by three daughters, including the novelist Nayantara Sehgal.       
         Carol E. Rinzler, a lawyer and author, died in her sleep on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 49 years old. She had suffered a neck injury recently, but the cause of her death was not immediately determined, her family said.         Ms. Rinzler pursued a dual career as a specialist in publishing law and as a writer who dealt in lighthearted fashion with childhood and adolescence. She was the author of "Nobody Said You Had to Eat Off the Floor," published in 1971; "The Girl Who Got All the Breaks" (1980), and "Your Adolescent: An Owner's Manual" (1981).         In the "owner's manual," addressed to people who find living with an adolescent more painful than adolescence itself, Ms. Rinzler offered advice like: "An adolescent who is cheerful at breakfast should be kept home from school that day."         Ms. Rinzler was born in Newark and was a graduate of Goucher College. She received her law degree from Yale and was with the Manhattan law firms of Cahill Gordon & Reindel and Rembar & Curtis before establishing her own practice earlier this year.         She was a contributing editor of Publishers Weekly, a book critic and columnist for Mademoiselle and Cosmopolitan magazines, and a writer of reviews and articles for The New York Times Book Review and other publications.         Ms. Rinzler is survived by her father, Irving Eisen, of Mount Pleasant, S.C.; a son, Michael, and a daughter, Jane, both of Manhattan.       
         Ruth Schonfeld, a vocational counselor to refugees, died on Tuesday at New York University Hospital. She was 74 years old and lived in Mamaroneck, N.Y.         Mrs. Schonfeld died of ovarian cancer, her husband said.         She joined the staff of the New York Association for New Americans in 1975 and specialized in helping foreign-born musicians find jobs with orchestras around the country.         In the late 1960's, Mrs. Schonfeld was a founder of the Guidance Center for Women, which helped women returning to work, at the University of Connecticut's department of continuing education.         She was a graduate of Barnard College and held two master's degrees, one from Teachers College, Columbia University, and the second in chemistry from Columbia University.         She is survived by her husband, Moses; two daughters, Deborah Statt Winegar of Manhattan and Jo-Ann Harrison of Kiryat Ono, Israel; a son, Victor of London; a sister, Miriam Waldman of Charlotte, N.C., and two grandsons.       
         Adele Sharpe Herzman, who with her husband was a collector of Chinese ceramics, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71 years old.         She died of cancer, her husband, Stanley, said.         In recent years, the couple donated pieces from their collection of Chinese ceramics or promised them as gifts to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where a major portion of the collection was exhibited in the summer. It is one of only three major holdings of Chinese ceramics given or promised to the museum since World War II.         Mrs. Herzman was also a co-founder of the auxiliary board of the New York Philharmonic.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two children from previous marriages, a daughter, Lucia Scott of Stamford, Conn., and a son, Guy Thomas of Manchester, Vt.; two sisters, Dorothy Lewis of St. Louis and Ruth Hamilton of Nashville, and four grandchildren.       
         Ann Cole Phillips, a painter, died in New York Hospital on Friday night. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia after a long illness, her son, Calman, said.         Ms. Phillips's colorful, vivacious paintings in a semi-abstract style are found in a number of museum collections.         In a tribute to her work, Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1986 established the Ann Cole Phillips Room, a classroom, where students can study the artist's experience from her paintings on the walls around them.         At the height of her career in the 1950's and 1960's, Ms. Phillips's works were compared to Kandinsky, Dufy and Kokoschka. She worked in oils, pastels and lithography.         A native New Yorker, she attended the National Academy of Design and the Arts Students League. She also studied with such masters as Stuart Davis, Jacques Villon and Jose Clemente Orozco.         Besides her son, she is survived by a brother, George Columbus of Lake Worth, Fla., and a granddaughter, Jamey Phillips of New York City.       
         Anne Kallem, an editor at the Sterling Publishing Company in Manhattan for 26 years, died on Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center. She was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, David Boehm, chairman of the publishing company, said.         At her death, she was managing editor emeritus of the company, which publishes nonfiction and reference books. She was born in the Bronx and graduated from Barnard College.         Her huband, Henry Kallem, an artist, died in 1985. She is survived by a son, Matthew Kallem of Rockport, Me.       
         Janet Chusmir, executive editor of The Miami Herald and a leading proponent of women's advancement to the top levels of management in American journalism, died yesterday at St. Francis Hospital in Miami. She was 60 years old.         The Herald said Ms. Chusmir suffered a brain aneurysm on Friday night, aboutan hour after returning to her home in Miami Beach after the paper's evening news conference at her office.         We have lost a great friend and a great editor," said The Herald's publisher, David Lawrence. "What a zest she had for good newspapers; what energy she had for caring, for worrying about what was right and fair for everyone."         In Ms. Chusmir's three-year tenure as executive editor, The Herald won two Pulitzer Prizes. And in November 1988, less than a year after she was appointed to the paper's top news post, The Herald introduced an enlarged and revamped Spanish-language newspaper, with a separate staff, called El Nuevo Herald. A month ago she was named Editor of the Year by the National Press Foundation, which cited her for "transforming The Herald to serve the unique multicultural population of greater Miami."         When Ms. Chusmir was named The Herald's executive editor in December 1987, about 85 percent of the newsroom executives in the country were men, according to a survey by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Of the society's 1,000 members -- the top editors of the nation's dailies -- about 80 were women. Opposed Special Position         The dearth of women in high positions was the subject of a seminar at the society's convention in 1988. And when an editor suggested that it was desirable for newspapers to create a "woman's seat" among their top editors, Ms. Chusmir denounced the idea. "The seat becomes devalued," she said, "and the function becomes devalued."         Ms. Chusmir was a feminist who understood the potency of understatement. She recently told a group of Hispanic women: "Pick your battles. It's not good to be fighting over each little thing and male chauvinistic action. Instead, fight for the important things: equal pay and equal respect. Fight smart."         At the same time, she was fond of telling female executives not to forsake their ability to nurture. "I always remind myself that I can't hug a newspaper," she said.         Janet Zoll was born in Boston and earned a journalism degree from Boston University in 1949. A week after graduation she married the editor of her college newspaper, Leonard Chusmir, and soon became a mother and homemaker.         It was not until after moving to Miami Beach with her two school-age children in 1963 that Ms. Chusmir took a job at the Miami Beach Daily Sun, which no longer operates, writing articles at a flat rate of $2.50 each. She was soon given a full-time position. Five Years in Colorado         In 1968, The Herald hired her as a general assignment reporter, and, soon afterward, she was writing a column and receiving awards for her feature writing. In the early 1970's, Ms. Chusmir was named editor of The Herald section News For and About Women, which in her tenure was renamed Living Today. By 1977, she had been promoted to assistant managing editor for features.         Then, in 1982, Knight-Ridder Newspapers, the Herald's corporate parent, appointed her president and publisher of The Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo., making her the first female chief executive of one of the organization's newspapers. Five years later, she returned to The Herald as executive editor.         Last year, in an occasional column she wrote, "View From the Newsroom," Ms. Chusmir offered readers a personal glance at herself. She said her favorite avocations were "baking, reading, swimming, dieting." Her favorite place was "my balcony at sunset." And of journalism, she said, "It's a sacred trust."         Besides her husband, Ms. Chusmir is survived by a son, Steven, of Fort Lauderdale; a daughter, Marsha Chusmir-Shapiro of Daytona Beach, and a grandson.       
         Marinka Gurewich, a voice teacher whose students included several prominent opera singers, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her son-in-law, Dr. Edwin Gordon.         Mrs. Gurewich was born in Bratislava, in what is now Czechoslovakia, in 1902. She studied voice and piano in Berlin. She gave recitals as a mezzo-soprano in Europe and in New York City after her arrival in 1940. In the 1960's and 70's, she was on the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music and the Mannes College of Music. She continued teaching privately after her retirement.         Mrs. Gurewich's best-known students include the sopranos Martina Arroyo, Florence Quivar, Grace Bumbry, Sharon Sweet and Diana Soviero.         She is survived by a son, Dr. Victor Gurewich of Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Anne Gordon of Indianapolis, and six grandchildren.       
         Carol D. Shryock, a trustee of Hastings Village, N.Y., died on Sunday at Montefiore Hospital. She was 49 years old and lived in Hastings.         Mrs. Shryock died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         She was serving her fifth term as a trustee and was involved in two village projects: the development of the Newington Cropsey Museum and the acquisition of Draper Park. She was a member of the St. Matthew's Church Group of the Homeless Consortium and of the Hastings League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Shryock had been public relations director for Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown from 1989 until October of this year. From 1983 to 1989, she was public-relations manager for Graham-Windham Services to Family and Children in Hastings.         She is survived by her husband, Ralph; a sister, Joan Allard of Albany, and a son, Stephen, of Hastings.       
         Elisabeth Robb Bettman, who taught English at the University of Cincinnati for 25 years, died Nov. 26 at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati. She was 72 years old and lived in Cincinnati.         Mrs. Bettman died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         Mrs. Bettman was a director of the Cincinnati Scholarship Foundation, the Cincinnati Council on World Affairs, and Working in Neighborhoods, a group that helps needy families.         She was graduated from Radcliffe College and received master's degrees from Barnard College and the University of Cincinnati.         Her marriage to Judge Gilbert Bettman of Cincinnati ended in divorce.         She is survived by two daughters, Louise Bettman of Cincinnati and Helen Cohen of Houston; a son, Gilbert Bettman Jr. of Los Angeles; a sister, Roberta Robb Bratenahl of Pasadena, Calif.; and a granddaughter.       
         Simone Cousteau, who accompanied her husband, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, on hundreds of voyages aboard the research vessel Calypso, died on Sunday. She was 72 years old.         Married in 1937, the Cousteaus for many years spent most of their time aboard the Calypso, sailing the world to study marine biology, conduct underwater explorations, make films and promote conservation.         Mrs. Cousteau served as nurse and purser and sometimes took part in underwater missions.         Survivors include her husband and a son, Jean-Michel.
